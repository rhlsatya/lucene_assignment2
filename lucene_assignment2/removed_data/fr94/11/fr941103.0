Vidalia Onions Grown in Georgia; Expenses and Assessment Rate


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule that authorized expenses and established an assessment rate that will generate funds to pay those expenses.
Authorization of this budget enables the Vidalia Onion Committee (Committee) to incur expenses that are reasonable
and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 955 (7 CFR part 955), regulating the handling of Vidalia
onions grown in Georgia. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, Vidalia onions are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein
will be applicable to all assessable onions handled during the 1994-95 fiscal period, which began September
16, 1994, and ends September 15, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any State or local law, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an
order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation
imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be
exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. The Act provides that
the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal
place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in
equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 250 producers of Georgia Vidalia onions under this marketing order, and approximately 145
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Vidalia onion producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities.

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the Vidalia Onion Committee, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for
approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Vidalia onions. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Vidalia onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 
The Committee met July 14, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $332,000, $69,050 more than
the previous year. Budget items for 1994-95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94
(in parentheses) are: Travel & auto expenses, $6,000 ($4,000), liability insurance and bonds, $1,000 ($500),
professional fees, $2,500 ($2,000), office supplies, $3,000 ($1,300), telephone, $4,000 ($3,500), Committee
member expense, $1,000 ($500), contract management, wages, and salaries, $60,000 ($59,600), miscellaneous general
and administrative, $1,000 ($500), research, $80,000 ($78,500), marketing, $132,000 ($82,500), and $4,250 for
FICA employer, $13,500 for employee benefits, and $8,000 for contract outside labor, for which no funding was recommended
last year. Items which have decreased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are: Equipment
purchases, $3,000 ($4,500), office overhead, $3,000 ($12,900), and $150 in interest, and $250 for petty cash, for
which no funding was recommended this year. 
The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per 50-pound bag or equivalent of Vidalia
onions, the same as last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 2,867,500 50-pound bags or equivalents
of Vidalia onions, would yield $286,750. The Committee also anticipates shipments of 50,000 50-pound bags of previously
unassessed Vidalia onions which have been in storage, which will yield an additional $5,000 in assessment income.
This, along with $5,250 in interest income and $35,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate
to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve of $167,766 are within the maximum permitted
by the order of three fiscal periods' expenses.

An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45188). That interim final rule added  955.207 to authorize expenses and establish
an assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through October
3, 1994. No comments were received. 

While this rule will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers.
Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived
by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994-95 fiscal period began on September 16, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal period apply to all assessable onions handled during the fiscal period. In addition, handlers are aware
of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 966
for the 1994-95 fiscal period. Authorization of this budget enables the Florida Tomato Committee (Committee)
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are
derived from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 125 and Order No. 966, both as amended (7 CFR part 966), regulating
the handling of tomatoes grown in Florida. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions
of the marketing order now in effect, Florida tomatoes are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable tomatoes handled during the 1994-95 fiscal period,
which began August 1, 1994, and ends July 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 250 producers of Florida tomatoes under this marketing order, and approximately 50 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Florida tomato producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the Florida Tomato Committee, the agency
responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members
of the Committee are producers of Florida tomatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs
of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was
formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate
and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Florida tomatoes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will
provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.

The Committee met September 8, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $2,215,000, $467,000
less than the previous year. Budget items for 1994-95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94
(in parentheses) are: Office salaries, $297,300 ($276,000), depreciation, $18,200 ($16,200), communications,
$12,000 ($10,000), employee's retirement program, $46,600 ($37,300), insurance and bonds, $7,000 ($5,000), office
rent, $24,700 ($22,600), social security tax, $20,000 ($19,000), supplies and printing, $7,500 ($6,500), and audit,
$2,500 ($2,300). Items which have decreased compared to those budgeted for 1993-94 (in parentheses) are: Research
expense, $192,100 ($200,000), and education and promotion expense, $1,500,000 ($2,000,000). All other items are
budgeted at last year's amounts.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.04 per 25-pound container, the same as last year.
This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 55,000,000 25-pound containers, will yield $2,200,000 in assessment
income. This, along with $15,000 in interest and other income, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period began on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable tomatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and it is similar to other budget actions issued in
past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will
be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Dry-Cured Pork Products 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending our regulations to allow certain dry-cured pork products processed in a specified manner to be imported
into the United States from countries where foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, African swine fever, hog cholera,
or swine vesicular disease exists. We are making this change because we have determined that certain dry-cured pork
products, if processed in accordance with the regulatory requirements, can be imported into the United States without
presenting a significant risk of introducing these specified diseases.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (the regulations) regulate, among other things, the importation into the United States
of pork and pork products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD),
rinderpest, African swine fever (ASF), hog cholera (HC), and swine vesicular disease (SVD).
On April 15, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 17999-18003, Docket No. 92-067-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by allowing the importation
into the United States of certain dry-cured pork products that have been processed in accordance with procedures
used in Spain to manufacture products known as Serrano hams, Iberian hams, Iberian pork shoulders, and Iberian pork
loins. 


Comments on the Proposed Rule 


We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending June 14, 1994. We received four comments
by that date. They were from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Nutrition of the Kingdom of Spain, a Spanish
meat exporters association, and two organizations representing U.S. meat industries. We carefully considered
all the comments we received. These comments are discussed below in detail. 
In response to the comments, APHIS is making several changes to the proposed requirements. 


Comment:

 The proposal would have amended various paragraphs of  94.17 by adding the term ``dry-cured'' before ``ham''
or ``hams.'' The term ``dry cured'' was incorrectly added in several places where the hams referred to would not yet
have finished the curing process. The term ``dry cured'' should not be added before ``ham'' or ``hams'' in  94.17,
paragraphs (a) through (g). 


Response:

 We agree, and are making the suggested change. 


Comment: 

In the current regulations,  94.17(a) requires that hams subject to the regulations must come from ``a swine
that was never out of the country in which the ham was processed.'' Because the proposal did not propose to amend this
country of origin requirement, only hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins that originated in the country in which they
were processed would be eligible to be imported under the proposed regulations. For example, products processed
in accordance with the regulations in Spain could not be imported if they were derived from swine from other countries.
However, the proposed processing would render the articles safe to import regardless of the country in which the swine
originated. Paragraph (a) of  94.17 should be amended to allow hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins derived
from swine from any country to be eligible for importation, if the products are processed in accordance with the regulations.

Response:

 We agree that it is not necessary to limit the regulations to hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins that originate in
the country where they are processed, as long as all the processing requirements are met. We are amending  94.17(a)
to eliminate the origin requirement for the articles. However, since processing facilities may frequently change
suppliers, eliminating the origin requirement could result in the mixing at processing facilities of meat products
originating from countries where SVD exists and meat products from countries free of SVD. Because of this, we are also
amending proposed paragraphs (o)(2) (ii) and (iii) of  94.17 to ensure that Serrano and Iberian hams processed
under the regulations are processed for 560 days, the period necessary to destroy the SVD agent in Serrano and Iberian
hams, if the hams are processed either in a country where SVD exists, or in a facility that may also process meat from
countries where SVD exists (i.e., any facility other than one authorized by the veterinary services of the national
government to process only meat from countries free of swine vesicular disease). This additional processing time
only applies to Serrano and Iberian hams, not to Italian-type hams, Iberian pork shoulders, and Iberian pork loins,
because the processing time already required for these latter products is sufficient to destroy the SVD agent. 



Comment:

 The proposed requirements for importing hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins include a step where they are frozen
to ^40 
 C and kept frozen at ^18 
 C for at least 30 days ( 94.17, paragraphs (i)(2)(i), (i)(3)(i), (i)(4)(i), and (i)(5)(i)). In reviewing
the research by the Foreign Animal Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory on which the proposal was based, it does not appear
that this freezing step is necessary to eliminate disease risk. The freezing requirements should be removed, and
the requirements describing how frozen hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins should be thawed should be reworded to
make it clear that freezing is optional, not required. 



Response:

 We agree, and are deleting the paragraphs cited above that contain the freezing requirement and are rephrasing the
thawing requirements to indicate that they only apply if the hams, pork shoulders, or pork loins are received frozen.
The freezing requirement was inadvertently included in the proposal because certain test hams were kept frozen at
these temperatures, but the research did not indicate that freezing reduces disease risk for the products. 



Comment:

 The relative humidity proposed for Serrano hams during 
the salt curing or pickling phase is 75 to 85 percent (proposed 
 94.17(i)(2)(iii)); the range proposed for Iberian hams is 70 to 80 percent (proposed  94.17(i)(3)(iii));
for Iberian pork shoulders, it is 75 to 95 percent (proposed  94.17(i)(4)(iii)), and for Iberian pork loins,
it is 75 to 85 percent (proposed  94.17(i)(5)(iii)). The research
 on which the proposal was based suggests that a range of 75 to 95 percent is appropriate for all four products. 







Response: 

We agree. We are changing the processing requirements for all four products to require a range of 75 to 95 percent relative
humidity during the salt curing or pickling stage. Because of the renumbering of paragraphs necessary due to our deletion
of the freezing requirement (discussed above), the humidity requirements for the salt curing or pickling stage now
appear in  94.17(i)(2)(ii), (i)(3)(ii), (i)(4)(ii), and (i)(5)(ii). The humidity requirements for stages
of processing other than the salt curing or pickling stage have not been changed from what was proposed. 



Comment:

 In proposed  94.17(j)(2), the requirement that each ham or pork shoulder bear a plastic tag stating the date
the ham or pork shoulder entered the processing establishment is unnecessary. The same paragraph requires that the
products bear an ink seal containing the date that salting began. 



Response:

 We agree, and are deleting the requirement for the plastic tag. The ink seal records the date (day, month, and year)
that salting begins, and this date is more useful for determining whether products have been properly cured than the
less specific date requirement proposed for the plastic tag (the month and year that the ham or pork shoulder entered
the processing establishment).

Comment:

 Proposed  94.17(j)(3) would require that pork loins have packaging material that remains intact throughout
processing and bears the identifying number of the processing establishment. This is not possible, since the packaging
material must be removed when the pork loin is placed in the pickle preparation. The processing establishment number
should instead be recorded on the plastic tag also required by this paragraph, which can remain on the product throughout
processing. 


Response:

 We agree, and are making the requested change. 


Comment:

 Proposed  94.17(m) (3), (4), and (5) would require that Iberian hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins would have
to come from a swine of the Iberico breed of black pigs. The word ``black'' should be deleted, as Iberico breeds include
pigs of several skin colors, all of which are equally suitable for processing under the regulations. The color of the
skin of the Iberico breed does not alter the way in which viruses present in the meat respond to processing. 


Response:

 We agree, and are making the suggested change. 


Comment:

 No assurance has been given that the proposed requirements for the controlled curing and long-term drying of these
products will in fact be followed. A failure to follow the proposed procedures could significantly increase the risk
of introducing foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, African swine fever, hog cholera, or swine vesicular disease
into the United States. 


Response:

 We believe that a number of controls exist to ensure that the regulatory requirements will be followed. The Spanish
Ministry of Agriculture exercises supervision over all animal importation and meat processing in Spain, and will
cooperate in enforcing the requirements. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service and Food Safety and Inspection Service inspect establishments participating in this program
and review their records. The official ink seals required on these products by the regulations provide a reliable
check for some of the most important requirements_ensuring that the products come from an approved establishment
and were processed for the required time period. 


Comment:

 These products should not be imported until a procedure is available to test the products at the time of importation
for freedom from the disease agents of concern. 


Response:

 Such a test is not now available; currently, identifying the disease agents of concern requires extensive laboratory
analysis. We do not expect early development of a practical test that could be used at the time of importation. We have
instead developed procedures, based on research, that have proven effective in eliminating the disease agents,
and have implemented regulatory controls to ensure that the procedures are followed. We do not believe that it is necessary
to prohibit the proposed importations until a test is available. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposed rule as a final rule, with the changes discussed above. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) estimates that, under these regulations, between 5 and 15
metric tons of dry-cured hams, pork shoulders, and pork loins will be imported into the United States during the first
year that importation is allowed. Products imported in accordance with the regulations will have an approximate
retail value between $352,500 and $1,057,500. In Spain, these products sell for approximately $32 per pound. We anticipate
the price per pound in the United States will be higher. 
Over the next decade, we estimate annual imports will plateau as United States markets for the products are developed.
These products are all high-value products, and not likely to be purchased for home consumption. Instead, we anticipate
most of these products will be purchased for resale by delicatessens, restaurants, and caterers. Within the next
20 years, APHIS estimates that the retail value of imported dry-cured pork products described in this document will
average between $33 and $66.1 million (50-100 metric tons) annually. This can be compared with the dry-cured
pork products, all of which are hams, currently being imported into the United States. In 1990, approximately 429
metric tons of these hams were imported. These dry-cured hams retail in the United States for approximately $16 per
pound. 
Dry-cured pork products exactly like those allowed to be imported into the United States under the regulations are
not produced in the United States. Certain dry-cured pork products produced in Virginia do resemble, in appearance,
the products the final rule allows to be imported. However, the Virginia products have a significantly higher salt
concentration and a significantly different taste. 
Genuine Virginia dry-cured hams are produced by four producers in Smithfield, VA. Two of these producers are small
entities. Wholesale production statistics and prices are not available due to propriety concerns. However, genuine
Virginia dry-cured hams retail for approximately $4 per pound.

Based on these facts, we anticipate that competition between United States-produced dry-cured pork products and
the proposed imported dry-cured pork products will be insignificant. 
In 1990, the United States produced 9,652,933 metric tons of pork and pork products, valued at about $11.3 billion.
Additionally, the United States imported about 232,253 metric tons of pork. Imports accounted for about 
2 percent of the pork available in the domestic market during 1990. Figures 
for 1990 indicate that approximately 429 metric tons of dry-cured pork products were imported under the current regulations.
This compares with 349,119 metric tons of all pork products imported during 1990, or 
0.0012 percent. Potential imports of dry-cured pork products would therefore account for less than 1 percent of total
annual pork imports. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

International Banking Operations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
(Board or Federal Reserve) amends its Regulation K concerning the permissible activities of state-licensed branches
and agencies of foreign banks. Section 202(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA or Act) provides that after December 19, 1992, a state-licensed branch or agency of a foreign bank may not engage
in any activity that is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank unless the Board has determined that the
activity is consistent with sound banking practice, and in the case of an insured branch, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) has determined that the activity would pose no significant risk to the affected deposit insurance
fund. This amendment to Regulation K sets forth the application procedures which state-licensed branches and agencies
of foreign banks will be required to follow in order to request the Board's permission to engage in or continue to engage
in an activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank and the requirements of divestiture and
cessation plans. Insured branches are also required to seek the approval of the FDIC to engage in or to continue to engage
in such an activity. The final rule also amends Regulation K to clarify that no application will be required in connection
with the conversion by a foreign bank of its federally-licensed branch or agency into a state-licensed branch or agency.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 202 of the Act amended section 7 of the International Banking Act (IBA) by adding several new subsections concerning
the establishment and termination of foreign bank branches in the United States. New subsection 7(h) of the IBA provides
that:




(1) IN GENERAL._ After the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of enactment of the [Act] a State branch or State
agency may not engage in any type of activity that is not permissible for a Federal branch unless_ 

(A) the [Federal Reserve] Board has determined that such activity is consistent with sound banking practice; and

(B) in the case of an insured branch, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that the activity would
pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund.

 

12 U.S.C. 3105(h)(1). 


In order to implement this provision, the Board issued a proposed rule on January 6, 1993, with a request for public
comment. (58 FR 513). In taking this action, the Board stated that it would consider revisions to the proposed rule
as appropriate and on the basis of the comments received. The comment period ended on March 5, 1993. The Board indicated
that it would accept and process applications under the statute during the pendency of the rulemaking. No applications
have been received. 
The proposed rule required a foreign bank operating a state-licensed branch or agency in the United States, which
desires to engage in or continue to engage in an activity that is not permissible for a federal branch, pursuant to statute,
regulation or order or interpretation issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), to file an application
in letter form to the Board for permission to conduct or to continue to conduct such activity. The proposed regulation
set forth the required contents of the application and a procedure for divestiture or cessation of impermissible
activities not approved by the Board. 
The Board specifically requested comment on several items, including the contents of the application, whether prior
notice rather than an application might be appropriate for certain classes of activities, and whether the conduct
of activities permitted by the OCC pursuant to informal rather than formal interpretation, opinion or advice should
require the filing of an application. 
In addition, the Board requested comment on another provision of Regulation K which requires that a foreign bank wishing
to convert from a federal branch or agency license to a state branch or agency license file for approval to do so with
the Board. 
The Board received four public comments on the regulation. Comments were submitted by a state banking supervisor,
an association of state banking supervisors, a trade association and a law firm. The commenters generally were supportive
of the approach taken in the proposed rule. The comments focused on whether an activity-based approach rather than
a bank-based approach would be preferable, whether the conduct of activities permitted by the OCC pursuant to informal
rather than formal interpretation, opinion or advice should require an application and whether an application would
be required to conduct an activity that the OCC permitted but only subject to quantitative restrictions. The commenters
uniformly stated that no application should be required to convert from a federal branch or agency license to a state
branch or agency license.

On March 2, 1993, the FDIC issued its own proposed regulation implementing section 7(h) of the IBA. See 58 FR 11992.
The Board has consulted with the FDIC concerning the response to its proposed rule. Both the Board and the FDIC have
attempted to make their final rules as consistent with one another as possible and thereby to reduce the burden that
might be imposed on applicants. A description of the final rule and an analysis of the relevant comments follows. 


Determining if an Activity is Permissible for a Federal Branch 


The commenters generally stated that no application should be required from a state-licensed branch or agency for
the conduct of an activity that is permitted for a federal branch pursuant to interpretation, opinion or advice issued
in writing by the OCC or its staff, as well as by statute, regulation official bulletin, circular or order. The commenters
argued that a stricter requirement would result in a competitive disadvantage to state licensed offices and thereby
would be inconsistent with the intent of the statute. The Board agrees with that argument. Accordingly, the conduct
of activities permitted for a federal branch pursuant to interpretation, opinion or advice issued in writing by the
OCC or its staff would not require an application, so long as such interpretation, opinion or advice is still considered
valid, 

i.e.

, it has not been overruled by the OCC or found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, because national
banks and federal branches may rely on a written opinion of counsel that an activity is permissible under the National
Bank Act or other applicable statutes, in the Board's view, it would be appropriate to permit state-licensed branches
and agencies also to rely on such opinions, provided the opinion of counsel is based on a reasoned analysis of applicable
statutes, regulations, official bulletins, circular, orders, or interpretations, opinions or advice of the OCC
or its staff. The Board plans to consult with the OCC when questions arise as to the permissibility of any particular
activity. Insured branches of foreign banks also should consult with the FDIC as to the permissibility of particular
activities. 


Bank Approach Versus Activity Approach 


The Board's proposed rule took a bank-based approach to implementing the statute; that is, an application was required
from each bank wishing to conduct or continue to conduct an activity not permissible for a national bank. The comments
suggested that the Board instead take an activity based approach, at least with respect to activities which the commenters
believed presented minimal risk. One commenter suggested that the Board entertain applications from industry trade
groups with respect to the conduct of such activities. 
The Board has determined that a combination of the two approaches is the appropriate way to proceed and has modified
the proposed rule accordingly. As described in further detail below, the final rule provides that certain categories
of activities are consistent with sound banking practice and that no application should be required to conduct such
activities. The fact that the Board's prior consent is not required does not preclude the Board from taking any appropriate
action within its authority with respect to such activities if the facts and circumstances warrant such action. 


Application Not Required in Certain Instances 


The first category of activities exempted from the application requirement are certain activities already determined
by the FDIC not to pose a significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund pursuant to  362.4(c)(3) of the FDIC's regulations
(12 CFR part 362). The Board has determined not to require an application under this part for the conduct of any such
activity that the FDIC would permit an insured state bank to conduct directly, provided the activity is permissible
for the branch or agency under applicable state law and any other applicable federal law or regulation. The Board believes
the conduct of these activities, with proper controls, is consistent with safe and sound banking. As set forth in 12
CFR 362.4(c)(3)(i)-(ii)(A), the exempted activities include guarantee activities and activities found
by the Board by regulation or order to be closely related to banking. In addition, the Board has determined to exempt
from the application requirement any activity conducted as agent rather than as principal, provided that the activity
is one that could be conducted by a state-chartered bank headquartered in the same state as the branch or agency is licensed.
Of course, all activities of the branches and agencies remain subject to examination. If any particular activity
is found to be improperly conducted, the Board retains enforcement authority to require conformance to safety and
soundness requirements.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, like the proposed rule, the final rule provides that an application under this section normally shall not
be required where an activity is permissible to a federal branch but the OCC imposes a quantitative restriction on
the conduct of such activity by the federal branch. The commenters were supportive of this exemption. The Board believes
appropriate quantitative restrictions can be addressed on a case- by-case basis as part of the ongoing supervisory
process. 


Contents of Application 



Section 211.29(b) of the proposed regulation provided that the application shall be in letter form and shall contain
certain information, including among other things, a description of the activity in which the branch or agency desires
to engage or in which it is already engaged, the foreign bank's financial condition, the assets and liabilities of
the branch or agency, the projected effect of the proposed activity on the financial condition of the foreign bank
and the branch or agency, and in the case of an application by a state-licensed insured branch, a statement of why the
proposed activity will pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. 

The commenters suggested that applicants not be required to provide information already available to the Federal
Reserve through its general examination and supervisory process. Accordingly, the Board has deleted from the final
rule the requirement to provide certain financial information. The Board may request such information in individual
cases if the information in its possession is either out of date or otherwise deemed insufficient. 

The Board and the FDIC have consulted concerning the type of information which each agency will need in order to make
an informed judgment and have agreed on a common list of information in order that applicants will need to prepare only
one application which, in the case of insured branches, may be submitted to both agencies. It is contemplated that
the Board and the FDIC will review such applications simultaneously. 


Standards To Be Examined 



Section 211.29(d) of the final rule sets forth the standards that the Board will examine in order to determine whether
a particular activity is consistent with sound banking practice. These factors are: 

 What types of risks, if any, the activity poses to the U.S. operations of the foreign banking organization;


 If the activity poses any such risks, the magnitude of each risk; and 

 If a risk is not 

de minimis

, the actual or proposed procedures to control and minimize such risk. 




Each of these factors shall be evaluated in light of the ability of the foreign bank to provide financial and managerial
support to the branch or agency, the performance record of the foreign bank in general and the branch or agency in particular,
and the volume of the proposed activity. The Board may also determine that a particular activity, after consideration
of the above factors and subject to any conditions or limits imposed by the Board, may be conducted by any other state-licensed
branch or agency without further application to the Board. 



This section remains unchanged from the proposed rule. 




Cessation or Divestiture 



In the event that a state branch or agency is required to cease conducting an activity pursuant to the final regulation,
 211.29(f) sets forth the guidelines that must be followed to divest or cease the impermissible activity. Generally,
this section provides that the state branch or agency shall submit a written plan of divestiture or cessation within
60 days of (1) being notified by the Board or the FDIC that an application to continue to conduct the activity has been
denied, (2) the effective date of the regulation in the event that the foreign bank elects not to apply for permission
to continue to conduct the activity, and (3) any change in statute, regulation, order or OCC interpretation that renders
the activity impermissible. Divestiture or cessation shall be completed within one year, or sooner if the Board so
directs. The Board requested comment on whether or not this period of time should be longer or shorter. 


No comments were received on this portion of the proposed rule. Accordingly, no substantive changes were made.

Conversion From Federal to State License 



As suggested by the commenters, the Board has determined not to require an application under the Foreign Bank Supervision
Enhancement Act in connection with the conversion of: (1) a federally-licensed branch to a state licensed-branch;
or (2) a federally licensed-agency to a state-licensed agency. Applications are not considered necessary in light
of the fact that state-licensed branches and agencies must restrict their activities to those permissible for a federal
branch or receive the Board's approval to engage in the activity. Section 24 of Regulation K will be amended accordingly.





Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), it is certified that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Amendment to the South Florida Low Offshore Airspace Area



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Technical amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action amends the description of the South Florida Low airspace area to exclude the airspace within the Grand
Bahama terminal control area (TCA) and the Nassau TCA. At the present time, the South Florida Low airspace area is correctly
depicted on aeronautical charts as excluding the airspace of the underlying Grand Bahama and Nassau TCAs. However,
the current airspace description of this airspace area is erroneous in that it inadvertently includes the Grand Bahamas
and the Nassau TCAs as part of the South Florida Low airspace area. This action corrects this error.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 

Background



The Offshore Airspace Reconfiguration Final Rule published March 2, 1993 (58 FR 12128), amended the Federal Aviation
Regulations (FAR), in pertinent part, by designating additional control areas as offshore airspace areas or en route
domestic airspace areas. The offshore areas were divided into high and low areas and an effort was made to establish
a uniform floor of controlled airspace for certain air traffic operations. Through that rule, the South Florida control
area was revised and redesignated as the South Florida Low offshore airspace area. The rule also extended the airspace
of the South Florida Low airspace area from 2,700 feet mean sea level (MSL) up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL.

The lateral boundaries of the South Florida Low were further revised, by amendment (58 FR 33907; June 22, 1993), to
extend from latitude 28
 00
'00
'
' North to latitude 34
 00
'00
'
' North. However, both amendments to the South Florida Low airspace area inadvertently included the underlying
airspace within the Grand Bahama TCA and the Nassau TCA, both of which have airspace segments extending above 2,700
feet MSL. The South Florida Low is correctly depicted on aeronautical charts as excluding the airspace of the underlying
TCAs. However, the airspace description does not reflect this exclusion as was intended.

The Amendment



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revises the airspace description of
the South Florida Low airspace area by excluding the Grand Bahama TCA and the Nassau TCA.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866;
is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and does
not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine
matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act.

<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action amends the time of designation for Restricted Areas R-5103A, B, C, and D, McGregor, NM. The U.S. Army
has determined that the present published time of designation for the restricted areas does not accurately reflect
their actual times of use. This action lessens the burden on the public by amending the published time of designation
to reflect limited weekend activity in these areas by the military.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

The Rule 



This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the time of designation for Restricted Areas
R-5103A, B, C, and D, McGregor, NM, from ``0700-2000 local time; other times by NOTAM'' to ``0700-2000
local time Monday-Friday; other times by NOTAM.'' Following a review of its special use airspace the U.S. Army, Fort
Bliss, TX, determined that it has a continuing requirement for the restricted areas; however, the current published
time of designation does not accurately reflect the time the airspace is required for military use. This action amends
the published time of the restricted areas but does not change the existing boundaries or the types of activities currently
conducted within R-5103A, B, C, or D. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is
not particularly interested, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary.  73.51
of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Environmental Review 



This action reduces the time of designation of the restricted areas. Accordingly, this action is not subject to environmental
assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental
Impacts.''

Policy Statement 


Issued: October 26, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) 
announces a new policy regarding the pricing of transmission 
services provided by public utilities and transmitting utilities 
under the Federal Power Act (FPA).
 The new policy is designed 
to allow much greater transmission pricing flexibility than was 
allowed under previous Commission policies. 




Greater pricing flexibility is appropriate in light of the 
significant competitive changes occurring in wholesale generation 
markets, and in light of our expanded wheeling authority under the 
Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).
 These recent events 
underscore the importance of ensuring that our transmission pricing 
policies promote economic efficiency, fairly compensate utilities 
for providing transmission services, reflect a reasonable 
allocation of transmission costs among transmission users, and 
maintain the reliability of the transmission grid. The Commission 
also recognizes that advances in computer modeling techniques have 
made possible certain transmission pricing methods that once would 
have been impractical. 




Based on the record developed in this proceeding, the 
Commission concludes that there appears to be a variety of 
workable, non-traditional transmission pricing methods that offer 
potential improvements in fairness, practicality and economic 
efficiency. For instance, the Commission believes that distance- 
sensitive rates using contract path or flow-based methods will be 
acceptable if properly supported. 

Accordingly, the Commission will permit more flexibility to 
utilities to file innovative pricing proposals that meet the 
traditional revenue requirement and will allow such proposals to 
become effective 60 days after filing,
 as long as they satisfy 
certain pricing principles discussed below. We refer to this 
category of proposals as conforming proposals. We will also permit 
utilities to file pricing proposals that deviate from the 
traditional revenue requirement, as long as they meet certain 
requirements discussed below. We refer to these filings as non- 
conforming proposals. Non-conforming proposals will be permitted 
to go into effect only prospectively from the date the Commission 
determines that such a pricing proposal meets the statutory 
requirements of the FPA, 

i.e.

, is just and reasonable and not 
unduly discriminatory or preferential. 




In addition to the guidance in this Policy Statement regarding 
conforming and non-conforming transmission pricing proposals, there 
are two specific subject areas for which we have instituted 
separate proceedings, and which may require transmission pricing 
flexibility. 

See

 Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities 
and Transmitting Utilities, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, IV FERC 
Stats. & Regs.   32,507, 59 FR 35274 (July 11, 1994); Alternative 
Power Pooling Institutions under the Federal Power Act, Notice of 
Inquiry, FERC Stats. & Regs.   

XXXX

 (1994). In those 
proceedings, we are examining what type of pricing policy is 
appropriate. We intend to examine whether any special procedural 
mechanisms are necessary to coordinate our pricing policy and 
filings proposing alternative power pooling institutions. 


I. Introduction 


The Commission will consider a broad range of rate design 
methods, within a utility's embedded original cost revenue 
requirement, as discussed in Section IV. We will also consider 
proposals that deviate from a utility's embedded original cost 
revenue requirement (subject to certain filing procedures and 
evaluation criteria), as discussed in Section V. The U.S. Supreme 
Court has recognized the Commission's broad latitude to fix rates. 
There is no single valid theory of ratemaking. Under the statutory 
standard of ``just and reasonable'' it is the result reached, not the 
method employed, which is controlling.

The designation of a single theory of ratemaking as a 
constitutional requirement would unnecessarily foreclose 
alternatives which could benefit both consumers and investors. 






488 U.S. at 316. Consistent with our broad ratemaking authority, 
in this Policy Statement we announce that we will consider various 
ratemaking methods to encourage proposals that will produce 
consumer benefits. 




The Commission's traditional transmission pricing policy has 
permitted a public utility providing firm transmission service to 
charge rates designed to yield annual revenues equal to the rolled-in embedded cost
 of the utility's integrated transmission grid 
on a postage stamp basis (

i.e.

, not distance sensitive), including 
the rolled-in costs of any new facilities or upgrades that become 
part of the integrated system. For non-firm transmission service, 
the Commission has permitted rates to reflect, in addition to the 
variable costs of providing the service, a charge up to a 100 
percent contribution to the fixed costs of providing the service, 
with the proviso that pricing must reflect the characteristics of 
the service provided, 

e.g.

, the degree of interruptibility. 
Traditionally, transmission rates have been based on a ``contract 
path'' model, 

i.e.

, an assumed transmission path from point A to 
point B, that may or may not represent the actual flows of power on 
the grid. 






In recent years, the Commission attempted to address the 
industry's changing needs by modifying its historical transmission 
pricing policy
 to allow a type of incremental cost pricing.
 
In order to provide new or expanded transmission service, a 
utility may be required to add expensive transmission assets, which 
can result in an increase in rolled-in embedded cost rates. To 
address this possibility, the Commission has allowed a utility to 
charge transmission-only customers the higher of embedded costs 
(for the system as expanded) or incremental expansion costs, but 
not the sum of the two.
 When the transmission grid is 
constrained and the utility chooses not to expand its system, the 
Commission has allowed a utility to charge the higher of embedded 
costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs, but not the 
sum of the two. The opportunity costs, in turn, are capped by 
incremental expansion costs. This type of pricing has been 
referred to as ``or'' pricing or 

Northeast Utilities 

pricing.
 
While ``or'' pricing will continue to be allowed under the 
Commission's pricing policy, the Commission is prepared to move 
beyond ``or'' pricing to consider other pricing alternatives. 








II. Request for Comments 




On June 30, 1993, the Commission issued a notice of technical 
conference and request for comments concerning these policies and 
other transmission pricing issues. 

Inquiry Concerning the 
Commission's Pricing Policy for Transmission Services Provided by 
Public Utilities Under the Federal Power Act, 

IV FERC Stats. & 
Regs., Notices  35,024 (1993) (Pricing Inquiry). The Commission 
received comments and reply comments from 165 entities, 
representing a broad cross-section of parties that participate in, 
or are affected by, the electric utility industry. The Commission 
also held technical conferences on April 8 and 15, 1994, that 
provided further opportunity for public comment and discussion. A 
summary of the comments received in this proceeding that included 
proposals for change is presented in Appendix A.






Those commenting expressed a variety of opinions on many 
transmission pricing issues, including whether transmission rates 
should reflect distance sensitivity and whether and how to 
compensate for flows over parallel paths. The commenters were 
nearly unanimous in their call for the Commission to provide 
further guidance concerning acceptable pricing methods. Some 
commenters indicated that such guidance would assist the formation 
of regional transmission groups (RTGs) by indicating what pricing 
policies will be acceptable to the Commission.

While many of the comments expressed dissatisfaction with the 
Commission's current pricing policy, the comments indicated no 
consensus for any one alternative pricing method. However, the 
commenters expressed general agreement that some type of 
transmission pricing reform by the Commission is needed. There was 
a strong consensus that such reform should: (1) Allow greater 
pricing flexibility; (2) provide pricing that is ``transparent''
 
and easy to administer; (3) promote economic efficiency, 
that is, allow transmission customers to make informed decisions as 
to the economic consequences of their choices, and encourage 
transmission owners to make efficient use of, and investment in, 
the transmission grid; (4) ensure equity and fairness; and (5) 
facilitate the development of RTGs.
 





However, there was disagreement regarding the degree to which 
reform of transmission pricing should stress administrative 
simplicity versus accuracy. Some commenters advocated the 
continued use of traditional contract path and postage stamp rates, 
in part because these rates are simple to administer. Other 
commenters proposed methods, such as distance sensitive and flow-based rates, that may give better price signals
but involve more 
complexity. 

In response to the comments received, the Commission has 
decided to revise its policies to permit utilities much greater 
flexibility. We are prepared to accept a variety of pricing 
methods in addition to 

Northeast Utilities

 pricing. 

Northeast 
Utilities

 pricing will still be acceptable because it fully 
comports with the pricing principles we adopt today. However, 
based on the record developed herein, a variety of other pricing 
methods will also be acceptable. 

The Commission concludes that greater pricing flexibility is 
now required for several reasons. First, exclusive use of methods 
that worked reasonably well in the past does not provide sufficient 
flexibility to accommodate the evolving needs of transmission 
owners and users in a more competitive era.
 It is important 
to gain practical experience with alternative transmission pricing 
approaches in order to assess how best to accommodate the current 
and future needs of the industry in providing efficient and 
reliable power supply as the industry becomes increasingly 
competitive. Second, our existing ``or'' pricing policy may not 
always encourage the most efficient investments in and use of the 
transmission grid. Third, regional differences (

e.g.,

 power flow 
patterns and population densities) justify a more flexible policy 
that can account for such differences. Fourth, a more flexible 
pricing policy may be necessary to implement effectively our RTG 
policy, which encourages RTGs to deal with a broad range of issues, 
including pricing, and which suggests that the Commission, in 
appropriate circumstances, will defer to RTG decision-making.
 
The Commission is convinced that a more flexible pricing 
policy can help to achieve broader policy goals and be implemented 
in a manner that is just and reasonable and not unduly 
discriminatory or preferential. 





In developing a more flexible transmission pricing policy, the 
Commission's basic premise is that comparable access to efficiently 
priced transmission services is critical to the continued 
development of a competitive wholesale power market. With this 
fundamental underpinning in mind, the Commission has developed 
several pricing principles that new pricing proposals should 
follow. Some of these principles reflect existing pricing 
requirements that any new proposal must continue to follow. Other 
principles, while important, may have to be balanced against one 
another.

Before discussing the pricing principles and specific new 
methodologies that may be acceptable, there are several points we 
would like to make. First, the Commission believes that improving 
price signals is an important goal, but recognizes that trade-offs 
between improved price signals and simplicity are inevitable. On 
one hand, transmission service is typically a small component of 
the total cost of electric service and, therefore, arguably does 
not merit overly complex pricing methods.
 On the other 
hand, in many cases transmission capacity is a scarce and valuable 
resource, and its pricing can send signals that promote the 
efficient siting of generation facilities and efficient decisions 
as to the dispatch of generation. In addition, new technological 
advances, particularly in computer technology, have made certain 
innovative pricing methodologies workable in practice. We 
therefore must balance the sometimes competing goals of better 
price signals and simplicity when evaluating any new pricing 
methodologies. 




Second, the Commission also recognizes that it must move 
beyond certain precedent in order to entertain alternative pricing 
proposals. For example, instead of requiring a single postage 
stamp rate for transmission over the integrated transmission system 
of a corporation, such as a holding company system with several 
affiliated operating companies,
 we will now entertain 
proposals such as zonal rates
 that take distance within the 
corporation into account, provided that such proposals are 
consistent with the pricing principles that we adopt today.
 
Having analyzed new methodologies presented in the record, we 
believe that some departures from our traditional integrated system 
pricing requirement will be supportable under the FPA if 
appropriately developed. 






Third, as previously noted, several commenters urged the 
Commission to provide a framework for reforming pricing that would 
supplement the Commission's RTG Policy Statement. The Commission 
continues to believe that it would be appropriate for RTGs to 
address transmission pricing. We anticipate that the pricing 
flexibility provided herein, and our willingness to give 
appropriate deference to RTG decisions, will not only encourage the 
development of RTGs, but will also encourage RTGs to address 
transmission pricing, including regional issues affecting such 
pricing. 

Finally, we do not want our policy to be so rigid that 
utilities will be prohibited from proposing pricing alternatives 
that may deviate from the traditional revenue requirement. Because 
transmission remains a natural monopoly, we believe it will be 
difficult for transmission owners to support such pricing under the 
FPA, particularly market-based transmission rates. However, we 
believe that it would be shortsighted to foreclose completely 
consideration of such non-conforming proposals. The electric 
utility industry of today is very different from the electric 
utility industry that existed only 20 years ago and even five years 
ago. Just as we today change our policies to reflect recent 
changes, we must remain flexible if we are to respond to future 
changes. Accordingly, we detail procedures and standards below 
that will be used in evaluating transmission pricing proposals that 
do not conform to the traditional revenue requirement. 

We now turn to the requirements of the FPA and the pricing 
principles that we have developed consistent with those 
requirements.

III. Transmission Pricing Principles 



Transmission pricing must adhere to the FPA requirement that transmission rates be just and reasonable and not unduly
discriminatory or preferential. This requirement is found in sections 205, 206, and 212. In addition, section 212(a)
requires that wholesale transmission rates for services ordered under section 211 must: 

 Permit the recovery of all costs incurred in connection with the transmission services and necessary associated
services, including, but not limited to, an appropriate share, if any, of legitimate, verifiable and economic costs,
including taking into account any benefits to the transmission system of providing the transmission service, and
the costs of any enlargement of transmission facilities; 

 Promote the economically efficient transmission and generation of electricity; and 

 To the extent practicable, ensure that costs incurred in providing the wholesale transmission services,
and properly allocable to the provision of such services, are recovered from the applicant for the 211 order and not
from a transmitting utility's existing wholesale, retail, and transmission customers. 




Consistent with these statutory requirements, which give the Commission discretion in setting rates within the
zone of reasonableness, and in light of the comments received in response to the Pricing Inquiry, we have formulated
five principles that will guide our approval of pricing for both firm and non-firm transmission services in the future.
The Commission believes these principles comport with the statutory requirements of sections 205, 206 and 212 of
the FPA, and, in the interest of developing a uniform transmission pricing policy, we will apply these same principles
to the pricing of transmission service whether that service is provided under section 205, 206, or 211 of the FPA. 



The first two principles reflect fundamental requirements previously established by the Commission. A conforming
proposal is one that meets the first principle, 

i.e.,

 it proposes pricing that meets the traditional revenue requirement. A conforming proposal must also meet the second
principle, 

i.e.,

 it must reflect comparability. As to the other three principles, however, these reflect goals that an applicant with
a conforming proposal must try to meet, but that ultimately may need to be balanced against one another in the Commission's
determination of whether the proposed rates are just and reasonable. 

A non-conforming proposal is one that does not meet the first principle, 

i.e., 

it does not propose pricing that meets the traditional revenue requirement. However, a non-conforming proposal
must meet the second principle, 

i.e., 

it must reflect comparability. If a non-conforming proposal does not clearly demonstrate that the comparability
requirement is met, it will be rejected. As to the remaining three principles, these reflect goals that an applicant
with a non-conforming proposal must try to meet, but that may need to be balanced against one another. In addition,
as part of its balancing, the Commission will consider the extent to which the first principle is not met.
 





We discuss these principles in detail below. 



1. Transmission Pricing Must Meet the Traditional Revenue Requirement 



For conforming proposals, transmission prices must be based on the costs of the transmission service provided. The
process of determining transmission prices involves three distinct steps. First, a utility must determine its total
company revenue requirement, the capital component of which traditionally has been measured by embedded (depreciated
original) cost. Second, a utility must allocate among individual customers or classes of customers that portion
of the total revenue requirement that is attributable to providing transmission services, in a manner which appropriately
reflects the costs of providing transmission service to such customers or classes of customers. Finally, the utility
must design rates to recover those allocated costs from each customer class. 

Different customers may pay different rates if they use the system in different ways. In the aggregate, however, rates
are designed so that a transmission owner meets, but does not exceed, its revenue requirement. That is, it should be
able to collect revenues from all its customers equal to the sum of its prudently incurred embedded costs, including
return on capital.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

There are two reasons for requiring transmission pricing to meet the traditional revenue requirement. First, it
appears that transmission will remain a natural monopoly for the foreseeable future. It is unlikely that market-based
prices for monopoly services, especially for firm transmission service, could be justified under the FPA at the present
time, under the current industry structure. However, it is clear that there is no single appropriate ratemaking method
under the FPA. The end result is the appropriate yardstick against which to measure the legality of a rate order, not
the ratemaking method. Thus, although no single ratemaking method is necessarily favored by the FPA, this pricing
principle will ensure that transmission users pay a just and reasonable price for transmission services and that
transmission owners, while being appropriately and adequately compensated,
 will not be able to exercise their market power to collect exorbitant rates. 





Second, we believe that pricing within an embedded cost revenue requirement provides adequate incentives for transmission
owners to provide comparable transmission services, as long as the transmission owner has the opportunity for full
cost recovery. When upgrades are required, the transmission owner may incur significant expenses related to planning
and siting new facilities. For example, a utility may be required to pay for environmental mitigation associated
with the construction of new transmission facilities. Such costs will be recoverable by the transmission owner if
they are prudently incurred. 

In addition, under the traditional revenue requirement principle, transmission owners clearly may, with appropriate
support,
 recover the legitimate and verifiable costs of services they provide that are ancillary to transmission services,
such as load following, reactive power compensation, and backup power services. However, transmission customers
should also be permitted to provide these services themselves or to obtain them from someone else if this is feasible.






Finally, as discussed in Section IV below, we intend to allow significant latitude and a wide variety of non-traditional
rate design proposals, within a cost cap based on the total company revenue requirement. 



2. Transmission Pricing Must Reflect Comparability 



Any new transmission pricing proposal, conforming or non- conforming, must meet the Commission's recently announced
comparability standard. In 

American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP),

 67 FERC  61,168 (1994), the Commission articulated a new standard for judging whether access to transmission
services is unduly discriminatory, or anticompetitive. The Commission noted that ``[a]n open access tariff that
is not unduly discriminatory or anticompetitive should offer third parties access on the same or comparable basis,
and under the same or comparable terms and conditions, as the transmission provider's uses of its system.''
 This principle has been applied to all open access tariffs filed since 

AEP,

 as well as to transmission services provided by RTGs.







There is a relationship between price and quality of service (

i.e

., in general, higher quality service costs more). In Florida Municipal Power Agency v. Florida Power & Light
Co., 67 FERC  61,167 at 61,482 (1994) (

FMPA

), the Commission stated, ``[s]ince FMPA wants to be able to use the transmission system as freely as does Florida Power,
it must pay a rate that reflects that equality.'' As a result of the relationship between quality of service and price
discussed most recently in 

FMPA,

 and the growing importance of service comparability, we will require that pricing be comparable. Comparability
of service applies to price as well as to terms and conditions. Comparability of transmission pricing involves a ``golden
rule of pricing''_a transmission owner should charge itself on the same or comparable basis that it charges others
for the same service.





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This golden rule has several implications. First, for purposes of setting FERC-jurisdictional rates, costs must
be allocated between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional customers in a consistent way, to determine the cost
responsibility of the two sets of customers.






Second, when a utility uses its own transmission system to make off-system sales, it should ``pay'' for transmission
service at the same price that third-party customers pay for the same service, and credit the transmission revenues
to its native load customers. This treatment restricts the transmission owner's ability to gain an unfair advantage
in the bulk power market by selling itself transmission service at a discount that would be subsidized by native load
and transmission-only customers.






Pricing comparability does not mean that the Commission is endorsing an end result in which there are no differences
in prices paid by various customers. For example, the Commission is not suggesting that prices must be based on highly
aggregated costs so that all customers face a uniform rate per kWh of service. Rather, we are receptive to pricing proposals
that disaggregate costs in order to give better price signals to all users of the system_third parties and the transmission
owner itself. Such disaggregation still permits different customers to pay different prices. Pricing comparability
does not rule out such a result.


Finally, comparability of pricing includes certainty of pricing. A transmission customer should have pricing certainty
comparable to that of the transmitting utility, 

e.g.

, the same transmission pricing certainty for long-term power contracts as the transmitting utility has.



3. Transmission Pricing Should Promote Economic Efficiency 



Section 212(a) of the FPA, as amended by EPAct, states that transmission pricing should promote economically efficient
generation and transmission of electricity.
 In our view, this means that transmission pricing should promote good decision-making and foster: 





 Efficient expansion of transmission capacity; 
 Efficient location of new generators and new load; 
 Efficient use of existing transmission facilities, including the efficient allocation of constrained capacity
through appropriate market clearing mechanisms; and

 Efficient dispatch of existing generating resources. 






To the extent practicable, transmission rates should be designed to reflect marginal costs,
 rather than embedded costs, in a manner consistent with the remaining principles. We favor marginal cost prices in
order to promote efficient decision-making by both transmission owners and users.
 In the short-run, marginal transmission costs are primarily line losses and, when lines are congested, opportunity
costs. In the long-run, marginal transmission costs include all the costs of the transmission system and support
services. The Commission recognizes the complexity of estimating marginal cost on the transmission grid and of implementing
pricing that follows marginal transmission costs, but we encourage experimentation in this area.
 On a case-by-case basis, we will balance the desirability of more economically efficient price signals against the
additional complexity of implementing such pricing.







4. Transmission Pricing Should Promote Fairness 



As a general matter, transmission pricing should be fair and equitable. This has two important implications. First,
the EPAct requires that, to the extent practicable, existing wholesale, retail and transmission customers should
not pay for the costs incurred in providing wholesale transmission services ordered under section 211. Similarly,
we do not believe that third-party transmission customers should subsidize existing customers. We believe this
principle should apply equally to transmission services under both section 211 and sections 205 and 206.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A second implication of the fairness principle is that 
economic harm that could be created during a period of transition 
from one pricing approach to another should be mitigated to the 
extent practicable. Solutions to any transition problems arising 
from pricing reform should balance fairness considerations 
associated with any reform against the potential efficiency 
improvements, and should mitigate the hardships arising from any 
reform. The major purpose of transmission pricing reform should be 
to provide more efficient price signals, particularly for new 
transmission uses, and not simply to reallocate sunk costs. 



5. Transmission Pricing Should Be Practical 



Transmission pricing should be practical and as easy to 
administer as appropriate given the other pricing principles. A 
user should be able to calculate how much it will be charged for 
transmission service. Some pricing proposals may be so complex 
that they are difficult to understand and analyze. Such 
complexity, while not fatal, should be balanced by efficiency gains 
or other advantages produced by such complexity. 



IV. Guidance Regarding Pricing Proposals That Conform to the 
Traditional Revenue Requirement 



In addition to the five general principles above, the 
Commission provides guidance on specific pricing proposals, 
including examples of acceptable pricing approaches and 
clarification of limitations on pricing flexibility. 

It is important for those involved in transmission pricing 
discussions and negotiations to have a common understanding of the 
attributes of various pricing proposals. For example, various 
parties advocate the use of ``megawatt mile'' pricing. Several 
distinct pricing proposals carry the same ``megawatt mile'' label. 
Therefore, those proposing transmission pricing reform must provide 
a clear explanation of their proposal. 

As the industry considers possible pricing reform, the 
following three attributes of any transmission pricing method 
should be specified to provide a common framework for analysis: 

 The method for measuring cost for purposes of rate 
design: embedded cost, incremental cost, the 
Commission's current ``or'' policy, long-run marginal cost, 
or short-run marginal cost; 
 The method for treating power flows: contract path or 
flow-based approach; and, 
 The method for grouping transmission facilities: 
corporate postage stamp versus more disaggregated 
approaches, such as zones, or line-by-line methods.






We anticipate that a wide variety of pricing proposals may be 
reconciled with the traditional revenue requirement. In theory, 
acceptable cost-based pricing that satisfies our principles could 
be designed for many combinations of these possible attributes. 
For example, prices could reflect incremental cost (the first 
attribute), be based on flow (the second attribute), and be 
allocated on a line-by-line basis (the third attribute). A 
different approach is taken by changing any one of the attributes, 


e.g.,

 zones instead of lines. Therefore, many varieties of cost-based pricing are possible. 

We fully intend to be flexible and to consider innovative, 
conforming pricing approaches that accommodate the changing needs 
of the competitive bulk power market. This applies to pricing for 
firm as well as non-firm transmission services. The pricing 
principles set out in the prior section are intended to guide RTGs 
and individual utilities in their consideration of new approaches. 
To provide further guidance, we discuss below examples of new cost-based pricing methods that we believe can be made
consistent with 
our principles. These examples are intended to be illustrative. 
Other approaches also may be consistent with the principles. In 
all cases, we emphasize that pricing reform must have a purpose 
consistent with the principles. We want transmission pricing that 
supports good and consistent decisionmaking by transmission system 
users and owners.

A. Examples of Specific Pricing Methods That Conform to the Traditional Revenue Requirement 


 

The following pricing approaches are examples of methods that 
the Commission would find acceptable, assuming an adequate showing 
by the utility. In this context, a conforming method is one that 
clearly meets the first two fundamental requirements and 
demonstrates that it is capable of satisfying the other three 
pricing principles (which ultimately may need to be balanced 
against one another in the Commission's determination of whether 
the proposed rates are just and reasonable). Of course, the rates 
resulting from its use must be shown to be just, reasonable and not 
unduly discriminatory or preferential. 


 

(1) Examples of Acceptable Transmission Pricing by an Individual Utility 


 

A variety of pricing proposals from an individual utility 
could be acceptable under the five pricing principles. The range 
of possible approaches includes various combinations of: (1) a 
traditional contract path approach or a flow-based approach; (2) 
costs aggregated at the utility level, at a zonal level, or at the 
line-by-line level; and (3) various cost concepts for rate design, 
such as embedded cost, ``or'' cost, incremental cost, or short-run 
marginal cost. Not all of these possible combinations, however, 
would necessarily satisfy our principles. 
Examples of pricing reform that the Commission would approve 
if proposed by an individual utility and if they satisfy our 
principles include: 

 Zonal ``or'' pricing based on power flows from zone to zone 
within a utility, or within the members of a holding 
company system. Zonal rates should be supported by 
showing the use made of separate zones by an individual 
transaction. Such rates should be supported by an 
explanation of the data base required and the computer 
modeling needed to implement it. 

 Flow-based line-by-line rates, based on embedded costs ``or'' pricing. Such rates should be supported by
an 
explanation of the data base required and the computer 
modeling needed to implement it. 

 ``Or'' pricing, at the corporate level using the 
traditional contract path approach. This is the current 
Commission standard and remains an acceptable pricing 
policy that satisfies our pricing principles. 


 

(2) Examples of Acceptable Transmission Pricing by an RTG 


 

The Commission will provide substantial latitude for 
innovative, conforming pricing proposals by a regional transmission 
group that meets the requirements of our RTG Policy Statement.
 
We will give more latitude to RTGs than to individual 
utilities. This is for two reasons. First, an RTG represents the 
combined interests of both transmission owners and transmission 
users, as well as the appropriate participation of state 
authorities, so pricing proposals are likely to represent an 
appropriate balancing of those interests. Second, the more 
attractive proposals for treating regional loop flow problems work 
better if all the utilities in the region use the same method.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An RTG could propose any pricing reform that is open to an 
individual utility and also other reforms that address the loop 
flow issue. Many approaches to reforming transmission pricing that 
were suggested in the record of the Pricing Inquiry address the 
loop flow issue and appear to require a regional approach. From 
the comments, the Commission discerns two major alternatives to 
traditional contract path pricing that RTGs could choose for 
dealing with loop flow: 

 ``Enhanced'' contract path pricing, which 
improves the contractual institutions 
underlying traditional contract path trading;
 and 

 



 Flow-based pricing, which refers to pricing 
designed to reflect the actual or projected 
power flows associated with a transaction. 


 Cost-based pricing could be designed to accommodate either of 
these alternatives. Examples of pricing reform based on a flow-based approach that the Commission would look approvingly
on if 
proposed by an RTG and if consistent with our principles include: 

 A MW-mile method, which could be implemented in 
one of several ways. For example, it could be 
based on ``or'' pricing and line-by-line power 
flows. Alternatively, a MW-mile approach could 
be based on embedded cost for the whole 
company, allocated as the ratio of transaction-specific megawatt-miles to total megawatt-miles. 

 Postage-stamp ``or'' ratemaking at the utility 
level that is combined with power flow analysis 
to determine the compensation due to all 
transmission owners on the parallel paths. 
This would be a departure from the current 
contract path approach. 

 Zonal ``or'' pricing based on power flow analysis 
to determine the use a transaction makes of the 
facilities in each zone. 

 Short-run marginal cost pricing with transmission prices 
based on line-by-line losses and opportunity costs caused 
by power flow constraints. 


 RTGs may be able to design a pricing approach that combines 
elements of flow-based pricing with elements of contract path 
pricing. An example might be contract-path pricing for capacity 
rights to engage in long-term firm transactions combined with flow-based pricing for short-term, nonfirm transactions
that are not 
covered by such rights. As can be seen from these examples, the 
Commission will provide RTGs substantial flexibility in choosing 
among a wide range of pricing approaches. 


 

(3) Examples of Unacceptable Transmission Pricing 


 

As discussed above, any pricing proposal, even a proposal that 
does not conform to the traditional revenue requirement, must meet 
the just and reasonable standard of the FPA. Below we list two 
types of pricing proposals which we find unacceptable. 


  Postage-Stamp ``And'' Pricing: Some utilities have 
proposed so-called ``and'' pricing, which would add an 
embedded cost rate to an incremental cost rate for 
the same service over the same facilities. The 
proposals have been based on traditional postage 
stamp ratemaking for which costs are aggregated at 
the utility level. This type of pricing has been 
found by the Commission to be unjust and 
unreasonable.
 We cannot see how such an 
approach is consistent with either our fairness 
principle or our efficiency principle.
 


 




 Pricing by Individual Utilities to Account for Loop 
Flow: While individual utilities may propose new 
and innovative pricing methods that seek to 
apportion transmission costs on the basis of 
scheduled flows (

e.g.

, zonal or line-by-line 
methods), we also believe that it would be 
inappropriate for individual utilities to reform 
their own approach to transmission pricing in a way 
that is inconsistent with regional practices 
regarding unscheduled or inadvertent flows (loop 
flow).
 We are concerned that individual 
public utilities may propose approaches to loop flow 
pricing that lead to a patchwork of mutually 
inconsistent loop flow pricing methods within a 
region. Accordingly, a utility's proposal to use 
flow-based pricing generically to recover the costs 
of unscheduled inter-utility power flows will be 
treated as a non-conforming proposal if it is 
inconsistent with regional loop flow practices, such 
as use of a contract path convention.

V. Pricing Proposals That Do Not Conform to the Traditional 
Revenue Requirement 



The Commission clearly prefers pricing proposals that are 
designed not to exceed the traditional revenue requirement. As 
noted, we believe that given the current industry structure it will 
be difficult to justify non-conforming proposals. In addition, we 
believe that the flexibility permitted under this revised 
transmission pricing policy should be adequate to satisfy the needs 
of today's electric utility industry, particularly given the 
current structure of the industry. Nevertheless, the electric 
utility industry is continuing to evolve
 and we must ensure 
that our policies do not impede the continued development of 
competitive bulk power markets, or the development of new market 
structures and transmission arrangements. The Commission will 
consider pricing proposals necessary to accommodate such 
developments. Some of the proposals discussed in this proceeding 
may exceed the traditional embedded cost revenue requirement. Such 
proposals will be considered 

provided

 they meet certain filing 
procedures and evaluative criteria. We will provide two procedural 
avenues for considering non-conforming proposals. We will also 
provide guidance on the type of evidentiary showing necessary to 
support such proposals.





A. Procedures for Proposals That Do Not Conform to the 
Traditional Revenue Requirement 



Any public utility that seeks non-conforming pricing must have 
on file with the Commission an open access transmission tariff 
offering comparable services. Such comparability tariff must have 
been accepted for filing by the Commission before a non-conforming 
pricing proposal will be considered. Moreover, utilities proposing 
non-conforming transmission pricing must submit such pricing 
proposals either: (a) in conjunction with a section 205 conforming 
transmission pricing proposal (the non-conforming proposal would be 
reflected as alternative ``pro forma'' rate sheets to the conforming 
proposal); or (b) in a petition for declaratory order. 



(1) Alternative ``Pro Forma'' Rate Sheets 



Under this procedure, the Commission and interested parties 
would review the non-conforming proposal in conjunction with review 
of a companion conforming pricing proposal.
 The conforming 
proposal would be subject to the notice and suspension procedures 
of section 205. The non-conforming proposal would not. The non-conforming proposal would be litigated at the same
time as the 
conforming proposal, but could not take effect, if at all, until 
the end of the proceeding. If, at the end of the proceeding, the 
Commission determines that the alternative, non-conforming rate 
proposal is acceptable under the FPA, the Commission will allow the 
utility to make a compliance rate filing, and the rates will be put 
into effect prospectively.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00039 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This procedure will permit the Commission to determine the 
extent to which the proposal deviates from the traditional revenue 
requirement, which may be necessary in determining whether the 
other features of the proposal are sufficient to offset this. It 
will also permit an examination of how risk, and hence cost of 
capital, will vary under the conforming and non-conforming 
proposals. Another benefit of the alternative ``pro forma'' rate 
sheets procedure is that the utility would be able to implement the 
non-conforming pricing, assuming it was just and reasonable, 
immediately following the Commission's final order. 



(2) Declaratory Order Petition 



A utility that wishes to have the Commission consider a non-conforming pricing proposal separate from a rate proceeding
may 
bring the matter to the Commission via a petition for declaratory 
order. Of course, if the Commission found that the utility's 
proposal met the statutory criteria, the utility would still need 
to file a rate reflecting the proposal pursuant to FPA section 205. 
Presumably the section 205 proceeding would be straightforward 
(

i.e. 

akin to a compliance filing), however, since the Commission 
would have already addressed the merits of the proposal in the 
declaratory order. 



B. Criteria for Evaluating Proposals That Do Not Conform to 
the Traditional Revenue Requirement 



Utilities proposing non-conforming transmission pricing must 
fully support such proposals. The utility must supply a complete 
discussion of how the proposal is intended to take account of the 
pricing principles. The Commission will consider the relative 
weight of each pricing principle as applied to the facts of each 
case. We will hold the comparability principle inviolate, however. 
Absent such support, the Commission will summarily reject the non-conforming proposal even if the utility has agreed
to the 
procedural requirements set forth above. 

We will also summarily reject non-conforming proposals that do 
not submit information showing that the proposal can be expected 
to: 

(a) Produce greater overall consumer benefits than a 
conforming proposal; and 

(b) Promote competitive bulk power markets.
 





At a minimum, utilities proposing non-conforming transmission 
pricing must make a showing of benefits to a broad cross-section of 
consumers which achieve the following: 

(i) Greater access and customer choice; 

(ii) Projected price decreases to customers of delivered 
power; and 

(iii) Service flexibility and available products to meet 
customer needs. 




As noted, utilities should also explain how the non-conforming 
proposal promotes competitive bulk power markets.

C. Guidance Regarding Proposals That Do Not Conform to the Traditional Revenue Requirement



We believe that a non-conforming proposal that results from a diverse group such as an RTG, with fair and nondiscriminatory
governance and decisionmaking procedures, would more easily be found just and reasonable than a non-conforming
proposal from an individual utility, for the same reason we would afford more deference to a conforming RTG transmission
pricing proposal than an individual utility conforming proposal.

Although the Commission has been willing, under appropriate circumstances, to permit market-based pricing for
sales of generation, the Commission intends to treat market-based transmission rate proposals as non-conforming.
Such rates obviously are not cost-based and the Commission does not believe market-based transmission pricing is
appropriate at this time. Although the transmission system has multiple owners, the basic provision of firm transmission
service is not competitive in most, if not all, circumstances. Rather, each owner can exert considerable market power
by controlling the access, pricing and expansion of its portion of the grid. In addition, regulatory approval for
new transmission lines is increasingly difficult to obtain and franchised owners are typically the only entities
that possess rights of eminent domain. In these circumstances, unlike for sales of generation, the Commission cannot
rely on competitive market forces to discipline prices for firm transmission service. Accordingly, any transmission
owner advocating a market-based transmission pricing method must demonstrate how it has alleviated these serious
concerns.

Some cost-based pricing approaches adhere to a traditional embedded (depreciated original) cost revenue requirement
more closely than others. Replacement cost methods and long-run marginal cost methods of pricing, for example, may
result in revenue levels that would exceed the traditional revenue requirement. Pricing methods designed to allow
a transmission owner to recover more than its traditional revenue requirement (depreciated original cost) are non-conforming
and would need to satisfy the procedures and criteria for non-conforming proposals. 



VI. Alternative Institutions and Associated Pricing



The Commission is aware that industry participants have begun to discuss alternative institutional arrangements,
such as ``pool companies'' and ``transmission companies.'' Some of these institutions apparently are intended
to facilitate efficient wholesale power trading, and may require alternative approaches for the pricing of transmission
services. We believe that these alternative institutions hold great potential. They may assist in the resolution
of some difficult federal-state jurisdictional issues and in developing mechanisms for resolving or minimizing
stranded cost issues. While we are encouraged that such ideas are under discussion, and are open to considering the
particular pricing needs of alternative institutions, these concepts are currently in an early, formative stage.
The concepts associated with these ideas have not been adequately explored in this pricing docket or in any other Commission
forum. Therefore, concurrent with issuing this Policy Statement, we are opening a separate docket to initiate an
inquiry regarding alternative power pooling institutions and their particular pricing needs.





VII. Conclusion



The transition to a competitive wholesale bulk power market depends on the availability of comparable transmission
services. Comparable transmission service, in turn, must have appropriate prices, terms and conditions. To that
end, the Pricing Inquiry has provided the basis for a productive dialogue among the various entities affected by and
participating in the transition to a post-EPAct competitive bulk power market, including transmission owners,
transmission users, and Federal and state regulators.

It is critical that transmission services be priced in a manner that appropriately compensates transmission owners
and creates adequate incentives for system expansion when such expansion is efficient. Of course, any transmission
pricing proposal will have to be evaluated under the standards of the FPA. The Commission must ensure that any such
proposal is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. A great many of the approaches discussed
in this proceeding have the potential to provide better (

i.e.

, more efficient) price signals. But they also have the potential to complicate and prolong the process of determining
appropriate rates for transmission services.

This Policy Statement provides a framework for understanding these competing interests, as well as a basis for continuing
the transmission pricing dialogue. The Commission has consciously avoided endorsing any particular commenter's
specific pricing methodology. Instead, the Policy Statement attempts to provide guidance while still encouraging
industry efforts at innovation. Indeed, a great many of the proposals that were submitted during the Pricing Inquiry
are highly theoretical and would need to be tested and evaluated in the context of individual cases.

The commenters in the Pricing Inquiry almost unanimously requested that the Commission allow flexibility. To that
end, the Commission has attempted to provide pricing principles and general guidance that allow broad experimentation
consistent with federal law and the physics of transmission. Certain experiments, particularly pricing methods
that attempt to recognize loop flow, clearly require regional involvement and cooperation if they are to be effective.
RTGs are encouraged to address such issues as pricing reform and loop flow.

The Commission encourages filing utilities and new groups that may form, such as RTGs and pool companies, to work closely
with state regulatory authorities in developing transmission pricing policy. The Commission is committed to cooperating
with all affected parties, especially state regulatory authorities, to ensure that any such pricing reform is implemented
in an equitable manner and facilitates an orderly transition to a fully competitive bulk power market. Our pricing
principles are expected to provide the foundation for the industry to continue its exploration of transmission pricing
reform.

Finally, the Commission in this Policy Statement has proposed procedures under which non-conforming pricing proposals
will be considered. We believe these procedures are flexible enough to permit utilities to propose non-conforming
pricing innovations which they believe will benefit ratepayers and promote the development of a competitive bulk
power market.

The Commission is making this Policy Statement effective immediately. It is based on the voluminous record developed
to date in the Pricing Inquiry. We will accept motions for reconsideration submitted within 30 days in order to help
us refine the principles established herein and to provide an opportunity to respond to any questions or clarify any
ambiguity. We will apply the Policy Statement to transmission pricing proposals submitted in individual cases filed
after the date of this Policy Statement.

 2.22 


Pricing Policy for Transmission Services Provided Under the 
Federal Power Act. 



(a) The Commission has adopted a Policy Statement on its pricing policy for transmission services provided under
the Federal Power Act. That Policy Statement can be found at 69 FERC 61,086. The Policy Statement constitutes a complete
description of the Commission's guidelines for assessing the pricing proposals. Paragraph (b) of this section is
only a brief summary of the Policy Statement. 

(b) The Commission endorses transmission pricing flexibility, consistent with the principles and procedures set
forth in the Policy Statement. It will entertain transmission pricing proposals that do not conform to the traditional
revenue requirement as well as proposals that conform to the traditional revenue requirement. The Commission will
evaluate ``conforming'' transmission pricing proposals using the following five principles, described more fully
in the Policy Statement. 

(1) Transmission pricing must meet the traditional revenue requirement. 

(2) Transmission pricing must reflect comparability. 

(3) Transmission pricing should promote economic efficiency. 

(4) Transmission pricing should promote fairness. 

(5) Transmission pricing should be practical. 

(c) Under these principles, the Commission will also evaluate ``non-conforming'' proposals which do not meet the
traditional revenue requirement, and will require such proposals to conform to the comparability principle. Non-conforming
proposals must include an open access comparability tariff and will not be allowed to go into effect prior to review
and approval by the Commission under procedures described in the Policy Statement.

Appendix A_Summary of Comments on the Inquiry Concerning the Commission's Pricing Policy for Transmission Services
in Docket No. RM93-19-000 



The request for comments for the inquiry concerning the Commission's pricing policy for transmission services in
Docket No. RM93-19-000 was issued on June 30, 1993. The date for filing responses was extended to November
8, 1993 and reply comments to January 24, 1994. Technical conferences were held on April 8 and 15, 1994. The first day
of the conference covered current policy issues. The second day was devoted to advanced pricing concepts and implementation
issues. 

Comments were received from 165 individual commenters. Five categories of commenters are investor-owned utilities
(IOUs, 67 commenters), municipal and cooperative utilities (Muni/Coop, 39 commenters), non-utility generators
and independent power producers (NUGs/IPPs, 15 commenters), Regulatory/Government entities (25 commenters),
and Others (19 commenters). A list of the commenters is at the end of this appendix; it shows the categories under which
their comments are summarized and the acronyms used in this appendix. 

A summary of the comments is provided here. The summary is organized in the same manner as the two-day conference (current
policy and advanced pricing concepts). The current policy issues are subdivided into eight comment areas and advanced
pricing into four comment areas as follows: 



Current Policy Issues 



(1) General Criteria for Transmission Service Pricing 

(2) ``And'' Versus ``Or'' Pricing and Related Incentives 

(3) Incremental Pricing 

(4) Network Service 

(5) Ancillary Services 

(6) Direction Aspects of Power Flows 

(7) Non-Firm Transmission Pricing 

(8) Regional Transmission Groups 



Advanced Pricing Concepts/Implementation Issues 



(1) Alternative Pricing Concepts 

(2) Distance/Flow-Based Rates 

(3) Contract Path versus Measured Power Flows 

(4) Spot Market Pricing 




The Commission also received comments on stranded costs in the course of this Inquiry, but these are not addressed
in this Pricing Policy Statement because stranded cost is the subject of a proposed rule.






Current Policy Issues 



1. 

General Criteria for Transmission Service Pricing 



The first comment area deals with the proposed criteria for assessing transmission pricing reform. Commenters generally
find the criteria proposed in Staff's Discussion Paper
 acceptable. However, certain criteria are more readily agreed upon than others. Most commenters uniformly agree
that the proposed criteria should: (1) Be simple to carry out and to administer; (2) promote efficient use of and investment
in the transmission grid; (3) provide appropriate price signals to transmission customers; and (4) ensure equity
and fairness during and beyond the transition period. 





Other proposed criteria by commenters include that transmission pricing policy should: 

 Ensure system reliability; 

 Be flexible (

i.e.,

 no ``one size fits all'' pricing methodology) and specifically recognize regional differences; 

 Encourage the formation of Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) and give substantial deference to pricing
methodologies developed by RTGs; 

 Provide for coordination between state and Federal pricing policies and encourage collaborative policy
development; 

 Provide for grandfathering of existing contracts and arrangements when implementing any new policies; 

 Promote competition in 

generation; 



 Unbundle rates for transmission services; 

 Ensure nondiscriminatory rates, terms, and conditions;

 Not allow native load customers to subsidize firm wheeling;
 Give deference to negotiated agreements (with some commenters adding, where equal bargaining power is involved);
 Ensure rate predictability and transparency of rate derivation; and,
 Allow customers an option to have stable prices over time (although this would not limit parties to fixed rate
contracts).
One criterion emphasized by most commenters is that the Commission should exercise maximum flexibility in pricing
transmission service. Specifically, many commenters stress that the Commission should not attempt to rigidly apply
a single transmission pricing methodology in all cases, to all entities, or to all regions. A general concern raised
is that the Commission must recognize the substantial differences present between customer groups, utilities,
state and local regulatory bodies, and regional differences. Accordingly, the Commission must resist the temptation
to apply one pricing methodology in all cases.
One common view expressed by many Muni/Coops commenters is that the industry must move from a structure where multiple
transmission system pricing occurs to a structure where transmission is viewed on a regional basis in conjunction
with the development of large, regional power markets. Many commenters advocate the regional transmission grid
approach but differ in how the industry and the Commission should advance toward this goal. Some appear to take a more
cautious approach. For example, some commenters note that the Commission can only obtain meaningful answers to the
questions posed in its transmission pricing inquiry if it first determines the shape of the industry it envisions
(such as the regional transmission grid approach or the traditional model based on individually owned and operated
transmission systems). APPA
 contends that before considering changes in traditional transmission pricing, the Commission should develop and
articulate a clear statement of its ``vision'' for the electric industry and specify ``where the industry is going,
how it will get there, likely impediments, and what steps are necessary for that vision to be fulfilled.'' Many Muni/Coops
commenters also argue that the Commission must first determine if the benefits of transmission pricing reform will
outweigh the costs of such reform.





Several Regulatory/Government entities commenters recommend that the following general principles be included
in addition to the Commission's proposed criteria:

 The Commission's pricing policies should reflect differences between the rights and responsibilities of
native load customers (including retail and wholesale requirements customers) and other users of the transmission
system; any transmission pricing policy must ensure that native load customers will be held harmless; and,
 The Commission should seek to promote voluntary resolution of case-specific pricing issues by giving appropriate
deference to consensual agreements produced through arms-length negotiations involving all affected parties.

NARUC proposes a consultative process to develop complimentary policies that truly coordinate and render coherent
regulation of transmission service. The general goals include coherence of public policy, economic efficiency
and reliability in electricity markets, efficiency of processes and decision-making, dialogue between federal
and state decision-makers and appropriate input from constituent groups and affected parties as necessary. The
Pennsylvania Commission concludes that without careful consideration of the role of state agencies and their interest
in economic and environmental impacts, bulk power wheeling as envisioned by the Commission is, and will remain, a
theoretical, economic model.

2. ``And'' Versus ``Or'' Pricing and Related Incentives 


The ``and'' versus ``or'' issue dominated the pricing comments. While arguments on all sides of the issue were expressed,
the commenters generally opposed the Commission's current corporate ``or'' policy and alternatively advocated
either some form of the ``and'' pricing method or corporate-average embedded cost-based rates. The positions of
the commenters are described below:


The ``And'' Method: 

Most IOUs, most Regulatory/Government entities and some Other entities support the ``and'' methodology. These
commenters state that the Commission's ``or'' pricing policy does not hold the native load customers harmless and
violates FPA section 212(a) (because native load customers and shareholders subsidize third party wheeling customers).
When additional facilities are needed to serve third party wheeling load, and incremental (or opportunity) costs
are greater than average embedded cost, native load customers subsidize that service (because no cost recognition
is given to the third party's use of the existing transmission system, without which the transmission service could
not be provided). Additionally, if incremental expansion cost related to third party transmission requests are
not allowed by state regulators in retail rates, the transmitting utility will not be made whole. Finally, the Commission's
policy on opportunity cost which applies the ``higher of'' test over the entire transaction period instead of an hourly
basis precludes opportunity cost recovery in most cases, sends the wrong hourly price signals to transmission customers,
and is overly burdensome administratively.



The ``Or'' Method: 

Most NUGs/IPPs commenters agree that the Commission's current corporate ``or'' policy sends the correct price signal
for third-party transmission (as long as opportunity costs are ``legitimate and verifiable'' and continue to be
capped at incremental expansion costs). However several commenters oppose pricing based on opportunity costs (as
monopoly rents for a constrained system).


The Average Embedded Cost Method: 

Most of the Muni/Coops, some NUGs/IPPs, and some Other entities generally support the return to traditional corporate-average
embedded cost-based rates. The majority of the Muni/Coops commenters and some of the Other commenters oppose both
the ``or'' and the ``and'' transmission pricing methods (as yielding excessive rates and impeding the competitive
generation market that EPAct permits). Such commenters recommend the traditional policy of charging average embedded
cost-based transmission rates. Many of these commenters argue that a transmission-dependent utility (TDU) cannot
be considered a ``marginal'' customer, subject to incremental and opportunity cost pricing, because the transmission
system was designed to accommodate the TDU's use and has been paid for proportionally by the TDU. Furthermore, these
commenters argue that applying incremental pricing to TDUs is anticompetitive and inconsistent with the EPAct because
(1) it forces TDUs to favor power purchases from the host utility over those from a competing power supplier, and (2)
TDUs compete with the host utility for requirements customers (who are charged an average embedded cost rate by the
host utility).

<PARENT> FR941103-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Commenters views regarding the incentives and disincentives inherent in corporate ``or'' pricing primarily fall
into three basic positions:

(1) Although groups disagreed among themselves on how to calculate various cost-based transmission rates, most
Muni/Coops, most Regulatory/Government entities, most NUGs/IPPs, and some others do not believe in allowing any
incentives, or premiums above cost-based rates, properly calculated. Most of these commenters agreed that, when
a monopoly resource is involved, such incentives amount to allowing ``monopoly rents.'' Transmission is and will
remain a natural monopoly, therefore, no incentive is needed beyond recovery of the transmitting utility's prudently-incurred
costs and a fair return on its invested capital. Premiums allow the transmission monopolist a competitive advantage
in the generation market. Furthermore, there is no need for incentives with the passage of the transmission provisions
of the Energy Policy Act; the legal requirement to provide transmission service is sufficient incentive.

(2) Most NUGs/IPPs believe the current incentives provided by the incremental pricing part of the ``or'' policy are
appropriate. However, many of these commenters oppose pricing based on opportunity costs (as monopoly rents for
a constrained system).

(3) Those advocating ``and'' pricing, such as most IOUs and some Others, believe that further incentives are needed.
The current ``or'' policy does not sufficiently compensate utilities for all costs of providing service, thus effectively
requiring native load customers to subsidize transmission customers. If utilities are forced to absorb potential
cost underrecovery and the risk associated with the ``or'' pricing methodology, then the rate of return should be
adjusted to reflect greater risks assumed by engaging in third party wheeling transactions.



3. Incremental Cost Pricing



Under the Commission's current corporate ``or'' policy, third-party transmission users may be required to pay the
incremental cost of a grid expansion if the incremental cost of the expansion is greater than corporate-average embedded
cost. Such incremental pricing can be structured in one of two ways_a 

contract

 approach in which each user pays the incremental cost of the upgrade it occasions, and an 

average

 incremental price based on the average cost of all upgrades to the transmission system for a group of users.

Most, though not all, commenters believe that contract pricing is the preferred pricing model. IOUs in particular
favor contract pricing because it provides more certainty that a utility's revenue requirements are fully recovered.
If incremental pricing increases the risk of less than full revenue recovery, either shareholders or residual customers
will bear the extra risks. Most wholesale customers also appear to favor contract pricing, though some have concerns
that contract pricing, with different prices for each user, may result in price discrimination. These commenters
suggest that similarly situated customers should have the same price, but have different notions of what this would
mean.

For many of the difficult practical issues associated with incremental pricing, there is no consistent position
taken by all or even most members of any interest group that supports incremental cost pricing. For example, many commenters
believe that average incremental cost pricing gives the wrong price signal to both the transmission owner and user.
These commenters are concerned that the average incremental cost price does not signal the true cost of the transmission
service. A few commenters argue that this will result in underbuilding of the transmission system. Others suggest
that this may result in overbuilding, although IOUs in particular doubt this result, given the difficulties inherent
in siting, certification and construction of new transmission facilities.

Additionally, commenters are split on the issue of administrative costs and other implementation problems that
may result under each pricing model. Some commenters argue that contract pricing entails maintaining separate contracting
provisions for each user, with attendant high costs. Other commenters suggest that average incremental cost pricing
is more difficult, given the need to estimate incremental costs, and the problems associated with changing average
incremental rates as a result of incremental cost changes. One commenter suggests that it is simply not possible to
reconcile average incremental pricing with an embedded cost transmission revenue requirement.

Several commenters suggested that it would be appropriate to allow utilities some flexibility to adopt either incremental
cost pricing approach. The challenge for the Commission would be to determine under what conditions such flexibility
would be warranted, in order to protect both the third-party transmission users and the remaining wholesale and retail
customers from being charged for inappropriate costs. Other commenters suggest that some experimentation may be
in order. If the Commission chooses to allow such experimentation, it may learn a great deal about the magnitude of
the practical problems, as well as potential solutions for those problems.

4. Network Service



The Staff Discussion Paper defined network service as allowing the user to vary its schedule and points of delivery
and receipt without paying additional charges for each change. Commenters were asked to discuss the reasonableness
of this definition and to provide recommendations on pricing network service. Most IOUs assert that utilities cannot
provide third party transmission users with unlimited flexibility in choosing and switching points of receipt and
delivery. Unless the transmission customer specifies the points of receipt and delivery, the nature of the generation,
and the loads to be served, the transmitting utility will have no way to determine the impact of the proposed network
arrangement on its system in terms of either reliability or cost. Unlimited flexibility could require transmission
upgrades and make long term planning more difficult (with the potential for overbuilding). If network service is
to include unlimited scheduling flexibility, it should be considered a premium service (priced higher than point-to-point
service) since it requires higher transmission capacity margins to ensure reliability.

Most Muni/Coops, Regulatory/Government entities, NUGs/IPPs and some Other commenters agree with the Commission's
definition of network service. Most Muni/Coops, NUGs/IPPs and some Other commenters insist that network service
should be priced on an average embedded cost basis (with no non-cost-based network rate premiums or percentage adders).
These commenters argue that such premiums would place network customers at a permanent competitive disadvantage
in obtaining economical generation sources and in generation sales, compared to the transmitting utility. Many
commenters agree that network access should not be totally flexible, nor be unduly rigid with reservation requirements
and excessively advanced scheduling requirements; rather, they believe it should be subject to the same conditions
faced by the transmitting utility, and provide access to transmission on an ``as if owned'' basis.

APPA asserts that it is not aware of any party that is seeking network access without regard to the control area utility's
own transmission needs, or that is requesting network service with total flexibility, 

i.e.,

 no scheduling or backup requirements. APPA adds that it agrees with EEI on two points concerning utilities receiving
network service: ``they should state in 

planning models

 the sources of power that most probably will be used to serve loads, and they should schedule generation to serve load
with the transmitting utility.''

Regulatory/Government entities generally agree that accurate pricing of network service will depend on the nature
of the network and any revenue pooling between transmission providers. Therefore, Regulatory/Government entities
urge the Commission to be flexible and not mandate any particular method for pricing network service.



5. Ancillary Services



The Staff Discussion Paper gave examples of ancillary services and requested comments on other examples (including
how such services should be priced). Most IOUs recommend that unless third party customers obtain ancillary services
elsewhere, they should compensate the wheeling utility for the services provided to prevent the native load customers
from subsidizing these services. IOUs note that as bulk power markets are becoming more competitive and independent
power producers are supplying ever increasing amounts of generation, these support type services that were once
provided on a reciprocal basis among utilities are not being provided by many suppliers because they are either unwilling
or unable to provide such service.

One of the main concerns of the Muni/Coops commenters is that costs associated with ancillary services should not
already be included in the average cost-based transmission rate. Additionally, several commenters insist that
transmission customers should be given the option to provide such services themselves, or obtain them from other
utilities, and receive full credit. These commenters also express concern regarding discriminatory pricing. Such
commenters urge that any charges for ancillary services assessed to a transmission customer should be the same as
the costs faced by the transmitting utility for the same service.

NUGs/IPPs, Regulatory/Government entities and Others generally did not address this issue.
Other claimed ancillary services include: Backup and Standby Service; Loss Service; Redispatch Costs; Control
Center Service; Emergency Services; fast starts, ``BlackStart'' capability (starting up a generating station
with no external power supply), regulation, and stability.
Graves, 

et al. 

proposed that ancillary services could be provided by an independent entity, which they call a ``Poolco'' (

e.g.

, an existing power pool, an RTG, NERC subregion, or consortium of independent generators). Their version of a Poolco
would not participate directly in real power MW brokerage or energy supply; rather, it would own and operate a relatively
small collection of generation and flow control assets sufficient to assure the integrity of the system, relying
on tieline flows, voltage measurements at a few key load centers, and forecast control-area load changes (over the
next few hours).


6. Direction Aspects of Power Flows


The power flows caused by a transmission transaction may be either with, or counter to, the prevailing flows. The incremental
effects of transmission transactions may also raise issues with respect to the use of multiple parallel paths and
the incremental effects on transmission losses.


A. Directional Flows


Most commenters (most IOUs, some Muni/Coops, and some Regulatory/Government entities) suggest that charges should
be applied for all power flows on a system (regardless of direction). Several commenters indicate that reverse flows
exist only under some system conditions and that changes in transmission system configuration (due to line outages)
and changes in generating unit dispatch, may eliminate any reverse flows. Such commenters also claim that all transmission
elements support all power flows. Accordingly, reverse flows should only be credited if they provide a direct economic
benefit to the utility.
Other commenters (some Muni/Coops, some Regulatory/Government entities, and most Others) argue that it is important
for the Commission to adopt a transmission pricing method which recognizes flow direction and discounts transmission
service which ``unloads'' the system and helps to relieve constrained transmission lines. These commenters suggest
that this type of pricing signal encourages the most efficient use of the transmission system.

B. Loop Flows


Few comments on this issue were received from Muni/Coops, NUGs/IPPs, Regulatory/Government entities and Others.
There did not appear to be any consensus among the IOUs on the best method to address loop flow problems.
Southern Companies indicates that loop flows were often short-lived and were viewed as part of the normal interconnected
operations among utilities. It was once commonly viewed that loop flows on one utility's system would most likely
be offset by loop flows on its neighboring systems. In instances where the flows were a problem, negotiated solutions
were reached. LG&E notes that bulk power transactions were once predominantly multi-directional and covered
shorter distances so that transactions evened out over time.
However, in today's marketplace transactions are more numerous, over longer distances, and unidirectional. As
a result, loop flows do not even out over time. In the new competitive environment, Southern Companies, AEP and Northern
States claim the situation has changed. In the emerging bulk power market, many more long term firm transactions in
a single direction are contemplated which will more adversely impact flows over interconnected systems. These commenters
state that it also may be more difficult in a competitive environment to negotiate solutions to parallel flow problems.
Consumers believes that uncertainty about loop-flow compensation may be a significant potential barrier to the
more rapid development of competition among new generators.


C. Losses


Many commenters (some IOUs, most Muni/Coops, some Others) argue that losses vary in proportion to the distance over
which the energy is moved, and accordingly, contend that incremental losses send a more appropriate price signal
to the customer (by more closely linking cost causation and cost recovery). Tabors claims that efficiency requires
pricing losses at the margin, which can be accomplished using load flow calculations and Optimal Power Flow modeling
techniques. On the other hand, many commenters recommend average system line losses. Several of these commenters
insist that they should be charged for line losses on the same cost basis that the transmitting owners use for their
own dispatch and charge their native load customers.


7. Non-Firm Transmission Pricing


A fundamental issue of non-firm transmission service pricing is whether or not a contribution to capital costs over
and above the variable cost of transmission (losses and opportunity costs) should be made for non-firm service. One
view is that users of non-firm service should not pay for capacity costs since capacity is not built for them and their
service can always be interrupted. On the other end of the spectrum are those that advocate a contribution of up to 100
percent of fixed costs, since firm customers need to be compensated for the use of the transmission system that they
support in its entirety.
Most IOUs indicate that non-firm users of the transmission system should contribute to the capital costs of the system.
They believe the Commission should rely on its historical precedent, which allows a contribution of up to 100 percent
of fixed costs for non-firm service with the revenues being credited to native load customers. Some believe the shareholders
should receive some of the revenues from non-firm transactions. Other commenters suggest minimal regulation of
non-firm transactions as long as the price does not exceed a cap equal to its fully allocated transmission costs.
Many of the Muni/Coops commenters state that there are no fixed costs associated with providing non-firm transmission
services and note that groups in different parts of the country (

e.g., 

PJM, NEPOOL, MAPP and ERCOT) do not include contributions to fixed costs in non-firm transmission pricing. Many commenters
believe that no demand charges for non-firm transmission are necessary and argue that such demand charges may have
a negative impact on the efficiencies of the economy energy market for short term transactions. For example, Consumer
Working Group recommends:
Limiting non-firm rates to real costs (

i.e. 

losses) would eliminate the artificial dead zone created by the incentive transmission rates now allowed. By granting
all market participants (and not just transmission owners) access at cost to non-firm transactions, all consumers
would benefit from increased coordination. Such nondiscriminatory, cost-based pricing of non-firm transmission
would serve the EPAct's purpose of stimulating competition in bulk power markets and would promote economically
efficient generation of electricity as expressly mandated by Section 212(a). (Consumer Working Group Reply at 21)


8. Regional Transmission Groups


All segments of the industry supported the Commission's encouragement of the development of such groups. Many commenters
believe that RTGs represent the best method available to deal with the difficult transmission pricing issues presented
in Staff's Discussion Paper. Some commenters cautioned that to be successful, RTGs must be certified by the Commission
to ensure proper representation of all groups within the electric utility industry. Many commenters anticipate
RTGs will facilitate coordinated regional planning, regional measurement of power flows and regional methodologies
to determine the price of any firm wheeling transaction within the region. The information available on a regional
basis will allow planning to alleviate current and future transmission constraints within the region as well as send
a clear price signal to third party customers requesting service. RTG's will also provide information as to what transmission
capacity is available and the need for any transmission enhancements within the region to accommodate the requested
transaction.

Advanced Pricing Concepts/Implementation Issues 


1. Alternative Pricing Concepts 


Numerous commenters proposed alternative pricing methods, 
other than those pricing methods normally permitted by this 
Commission. The methodologies advanced by these commenters varied 
from conceptual ideas to detailed formulas. Certain concepts and 
methods were advocated by more than one and in some cases several 
commenters, including: 
 Combinations of, or hybrids between, the ``or'' and the ``and'' 
policies, many of which advocated recovery of all incremental 
costs and 

some 

contribution (but not necessarily 100%) to 
average embedded system costs. 
 Variations of recovering strictly incremental or marginal cost 
pricing; 

i.e.

, rates based on long-run incremental cost 
pricing for long-term firm transmission service and short-run 
marginal costs for other transactions. Another commenter 
proposed short-run marginal costs for transactions not 
requiring upgrades. 
 Numerous proposals for a single transmission owner and for 
regional pricing, planning and operating approaches; for 
example: (1) The forced divestiture of all utilities' 
transmission assets and formation of a single transmission 
owning national grid company or ``gridco''; (2) joint ownership, 
operation and pricing of all transmission within an 
established region with all transmission users obtaining load 
ratio shares of the regional grid and paying on an average 
embedded load ratio basis; (3) a proposal simply to price 
transmission in a region as if there were a single 
transmission owner; and (4) many suggestions for the Commission 
to further examine the companies formed in Norway, Sweden, New 
Zealand, Victoria (Australia), India, Argentina, England and 
Wales. 
 Establishing a secondary market in transmission rights_transmission purchasers having the capacity to
contractually 
broker, resell, trade, partially assign, or assign firm 
purchase entitlements as they choose. Capacity trading will 
provide for the repackaging of capacity rights to fit market 
needs, thereby creating a market mechanism to ``price'' and 
``clear'' transmission services as a commodity. 
 Numerous proposals advocating that the Commission require the 
unbundling of rates for transmission and sales services. 
Unbundling would require transmission owners to include a 
separate (transparent) transmission charge in any use of the 
utility's transmission system for the delivery of power in the 
wholesale market, including that utility's own wholesale 
sales. Transmission terms and conditions should be the same 
for all wholesale transactions, regardless of whether the 
seller is the owner of the transmission facilities used for 
the transaction. 


2. Distance/Flow-Based Rates 


Alternatives to postage stamp rates would make rates sensitive 
to the transmission distance involved in providing the service. 
Alternatives suggested include various ``MW-mile'' approaches and 
other methods based on load flows (such load flow methods can 
also treat issues involving multiple parallel paths and 
transmission losses associated with particular transmission 
transactions). Commenters' support is split between distance-based 
pricing and postage stamp rates. 
Regulatory/Government commenters express a clear preference 
for distance-sensitive rates (over postage stamp rates). Most 
Regulatory/Government entities, some IOUs, some NUGs/IPPs, and some 
Others argue that distance-based rates would compensate the 
transmitter for increased transmission costs as more of its system 
is used. This encourages more efficient use of the transmission 
system. Where more miles of the transmission system are utilized, 
distance-sensitive rates reflect the proper cost causation. 
Several commenters believe that simplified distance-sensitive 
pricing methods, such as some MW-mile methods, used in conjunction 
with approaches such as zonal pricing that reflects system 
constraints, would be appropriate. Numerous commenters advocating 
distance-based rates recommend zonal pricing as a compromise 
between the administrative simplicity of postage stamp rates and 
more appropriate price signals of certain distance-based rate 
methods.

<TEXT>
 

Most Muni/Coops, some IOUs, and some NUGs/IPPs support postage 
stamp rates and criticize distance-sensitive pricing due to its 
dependence upon power flow studies involving a base and a change 
case. Many commenters note that power flows on a transmission 
system are in constant change, thereby creating a very large number 
of possible system parameters that could be included in load flow 
analyses and therefore requiring many simplifying assumptions. 
Consequently, any attempt to derive a normal base case power flow 
on which to model an incremental power flow would be flawed and 
unreliable, particularly for individual utilities located in 
heavily interconnected networks. Therefore, these commenters 
prefer the administrative convenience of postage stamp rates over 
the complexity and questionable accuracy of distance-sensitive 
rates based on power flow studies. 


3. Contract Path Versus Measured Power Flows 


The mismatch between the contract path for a transaction and 
the actual flows creates pricing and equity concerns. Utilities 
are split regionally on whether to adopt loop flow, or parallel 
path, pricing reform or retain contract path pricing. Most Western 
utilities favor retaining contract path pricing. Western utilities 
maintain that the topology of the WSCC makes it well suited to the 
use of phase shifters to control the loop flow problem. In 
addition, the development of Flexible AC Transmission technology 
may provide additional devices to augment existing control 
strategies. 
Many utilities in the Midwest and the East favor adopting loop 
flow pricing because over time contract path pricing has left many 
systems uncompensated for parallel flows. These utilities argue 
that contract path pricing is outmoded because (1) transmission 
services have become long-term single direction transactions, (2) 
many new market entities do not own transmission so that 
reciprocity is not possible, and (3) negotiated solutions are less 
possible as competition expands. 
Many utilities in favor of loop flow pricing are concerned 
that the associated transition costs are formidable. Parallel 
flows constantly change with changes in the dispatch of generation. 
In addition, some utilities urge the development of RTGs first 
before implementing loop flow pricing. In fact, there is general 
agreement that RTGs are an appropriate institution for addressing 
many of the industry's problems including pricing issues and the 
siting and construction of transmission facilities. 
While there is widespread dissatisfaction with contract path 
pricing outside of the West, there is considerable uncertainty 
about how to address the parallel flow problem effectively. Many 
parties believe that contract path pricing and loop flow pricing 
can be combined to address the problem, while other parties believe 
that these two methods are incompatible. Still other parties offer 
an array of variations on the contract path pricing and loop flow 
pricing methods. For example, Hogan's ``contract network'' approach 
and PacifiCorp's proposal are variations on the contract path 
pricing method. The GAPP experiment, which the Interregional 
Transmission Coordination Forum stresses as the way to identify the 
pricing method to compensate for parallel flows, is a preliminary 
type of loop flow pricing. The Texas Planned Capacity Wheeling 
Service and Southern Company's Transmission Cost Actual Path 
Pricing are also examples of loop flow pricing. Finally, many 
parties argue that alternatives to contract path pricing should be 
pursued on a voluntary basis. 


4. Spot Pricing for Non-firm Transmission 


Few commenters express outright opposition to spot pricing, 
but most advocate a cautious approach to implementation. Those in 
the latter category comprise a diverse group of IOUs (including 
EEI), coops, state commissions and industrial groups. Many suggest 
that spot pricing schemes should continue to be studied, but not 
considered for implementation at this time. Some encourage the 
Commission to conduct experiments similar to the Southwest Bulk 
Power Experiment and the WSPP. 
Those opposed to spot pricing generally believe that the 
benefits are not worth the costs. Some argue that the successful 
implementation of spot pricing for transmission requires a 
competitive market in generation that does not now exist. However, 
some commenters that see promise in spot pricing argue that the 
necessary market institutions and technology exist today. They 
cite the operation of tight power pools, electronic bulletin 
boards, and the WSCC experiment as evidence of this fact. 
Some commenters argue that the ``up to'' transmission rates that 
many utilities now use for non-firm transmission service 
effectively approximate spot transmission pricing. However, others 
believe that rate design for spot transmission pricing raises a 
number of difficult issues, such as the use of one-part versus two-part rates, and the appropriate definition of the
cost of 
transmission service.

Several commenters offer highly developed policy proposals or 
technical models for use in implementing spot pricing. In 
particular, Hogan and Putnam believe that all participants in the 
power market should have access to economic dispatch with marginal 
cost pricing. Hogan argues that transmission rights cannot be 
built on the traditional wheeling model that assumes that specific 
power moves to specific customers. He claims that only by stepping 
away from such misleading assumptions can the Commission design a 
set of pricing and access reforms that are consistent with the 
underlying economics and will support an efficient competitive 
electricity market.

Refusal of Diversity Immigrants 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 31, 1994, the Department published a final rule to implement the provisions of sections 201(a)(3), 201(e),
203(c) and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, relating to Diversity Immigrants. There
was an inadvertent omission in that publication. This final rule rectifies that omission by promulgating a new section
40.105.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Public Notice 1925 at 58 FR 68791, December 29, 1993, proposed amendments to 22 CFR Parts 40 and 42 to implement section
201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c), 203(e)(2), and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, relating
to Diversity Immigrants. Public Notice 1973 at 59 FR 15298, March 31, 1994, published the final rule. The Department
has belatedly realized that one proposed amendment was not included in the final rule. 


In the proposed amendments the Department included a proposal to establish a new  40.104 incorporating into
regulation the statory authority to refuse an application for a diversity immigrant visa under section 203(c) if
the applicant does not meet either the education or work experience requirement. Section 203(c)(2) specifies that
an alien is not eligible to receive a visa under section 203(c) unless he or she has either at least a high school education
or its equivalent or, within the last five years, has had at least two years work experience in an occupation requiring
at least two years of training or experience. 
There is thus a clear statutory mandate to refuse an application for a diversity immigrant visa if the applicant does
not meet that requirement, even though this is couched in terms of eligibility requirements that must be met, rather
than in terms of a refusal ground. For this reason, the Department proposed to add a new section 40.104 for this purpose.
None of the commenters on the proposed regulations commented on this proposed new section, presumably because it
was correctly understood to be merely a technical refinement without substantive effect on the interpretation and
application of the underlying statutory provisions. 
For reasons not now clear, proposed section 40.104 was not included in the final rule. Since then the Department has
recently promulgated a different new section 40.104 in connection with the implementation of section 506 of Public
Law 103-317, an unrelated provision. As a result, the Department is now publishing the text of what was originally
proposed to be section 40.104 as section 40.105. 


List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 40 


Aliens, Documentation, Immigrants, Refusals, Visas.

 

Accordingly, 22 CFR Part 40 is amended as follows: 


PART 40_[AMENDED] 


1. The authority citation for part 40 continues to read:

 



Authority:

 Sec. 104, 66 Stat. 174, 8 U.S.C. 1104; Sec 109(b)(1), Sec. 131 of Public Law 101-649, 104 Stat. 4997.

 

2. Part 40 is amended by adding a new  40.105 to subpart K to read as follows: 


 40.105 

Applicant for immigrant visa under INA 203(c). 


An alien shall be ineligible to receive a visa under INA 203(c) if the alien does not have a high school education or its
equivalent, as defined in 22 CFR 42.33(a)(2), or does not have, within the five years preceding the date of application
for such visa, at least two years of work experience in an occupation which requires at least two years of training or
experience.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, EPA is conditionally approving a revision to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Inspection and Maintenance (I/M). This SIP revision was originally submitted
to EPA for approval on November 1, 1993. This submittal was supplemented by a letter from the Commissioner of DEP dated
May 26, 1994 describing additional changes Maine is making to the I/M program, and a commitment to provide additional
material by 
July 22, 1994 and to address issues relating to the low mileage waiver by specified dates. On July 21, 1994, the State
of Maine submitted a revised SIP submittal. The SIP revision includes Chapter 128 of an amended State rule entitled
``Motor Vehicle Emission Inspection Program,'' and additional supporting material including authorizing legislation,
administrative items, and a description of the program being implemented. 



EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revision on I/M, under section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, based on commitments made
by Maine in its May 26, 1994 letter and reiterated in the July 21, 1994 submittal. Maine's commitments pertain to the
``low mileage'' waiver described in III.F below as well as the owner-performed repair issue described in III.J below.
Section 110(k)(4) provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitments by a date certain, but no later than
one year after EPA approval, EPA's conditional approval will convert to a disapproval. The content of the May 26, 1994
letter, and the July 21, 1994 revised SIP submission are described in detail in this notice. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 8, 1994 (59 FR 35072), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maine. The NPR proposed
conditional approval or, in the alternative, disapproval of Maine's enhanced inspection and maintenance program
in Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and York Counties. This SIP revision was originally
submitted to EPA for approval on November 1, 1993.

This submittal was supplemented by a letter from the Commissioner of DEP dated May 26, 1994 describing additional
changes Maine is making to the I/M program, and a commitment to provide additional material by July 22, 1994 and to address
issues relating to the low mileage waiver by specified dates. On July 21, 1994, the State of Maine submitted a revised
SIP submittal. 

Specific requirements of EPA's I/M regulations and the rationale for EPA's proposed action were explained in the
NPR and will not be restated here. This rulemaking explains how the State fulfilled the requirements articulated
in the May 26, 1994 letter from DEP as they were described in the NPR. While no public comments were received on this NPR,
substantial public comments were received on a related NPR published on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32390). In that package,
EPA proposed approval of a voluntary I/M program in Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln and Sagadahoc counties, without evaluating
whether or not it met any requirements of the federal I/M rule. One hundred seventy-four comment letters were received
on that package. Comments centered on a potential emissions trade, which would have allowed nitrogen oxide emission
reductions from the I/M program, not reqired by federal law, to be traded to promote industrial growth. Though it was
reported by the local media as such, the NPR did not propose approval of an emissions trade. In addition, while many
supported I/M, some of the commenters questioned the need for I/M in Maine. Each of the letters which had a return address
was responded to in writing individually from Region 1's Air Director, with the exception of comments received from
the Natural Resources Council of Maine and the American Lung Association of Maine. A summary of all these comments,
and EPA's response is included in section IV of this document. Again, no comments were received on the July 8, 1994 NPR
to which this final action specifically pertains. 

The I/M SIP includes Chapter 128 of an amended State rule entitled ``Motor Vehicle Emission Inspection Program,''
and additional supporting material including authorizing legislation, administrative items, and a description
of the program being implemented. Maine submitted this SIP revision request to the EPA to satisfy the requirements
of sections 182(b)(4) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act, and the federal I/M rule codified at 40 CFR part 51, subpart
S. This SIP revision will require vehicle owners to comply with the Maine I/M program in the seven moderate ozone nonattainment
counties in Maine. This revision applies to the Maine counties of Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln,
Sagadahoc, and York. At the time the NPR was prepared, the State was proposing revisions to its I/M regulations and
was undergoing rulemaking action to address outstanding deficiencies in the rules submitted as part of the November
1, 1993 SIP revision. The July 21, 1994 submittal includes those revised adopted rules and a detailed narrative description
of the program. EPA is taking final action to conditionally approve the program because the state has met the requirements
of the I/M rule except for the items which provide the basis for the conditional approval. 

The NPR stated that the only outstanding issue which could not be resolved in time for the July 21, 1994 submission (and
which therefore formed the basis of the conditional approval) was the ``low mileage'' waiver (LMW). Conditional
approval for the LMW issue is necessary because the number of vehicles to be granted low mileage exemptions is uncertain
and EPA is concerned that the use of LMWs may result in the State's failing to meet the minimum enhanced I/M performance
standard in actual practice. Coincident with EPA's processing of the NPR, however, Maine adopted a change to the regulation
that is inconsistent with the federal I/M rule. Specifically, Maine allowed for owner-performed repairs for select
emission control devices for 1980 and newer vehicles to count toward the minimum waiver expenditure provided by section
51.360 of the federal I/M rule. Section 51.360 does not allow the cost of parts for these newer vehicles to count toward
the waiver limit. However, the state committed in its May 26, 1994 letter and reiterated in the July 21, 1994 submittal
that it would issue waivers only when the requirements of EPA's waiver requirements are met. EPA construes this as
a commitment to adopt the necessary corrective measures which in turn provides an additional basis for the conditional
approval proposed in the July 8, 1994 NPR. EPA believes this deviation in the area of owner-performed repairs, referred
to herein as the ``OPR issue,'' provides an additional basis for the conditional approval proposed in the July 8, 1994
NPR. Such conditional approval is appropriate because of the State's commitment to meet all of EPA's waiver requirements
in its May 26, 1994 letter and in the July 21, 1994 submittal.

By proposing conditional approval on this action, EPA is agreeing to defer final, full approval on the revised SIP
until the State has conducted a study of the impact of the LMW on the I/M program's emission reductions. The May 26, 1994
letter and the July 21, 1994 submittal commit to completing this evaluation no later than January 31, 1995. It should
be noted that the State's authorizing legislation currently sets a deadline of January 15, 1996 for completion of
this evaluation, and the State's commitment to complete the report by January 31, 1995 represents a significantly
expedited schedule. In the event that the above evaluation shows that the State's use of LMWs causes it to fall short
of the enhanced I/M performance standard in actual practice, the State has further committed to securing the necessary
legal and regulatory changes to eliminate LMWs in time to submit a corrected I/M SIP no later than September 1, 1995.
To fulfill its commitment to meet all requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 Maine must also make the necessary regulatory changes
to address the OPR issue no later than September 1, 1995. Should the State fail to meet the above commitments, the conditional
approval will convert to a disapproval. 


I. Clean Air Act Requirements 


Background 


Maine is part of the Ozone Transport Region (OTR). Section 184(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires areas of
the OTR defined in EPA's final I/M rule (57 FR 52950, November 5, 1992) to adopt and implement an inspection and maintenance
program meeting EPA's enhanced I/M performance standard. In addition, the I/M rule requires that all moderate ozone
nonattainment areas containing urbanized areas must implement a program meeting the basic I/M performance standard.
Maine is affected by these provisions in some areas of the State. Specifically, under EPA's I/M rule, enhanced I/M
programs are required in the Portland area, and the Maine portion of the Portsmouth, New Hampshire area. Basic I/M
would be required in the Lewiston-Auburn area. This program is being submitted to fulfill Maine's obligations to
implement basic and enhanced I/M. Enhanced I/M is a more stringent program and includes all of the required components
of basic I/M. 
EPA has reviewed the November 1, 1993, May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 State submittals against the requirements of the
Act and EPA's final I/M rule. A summary of EPA's analysis is provided below. 


II. I/M Regulation General SIP Submittal Requirements 


On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), EPA published a final regulation establishing the I/M requirements, pursuant to
sections 182 and 187 of the Act. The I/M regulation was codified at 40 
CFR part 51, subpart S, and requires States to submit, by November 15, 1993, an I/M SIP revision that includes all necessary
legal authority and the items specified in 40 CFR 51.350 through 51.373.

On November 1, 1993, May 26, 1994, and July 21, 1994, the State of Maine submitted various elements which, taken together,
constitute an I/M SIP revision for seven ozone nonattainment counties classified as moderate or above. A public hearing
for the November 1, 1993 submittal was held on October 26, 1992. As stated in the May 26, 1994 letter from the DEP, a public
hearing also was held on May 25, 1994. The amended rules submitted on July 21, 1994, were effective on June 28, 1994.
EPA submitted comments during both of those hearings. In addition, EPA has worked closely with the DEP to ensure that
the I/M program meets EPA requirements identified in the I/M rule. 

The I/M SIP submittal provides for the implementation of enhanced I/M in the Maine counties of Androscoggin, Cumberland,
Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, and York beginning on July 1, 1994. Maine will be implementing a biennial, test-only
I/M program. With the changes the State made in its July 21, 1994 submittal, the program will meet the requirements
of EPA's performance standard and other requirements contained in the federal   
I/M rule, in the above-listed counties. Testing will be overseen by the DEP and implemented by an I/M contractor. Other
aspects of the Maine I/M program include: transient testing of 1968 and later light duty vehicles and trucks and heavy
duty trucks (although only the testing of 1981 and newer vehicles is considered in evaluating whether the enhanced
performance standard is met), evaporative emission testing for specified model year vehicles, a test fee to ensure
adequate resources to implement the program, enforcement by registration suspension, a repair effectiveness program,
requirements for testing convenience, quality assurance, data collection, minimum expenditures prior to time
extensions and hardship waivers, reporting, test equipment and test procedure specifications, public information
and consumer protection, inspector training and certification, penalties based on inspector incompetence, an
on-road testing program, and emission recall enforcement. A section-by-section analysis of the federal I/M rule,
Maine's demonstration of how the I/M program meets the federal SIP requirements, as well as the changes to the Maine
I/M program as submitted on July 21, 1994, is provided below. 


A. Applicability 


The SIP describes in detail the areas subject to the enhanced I/M SIP revision and, consistent with 40 CFR 51.372, includes
the legal authority necessary to establish program boundaries. 
The Maine I/M regulations and authorizing legislation specify that the enhanced I/M program be implemented in the
counties described above. The Maine I/M program is being implemented in areas beyond those required by the Clean Air
Act and EPA's rule. Maine is implementing the enhanced I/M program throughout its moderate ozone nonattainment areas,
in part, to meet requirements of Section 182(b)(1)(A) of the CAA that requires reasonable further progress (RFP).
EPA intended to take separate rulemaking action on the portion of the Maine submittal expanding the geographical
scope of the I/M program to counties not otherwise required to adopt I/M. Those counties include Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln,
and Sagadahoc. Although these areas are not required to implement enhanced or basic I/M, the State of Maine had requested
expedited approval for those areas in order to make the resultant emission reductions federally enforceable. Therefore,
EPA moved forward to approve I/M in these areas as strengthening the SIP in Knox, Kennebec, Lincoln, and Sagadahoc
Counties. EPA proposed separate action on that optional I/M program in the event that EPA took final action disapproving
this SIP. However, by this action, Maine's I/M program is conditionally approved and the revised SIP requirements
will apply to all I/M areas including the optional areas. Once Maine has fulfilled its commitments regarding the ``low
mileage'' waiver and the owner-performed repair issues, EPA will withdraw the separate rulemaking action approving
the optional I/M program since that action would be superseded by such final (unconditional) approval in the context
of this rulemaking. 



B. Enhanced I/M Performance Standard 


Today's proposal discusses the I/M program designed, in part, to meet the enhanced I/M performance standard for ozone
precursors causing air quality problems in Maine. Maine's program was designed to meet the performance standard
for volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO

X

). EPA's performance standard establishes an emission reduction target that must be met by a program in order for the
SIP to be approvable. The program, as documented in the SIP, must meet the performance standard in actual operation,
with provisions for appropriate adjustments if the standard is not met.

The State submitted a modeling demonstration using the EPA computer model, MOBILE5a, showing that the enhanced performance
standard will be met in the area. The impact of the allowed program exemptions (for example, street rods and stock race
cars) has been incorporated into the estimate of the program's effectiveness. In addition, in its May 26, 1994 and
July 21, 1994 submittals, the DEP provided a commitment to maintain the level of compliance and waivers assumed in
the modeling. The DEP also provided additional detail on this modeling effort, including justification for the modeling
inputs assumed in the revised submittal. The effect of the ``low mileage'' waiver (LMW) was not evaluated in this modeling
effort. One reason this action is a conditional approval is to allow the State to demonstrate that the effect of the
LMW is negligible, or to fulfill its commitment to make necessary legislative and regulatory changes if such LMW affects
the ability of the State to meet the performance standard.



C. Network Type and Program Evaluation



Under the Act and EPA's I/M rule the SIP must include a description of the network to be employed, the required legal
authority, and, in the case of areas making claims for case-by-case equivalency, the required demonstration. Also,
for enhanced I/M areas, the SIP needs to include a description of the evaluation schedule and protocol, the sampling
methodology, the data collection and analysis system, the resources and personnel for evaluation and related details
of the evaluation program, as well as the legal authority establishing the evaluation program.

Maine has chosen to implement a test-only I/M network program design utilizing contractors to implement the inspection
portion of the program. The State has chosen not to make a demonstration for case-by-case equivalency for a different
network design, and has provided evidence that precludes conflicts of interest by the contractor, as described in
the ``test-only'' requirements in the I/M rule. In its July 21, 1994 letter, the Maine DEP states, in its SIP revision
narrative, that it will institute a continuous ongoing evaluation program consistent with the federal I/M rule.
The results of the evaluation program will be reported to EPA on a biennial basis (40 CFR 51.353). In addition, Maine
commits to developing and submitting the annual reports described by 40 CFR 51.366. Legal authority, already contained
in Maine state law, authorizes the DEP to implement this contractor operated, test-only program and conduct the program
evaluation, as necessary, to implement I/M consistent with federal requirements.



D. Adequate Tools and Resources



Under the Act and EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the resources that will be used for program operation
and must discuss how the performance standard will be met, including: (1) A detailed budget plan describing the source
of funds for personnel, program administration, program enforcement, purchase of necessary equipment (such as
vehicles for undercover audits), and for other requirements discussed throughout the I/M rule, for the period prior
to the next biennial self-evaluation required by the federal I/M rule, and (2) a description of personnel resources,
the number of personnel dedicated to overt and covert auditing, data analysis, program administration, enforcement,
and other necessary functions, and the training attendant to each function.

The current Maine legislation was effective July 12, 1993. The legislation authorizes the DEP to collect a fee from
the I/M contractors to cover the costs of administrating, overseeing, and enforcing the I/M program, and provides
for allocation of certain highway funds for implementation. As Maine committed in the May 28, 1994 letter, the July
21, 1994 submittal includes additional detail on the funding and description of resources to be used for implementation
of the enhanced I/M program. This narrative describes the budget, staffing support, and equipment needed to implement
the program. The revised regulations provide between a $2.00 and $4.00 fee per inspection to be used to administer
the program.

E. Test Frequency and Convenience



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a detailed test schedule, including the test year selection scheme if testing
is other than annual. The SIP must also include the legal authority necessary to implement and enforce the test frequency
requirement and explain how the test frequency will be integrated with the enforcement process. In addition, in enhanced
I/M programs, the SIP needs to demonstrate that the network of stations providing testing services is sufficient
to ensure consumer convenience by providing short waiting times to get a test, and short driving distances to get to
the test center.

The Maine SIP revision requires biennial inspections for all subject motor vehicles that are at least two years old.
The inspections will be conducted on odd or even years corresponding to the model year of the vehicle and timed with
the registration process. This is described in more detail in the July 21, 1994 submittal. The authority for enforcing
the testing frequency is contained in the revised Maine I/M rule. Short waiting times and short driving distances
relating to network design are addressed in the contract between the State and its contractor, and in the Maine rules.
The contract requires an average waiting time of 15 minutes or less per test (except for 7 days per month) and inspection
facility locations which ensure that 85% of the vehicle population is within a fifteen mile drive of each facility.



F. Vehicle Coverage



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a detailed description of the number and types of vehicles to be covered by
the program, and a plan for identifying subject vehicles, including vehicles that are routinely operated in the area
but may not be registered in the area. Also, the SIP must include a description of any special exemptions which will
be granted by the program, and an estimate of the percentage and number of vehicles granted such exemptions. Such exemptions
need to be accounted for in the emission reduction analysis. In addition, the SIP needs to include the legal authority
necessary to implement and enforce the vehicle coverage requirement.

Maine's I/M program covers all 1968 and newer model year gasoline powered light-duty vehicles and light-duty and
heavy-duty trucks, registered, or required to be registered, within the nonattainment areas (only the testing of
1981 and newer vehicles is considered in evaluating whether the enhanced performance standard is met). Vehicles
will be identified through the State Department of Transportation vehicle registration database. Special classes,
which are exempt from the emission testing program, include vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds (GVWR), street
rods, stock race cars, and motorcycles. Based on information provided by the State, Maine has shown that such exemptions
will not prevent the program from achieving the performance standard. Additional detail supporting this conclusion
was submitted by the State on July 21, 1994. Legal authority for the vehicle coverage requirement is contained in the
Maine I/M rule and the July, 1993 authorizing legislation. 
The revised rules submitted by Maine on July 21, 1994 include a low-mileage waiver (LMW) which exempts vehicles driven
less than 5000 miles per year. The authorizing legislation requires the LMW and also requires that the DEP prepare
a report on its effect on Maine's ability to meet the performance standard. The May 26, 1994 letter and the July 21, 1994
submittal from the DEP commit to provide the legislature with this information by January 31, 1995, and to secure revised
legislation if the data shows that Maine cannot achieve the performance standard required by EPA's I/M rule. If necessary,
the DEP also commits to revising its regulation by June 1, 1995, to hold a public hearing on necessary regulatory changes,
and to submit to EPA a revised SIP submittal removing the LMW by September 1, 1995. At present, there is inadequate information
for EPA to determine how this waiver will affect the performance standard. For this reason, EPA is conditionally approving
the submission based on the above-referenced commitments by DEP. Failure to meet any of these dates will result in
EPA disapproval of this action, unless the EPA Regional Administrator approves a later date in writing no later than
the date of the applicable milestone. Under no circumstances will the September 1, 1995 date for final submittal be
revised.

G. Test Procedures and Standards 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of each test procedure used. The SIP also must include the rule,
ordinance or law describing and establishing the test procedures. 

The Maine I/M SIP revision obligates the State to perform transient exhaust emission testing using the IM240 driving
cycle. In addition, the State of Maine has stated that it will follow procedures in accordance with EPA's guidance
document entitled, ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment
Specifications.'' The State will be requiring IM240 tests on 1968 and later model year vehicles in the area. This model
year coverage complies with EPA's I/M regulation. In addition, the State of Maine will require evaporative emission
testing of fuel system integrity and functionality for 1981 and newer vehicles. The test procedures are set forth
with specificity in the I/M Request For Proposal (RFP) which the Maine I/M contractor is required to abide by. In approving
this action, EPA expects Maine to amend these procedures to ensure that the latest EPA procedures will be used in the
program, if the EPA guidance is revised in the future. 



H. Test Equipment 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include written technical specifications for all test equipment used in the program
and address each of the requirements set forth at 40 CFR 51.358. The specifications must describe the emission analysis
process, the necessary test equipment, the required features, and written acceptance testing criteria and procedures.


In its July 21, 1994 submission, Maine provided written equipment specifications as contained in EPA's IM240 Guidance
and the appendices of EPA's I/M rule. The Maine SIP submissions and their appendices address the requirements in 40
CFR 51.358 and include descriptions of performance features and functional characteristics of the computerized
test systems. The necessary test equipment, required features, and acceptance testing criteria are mandated by
the RFP and contract. 



I. Quality Control 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of quality control and recordkeeping procedures. The SIP
also must include the procedures manual, rule, and ordinance or law describing and establishing quality control
procedures and requirements. 

The Maine I/M SIP narrative, the RFP, and the contract included as part of the Maine July 21, 1994 submittal contain
descriptions and requirements establishing the quality control procedures described in accordance with the federal
I/M rule and are consistent with EPA guidance. These requirements will help ensure that equipment calibrations are
properly performed and 
recorded and that the necessary compliance document security is maintained. The Maine SIP complies with all specifications
for quality control set forth in  51.359 and appendix A of the federal I/M rule, and EPA's technical guidance.




J. Waivers and Compliance Via Diagnostic Inspection 



Under EPA's I/M rule the SIP must include a maximum waiver rate expressed as a percentage of initially failed vehicles.
This waiver rate is used for estimating emission reduction benefits in the modeling analysis. Corrective action
must be taken if the waiver rate exceeds that estimated in the SIP, or the state must revise the SIP and claim emission
reductions accordingly. The SIP also must describe the waiver criteria and procedures, including cost limits, quality
assurance methods and measures, and administration. Lastly, the SIP must include the necessary legal authority,
ordinance(s), or rules to issue waivers, set and adjust cost limits as required, and carry out any other functions
necessary to administer the waiver system, including enforcement of the waiver provisions.

Cost limits for the minimum expenditure waivers must be in accordance with the CAA and federal I/M rule. Expenditures
for repairs of at least $450, adjusted annually for the consumer price index (CPI), must be spent in order to qualify
for a waiver in the enhanced I/M program. Maine has demonstrated that it can meet the enhanced I/M performance standard
testing only 1981 and newer vehicles. In addition, Maine is requiring I/M on vehicles as old as 1968 model year. These
vehicles will not be included as part of the ``enhanced I/M'' program, despite being subject to the same type of exhaust
emission testing because the state does not require such vehicles to meet the $450 waiver minimum. Nevertheless,
the testing of these additional vehicles will achieve additional emission reductions which will be used, in part,
as a means of achieving additional emission reductions required for Reasonable Further Progress, and anticipated
by Maine to be necessary for attainment. Accordingly, these older vehicles will be subject to a lower waiver expenditure
of $125, adjusted for CPI, prior to receiving a waiver. 

The Maine program includes a waiver rate of 3% of initially failed vehicles, Model Year 1981 and newer. This waiver
rate is used in the modeling demonstration. The DEP has committed in the July 21, 1994 submittal, that if the waiver
rate is higher than estimated as determined by its program reports, the State will take corrective action to address
the deficiency. Furthermore, the SIP describes the three types of waivers the State will allow including: a minimum
expenditure, a time extension, and a one-time hardship waiver provisions. These issues are dealt with in a manner
consistent with the federal I/M rule. The proper criteria, procedures, quality assurance and administration regarding
the issuance of waivers, consistent with EPA's I/M rule, will be ensured by the DEP and its contractors and are detailed
in the SIP narrative, submitted on July 21, 1994. 

One portion of the revised Maine rule represents a deviation from the requirements of EPA's final rule (57 FR 52950).
This provision allows for owner-performed repairs for select emission control devices (specifically, the catalytic
converter, exhaust pipes and hardware, fuel filler cap, PCV valve, thermostatic air cleaner, and air pump) for 1980
and newer vehicles to count toward the minimum waiver expenditure set forth in section 51.360 of the federal I/M rule.
However, as mentioned above, section 51.360 also requires that the State commit to maintaining a maximum level of
waivers in this program. The State has committed to a 3 percent waiver limit, and to taking necessary steps to ensure
that this rate is not exceeded. It is the level of waivers that greatly affects the level of emission reductions achieved
from the program. Maine's deviation in the area of owner-performed repairs is very narrow since the list of emission
control devices for which costs can count toward the waiver is expressly limited. Based on these considerations and
the State's commitment to ensuring an allowable maximum waiver rate, EPA believes that a specified and clearly limited
deviation from the federal I/M rule in the area of owner-performed repairs will not significantly affect the level
of reductions achieved from the I/M program. 

The State committed in its May 26, 1994 letter, reiterated in 
the July 21, 1994 submittal, that Maine would issue waivers only 
when the requirements of EPA's waiver requirements were met. 
In its May 26, 1994 letter, the State committed to amend the SIP to not allow owner repair costs to count toward the $450
waiver amount for 1980 and later model year vehicles. The July 21, 1994 submittal stated that Maine would issue waivers
``only when the requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 are met.'' EPA construes this as a commitment to adopt the necessary corrective
measures, which in turn provides an additional basis for the conditional approval proposed in the July 8, 1994 NPR.
EPA has commented previously on the waiver provisions, including the OPR issue and the NPR proposed a conditional
approval so that public notice on these issues was sufficient. For these reasons, EPA is conditionally approving
this SIP revision. Accordingly, this notice requires the DEP to revise its regulation by June 1, 1995, to hold a public
hearing on necessary regulatory changes, and to submit to EPA a revised SIP submittal removing the OPR waiver allowance
for 1980 and newer cars by September 1, 1995. Of course, the State's failure to meet any of these dates will result in
EPA disapproval of this action, unless the EPA Regional Administrator approves a later date in writing no later than
the date of the applicable milestone. The September 1, 1995 date for final submittal will not be revised under any circumstances.

K. Motorist Compliance Enforcement



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must provide information concerning motorist enforcement, including: (1) A description
of the existing compliance mechanism if it will continue to be used for this program, and the demonstration that it
is as effective or more effective than registration-denial enforcement; (2) an identification of the agencies responsible
for performing each of the applicable activities in this section; (3) a description of, and accounting for, all classes
of exempt vehicles; and (4) a description of the plan for testing fleet vehicles, rental car fleets, leased vehicles,
and any other special classes of subject vehicles, such as those operated (but not necessarily registered) in the
program area. Also, the SIP must include a determination of the current compliance rate based on a study of the system
including an estimate of compliance losses due to loopholes, counterfeiting, and unregistered vehicles. Estimates
of the effect of closing such loopholes and otherwise improving the enforcement mechanism must be supported with
detailed analyses. In addition, the SIP needs to include the legal authority to implement and enforce the program.
Lastly, the SIP must include a commitment to an enforcement level and minimum compliance level used for modeling purposes
and to be maintained, at a minimum, in practice. 

The State of Maine has chosen to use a program of registration suspension whereby subsequent registration is denied
to anyone who fails to meet emission testing requirements. The motorist compliance enforcement program will be implemented
primarily by the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV). The enforcement strategy is described in Maine's July 21, 1994
submittal. The enforcement strategy is designed to ensure a 90 percent compliance rate for all vehicles within 4 months
of the compliance deadline. As described in the July 21, 1994 submittal, this will be accomplished by a computer matching
program that will identify registered vehicles tested prior to registration, as well as those receiving their emission
inspection within a 60 day period after registering. Those not receiving the emissions test will be notified of such
failure, and put on notice that their registration will be suspended if they do not comply. Those that still fail to
comply will either receive a summons to appear in court, or be subject to confiscation of their license plate by BMV
personnel who would physically remove the plate from the vehicle. In addition, the Maine legislation authorizing
I/M provides that vehicles operating with a suspended registration must be fined at least $450 for 1981 model year
or newer vehicles, or $125, for older than 1981 model year vehicles. 

The only classes of vehicles exempt from the I/M program are described above under vehicle coverage. Fleet vehicles,
rental car fleets, and leased vehicles will be required to meet the same program requirements as all other vehicles
that receive annual registration. The compliance rate for the program was estimated at 96%. The legal authority to
implement and enforce the program is included in the Maine law and in DEP and BMV rules as supplied on July 21, 1994. 



L. Motorist Compliance Enforcement Program Oversight 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of enforcement program oversight and information management
activities. 

The Maine I/M SIP revision provides for regular auditing of its enforcement program and adherence to effective management
practices, including adjustments to improve the program when necessary. These program oversight and information
management activities were described in the July 21, 1994 SIP narrative, and include: establishing procedures for
personnel engaged in I/M document handling and processing, supporting a communications network for the State's
oversight and management requirements, and establishing an I/M database to compare to the registration database
for purposes of determining program effectiveness. In addition, the SIP describes the procedures to be followed
in identifying noncomplying vehicles, timeframes for confiscation of suspended vehicle registration certificates
and plates, timeframes for issuing summonses to appear in court, and the associated fines for failure to comply.

M. Quality Assurance 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the quality assurance program, and written procedure manuals
covering both overt and covert performance audits, record audits, and equipment audits. 

The July 21, 1994 submittal from Maine includes a description of the quality assurance program. According to that
submittal, the program will include operation and progress reports and overt and covert audits of all emission inspectors
and emission inspection facilities to be conducted by the DEP. Written procedures and techniques for overt and covert
performance, record, and equipment audits will be prepared and provided to auditors and updated as needed. The July
21, 1994 submission also includes a commitment to conduct a minimum of two (2) covert audits per lane per year. 



N. Enforcement Against Contractors, Stations and Inspectors 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a penalty schedule and legal authority for establishing and imposing penalties,
civil fines, station and inspector license suspension, and revocations. In the case of state constitutional impediments
precluding immediate authority to suspend licenses, the state Attorney General shall furnish an official opinion
within the SIP explaining the constitutional impediment as well as relevant case law. The SIP also must describe the
administrative and judicial procedures and responsibilities relevant to the enforcement process, including the
agencies, courts, and jurisdictions involved, personnel to prosecute and adjudicate cases, and other aspects of
the enforcement of the program requirements, the resources to be allocated to the enforcement function, and the source
of those funds. In states that are without immediate suspension authority, the SIP must demonstrate that sufficient
resources, personnel, and systems are in place to meet the three-day case management requirement for violations
that directly affect emission reductions. 

The Maine I/M SIP revision includes specific penalties in its enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors
in accordance with the federal I/M rule. Based on its SIP submittal dated July 21, 1994, the State's enforcement procedures
can be pursued through contractual or regulatory action. The DEP has the authority to immediately suspend a station
inspector for violations that directly affect emission reduction benefits. Authority for establishing and imposing
penalties, civil fines, license suspension, and revocations are contained in the contract. The DEP is planning to
assign employees to covert and overt auditing and commit additional resources required for enforcement oversight.
These audits and oversight functions will be funded by the inspection fee. 



O. Data Analysis and Reporting 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must describe the types of data to be collected. 

The Maine I/M SIP provides for collecting test data to link specific test results to specific vehicles, I/M program
registrants, test sites, and inspectors. The SIP lists the specific types of test data and quality control data which
will be collected. As outlined above and described in the May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 submittals, the data will be
used to generate reports concerning test data, quality assurance, quality control, enforcement, as well as necessary
changes and identified weaknesses in the program. The state has also committed to collecting all data necessary for
the quality assurance and enforcement reports, as required by 51.366 of the federal I/M rule. 



P. Inspector Training and Licensing or Certification 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the training program, the written and hands-on tests, and
the licensing or certification process. 

The May 26, 1994 and July 21, 1994 submittals from the DEP provide detail on the inspector training program. The Maine
I/M SIP provides for implementation of training, licensing, and refresher programs for emission inspectors. The
SIP describes the program and curriculum including written and hands-on testing at least once every two years. All
inspectors will be required to be licensed to inspect vehicles in the Maine I/M program.

Q. Improving Repair Effectiveness 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of the technical assistance program to be implemented, a description
of the procedures and criteria to be used in meeting the performance monitoring requirements of this section for enhanced
I/M programs, and a description of the repair technician training resources available in the community. 

In the July 21, 1994 submittal, Maine provided additional detail and a description of the technical assistance, performance
monitoring and repair technician training programs to be implemented. The SIP revision provides for regularly informing
repair facilities about changes to the inspection program, training course schedules, common problems, and potential
solutions for particular engine families, diagnostic tips, repairs, and other assistance issues. As described
in the July 21, 1994 submittal, the DEP has also ensured that a repair technician hotline be available for repair technicians,
and issued a contract to accomplish this. Performance monitoring statistics of repair facilities will be provided
to motorists whose vehicles fail the I/M tests in enhanced I/M areas. The State has committed to ensure that adequate
repair technician training exists by establishing training courses at technical schools in the area, and has secured
necessary funding under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. Further, the SIP includes a detailed
public information and consumer protection plan consistent with the requirements of EPA's I/M Rule at  51.368.




R. Compliance With Recall Notices 



Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must describe, for enhanced I/M programs, the procedures used to incorporate the vehicle
recall lists provided into the inspection or registration database, the 
quality control methods used to ensure that recall repairs are properly documented and tracked, and the method (inspection
failure or registration denial) used to enforce the recall requirements. 

The revised Maine I/M SIP ensures that vehicles subject to the enhanced I/M program that are included in either a voluntary
emission recall or a remedial plan determination pursuant to the CAA have had the appropriate repairs made prior to
the inspection. The contractor will identify vehicles that have not completed recall repairs through an electronic
database, updated on a quarterly basis. Motorists with unresolved recall notices will be required to show proof of
compliance or will be denied the opportunity for inspection. The revised rules of June 28, 1994 address this issue,
and were submitted on July 21, 1994. 



S. On-road Testing 









</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00067 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the Act and EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a detailed description of the on-road testing program required
in enhanced I/M areas, including the types of testing, test limits and criteria, the number of vehicles (the percentage
of the fleet) to be tested, the number of employees to be dedicated to the on-road testing effort, the methods for collecting,
analyzing, utilizing, and reporting the results of on-road testing and, the portion of the program budget to be dedicated
to on-road testing. Also, the SIP must include the legal authority necessary to implement the on-road testing program,
including the authority to enforce off-cycle inspection and repair requirements. In addition, emission reduction
credit for on-road testing programs can only be granted for a program designed to obtain significant emission reductions
over and above those predicted to be achieved by other aspects of the I/M program. The SIP needs to include technical
support for the claimed additional emission reductions. 

The I/M SIP submitted on July 21, 1994 includes a detailed description of its on-road testing program. The testing
program will include 0.5% of the subject vehicles. Vehicles with emission readings measured by remote sensing devices
exceeding limits defined in the revised rules will be required to obtain an out-of-cycle inspection at a vehicle emission
inspection facility. This program will be staffed by the DEP. Data collection and reporting will be done using the
general record-keeping and reporting provisions of the I/M program. The legal authority for this program is contained
in the Maine I/M rule and the authorizing legislation. The State did not include additional modeling credit for this
portion of the program as part of the modeling used to demonstrate that EPA's performance standard was met. 



T. Concluding Statement 



A more detailed analysis of the State's submittal and how it meets the federal requirements is contained in the EPA's
technical support document prepared for this action. The TSD is available from the EPA New England Regional office
listed above. The criteria used to review the submitted SIP revision are based on the requirements set forth in Section
182 of the CAA and in the federal I/M regulations. Based on these requirements, EPA developed a detailed I/M approvability
checklist to be used nationally to determine if I/M programs meet the requirements of the CAA and the federal I/M rule.
The checklist states the federal requirements, referenced by section of the rule, whether or not the Maine program
meets such requirements, and where in the Maine SIP submittal the requirements are met. This checklist, the CAA, and
the federal I/M regulation formed the basis for EPA's technical review. EPA has reviewed the Maine I/M SIP revision
submitted to the EPA using the criteria stated above. The Maine regulations and accompanying materials contained
in the SIP submittals from the State represent an acceptable plan to comply with the I/M requirements and meet all the
criteria required for EPA to conditionally approve the SIP.

Due to recent, well-publicized criticism of initial I/M testing in Maine, an agreement appears to have been reached
between representatives of the Governor's Office, the Maine Legislature, the DEP, and Systems Control, Maine's
I/M contractor. The agreement calls for a suspension of mandatory vehicle testing until March, 1995 so that improvements
can be made to ensure a fair and equitable program. Since EPA's I/M rule permits the phase-in of emissions testing in
areas implementing new test-only programs (See 40 CFR 51.373(c)(2)), the agreement in no way precludes EPA from conditionally
approving the Maine I/M SIP as set forth in this notice. 



IV. Response to Comments 



While no public comments were received on this NPR, substantial public comments were received on a related NPR published
on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32390). That package proposed approval of an I/M program in Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln and Sagadahoc,
with no judgement as to whether or not it met any requirements of the federal I/M rule. One hundred seventy-four comment
letters were received on that package. Comments centered on a proposed trade which would have allowed nitrogen oxide
emission reductions not required by federal law from the I/M program to be traded to promote industrial growth. Though
it was reported by local media as such, EPA's notice did not propose to approve such a trade. In addition, while many
commenters supported I/M, some questioned the need for I/M in Maine. The Maine Lung Association commented in support
of expanding the program to the four optional counties. Each of the letters which had a return address were responded
to in writing individually from Region l's Air Director, with the exception of the Natural Resources Council of Maine
and the American Lung Association of Maine. A summary of these comments, and EPA's response is included in this package.
No comments were received on the July 8, 1994 NPR to which this final action specifically pertains. 

The Natural Resources Council of Maine and the American Lung Association of Maine commented the EPA should wait to
approve the use of NO

X

 credits for trading purposes until an attainment demonstration has been submitted by the state and approved by EPA.
This would allow both parties to determine if any credits generated by expanding the program area were surplus and
available for trading to meeting offset requirements. Surplus credits are credits beyond those mandated by CAA requirements
and necessary for attainment or Reasonable Further Progress. EPA agrees with this comment and will continue to work
with the state of Maine to ensure that any credits generated by the I/M program used to meet offset requirements are
surplus credits. 



Final Action 



 EPA is conditionally approving the Maine I/M program submitted by the State, on November 1, 1993, May 26, 1994, and
July 21, 1994. 

Pursuant to section 110(k)(4) of the CAA, EPA is conditionally approving Maine's submission based on the commitments
of the DEP. Specifically, by January 31, 1995 the DEP will submit a report outlining the effect of the ``low mileage''
waiver to the legislature; by June 1, 1995, if necessary, will hold a public hearing on revised regulation changes;
and by September 1, 1995, if necessary, will submit a revised SIP revision removing the ``low mileage'' waiver from
the regulations. The state must also address the above described issues related to owner performed repairs according
to the same schedule. Section 110(k)(4) provides that, if a state fails to comply with its commitment, such conditional
approval will convert to a disapproval. 

Failure to meet any of these dates will result in EPA disapproval of this action, unless the EPA Regional Administrator
approves a later date, in writing, by no later than the date of the applicable milestone. Under no circumstances will
the September 1, 1995 date for final submittal be revised. 

Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709.) 

This action has been classified as a Table 1 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.


Conditional approvals of SIP submittal under sections 110 and 301 subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new
requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing or has committed to impose in the
future. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA,
preparation of a flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the state actions. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA,

 427 U.S. 246, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

If EPA issues a final disapproval or if this conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k),
based on the state's failure to meet the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable
to small entities. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover,
EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that in the
event EPA disapproves the state submittal, such disapproval would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities because it would not remove existing state requirements nor would it substitute a new federal
requirement.

It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revision is based on whether it meets the requirements
of 
sections 110(a)(2) (A)-(K) and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part
51.

ACTION:

 Direct final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 13, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky through the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet
(Cabinet), submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Lexington, Owensboro, Paducah, and Edmonson
County areas from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O

3

). The marginal nonattainment areas include the following counties: Lexington (Fayette and Scott), Owensboro (Daviess
and a portion of Hancock), Paducah (Livingston and a portion of Marshall), and Edmonson County. Under the Clean Air
Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes and the redesignation request
satisfies the criteria set forth in the Clean Air Act. In this action, EPA is approving the redesignation to attainment
of the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas and the associated maintenance plans because they meet the maintenance
plan and redesignation requirements. EPA will act on the request to redesignate to attainment the Lexington and Paducah
areas in a future document. In this action, EPA is also approving the 1990 base year inventory for the Owensboro and
Edmonson County marginal O

3

 nonattainment areas.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of Kentucky,
EPA designated the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas as nonattainment because the areas violated the O

3

 standard during the period from 1987 through 1989 (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified
at 40 CFR 81.318.) 



The Owensboro and Edmonson County marginal O

3

 nonattainment areas (nonattainment areas) more recently have ambient monitoring data that show no violations of
the O

3

 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), during the period from 1989 through 1991. In addition, there have
been no violations reported for the 1992, 1993, or 1994 O

3

 seasons. Therefore, in an effort to comply with the amended CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on
November 13, 1992, the Cabinet submitted for parallel processing an O

3

 maintenance SIP for the nonattainment areas and requested redesignation of the nonattainment areas to attainment
with respect to the O

3

 NAAQS and EPA found the request complete. On November 24, 1992, the Cabinet submitted the Marginal Ozone Nonattainment
Areas Projection Inventory 1990-2004 as an amendment to the SIP. On January 15, 1993, the Cabinet submitted
revisions addressing public comments on the request to redesignate the nonattainment areas to attainment. On July
16, 1993, February 28, 1994, and August 29, 1994, the Cabinet submitted revisions to the redesignation request, maintenance
plan, and projection inventories. 

On May 7, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the Cabinet constituted a complete redesignation
request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes
of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify
when the Cabinet first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous
policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the amended CAA, including redesignation
submittals, would not be determined complete. See ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response
to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines,'' Memorandum from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X,
dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception
to the completeness criteria (40 CFR part 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates
for mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3-4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory
submittals under the CAA, EPA believed it appropriate to change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals
to conform to the existing completeness criteria (58 FR 38108 (July 15, 1993)). Therefore, EPA believes, the parallel
processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals, at least
until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception. The Cabinet submitted a redesignation request and a maintenance
plan on November 13, 1992. When the maintenance plan became state effective on January 27, 1994, the Commonwealth
of Kentucky no longer needed parallel processing for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. 

The Kentucky redesignation request for the nonattainment areas meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E)
for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the Commonwealth of Kentucky has fulfilled
each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA
will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request.

1. The Area Must Have Attained the O

3

 NAAQS 


The Cabinet's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which is relevant
to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar year 1989
through calendar year 1991 show an expected exceedance rate of less than 1.0 per year of the O

3

 NAAQS in the marginal nonattainment areas. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) In addition, there were no violations
reported for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 O

3

 seasons. Because the nonattainment areas have complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard
over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the areas have met the first statutory criterion of attainment
of the O

3

 NAAQS. The Commonwealth of Kentucky has committed to continue monitoring in the nonattainment areas in accordance
with 40 CFR 58. 


2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110, and Part D of the Act 


On January 25, 1980, August 7, 1981, November 24, 1981, 
November 30, 1981, and March 30, 1983, EPA fully approved Kentucky's SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2)
and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 6092, 46 FR 40188, 46 FR 57486, 46 FR 58080, and 48 FR 13168). The approved control strategy
did not result in attainment of NAAQS for O

3

. Additionally, the amended CAA revised section 182(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and
added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement
that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed the Kentucky SIP to ensure that it contains
all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted its redesignation
request. 


A. Section 110 Requirements 


Although section 110 was amended by the CAA of 1990, the Kentucky SIP for the marginal nonattainment areas meets the
requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore,
EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is
consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). 


B. Part D Requirements 


Before the nonattainment areas may be redesignated to attainment, they must have fulfilled the applicable requirements
of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1
of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well
as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Owensboro and Edmonson County nonattainment
areas were classified as marginal (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.318). The Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted
their request for redesignation of the marginal nonattainment areas prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order
to be redesignated to attainment, the Commonwealth of Kentucky must meet the applicable requirements of subpart
1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176, but is not required to meet the applicable requirements of subpart
2 of part D, which became due on or after November 15, 1992.

B1. Subpart 1 of Part D 


Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator, but no
later than three years after an area has been designated to nonattainment. EPA has not determined that these requirements
were applicable to O

3

 nonattainment areas on or before November 13, 1992, the date that the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted a complete
redesignation request for the marginal nonattainment areas. Therefore, the Commonwealth of Kentucky was not required
to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. The Owensboro and Edmonson County areas currently have
a fully approvable New Source Review (NSR) program which was last revised on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32343). Upon redesignation
of these areas to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of
title I are applicable. On January 25, 1978, September 1, 1989, November 6, 1989, November 13, 1989, November 28, 1989,
February 7, 1990, and June 23, 1994, the EPA approved revisions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky's PSD program (43 FR
3360, 54 FR 36307, 54 FR 46613, 54 FR 47211, 54 FR 488887, 55 FR 4169 and 59 FR 32343). 
Section 176(c) of the CAA requires states to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable state SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by states must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the state revisions to be submitted by November 15, 1992, one year after the date for promulgation of final
EPA conformity regulations which were due November 15, 1991. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's
General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed states that its conformity regulations would establish
a submittal date [see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)]. 
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both
transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance
plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section
51.851 of the general conformity rule, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is required to submit a SIP revision containing
transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November
25, 1994. Similarly, Kentucky is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures
consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadline for these submittals
has not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect
approval of this redesignation request. 
On February 24, 1994, the Commonwealth of Kentucky revised their maintenance plan to commit to revise the SIP by November
25, 1994, to be consistent with the final Federal regulations on conformity. In addition, the Division for Air Quality
and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet are cooperating in adopting regulations consistent with the final conformity
regulation. 


B2. Subpart 2 of Part D 


The CAA was amended on November 15, 1990, Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.
EPA was required to classify O

3

 nonattainment areas according to the severity of their problem. On November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694), the Owensboro and
Edmonson County metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) were designated as marginal O

3

 nonattainment. Because these areas are marginal, the areas must meet section 182(a) of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the
SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 182. Below is a summary of how the
area has met the requirements of these sections.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-0-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-0-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Emissions Inventory 
The CAA required an inventory of all actual emissions from all sources, as described in section 172(c)(3) by November
15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, the Cabinet submitted an emission inventory on the Owensboro and Edmonson County area.

(2) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) 
The CAA also amended section 182(a)(2)(A), in which Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that O

3

 nonattainment areas fix their deficient Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules for O

3

. Areas designated nonattainment before amendment of the CAA and which retained that designation and were classified
as marginal or above as of enactment are required to meet the RACT Fix-ups requirement. The Owensboro and Edmonson
County areas were not designated nonattainment prior to 1990 and were classified as marginal O

3

 nonattainment pursuant to the 1990 CAA. Therefore, these areas are not subject to the RACT fix-up requirement. However,
Kentucky chose to apply RACT on all major sources which commenced on or after the effective date of a particular RACT
rule. Kentucky submitted VOC RACT SIP revisions through the Cabinet to EPA on February 12, 1992, October 20, 1992,
February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993. Action was taken December 12, 1993, on the SIP revision submitted on February
12, 1992. Action was taken June 23, 1994, on the SIP revisions submitted on October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and
March 4, 1993. 
(3) Emissions Statements 
The CAA required that the SIP be revised by November 15, 1992, to require stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) and VOCs to provide the state with a statement showing actual emission each year. This request to redesignate was
submitted prior to the November 15, 1992 emissions statement deadline. Therefore, the emissions statement program
is not a requirement for the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas. 
(4) New Source Review (NSR) 
The CAA required all classified nonattainment areas to meet several requirements regarding NSR, including provisions
to ensure that increased emissions of VOCs compounds will not result from any new or major source modifications and
a general offset rule. A SIP revision incorporating these requirements was due November 15, 1992. This request to
redesignate was submitted prior to the November 15, 1992 NSR deadline. Therefore, the NSR program is not a requirement
for the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas. 


3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA 


Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended
CAA, EPA has determined that Kentucky has a fully approved O

3

 SIP under section 110(k) for the marginal nonattainment areas, which also meets the applicable requirements of section
110 and part D as discussed above. 


4. The Air Quality Improvement Must Be Permanent and Enforceable 


Several control measures have come into place since the nonattainment areas violated the O

3

 NAAQS. Of these control measures, the reduction of fuel volatility from 11.4 psi to 8.6 psi, as measured by the Reid
Vapor Pressure (RVP), and fleet turnover produced the most significant decreases in VOC emissions. The table below
summarizes total emissions for VOCs. The difference between 1988 and 1990 are actual permanent and enforceable emission
reductions which are responsible for the recent air quality improvement in the areas. The VOC emissions in the base
year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn. The technical support documents (TSD) contain additional
information on these reductions.

5. The Area Must Have a Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Pursuant to Section 175A of the CAA 


Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS or at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. 
In this notice, EPA is approving the Commonwealth of Kentucky's maintenance plan for the Owensboro and Edmonson County
marginal nonattainment areas because EPA finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal meets the requirements
of section 175A. 


A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory 


On November 13, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC, NO

X

, and CO emissions from the marginal nonattainment areas. The inventories included biogenic, area, stationary,
and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory is
considered representative of attainment conditions because the O

3

 NAAQS was not violated during 1990. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category.
This comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the SIP Air Pollutant Inventory Management System
(SAMS) format. Finally, this inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and
projected maintenance year inventories for the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas are included in this notice for
VOCs and NO

X

. The CO and the biogenic VOC values are shown below and are a part of the 1990 base year emission inventory. This notice
is approving the base year inventory. Refer to the TSD for more in-depth details regarding the base year inventory
for the marginal nonattainment areas. 











B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories 


Below, totals for VOC and NO

X

 emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to 2004. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance
with EPA guidance. Refer to EPA's TSD for more in-depth details regarding the projected inventory for the nonattainment
areas.

<TEXT>
 










As indicated in the following table, an emissions decrease in VOCs and NO

X

 in the Owensboro nonattainment area and an emissions decrease in NO

X

 in the Edmonson County nonattainment area are projected throughout the maintenance period. There is an increase
in VOC emissions in the Edmonson County nonattainment area. However, the emissions increase of 0.04 tpd is not expected
to affect maintenance of the O

3

 NAAQS in this rural area. EPA believes that these emissions projections demonstrate that the nonattainment areas
will continue to maintain the O

3

 NAAQS. 




C. Verification of Continued Attainment 


Continued attainment of the O

3

 NAAQS in the marginal nonattainment areas depend, in part, on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's efforts toward tracking
indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The Commonwealth of Kentucky's contingency
plan is triggered by two indicators, the emissions inventory for interim years exceeding the baseline emission inventory
by more than 10% or an air quality violation. As stated in the maintenance plan, the Cabinet will be developing these
emissions inventories every three years beginning in 1996. These periodic inventories will help to verify continued
attainment. Refer to the TSD for a more complete discussion of the indicators the Commonwealth is tracking and the
contingency measures.

D. Contingency Plan 


The level of VOC and NO

X

 emissions in the nonattainment areas will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the O

3

 NAAQS in the future. Despite the Commonwealth's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS,
the ambient air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, the Commonwealth of Kentucky
has provided contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future O

3

 air quality problem. The plan contains a contingency to implement RACT on existing major sources in the area where
the violation occurred within ninety (90) days. RACT was not required for these nonattainment areas because they
were designated marginal nonattainment pursuant to the CAA. A complete description of this contingency measure
and its trigger can be found in the TSD. EPA finds that the contingency measures provided in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's
submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA. 


E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 


In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has agreed to submit a revised maintenance
SIP eight years after the marginal nonattainment areas redesignate to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide
for maintenance for an additional ten years. 


Final Action 


In this final action, EPA is approving the nonattainment areas' O

3

 maintenance plan because it meets the requirements of section 175A. The EPA is redesignating the Owensboro and Edmonson
County nonattainment areas to attainment for O

3

 because the Commonwealth of Kentucky has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E)
for redesignation. In addition EPA is approving the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Owensboro and Edmonson
County nonattainment areas. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing
a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered
separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory
and regulatory requirements. 
The O

3

 SIP is designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the CAA and to provide for attainment and maintenance of the
O

3

 NAAQS. This final redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the Commonwealth of Kentucky to delete,
alter, or rescind any of the VOC or NO

X

 emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved O

3

 SIP. Changes to O

3

 SIP VOC regulations rendering them less stringent than those contained in the EPA approved plan cannot be made unless
a revised plan for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by EPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions,
and 
changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation (section 173(b) of the CAA) and in a SIP deficiency call
made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the CAA. 
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 

Federal Register

 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective January 3, 1995 unless, by December 5, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. 
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective January 3, 1995. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by January 3, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Tables 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements
on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any
regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request
will not affect a substantial number of small entities.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Removal of Direct final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 6, 1994, EPA published approval of a redesignation request and maintenance plan for the Huntington,
West Virginia Ozone Nonattainment Area (59 FR 45980). This action approved a maintenance plan for the area to assist
in maintaining the ozone standard and redesignated the Huntington, West Virginia area to attainment for ozone. The
intended effect of the action was to provide for continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS by means of a maintenance plan
and to reclassify the area to attainment. The effective data of this action was October 21, 1994. 


EPA approved this direct final rulemaking without prior proposal because the Agency viewed it as a noncontroversial
amendment and anticipated no adverse comments. The final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 with a provision for a 30 day comment period (59 FR 45980). At the same time, EPA announced that this final rule would
convert to a notice of proposed rule (NPR) (59 FR 46019) in the event that adverse comments were submitted to EPA within
30 days of publication of the rule in the 

Federal Register

. The effective date of this action has passed. 
Notice of intent to adversely comment was submitted to EPA within the prescribed comment period. Therefore, EPA is
rescinding the September 6, 1994, final rulemaking action. All public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent
rulemaking action based on the proposed rule entitled Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans
and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Redesignation of the Huntington, West Virginia Ozone
Nonattainment Area to Attainment and Approval of the Area's Maintenance Plan.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement a voluntary pilot program that will allow limited retention of undersized
swordfish, in excess of the trip allowance, for scientific purposes critical to proper stock assessment. Swordfish
so collected must be donated through the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network to needy individuals. The intended
effects are to obtain additional information regarding the harvest, mortality, and biological characteristics
of swordfish less than the minimum size, while investigating the potential for avoiding waste of swordfish that would
otherwise be discarded dead.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Atlantic swordfish fishery is managed under the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Swordfish and its
implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 630 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq.

) (Magnuson Act) and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA) (16 U.S.C. 971 

et seq.

). Regulations issued under the authority of the ATCA carry out the recommendations of the International Commission
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).

Background


In June 1991, NMFS implemented swordfish regulations, consistent with the ICCAT recommendations, that included
a minimum size limit of 41 lbs. (18.6 kg) dressed weight or 31 inches (78.7 cm) carcass length. The regulations include
a trip allowance for undersized swordfish in an amount not exceeding 15 percent of the total number of swordfish landed.
NMFS and the majority of the swordfish industry recognize the importance of minimizing the catch and mortality of
undersized swordfish and remain committed to that objective.
Although large swordfish are the preferred target of U.S. swordfish vessels, harvest of some undersized swordfish
is unavoidable in most cases. Under current regulations, undersized swordfish in excess of the trip allowance must
be discarded, despite the fact that many of these fish are dead prior to being brought aboard the vessel. This results
in waste of the resource. Further, if discards are not accurately reported, loss of information critical to proper
stock assessment, in general, and to evaluation of the minimum size limit, in particular, also occurs.
NMFS, in cooperation with Blue Water Fishermen's Association, other members of the swordfish industry, National
Fisheries Institute, and Second Harvest National Foodbank Network (Second Harvest), proposed implementing a pilot
program to address these issues. Under the pilot program, voluntary participants selected by NMFS will be allowed
to land, in excess of the 15 percent allowance, undersized swordfish that were dead prior to being brought aboard the
vessel. Reporting and marking requirements will ensure the integrity of the program. Undersized fish retained in
excess of the trip limit would be donated through Second Harvest to needy individuals.
At the November 1992 ICCAT meeting, the U.S. delegation discussed the proposed pilot program. It was agreed that the
program was consistent with current ICCAT recommendations for swordfish and that it would be useful for evaluating
the effectiveness of the minimum-size regulation. The United States will provide ICCAT with all data collected from
the program.
Second Harvest is a tax-exempt organization that solicits surplus products and distributes them through a network
of more than 45,000 qualified recipient organizations that provide food to millions of needy, ill, or infant Americans.
Further information is available from the 

Federal Register

 notice of the proposed rule on the Atlantic Swordfish Fishery (58 FR 68109, Dec. 23, 1993). This final rule makes some
modifications to the proposed rule. The modifications are made after consideration of public comments, to make the
responsibilities of program participants more clear and to ensure the enforceability of the regulations. These
minor modifications are explained in the Description of the Program section of this preamble. NMFS realizes that
there is a need to develop guidelines for donation programs for bycatch. A task force will be formed by NMFS to look into
this issue. Information obtained from this pilot study, and task force meetings will begin the process of addressing
NMFS standards for bycatch donation programs.


Program Objectives


1. Improve Scientific Information Regarding Catch, Mortality, Discard Rate, and Biological Characteristics of
Undersized Swordfish


The program will provide an alternative source of data for estimating discards in excess of the trip allowance for
undersized swordfish; discourage unreported discarding of dead undersized swordfish; and provide an opportunity
to obtain additional information (e.g., age, size, sex) about undersized swordfish. This is important in maintaining
catch per unit of effort indices for small swordfish, which are critical to ICCAT stock assessments.


2. Avoid Waste of a Valuable Resource


Dead fish that would have been discarded will be donated, through an organized, controlled program, to needy individuals.


3. Encourage Tagging and Release of All Live Undersized Swordfish by the Participants


The regulations require the owner or operator of a vessel to make a reasonable effort to tag and release live swordfish.
In addition, the regulations encourage the participants to tag small bluefin tuna, bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna,
and sharks when possible.

4. Implement the Program in a Manner That Will Not Jeopardize or Undermine the Broader Management Objective of Minimizing
the Mortality of Undersized Swordfish



The regulations implementing the program contain every practicable safeguard to ensure this. 



Description of the Program 



Non-profit 



Although participants will incur costs associated with donated fish (harvesters_handling and processing, dealers_storage,
Second Harvest_distribution), they will receive no direct economic benefit from landing and donating the undersized
swordfish. Any purchase, sale, trade, or barter of undersized swordfish in excess of a vessel's trip allowance for
undersized swordfish landed under the pilot program is prohibited. 



Selection Process 



NMFS will select participants (dealers and vessels) from among volunteers. Factors that will be considered in the
selection process include: (1) History of voluntary participation in NMFS cooperative scientific programs, e.g.,
tag and release, sea sampling, collection of biological samples; (2) whether both vessel and dealer volunteers can
be matched in an area throughout the year (including truck routes) to ensure distribution of donated fish; (3) representative
coverage of the fishery to the extent possible; and (4) possible exclusion from the program of vessels and dealers
with Magnuson Act, Lacey Act, or ATCA violations. Item (4) was expanded from the proposed rule, because NMFS does not
want participants in the program who have serious violations, but NMFS wants to retain discretionary authority to
include participants that have only minor violations. 



Scope of the Program 



The pilot program is divided into seven geographic regions: Gulf of Mexico, Florida East Coast, South Atlantic Bight,
Mid-Atlantic Bight, Northeast Coastal, Northeast Distant Waters, and Caribbean. Initial efforts will be directed
at establishing the program in the Gulf of Mexico region and then along the Atlantic seaboard. NMFS will select only
one or two vessels initially, with only six vessels selected in the first year. NMFS intends to have 100 percent observer
coverage of these vessels. After the logistics are worked out and any unforeseen problems are resolved, additional
vessels/regions will be gradually added during the second year until the pilot program is established in all seven
regions. Ultimately, two to four vessels and cooperating dealers will be selected to participate in each region.




Responsibilities of Participating Fishermen

<PARENT> FR941103-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A selection letter from NMFS, identifying the vessel as a participant in the program, is required to be maintained
aboard the vessel and made available for inspection. Non-participating vessels remain subject to the current limits
on the retention of undersized swordfish. Participants will be required to accommodate on board observers. 

Undersized swordfish that are dead when brought on board the vessel and that will be donated are required to be properly
prepared and stored. All live undersized swordfish to the extent possible must be tagged, released, and reported
to NMFS on logbook and tagging records. Participants are required to handle properly, record, and transfer to selected
dealers all undersized swordfish in excess of the trip allowance, i.e., such swordfish or parts thereof may not be
retained for the crew, purchased, sold, bartered, traded, or given to anyone other than a selected dealer for transfer
to an authorized recipient (Second Harvest). 

The vessel owner or operator is required to notify the NMFS Office of Enforcement, at the phone number listed in the
selection letter, and the dealer, 24 hours in advance, or as otherwise specified by NMFS, of landing information,
including date, approximate time, location, and estimated number of fish to be donated. Specific instructions will
be provided by NMFS to address logistics and to facilitate shorter notification in areas where the fishing grounds,
such as the Florida Straits, are close to the landing locations. The advance notification and landing requirements
were modified from the proposed rule to allow better enforcement and tracking of the donated swordfish. 

The vessel owner or operator, prior to offloading, must tag donated swordfish with individually numbered tags provided
by NMFS. Dealers may specify more than one facility where they expect to off-load vessels in the program. All fish must
be in whole or dressed form through off-loading, and all swordfish from a vessel's trip must be off-loaded at the same
facility. A list of selected dealers will be provided by NMFS to participating vessels. 
The individual carcass weights of all donated fish must be clearly indicated, using a NMFS-specified code, on the
tally (weigh-out) sheets that must be submitted to NMFS, as specified in the current regulations. 

Transfer of swordfish between vessels is prohibited, as currently specified in the regulations. 



Responsibilities of Participating Dealers 



A selection letter from NMFS, identifying the dealer as a participant in the program, must be maintained at the dealer's
place of business and be made available for inspection. 

Donated swordfish may be received only from vessels selected by NMFS. A list of selected vessels will be provided by
NMFS to participating dealers. 

Dealers are responsible for weighing all undersized swordfish to be donated and recording the individual carcass
weights, using a NMFS-specified code, on the dealer reports currently required. Information regarding vessel and
dealer identification and the date that fish were received must be included on those reports. Reports must be submitted
twice monthly to NMFS, as currently required by the regulations. 

Swordfish for donation must be separated from swordfish eligible for sale and maintained without removal of the donation
tag. 

The dealer is required to obtain a bill of lading from Second Harvest, its affiliate, or agent for all swordfish donated.
A copy of the bill of lading and weigh-out sheet must be submitted to the vessel that landed the swordfish (along with
normal dealer weigh-out/trip settlement sheets). The types of forms to be used are more specific than indicated in
the proposed rule, but no additional forms have been required. 



Responsibilities of Second Harvest 



Donated swordfish or any part thereof cannot be purchased, sold, bartered, or traded. 

Donated swordfish must be made available for use as soon as possible to ensure the greatest freshness and palatability.


Second Harvest, its affiliates or agents, assume responsibility for donated swordfish upon receipt from the dealer,
including transportation, quality control of product, processing, and distribution to the needy.

<PARENT> FR941103-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Transportation is to be provided by Second Harvest to ensure timely collection and distribution of donated swordfish.


Upon pickup of swordfish, Second Harvest, its affiliate or agent must provide dealers with bills of lading that include,
or have attached, the names and permit numbers of fishing vessels and dealers involved in donating the swordfish,
date of pickup, and tag number with individual carcass weight of each swordfish received. Second Harvest, its affiliates,
or agents must provide copies of bills of lading with attachments to Second Harvest headquarters, which will provide
duplicate copies to NMFS. 

Second Harvest's affiliates or agents are responsible for distributing donated swordfish to local charities, which
will process and prepare the swordfish for consumption by needy individuals. During discussions with Second Harvest
representatives on processing and preparation, the matter of liability was considered. No modification was necessary
in this final rule because the Good Samaritan laws in each state adequately cover the issue. 



Implementation 



The pilot program could continue for 2 years, subject to review and evaluation. NMFS will monitor the program and prepare
an annual report evaluating the results. Results from this study will be presented to ICCAT. If the program is achieving
its purposes, and there is concurrence from ICCAT, the program could be continued beyond 2 years. If the program is
not achieving its purpose or is no longer in conformance with the recommendations of ICCAT, NMFS will terminate the
program. 



Comments and Responses 





Comment 1:

 This program would provide the industry and NMFS data on the real numbers of live and dead fish caught, which are needed
to manage the fishery. At the same time, the program would feed the hungry children of our Nation while not changing
the catch or the quota. 



Response:

 NMFS agrees. Current estimates of the mortality for fish hooked on longline are from observation data that 70 percent
of hooked fish are dead when brought alongside the vessel. This pilot program provides that all small swordfish brought
alongside must either be tagged and released alive, landed dead as part of the 15 percent tolerance, or tagged dead
for transfer to Second Harvest. This ensures that accurate information will be collected on live and dead small swordfish,
with accurate length frequency data on all swordfish less than the minimum size. In addition, this program will increase
the number of tagged and released small fish that potentially can provide more information on the growth and movement
of small swordfish. 



Comment 2:

 This program would provide much-needed protein to the needy. Food banks are always short of nutritious, high-protein
foods. While this small pilot program would only supply a small amount against a tremendous need, it would make a difference.




Response:

 If current estimates of catch, tolerance, number of discards, and average weights are correct, the pilot program
in full operation could supply the Second Harvest network about 42,000 lbs. (19.05 metric tons) landed weight per
year. 



Comment 3:

 This is a good, small-scale program to be closely monitored by NMFS that would deal with the problem of dead bycatch.
It would serve as an excellent pilot, because if it is abused NMFS has the authority to terminate the program. 



Response:

 NMFS agrees. 



Comment 4:

 This project would promote understanding of the benefits of fish to the needy, who currently underutilize fish as
a protein source. At the same time, it would not change the number of swordfish caught or killed, only the number of dead
swordfish thrown overboard. 



Response:

 Second Harvest is working closely with NMFS on this program; every opportunity will be taken to promote the benefits
of seafood consumption. Further, every effort has been made in the final rule to ensure that only those fish already
dead will be retained for contribution to the Second Harvest. 



Comment 5:

 Placing requirements on times and locations of landings will reduce the number of volunteers who are willing to participate
in the pilot program. 



Response:

 The landing requirements will be examined in the pilot program along with other aspects of the process. Provisions
in the final rule allow the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries to modify landing requirements after consultation
with the industry and law enforcement officials.

Comment 6: 

Observers must be placed on all participating vessels to ensure that the vessels' crews comply with the provisions
of the pilot program. 


Response:

 NMFS intends to have 100 percent observer coverage on the vessels the first year and then evaluate whether 100 percent
coverage is necessary for the entire pilot study. 


Comment 7:

 NMFS must ensure that this pilot program is not used as an excuse to violate tolerance laws. 


Response:

 In the final rule, landing restrictions, record keeping requirements, selection of participants, and enforcement
are all used to help ensure against abuse of the tolerance regulations. In addition, as previously stated, the participating
vessels are required to notify NMFS Enforcement 24 hours prior to each landing of the expected time and location of
arrival. 


Comment 8:

 This program is not necessary for swordfish management. 


Response:

 ICCAT has sanctioned this program as part of its overall international research program. Reliable data on small fish
are necessary to manage Atlantic swordfish adequately. Knowledge of stock distribution will have wide implications
for stock analysis and future management options. Increased tagging of live fish and their subsequent recovery,
with all the analytical implications, will benefit the NMFS pelagic tagging program, management decisions (e.g.,
information for possible time/area closures), and the ICCAT statistical data base. This program also can help fulfill
a social need, and provides a logical disposition of the specimens taken for scientific purposes. 


Comment 9:

 Indirect economic benefit will accrue through tax advantages; NMFS must ensure against economic motive for killing
small swordfish. 


Response:

 Information from IRS indicates that this is not a problem because in general the fishermen will not get any additional
tax benefit beyond that which already exists. 


Comment 10:

 In order for this program to work, NMFS must provide enough enforcement to overcome the incentive to kill small juveniles.
Small swordfish will be killed to ``high-grade'' the 15 percent tolerance on participating pilot program vessels.



Response:

 The final rule specifically forbids killing small juveniles, and requires that all participating vessels notify
enforcement 24 hours prior to landing. All live fish less than the minimum size must be tagged and released alive by
participating vessels. Some ``high-grading'' may occur, but it will be no more than current regulations allow, since
all donated dead fish less than the minimum size must be tagged prior to landing and weigh-out. The regulations specifically
prohibit the removal of a donation tag; vessel owners or operators must account for all tags.

Comment 11: 

This program would divert scarce resources from NMFS Highly Migratory Species (HMS) program's more urgent needs.



Response: 

Data collection and analysis of any kind require an investment of program resources. For the HMS Division, the requirements
of collecting the data and giving the specimens to the needy take no more effort than collecting the data and disposing
of the specimens after the data are collected. 


Comment 12: 

NMFS must address Executive Order 12898 to insure that minorities will not be adversely affected by mercury contamination
of swordfish. 


Response: 

Mercury is cumulative with size and age in swordfish. The Food and Drug Administration has set 1.0 parts per million
(ppm) as the action level for methyl mercury in fish products. Swordfish at the minimum size and lower test in the 0.2
ppm to 0.6 ppm range. Based on available data, swordfish consumed through charitable programs will not result in a
contamination problem. Additionally, NMFS will test for methyl mercury levels in donated swordfish each semester
throughout the first year. 


Comment 13: 

This pilot program would take away any incentive for longline fishermen to reduce the incidence of juvenile swordfish
being hooked and killed. 


Response: 

The pilot program volunteers will encompass less than 3 percent of the longline fleet when fully in operation. Restrictions
and requirements are included in the program to prevent any increase in juvenile swordfish mortality beyond what
would have occurred without the program. 


Changes From the Proposed Rule 


Changes in this final rule from the proposed rule include some operational changes. The responsibility for tagging
donated fish now rests with the owner or operator of the volunteer vessel, and all donated fish must be tagged prior
to offloading. Volunteer vessel owners or operators must notify NMFS enforcement 24 hours prior to landing and offloading
the donated fish. NMFS plans in the first year of operation to place observers on all participating vessels. The number
of vessels selected in the first year is not expected to exceed six vessels. Volunteer vessels who have been issued
a Notice of Violation and Assessment may be excluded from the program. All unused tags must be accounted for by the vessels
owners or operators. In addition to operational changes some minor changes were made in wording of the text to make
the meaning of certain passages more clear. 


Classification 


This final rule is published under the authority of the ATCA. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA),
has preliminarily determined that this final rule is consistent with the recommendations of ICCAT and is necessary
for management of the Atlantic swordfish fishery. 
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
This final rule contains four new collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act,
specifically, application to participate in the donation program, 24-hour advance notice of landing donated swordfish,
tagging and reporting of undersized fish for voluntary participants, and submission of bills of lading and landing
receipts by Second Harvest headquarters to dealers and to NMFS. The public reporting burdens for these collections
of information are estimated to average 10, 3, 2, and 15 minutes, respectively, per response, including the time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing
and reviewing the collections of information. Requests to collect this information have been approved by OMB (OMB
Control number 0648-0277). This final rule also involves three collections of information subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act that have previously been approved by OMB, specifically, fishing vessel reports (OMB Control Number
0648-0016), dealer reports (OMB Control Number 0648-0013), and tagging requirements (OMB Control Number
0648-0247). The public reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 6,
30, and 2 minutes, respectively, per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information.
Send comments regarding burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions
for reducing the burdens, to NMFS or OMB (see

 630.50

 Purpose. 


This subpart implements a program under which swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock that are retained
in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish specified in  630.23(b) must be retained for donation
through the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network to the needy. This program is intended to obtain additional
information regarding the harvest, mortality, and biological characteristics of swordfish less than the minimum
size limit and to avoid waste of swordfish that would otherwise be discarded dead. 


 630.51 

Participation. 


(a) 

General. 

Owners of vessels and dealers permitted under  630.4 may volunteer to participate in the swordfish donation
program by contacting the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management,
NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; telephone: (301) 713-2347, facsimile (301) 588-4967.
The Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, will select owners of vessels and dealers who may participate in the
donation program and will keep selected vessel owners advised of the selected dealers. 
(1) Factors that will be considered in the selection process include: 
(i) History of voluntary participation in NMFS cooperative scientific programs; 
(ii) Whether both vessel and dealer volunteers can be matched in an area throughout the year (including truck routes)
to ensure distribution of donated fish; 
(iii) Representative coverage of the fishery, to the extent possible; and 
(iv) Compliance record of volunteers. Specifically, any person who has been issued a Notice of Violation and Assessment
(NOVA) for violating any provision of the Magnuson Act (16 U.S.C. 1802 

et seq.

), the Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3371 

et seq.

), or the ATCA (16 U.S.C. 971 

et seq.

), or who is currently under investigation for such a violation, may be excluded from the program. 
(2) Selected dealers will also be advised of the selected vessel owners and of authorized Second Harvest recipients
of donated swordfish.

(3) Second Harvest is the Second Harvest National Foodbank Network, 116 South Michigan Avenue, Suite 4, Chicago,
IL 60603-6001. Second Harvest affiliates are Certified Affiliate Food Banks throughout the United States
that have a contract with Second Harvest and are officially part of their National Foodbank Network. Agents of Second
Harvest are the individual charities that distribute or serve food to the needy from the Affiliate Food Banks, or a
business designated by letter from Second Harvest to transport donated food between the foodbank and the charity.
(b) 

Vessels.

 The owner, or their operator, of a vessel that has been selected to participate in the donation program and so notified
in writing by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, may retain swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish
stock that are in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish specified in  630.23(b) under the following
terms and conditions. No person may land a swordfish in excess of the trip allowance for undersized swordfish other
than in accordance with these terms and conditions; any such landing constitutes a violation of the prohibition specified
in  630.7(q).
(1) The vessel's selection letter from the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division, must be carried on board the
fishing vessel and the operator must present it for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer.
(2) The vessel's owner or operator must release any swordfish that is less than the minimum allowable size specified
in  630.23(a) and that is alive when brought aboard the vessel, in a manner that will ensure maximum probability
of survival. If caught by hook, such fish must be released by cutting the line near the hook without removing the swordfish
from the water. The owner or operator must make a reasonable effort to tag each swordfish released under this paragraph
(b)(2). In addition, participants are encouraged to tag all released small bluefin tuna, big eye tuna, yellowfin
tuna and sharks where possible. Tags will be provided by the Science and Research Director. A record of each tag and
release must be maintained and submitted to the Science and Research Director on forms provided with the tags.
(3) The vessel's owner or operator must retain any swordfish that is dead when brought aboard the vessel.
(4) The vessel's owner or operator must tag any swordfish that is retained under the donation program of this subpart
prior to its off-loading from a vessel at the facility of a selected dealer, using a non-reusable, individually numbered
donation tag provided by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division. The donation tag is not to be removed by the
vessel crew, dealer, or Second Harvest until the carcass is processed.
(5) All tags assigned to a vessel by NMFS Highly Migratory Species Division, used or unused, must be accounted for by
the owner/operator at the request of any authorized officer.
(6) The vessel's owner or operator must off-load any swordfish that is retained under the donation program of this
subpart only at a specified facility of a dealer who has been selected by the Chief, Highly Migratory Species Division,
to participate in the donation program. Off-loading must begin between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. local time. An
owner or operator must notify the Chief, NMFS Office of Enforcement, by telephone at numbers given in the vessel owner's
selection letter, and a selected dealer, at least 24 hours prior to off-loading swordfish under the donation program,
unless stated otherwise in the vessel owner's selection letter.
(7) The Assistant Administrator, upon consulting with industry representatives and NMFS Office of Enforcement,
may change the requirements for off-loading by notification in the 

Federal Register

.
(8) All swordfish harvested during a trip by a vessel participating in this pilot program must be off-loaded at the
same facility to a dealer participating in this donation program.
(9) No vessel owner or operator may sell, trade, or barter, or attempt to sell, trade, or barter, any swordfish or any
part thereof that is retained under the donation program of this subpart.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except
for directed fishing for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to
directed fishing for pollock. This action is necessary because the 1994 Pacific halibut prohibited species catch
(PSC) limit for trawl gear in the GOA has been caught.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan
for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing
the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


The final 1994 initial specifications for the GOA (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) established the 1994 Pacific halibut
PSC limit for vessels using trawl gear at 2,000 metric tons (mt).
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(i), that vessels engaged
in directed fishing for groundfish with trawl gear in the GOA have caught the 1994 Pacific halibut PSC limit. Therefore,
NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for groundfish by vessels using trawl gear in the GOA, except for directed fishing
for pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for
pollock. This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October 29, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31,
1994.

Atlantic Shark Fisheries


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the closure of the Federal commercial fishery for large coastal sharks in the Western North Atlantic
Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the semiannual
quota for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP)
for Atlantic Sharks under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 

et

 

seq

.). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678.


Section 678.23(b)(1)(i) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested
from Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico waters by commercial fishermen. The second semiannual quota is available
for harvest from July 1 through December 31, 1994.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), is required under  678.24 to monitor the catch and landing
statistics and, on the basis of these statistics, to determine when the catch of Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico
sharks will equal any quota under  678.23(b)(1). When shark harvests reach, or are projected to reach, a quota
established under  678.23(b)(1), the AA is further required under  678.24 to close the fishery.
The AA has determined, based on the reported catch and other relevant factors, that the semiannual quota for the period
July 1 through December 31, 1994, for large coastal sharks, in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including
the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, will be attained by the closure date. After 11:30 p.m. on November 4, 1994, for
vessels issued a permit under  678.4, possession of large coastal sharks from the management unit is prohibited,
unless the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat, in which case the vessel limit per trip is four large
coastal sharks. However, the sale, purchase, trade, or barter or attempted sale, purchase, trade, or barter, of carcasses
and/or fins of large coastal sharks harvested by a person aboard a vessel that has been issued a permit under  678.4(a)(4),
is prohibited, except for those sharks that were harvested, offloaded, and sold, traded, or bartered prior to the
closure, and were held in storage by a dealer or processor.
Vessels that have been issued a Federal permit under  678.4 are reminded that, as a condition of permit issuance,
the vessel may not retain a large coastal shark during the closure, regardless of where harvested, except as provided
by  678.24(a)(2). Fishing for pelagic and small coastal sharks may continue. The recreational fishery is not
affected by this closure.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 RSPA is amending certain requirements for the manufacture, qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles.
These regulatory actions are based on petitions for rulemaking, exemptions, National Transportation Safety Board
recommendations, and RSPA initiative. The intended effect of these actions is to relax certain regulatory requirements
and to reduce unnecessary economic burdens on industry where there will be no adverse effect on safety.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


On March 3, 1993, RSPA published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) [Docket No. HM-183C; Notice No. 93-7; 58 FR 12316] proposing to
amend certain requirements for the manufacture, qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles. Most
issues raised in the NPRM relate to requirements that were adopted in final rules published under Docket No. HM-183/HM-183A
(June 12, 1989, 54 FR 24982; May 22, 1990, 55 FR 21035; September 7, 1990, 55 FR 37028; June 17, 1991, 56 FR 27872). The
final rules established three new cargo tank specifications designated as DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412, and revised
the structural design requirements for MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks. Voluntary compliance for manufacture of cargo
tanks to these new or revised specifications was authorized beginning on October 1, 1990. 
As manufacturers began modifying their manufacturing operations to construct cargo tanks to the new requirements,
they encountered certain technical problems which caused them to question changes they had endorsed several years
ago. They raised issues relating to structural integrity, accident damage protection, use of dual function pressure
relief devices, and certification by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Also RSPA received several
petitions for rulemaking addressing certain issues not previously raised. In the NPRM, RSPA pointed out these concerns
and other issues based on petitions for rulemaking, exemptions, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
recommendations. The NPRM also announced a public meeting that was held in Chicago on March 24 and 25, 1993, to address
issues raised in the NPRM. 
On March 8, 1993, RSPA published a final rule [Docket HM-183, 58 FR 12904] granting an extension until April 21,
1994, for the continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications.
This action was granted to allow additional time for RSPA and industry to address certain technical issues concerning
the manufacture of cargo tank motor vehicles to the DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications, and to resolve certain
concerns about the structural design requirements in the MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. 
At the March 24-25 public meeting, several significantly different views of design engineers and cargo tank
manufacturers were identified. Additionally, preliminary results were presented of an advanced structural evaluation
(using finite element analysis) of the MC 331 cargo tank which raised questions in regard to stress levels in areas
of concentrated loadings. 
On January 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule [Docket HM-183, 58 FR 1784] granting another extension until
August 31, 1995, for continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC specifications. The final rule
also announced a public meeting in Washington, D.C. on February 7-8, 1994. 
At the February public meeting, RSPA obtained clarification of certain comments received in response to the NPRM
and also obtained additional supporting data on certain alternate proposals offered by industry. In addition, RSPA
sought information to resolve the remaining issues on structural integrity, accident damage protection, use of
dual function pressure relief devices, and ASME certification of low pressure cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturers.



II. Summary of Comments 


RSPA received over 50 written comments in response to the proposals contained in the NPRM from trade associations,
cargo tank manufacturers and repairers, manufacturers of cargo tank parts and equipment, and Federal, State and
local agencies. RSPA has considered all comments, public meeting transcripts and petitions in the development of
this final rule.

In the NPRM, RSPA informed industry that the following items would be open for discussion at the March public meeting:

1. Application of the ASME Code to DOT 400-series specification cargo tank motor vehicles. 
a. The feasibility of citing all sections of the ASME Code that must be met in construction of DOT specification cargo
tank motor vehicles as opposed to citing only those sections that do not apply. 
b. The development of a consensus standard containing procedures for quality control, welding and design as an alternative
to the procedures contained in the ASME Code. 
2. The progress of the industry on development and testing of dual function vents, reclosing pressure relief devices
capable of reseating with the loss of less than one gallon of lading, and self-closing systems for vacuum-loaded hazardous
waste tanks. 
3. The regulatory proposals contained in the NPRM. 
Most commenters supported application of the ASME Code. One commenter stated that his company, which had initially
opposed becoming ASME certified, has benefited from the expertise of the National Board inspector. 
The ASME Code is an internationally recognized consensus standard for the design and construction of pressure vessels.
It is also the only proven quality control standard for pressure vessels and cargo tanks. 
The Cargo Tank Manufacturing Association (CTMA) submitted a draft quality control manual for review. CTMA recommended
that RSPA recognize the manual, which includes quality control procedures, as an alternative to requiring manufacturers
to have an ASME ``U'' stamp or National Board ``R'' stamp. The use of the alternative standard recommended by CTMA is
not equivalent in scope and detail to the ASME Code and is not included in this final rule. 
It has also been brought to RSPA's attention that some ``U'' stamp and ``R'' stamp holders may believe they are not required
to apply all provisions of the ASME or National Board quality control program for work on non-ASME DOT specification
cargo tanks. When the regulations requiring cargo tank manufacturers and repair facilities to hold ``U'' and ``R''
stamps were promulgated, RSPA stated in the preamble discussions of the final rules and at public meetings that major
provisions of the ASME or National Board quality control programs would apply to all work on DOT specification cargo
tanks. Such provisions include welder qualifications, welding techniques, and quality control procedures. For
instance, refer to the preamble discussions in the following final rules: ``B. Cargo Tank: Manufacturer Qualification,
Registration, Quality Control, and Certification,'' (June 12, 1989, 54 FR 24984); ``Section 180.413 (Repair, Modification,
Stretching, and Rebarrelling),'' (September 7, 1990, 55 FR 37044).

One commenter stated that specifying all applicable sections of the ASME Code, rather than providing exceptions
to sections that are not applicable, would provide greater assurance to engineers and designers that they have not
overlooked an obscure section of the ASME Code. The commenter did not provide RSPA with any suggested wording for implementation
of the recommendation. 
The National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) submitted a report on the structural integrity of the MC 331 specification
cargo tank. NPGA recommended uniformity in design loading requirements for all DOT specification cargo tanks. RSPA
will consider the design loading requirements for MC 331 and MC 338 specification cargo tanks in a future rulemaking.
The report is available for review in the public docket. 


III. Section-by-Section Review 


This review by section discusses only significant comments received to the proposals in the NPRM, changes made based
on alternative proposals offered by commenters, and clarifications to certain provisions based on RSPA's initiatives.
For those provisions that are adopted as proposed, readers are referred to the preamble discussion in the NPRM. 


Section 171.7


The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) submitted a petition for rulemaking (P-1236) requesting
RSPA to incorporate by reference the latest editions of the ASME Code from the 1986 Edition and Addenda through 1985
to the 1992 edition and Addenda through 1993, and to update the National Board inspection Code from the 1983 Edition
to the 1992 Edition. RSPA has reviewed these updated standards and agrees the latest editions should be referenced.
The table in paragraph (a)(3) has been revised accordingly. 



Section 173.33 


Consistent with changes made in  180.405(h) in this final rule, a new sentence is added to paragraph (d) stating
that the venting requirements of the original DOT cargo tank specification must be met whenever a pressure relief
valve is modified to a more recent specification. See preamble discussion for  180.405(h). Similarly, in view
of changes made in   178.337-11 and 178.338-11 in this final rule, a new paragraph (h) is added
to inform shippers that certain MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks manufactured after August 31, 1995, must have remotely
controlled, internal, self-closing stop valves. See preamble discussion for  178.337-11. 


Section 173.225 


Commenters supported the proposal to revise paragraph (e)(2) to authorize the use of MC 307 and DOT 407 cargo tank motor
vehicles for certain organic peroxides. However, one commenter opposed allowing the use of MC 307 cargo tanks for
all organic peroxides. This commenter misunderstood the proposal. Note 14 to the  173.225(b) Table authorizes
bulk packagings for only a few organic peroxides. Therefore, paragraph (e)(2) is adopted as proposed in the NPRM.



Section 173.315 


For cargo tank motor vehicles in chlorine service, changes in requirements for hose, piping or tubing to be carried
on the vehicle and in requirements for testing angle valves, as proposed in the NPRM, are adopted as paragraphs (o)(1)
and (o)(2) respectively. 


Section 178.337-1 


Paragraphs (a)(3) and (e)(1) are revised to correct certain section references and paragraph (e)(2) is revised to
authorize the use of ceramic fiber/fiberglass insulation for cargo tanks in chlorine service as proposed in the NPRM.



Section 178.337-9


As proposed in the NPRM, the restriction is removed against mounting or carrying on a cargo tank motor vehicle any hose,
piping or tubing used in loading or unloading; paragraphs (b)(7) (ii) and (iii) are redesignated as (b)(7) (i) and
(ii) respectively. 


Section 178.337-11 


In response to NTSB recommendation H-90-91 dealing with release of sulfur dioxide from an MC 331 cargo
tank during unloading, RSPA proposed revision of requirements for remotely controlled self-closing stop valves
on liquid or vapor discharge lines on newly constructed MC 331 cargo tank motor vehicles. Currently found at paragraph
(a)(2), this requirement applies only to equipment intended for transportation of a flammable liquid, a flammable
compressed gas, hydrogen chloride (refrigerated liquid) or anhydrous ammonia. RSPA proposed to broaden the requirement
to include all compressed gases. This revision also was proposed for MC 338 cargo tanks. 
Both the NTSB and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) commented on RSPA's proposal to require remotely controlled
internal self-closing stop valves. While supportive of RSPA's proposal, NTSB stated:


 

Although the Safety Board is aware that MC 331 cargo tanks are predominantly used for the transportation of flammable
and nonflammable compressed gases, the hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR Parts 171 through 180) do authorize
these tanks to be used for the transportation of other classes of hazardous materials such as flammable liquids and
poisons. The Safety Board believes that remote controls for internal shut-off valves should be required for any hazardous
material that is authorized to be transported in an MC 331 cargo tank. Further the Safety Board believes that all MC
331 and MC 338 cargo tanks currently in hazardous materials service, and not just newly constructed tanks, should
also be equipped with remote controls for the internal shut-off valves. The Safety Board has consistently urged the
DOT to eliminate ``grandfathering'' clauses that permit hazardous materials to be transported indefinitely in
containers or vehicles that fail to meet current minimum safety standards. The Safety Board believes that RSPA should
require all MC 331 and MC 338 highway cargo tanks in hazardous materials service to be equipped with remote controls
for internal shut-off valves by a specific date. 



On the other hand, the CGA believes that remotely controlled shut-off valves should not be required for nonflammable
ladings. CGA stated that ``operating experience for the nonflammable compressed gases does not warrant the addition
of this restriction which would add cost without providing additional safety benefit.''

After consideration of both comments, RSPA has revised the wording in   178.337-11 and 178.338-11
to require the use of remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valves on any cargo tank motor vehicle certified
after August 31, 1995, that is intended for the transportation of hazardous materials other than argon, carbon dioxide,
helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, and xenon. RSPA has excepted these particular gases because they pose a lesser degree
of risk to public health, safety, and the environment in the event of their release during transportation. Many of
the nonflammable refrigerant gases presently transported in cargo tanks are ozone depleters; some other nonflammable
gases are toxic or noxious. RSPA will address the retrofit of existing cargo tanks with remotely controlled internal
self-closing stop valves in a separate rulemaking action. 



Section 178.338-9



As proposed in the NPRM and adopted in this final rule, paragraph (c)(2) is amended by removing the definition of ``same
design'' and by adding a reference to the definition of ``same design'' contained in  178.320. By referencing
the definition in  178.320, minor design variations are allowed for MC 338 cargo tanks. 



Section 178.338-11



NTSB and CGA submitted comments to this section which were similar to their comments to proposed  178.337-11.
As stated in the preamble discussion to  178.337-11 above, RSPA has revised the wording in   178.337-11
and 178.338-11 to require the use of remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valves on any MC 338 cargo
tank motor vehicle certified after August 31, 1995, that is intended for the transportation of hazardous materials
other than argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, and xenon. 



Section 178.345-1



In paragraph (c), definitions for ``normal operating loading'' and ``extreme dynamic loading'' are added. These
terms are used in revised  178.345-3 in this final rule. 

Paragraph (i)(2) requires that the void space within the connecting structure of a cargo tank motor vehicle composed
of multiple cargo tanks must be vented to the atmosphere by a drain of at least 1 inch in diameter. In the NPRM, RSPA proposed
to remove the drain hole size restriction. RSPA also solicited information on suitable dimensional controls for
these drains, how often these areas need to be inspected, the conditions revealed during such inspections, and the
availability of equipment for inspecting these areas. 

Commenters expressed diverse views on the need to inspect these areas. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) strongly
supported the need for periodic inspection of the connecting structures on cargo tanks used to transport all hazardous
materials. CHP related information about three separate catastrophic failures of molten sulfur trailers that occurred
due to fatigue cracking in the void space. All three cargo tank motor vehicles had been insulated, thus preventing
any external visual inspection for shell cracks. CHP believes that if an internal visual inspection of the void space
had been performed, evidence of cracking may have been detected prior to the catastrophic failures. CHP noted that
equipment, such as fiber optics, borescopes and video cameras, is readily available for inspecting closed areas
and is being used for pipeline, aircraft, oil well, and boiler inspections. Also, numerous contractors offering
inspection and non-destructive testing services are available throughout the U.S. 

NTSB also concurred that regular and effective inspections of void spaces are essential. NTSB, however, expressed
concern that HM-183C did not address the configuration of other appurtenances that could conceal corrosion
that might lead to a failure of the tank wall. The NTSB recommendation H-83-30 called for periodic external
visual inspection of surfaces obscured by appurtenances, structural members, etc. 

Several commenters who opposed inspecting these areas stated that double bulkheads and void spaces on MC 306 or DOT
406 cargo tanks in non-corrosive service do not experience the same degree of deterioration as MC 312 or DOT 412 cargo
tanks in corrosive service. They stated that cargo tanks in non-corrosive service should not be subject to the same
inspections. One commenter submitted to RSPA samples taken from bulkheads adjacent to void spaces of two scrapped
MC 306 carbon steel cargo tanks used in gasoline service for 14 and 15 years. The commenter stated that neither tank
showed evidence of corrosion at this location; the samples confirm this statement.

TTMA stated there is little possibility of corrosion occurring in the void space of any tank, except on carbon steel
cargo tanks in corrosive service. TTMA recommended that the connecting structure on self-supporting cargo tanks
be thickness tested every two years for signs of corrosion. Several other commenters supported TTMA's comments.
One commenter also suggested that the wording be revised to eliminate reference to the inspection opening but continue
to provide for a drain. The commenter stated that the minimum acceptable size of any drain opening should be 0.5 inches
diameter, which is large enough to insert a borescope or equivalent device. 

RSPA agrees with commenters that there has been no evidence of corrosion occurring in the void space of any tank, except
a carbon steel cargo tank in corrosive service. Corrosion in connecting spaces has serious structural implications
for self-supporting cargo tanks. The failure reported in the NTSB investigative report, containing recommendation
H-83-30, involved a carbon steel MC 312 cargo tank semi-trailer carrying hydrochloric acid; the failure
occurred due to severe corrosion in the tank shell under a circumferential reinforcing ring. Therefore, paragraph
(i)(2) is revised to require that the connecting structure in a carbon steel, self-supporting multi-tank cargo tank
motor vehicle must have a single drain of at least 1.0 inch diameter, or two or more drains of at least 0.5 inches diameter,
6 inches apart, one of which is located on the bottom centerline. In addition,  180.407(i) is revised to require
thickness testing of these areas as suggested by TTMA. 

RSPA believes that NTSB recommendation H-83-30, which calls for periodic external visual inspection
of cargo tank surfaces obscured by appurtenances and structural attachments, is adequately addressed in current
 180.407(d). Paragraph (d) requires that a periodic external visual inspection must be conducted of all major
appurtenances and structural attachments on a cargo tank to detect signs of corrosion or damage. 



Section 178.345-3



Commenters expressed concern over the lack of flexibility in calculating compressive stresses for non-ASME DOT
400-series cargo tanks. They recommended that RSPA provide alternatives to ASME Code Section VIII, Division 1 UG-23(b)
for calculating the maximum allowable compressive buckling stress in tank walls for low pressure cargo tanks. The
static design and construction of all DOT 400-series cargo tanks must be in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME
Code. Any DOT 400-series cargo tank which is required to be certified to the ASME Code also must be designed in accordance
with the Code's requirements for dynamic loading, including UG-23(b). This applies to DOT 407 cargo tanks with
a MAWP greater than 35 psig and each tank designed to be loaded by vacuum, and to DOT 412 cargo tanks having a MAWP greater
than 15 psig. 

TTMA stated manufacturers believe the requirements in  178.345-3(b) should be modified to allow several
methods of analysis as appropriate for the cargo tank under consideration. Using the methods outlined in the ASME
Code produces lower allowable compressive stress values, resulting in substantially thicker sheets for the DOT
400-series tanks as compared with the MC 300-series cargo tanks.

One commenter stated that while the UG-23(b) calculations may be appropriate for DOT 407 cargo tank with MAWP
ratings between 25 and 35 psig, this formula will rarely yield reasonable results for DOT 406 or DOT 412 cargo tanks
having a MAWP of 15 psig or less. Commenters recommended two alternatives to the ASME UG-23(b) design calculations,
both of which are formulas from engineering texts. One is from the ``Alcoa Structural Handbook,'' 1960, page 156 and
Table 23; the other is from ``Formulas for Stress and Strain,'' Fifth Edition, by Roark and Young, pages 554 and 555
and Table 35. The ``Alcoa Structural Handbook'' formula is as follows:







where:
R

i

/t

s

 is greater than 200
E = modulus of elasticity of material at design temperature
R

i

 = inside radius of the shell (largest radius of non-circular cross-section)
t

s

 = minimum thickness of shell less corrosion allowance
S

The Roark and Young formula is as follows:







where:



R

i

/t

s

 is greater than 10
S

bY

 = critical compressive buckling stress per Roark and Young
v = Poisson's ratio



Other symbols are the same as in the Alcoa formula, above.
Based on the merit of these comments, RSPA is revising paragraph (b) to allow alternative methods for determining
compressive buckling stress for DOT 400-series cargo tanks which are not required to be certified in accordance with
the ASME Code. This allows manufacturers more freedom in the design of DOT 400-series cargo tank motor vehicles, particularly
the DOT 406 cargo tank.
RSPA solicited information on the structural integrity of cargo tanks and, in particular, the loading combinations
that may be encountered during operation of cargo tank motor vehicles as prescribed in paragraph (c). Information
was received from several commenters which indicated that the loadings from normal operating conditions are different
from loadings experienced in extreme dynamic events. The normal operating loadings are more frequent in occurrence,
but much lower than the extreme dynamic loadings.

The requirement contained in current paragraph (c) only specifies extreme dynamic loadings. A cargo tank designer
must determine which loadings, if any, should be considered as acting simultaneously. TTMA stated it is unlikely
that extreme dynamic loadings will occur and highly unlikely that such loadings will occur at the same time. TTMA reported
that if the extreme dynamic loadings are considered by the cargo tank designer as acting simultaneously, the resulting
weight of a DOT 406 cargo tank would increase significantly. TTMA went on to state that such an increase in tank weight
would have an adverse effect on public safety because it would cause a decrease in the number of gallons delivered each
trip, increasing the number of trips and miles driven, thus increasing the probability of more accidents, personal
injuries and fatalities.
During discussions on structural integrity issues at the February 1994 public meeting, the potential for changes
in loading due to liquid movement was addressed. Commenters generally agreed that while significant lading movement
can occur during partially loaded conditions and that such movement cannot be disregarded by cargo tank designers
and vehicle operators, the variables involved are more than can be comprehensively dealt with at this time. The general
agreement was that the highest stress conditions on most cargo tank configurations occur when the cargo tanks are
full. Discussions on how to combine the loadings in calculating the structural integrity requirements have been
going on for a number of years. RSPA agrees with commenters that the loadings currently in the HMR are based on extreme
conditions that would be realized only on a rare occasion, if ever. Thus, based on recent information presented at
the public meetings and written comments received in response to the NPRM, RSPA concludes that, for the design and
construction of cargo tanks, it is best to consider separately the effects of normal operating loadings, which are
known to act in combination, and the effects of extreme dynamic loadings, which are not expected to act in combination
with each other. Therefore, in this final rule, RSPA is revising paragraph (c) to provide structural design requirements
that will be more reflective of conditions encountered by cargo tank motor vehicles. These revisions will require
cargo tank designers to consider normal operating loadings to be acting simultaneously, except that longitudinal
acceleration and deceleration cannot occur at the same time. Also, extreme dynamic loadings must be considered in
separate calculations; these loadings may be considered to be acting independently.
Paragraph (d) prescribes design calculations that should be considered to account for stresses due to impact in an
accident. For consistency, the accident damage requirements contained in current paragraph (d) are moved to  178.345-8(e)
where other accident damage protection requirements appear. Also, consistent with other changes made to this section,
paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) are amended by removing the reference to paragraph (d) of this section.
Paragraph (e) is editorially revised, for clarity and consistency, by changing the word ``wall'' to read ``shell
and heads'', and paragraphs (e) through (g) are redesignated as paragraphs (d) through (f).


Section 178.345-5


Commenters supported the proposed change in paragraph (b) that all fittings and devices mounted on a manhole cover
must withstand the same static internal fluid pressure as that required for the manhole. However, commenters requested
a revision to clarify that fitting and device manufacturers are responsible for testing and certifying the structural
integrity of their products. RSPA agrees with the commenters that the fitting and device manufacturers should be
responsible for ensuring the integrity of their components. Therefore, the proposed provision is revised for clarity
and added as new paragraph (f).
Another commenter suggested that paragraph (e) be revised to require that each manhole cover must be marked with the
date of certification. RSPA will consider this comment in a future rulemaking action.


Section 178.345-6


A minor editorial change is adopted as proposed in the NPRM.


Section 178.345-8


Commenters recommended several changes to the accident damage protection requirements. They requested that all
accident damage protection devices be designed so that calculated stress under the conditions prescribed not exceed
the ultimate strength of the material of construction. They pointed out certain inconsistencies in the design criteria
specified in this section. For example, in paragraph (d), the design stress for accidents involving longitudinal
deceleration is based on ``the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate strength''; the general requirement
for accident damage protection in paragraph (a)(3), is based on ``75 percent of the ultimate strength''; while bottom
damage and rollover damage protection, in paragraphs (b) and (c), both are based on the ``ultimate strength.'' RSPA
agrees there is merit in using the same criteria whenever possible. Therefore, in this final rule, the design of all
accident damage protection devices is based on the ultimate strength of the material of construction.

The primary purpose of accident damage protection is to prevent the release of hazardous lading from a cargo tank in
the event of an accident. For example, during an accident involving the maximum level of longitudinal deceleration
expected, if the front head of a cargo tank experiences stress levels above the yield point of the material of construction,
the head will bulge or distort. However, if that deformed head continues to contain the lading, the intent of this requirement
has been met. In a practical sense, good engineering practice provides for factors of safety when analytical methods
are not well established and when safety considerations call for reducing the probability of failures. 
When an accident imposes loads on the cargo tank wall, the material of the wall, however, must be stronger than the accident
damage protection device. For example, in a rollover accident, the portion of the cargo tank wall to which a rollover
protection device is attached should not fail before the rollover protection device fails. The design stresses in
the protection device itself can be based on the ultimate strength of the material, but the loads transmitted to the
cargo tank wall must be based on a more conservative value. This can be achieved by use of factors of safety. 
Accordingly, paragraph (a)(3) is revised to base design stresses on the ultimate strength of the material with a 1.3
safety factor (i.e., the reciprocal of 0.75 times ultimate, rounded). 

Commenters have stated that most impacts on bottom damage protection devices in accidents occur directly from the
side of the vehicle. TTMA has stated that any piping at the bottom of a tank is protected fore and aft by the running gear
of the cargo tank motor vehicle or its towing vehicle. Contending that reduced forces of impact can be expected from
front and rear, TTMA petitioned for a reduction from 155,000 pounds to 27,000 pounds fore and aft along the longitudinal
axis of the vehicle. RSPA believes, however, that the possibility of impacts from the front is very real for trailers;
for example, during turning maneuvers, or in the event that the towing vehicle rides over an obstacle such as a guard
rail. On the other hand, impacts from the rear are less likely on trailers because of the rear suspension. Therefore,
RSPA has revised paragraph (b)(1) to recognize that suspension components and structural mounting members can provide
all, or part, of bottom damage protection. Additionally, in paragraph (b) introductory text, a second sentence is
added to clarify that a single protection device may be used to protect outlets, projections and piping grouped or
clustered together.

Commenters stated that in the general rollover damage protection requirements, in paragraph (c), the wording ``enclosed
inside'' could be misunderstood to require that closures and fittings must be protected from rollover damage on all
sides_front, sides, rear and top. They also suggested that the protection devices be located no more than 48 inches
from the closure or fitting. RSPA never intended to require that the component being protected be fully enclosed by
the protective device. Also, RSPA does not agree with adding a dimensional location requirement. Rather than dimensional
controls, one of RSPA's overall objectives is to provide performance requirements when appropriate. Therefore,
paragraph (c) is revised to clarify the ambiguous wording. 
Commenters requested that in paragraph (c)(1), the tangential design load for rollover protection be reduced from
2 ``g'' to 0.5 ``g'' or 1 ``g.'' A commenter stated that ``neither industry nor government have any data to support what
this rollover protection device strength should be'', contending that MC 306 accident damage protection has performed
well, even considering findings of the NTSB study of overturn accidents. A commenter provided analytical data that
indicated the internal bulkheads would be overstressed under 2 ``g'' tangential loads using the current MC 306 design.

A February 4, 1992 NTSB investigation report on rollover accidents involving MC 306 and MC 312 cargo tanks recommended
several actions by both RSPA and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The NTSB report supported the earlier
RSPA decision to increase the rollover design load in the horizontal plane from one-half the weight of the loaded cargo
tank motor vehicle prescribed in the MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 specifications, to twice the weight of the loaded cargo
tank motor vehicle prescribed in the DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications. NTSB also noted that at this time,
test results are not available to support this four-fold increase, but limited testing performed under RSPA and FHWA
sponsorship for studies of release from dome covers indicate forces can easily exceed 2 ``g''. Additionally, NTSB
questioned whether the load specified for the DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications are adequate in a typical
rollover accident. 
RSPA agrees with comments that in some rollover accidents, cargo tank rotation is limited to 120 degrees or less, so
that these horizontal forces do not come into play unless a roadside obstacle is struck. In such incidents, the side
of the cargo tank absorbs most of the energy of the rollover. However, in other rollover incidents, cargo tank motor
vehicles have rotated 180 degrees or more and rollover protection devices have failed. 
RSPA performed simple calculations to estimate the forces that would be expected to bring a sliding overturned cargo
tank motor vehicle to a halt, at a variety of speeds and stopping distances. From the calculations performed regarding
stopping distances, RSPA concludes that the design loads should not be decreased. FHWA will initiate a study aimed
at developing a more refined understanding of the forces involved in cargo tank rollover accidents.

For these reasons, RSPA rejects requests to lower the tangential design load. In many cases, manufacturers will find
it necessary to develop new designs for overturn protection devices, perhaps with associated short-term increased
cost, but with enhanced safety benefits. Several manufacturers already have developed satisfactory protection
devices which meet these design criteria. In addition, RSPA has made several minor editorial revisions in paragraph
(c)(1) to improve clarity. 

Paragraph (d)(3) prescribes that each cargo tank rear-end protection device and its attachment to the vehicle must
be designed to satisfy the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) when subject to an impact of the cargo tank at rated
payload, at a deceleration of 2 ``g''. Such an impact must be considered as being uniformly applied in a horizontal
plane at an angle of 30 degrees or less to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. Commenters requested elimination of
the 30 degree angle for this impact load. They stated that most rear-end collisions of trucks and trailers involve
other vehicles and are ``in line'', i.e., the longitudinal centerlines of the two vehicles are parallel at impact.
TTMA pointed out that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a notice of proposed
rulemaking [Docket No. 1-11, Notice 9; January 3, 1992], containing a proposal for rear impact guards and protection.
The NHTSA proposal specified an impact only in the direction of the longitudinal centerline of the struck vehicle;
it did not address angular impact. NHTSA's rear impact requirements are intended for the design of underride guards
that will minimize impacts in occurrences where automobiles underride (i.e., slide under) the rear-end of large
trucks and trailers. These requirements are intended to protect passenger occupants while RSPA's requirement for
cargo tank rear-end protection is intended to prevent impacts to lading retention components that could result in
the loss of hazardous material lading. Upon further review, RSPA agrees that requiring rear-end protection devices
to withstand impacts at an angle of 30 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle is excessive. Therefore, paragraph
(d)(3) is revised to reduce the angle of impact to 10 degrees. 

A requirement contained in current paragraph (d) of  178.345-3 specifying design stress for accidents
involving longitudinal deceleration is revised and moved to new paragraph 178.345-8(e) in this final rule.
The specified design stress is based on the ultimate strength of the material with a factor of safety of 1.3 (i.e., the
reciprocal of 0.75 times ultimate, rounded). The use of 2 ``g'' as a reasonable maximum level for longitudinal deceleration
in accident situations generally has been accepted by industry but commenters have stated that the reliability of
strain gauge testing and finite element analysis is questionable when structures are loaded above the yield point.
For this reason, cargo tank manufacturers who choose to design at this level may use performance testing to prove that
tank heads and shell can withstand this 2 ``g'' loading condition. Alternate analytical methods or combinations
of test and analysis may be used if they are accurate and verifiable. 



Section 178.345-10




This section specifies requirements for the pressure relief and vacuum systems on DOT 400-series cargo tank motor
vehicles. It also specifies lading retention requirements for the pressure relief system in the event of an overturn.
Numerous commenters suggested alternative provisions for pressure relief systems on DOT 400-series cargo tanks.
Pressure relief valve manufacturers stated that they have found it very difficult to attain ``no loss of lading''
with valve designs capable of withstanding the characteristic dynamic pressure surge required by the regulation,
especially at low design pressures. 

For these reasons, commenters requested that RSPA allow the loss of one liter of lading. If adopted, a properly functioning
pressure relief valve could be expected to release no more than one liter of hazardous material in an overturn accident.
This amount of liquid would be so widely dispersed by the motion of the vehicle as to cause minimal danger of fire or environmental
damage. 

Cargo tank shipments of poisonous-by-inhalation (PIH) materials in Hazard Zones A and B are subject to special provisions
which result in high working pressures, thicker tank walls and thermal insulation. Insulation moderates thermal
gain, thus increasing the pressure differential between valve pressure settings and dynamic pressure; also, it
cushions the impact of accidents. The net effect of these features makes it unlikely that even small releases of PIH
lading will occur.

RSPA believes allowing a minute release of other types of ladings in overturn accidents has greater safety benefits
when compared with possible loss of an entire cargo tank load. Therefore, paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is revised to specify
that after August 31, 1995, DOT 400-series cargo tanks must be equipped with a pressure relief valve that will release
no more than one liter of lading in an emergency situation before reclosing to a leak-tight position. In addition,
editorial changes are made in paragraph (b)(3)(i) for clarity. 



Section 178.345-13



A paragraph heading, ``

Leakage test

.'' is added to paragraph (c) as proposed in the NPRM. 



Section 178.345-14



This section specifies cargo tank marking requirements. The California Highway Patrol recommended several substantial
changes throughout this section that were not proposed in the NPRM. While RSPA believes some of these changes may have
merit, they will have to be considered in a future rulemaking. 

Proposed paragraph (d) is revised to clarify that each cargo tank on a multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle must have
a separate nameplate, unless each cargo tank is made by the same manufacturer with the same materials, manufactured
thickness, and minimum thickness. 



Section 178.345-15



RSPA proposed to add a new paragraph (e) to allow affixing a metal certification plate to cargo tanks which do not meet
all of the applicable specification requirements. This would be indicated by not stamping a compliance date on the
plate. A commenter pointed out that the proposed wording does not specifically require the Registered Inspector
to stamp the date of compliance on the specification plate when the cargo tank is brought into full conformance with
the specification. RSPA agrees with the commenter and has clarified the requirement. 

Another commenter requested a revision to clarify that, for ASME tanks, the cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturer
must furnish a manufacturer's data report to the cargo tank owner as required by the ASME Code, in addition to other
required documents. The ASME Code requires a cargo tank manufacturer to prepare a manufacturer's data report for
each tank. RSPA agrees with the commenter and has added a provision in paragraph (b)(2) specifying that the manufacturer
must supply the cargo tank owner with a copy of the manufacturer's data report, at the time of delivery. 



Section 178.346-1



RSPA proposed to add a new paragraph (d)(9) specifying provisions for the use of a single full fillet lap weld joint
without plug welds for longitudinal seams on the top 25 percent of the cargo tank. For the most part, commenters agreed
in principal with the proposal; however, they recommended that the use of single fillet weld lap joint not be limited
to the top one-fourth of the cargo tank. 

Several manufacturers stated that they have used single full fillet lap welded joints for longitudinal seams on both
the top and bottom areas of thousands of low-pressure cargo tank motor vehicles. They stated their service experience
with these joints over many years of operations has been very good.

Advantages cited by the manufacturers for using this type of weld include the ability to achieve excellent fit between
the shell and head flanges, and reduction in the amount of time personnel must work in confined spaces. However, because
the ASME Code does not recognize this joint configuration, it may not be used on ASME certified vessels. 

Industry submitted reports of tensile tests of the typically used single full fillet lap joints to RSPA. Test results
indicate that failure occurs at stress levels of about 70 to 75 percent of the ultimate strength of adjacent material.
One commenter opposed the use of such joints but provided no supporting test data. 

RSPA believes the satisfactory performance of these joints over the years serves as a persuasive argument for their
continued use on DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles. However, because a major reason for establishing the DOT 400-series
specifications is enhanced quality assurance, the joints may be used only when subject to certain conditions. Therefore,
new paragraph (d)(9) specifies the conditions for use of these joints in longitudinal seams, requirements for periodic
compliance testing, and design requirements for determining weld joint efficiency. In addition, a new paragraph
(d)(10) is added to clarify that requirements of paragraph UW-9(d), of Section VIII, Division 1, ASME Code do
not apply.

Section 178.346-2


Minor editorial changes are made to paragraph (a). 


Section 178.346-10


Valve manufacturers stated that, during prototype testing, they have encountered substantial problems in obtaining
adequate flow under emergency conditions with pressure relief valves designed for the comparatively low MAWP levels
typical of DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles. These problems have been resolved for current valves; however, the valve
manufacturers continue to believe the emergency flow capacities, which are permitted to release up to one gallon
of lading under the dynamic pressure surges characteristic of rollover accidents, are still marginal in some cases.
Because of the problems encountered by valve manufacturers, RSPA will allow an additional year for product development
and manufacturing start-up. This extension is added in a new paragraph (b)(3). 
RSPA proposed to revise paragraph (c)(1) to permit DOT 406 cargo tanks to have the same set pressure and test pressure
as allowed in  178.345-10(d)(1), and as prescribed for DOT 407 and 412 cargo tanks except that the reclosing
pressure would remain at no less than MAWP. Commenters stated that while the proposed language would be helpful in
increasing the venting capacity to a limited extent and providing a similar difference between opening and closing
pressures over a range of MAWP values, it would not eliminate the need for supplementary venting capacity. Commenters
requested that the flow rate be determined at a higher pressure, specifically at 125 percent of the tank test pressure.
This would provide more pressure differential across the valve seat and provide higher venting capacities. As discussed
in the preamble for 178.346-10(b) above, pressure relief valve manufacturers reported that they have found
it difficult to obtain adequate emergency flow capacities in valves designed for DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles.

Based on comments received, RSPA believes the problem can be relieved by implementing two measures. The first measure
is to increase the tolerance on the valve set pressure to allow the valve to begin opening at a lower set pressure and
to be fully open at a higher pressure. The second measure is to increase the venting capacity rating pressure to 125
percent of the tank test pressure, and not greater than 3 psi above the tank's MAWP. Because the pressure relief valves
are required to be removed from the cargo tank during periodic pressure testing, the tank itself will not be exposed
to pressures above its normal test pressure [see  180.407(g)(1)(i)]. This increase in the venting capacity
rating pressure will still provide a satisfactory margin of safety with respect to tank bursting pressure, even in
the event of exposure to fire. The combined effect of these changes can be expected to significantly raise the pressure
differential across the valve seat, thus increasing flow. Accordingly, both paragraphs (c)(1) and paragraph (d)(1)
have been revised to include these two measures. 


Section 178.346-13


In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to increase the emergency flow capacity of DOT 406 pressure relief valves by raising the
test pressure of the cargo tank. This was intended to alleviate problems reported by valve manufacturers by increasing
the differential pressure across the valve seat, thus increasing flow. However, commenters requested that RSPA
not make this change because of the increased danger of deformation of heads at pressure levels above 5.0 psig, especially
for internal heads in which the pressure is applied to the convex side. One commenter stated that pressures above 5.0
psig would require increased head thickness or bracing, thus increasing the weight of the tank resulting in lower
payload and higher manufacturing cost. 
As an alternative means of increasing emergency flow, commenters suggested that the set pressure and the flow rating
pressure of the pressure relief valve itself be changed while retaining the existing tank test pressure. RSPA agrees
with this alternative. Therefore, RSPA has revised paragraphs 178.346-10(c)(1) and (d)(1) instead of revising
the tank test pressure requirements. 
Shortly before publication of the NPRM, TTMA petitioned RSPA to use the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) test
for vapor-tightness for all DOT 406 cargo tanks. TTMA requested that Method 27 be authorized for all DOT 406 cargo tanks,
regardless of whether they are: (a) used in gasoline delivery, (b) fitted with vapor collection equipment, or (c)
subject to this test under EPA rules. Method 27, is found in appendix A. to 40 CFR Part 60. Section 1.1 of Method 27 is applicable
for the determination of vapor tightness of a gasoline delivery tank which is equipped with vapor collection equipment.
Requirements for applying the initial pressure-vacuum and test criteria are contained in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart
XX_Standards of Performance for Bulk Gasoline Terminals. In  60.501, the definition of vapor tight gasoline
tank truck reads: 



Vapor-tight gasoline tank truck means a gasoline tank truck which has demonstrated within the 12 preceding months
that its product delivery tank will sustain a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals (75 mm of water) within 5 minutes
after it is pressurized to 4,500 pascals (450 mm of water). This capability is to be demonstrated using the pressure
test procedure specified in Reference Method 27. 



It should be noted that 750 pascals = 0.109 psi = 3.0 inches of water and 4,500 pascals = 0.653 psi = 18.1 inches of water.
Similar provisions for benzene are prescribed in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart BB_National Emission Standard for Benzene
Emissions from Benzene Transfer Operations, at  60.601.

RSPA authorized this alternative leakage test in the June 12, 1989 final rule published under HM-183 to relieve
burdens of duplicate test requirements for cargo tanks intended for use in locations where, based on established
standards of air quality, EPA has decided that release of gasoline vapors constitutes a hazard to the environment.
TTMA stated that a cargo tank motor vehicle manufacturer may not know the local air pollution requirements to which
the motor vehicle may be subject. RSPA recognizes TTMA's concerns and is permitting this alternative test when a cargo
tank is equipped with vapor recovery equipment without qualification regarding the materials transported. RSPA
also has revised paragraph (c) and  180.407(h)(2) to reference appropriate acceptance criteria in EPA's regulation
contained in 40 CFR 60. 


Section 180.403 


Commenters supported the proposal to add a definition for the term ``replacement of a barrel.'' TTMA recommended
that, in the definition of ``replacement of a barrel'' the wording ``unused tank'' should be clarified to mean a ``new
tank.'' RSPA agrees and the word ``new'' is added parenthetically after the word ``unused.'' 
Commenters also supported the proposal to revise the definition of rebarrelling. However, for the reasons contained
in the preamble discussion for  180.413 the proposed revision is not being adopted in this final rule. A commenter
recommended that the definition of ``repair'' be modified to include the replacement of components such as valves,
vents and fittings. RSPA believes this suggested change would be confusing because a ``repair'' is specifically
defined to mean ``any welding done to the cargo tank wall to return it to the original specification or a later equivalent
specification.'' Replacement of valves, vents and fittings is considered maintenance. Therefore, the current
definition is retained. 


Section 180.405 


Minor editorial changes are made in subparagraphs (f)(1)(iii) and (f)(4) as proposed in the NPRM. 
In paragraph (g)(2), RSPA proposed to clarify that fittings and devices mounted on a manhole cover are part of the manhole
assembly and must meet all performance standards required for the manhole cover. A commenter stated that the current
requirement is adequate and recommended that RSPA not adopt the proposed change. The commenter stated that any concern
or problem is due to a lack in verifying the continued proper securement of these fittings and devices to the manhole
cover. The commenter said that the annual leakage test and inspection requirements in  180.407 should be sufficient
to assure that these in-service fittings and devices remain securely mounted and properly sealed on in-service manholes.
RSPA agrees with the commenter and the proposed changes are not adopted in this final rule. 
Another commenter recommended that paragraph (g)(2)(i) be revised to add ``month and year'' to the certification
marking on manhole assemblies. Although RSPA believes that such a requirement may have merit, an opportunity should
be provided for public comment; therefore, it will be considered in a future rulemaking action. 
Paragraph (h) specifies that replacement for any reclosing pressure relief valve must be capable of re-seating to
a leak-tight condition after a pressure surge. Section 180.405(c) authorizes modifying the reclosing pressure
relief valves of an MC 306 cargo tank by installing the dual function pressure relief valves which are required for
DOT 406 cargo tank motor vehicles. Commenters pointed out that this replacement could result in an MC 306 cargo tank
having lower emergency venting capacity than its specification requires; because it is difficult to produce a valve
that achieves the comparatively high flow rates of the MC 306 units, withstands the pressure surges specified in the
DOT 406 specification, and recloses with minimal loss of lading. A reduced flow capacity is less likely to be encountered
in fitting an MC 307 with a DOT 407 valve replacement, and in fitting an MC 312 with a DOT 412 valve replacement, because
of the larger pressure differentials which are commonly used in these cargo tanks. Regardless of the equipment installed,
the venting requirements specified in the particular cargo tank specification must be met whenever a pressure relief
valve is replaced. For this reason, in this final rule, RSPA is authorizing replacement of defective MC 306 pressure
relief valves with new or refurbished MC 306 pressure relief valves until August 31, 1998. After this date, any valve
replacements must be the surge resistant pressure relief valves required for DOT 400-series cargo tanks. This allows
three years for implementation of this safety approvement.

Section 180.407 



In the table in paragraph (c), chlorine cargo tanks must be leakage tested annually. These cargo tanks are also required
to be pressure tested every two years. Based on a comment, RSPA has extended the frequency for conducting the leakage
test to two years to coincide with the pressure test. Certain minor editorial changes are made in paragraph (d)(1)(i)
for clarity. Paragraph (e)(1) is revised to clarify that when a particular tank design such as a cargo tank with a lining,
coating or internal baffles, precludes an internal visual inspection, the tank must be hydrostatically or pneumatically
tested. Paragraph (e)(4), which is duplicative with the requirements in paragraph (f)(3), is removed as proposed
in the NPRM. 


RSPA proposed to revise paragraph (g)(1)(iv), covering the pressure test of specification cargo tanks for consistency
with the proposed changes to  178.346-10; however, commenters who initially sought this change recommended
that the proposal be withdrawn and the current provisions retained. Therefore, no change is made in this final rule.



Paragraph (h)(2) is revised to permit the use of the EPA Method 27 vapor tightness test on any cargo tank fitted with
a vapor recovery system and used in gasoline or benzene service, as discussed earlier under the preamble discussion
to  178.346-13(c)(2). A commenter suggested that paragraph (h)(2) require the use of oil or soap to detect
leaks in cargo tank seams, piping, valves and accessories when performing the Method 27 test. RSPA believes that oil
or soap can be very useful in locating leaks, but that it would be an unnecessary burden if required for all Method 27
tests. Accordingly, RSPA has not adopted the suggested change. 


Paragraph (i) prescribes that the heads and shell of all unlined cargo tanks used for the transportation of materials
corrosive to the tank must be thickness tested. Consistent with changes made to  178.345-1(1)(2) in this
final rule, a new paragraph (i)(4)(x) is added to specify that thickness testing must be performed on connecting structures
of a carbon steel, self-supporting multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle. 


Requirements for continuing qualification and maintenance of cargo tank motor vehicles include periodic measurement
of the thickness of heads and shells. This has focused attention on interpretation of specification requirements
for minimum thickness, especially of specification MC 306, MC 307, MC 312 cargo tanks and their predecessors. 


In the specifications for MC 306, MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tanks constructed of steel, minimum thickness requirements
for heads and shells were expressed in terms of U. S. Standard Gauges for sheet material or, for some MC 312 units where
plate material was specified, in terms of fractions of an inch. These data were found at Table I and Table II in specifications
for each of the respective types. Although not explicitly stated in the regulatory text, the tabulated values were
the minimum nominal sheet and plate sizes permitted for these cargo tanks. For aluminum, values in Table I and Table
II were the minimum nominal thickness expressed in decimals. The tolerances on mill thickness and the minimum thickness
after forming were not covered. Although major steel purchase orders and steel mill production controls for sheet
stock and thin plate are based on specific thicknesses and tolerances rather than on standard gauges, manufacturing
tolerances have been established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for standard gauges and
plate. For example, ASTM A480/A480M provides general specifications for stainless steels and heat-resisting steel
plate, sheet and strip; Tables A1.2 and A1.17 in this specification are of special interest to manufacturers of DOT
specification cargo tanks. For MC 307 and MC 312 cargo tanks which were required to be designed and constructed in accordance
with the ASME Code, minimum mill undertolerances are set forth in Section VIII, Division 1 at UG-16(c). The ASME
values are more restrictive than those of ASTM A480/A480M.

In January 1991, the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC) published a revision to their ``Cargo Tank Maintenance
Manual'' which included a table of minimum thicknesses for U.S. steel gauges ranging from 3 through 30. The accompanying
narrative stated that the basic information was ``provided by DOT.'' A table, contained in  173.24(c)(2) of
the 1990 edition of the HMR was cited for gauges 12 through 30 with extrapolation being used to complete the other gauges.
The values presented in that table were intended for relatively severe cold-working operations such as those experienced
in forming the top and bottom chimes of steel drums, not for cargo tank construction. However, since adopting 49 CFR
180 Subpart E_Qualification and Maintenance of Cargo Tanks, the values published in the NTTC manual have been used
for thickness testing as required by  180.407(i). In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to add a new paragraph (i)(5) containing
a minimum thickness table for steel and aluminum for the sizes of sheet and plate which have been authorized for MC 300,
MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 heads and shells. The way in which minimum
thickness has been set forth over the years has varied. For example, steel thicknesses generally have been expressed
in terms of U.S. Standard Gauge (USSG), but, in the case of the MC 303 specification, both USSG values and decimal values
were used. Thickness values for aluminum more often have been expressed in decimals. However, in the case of the MC
302 specification, both USSG values and decimal values were tabulated; and in the case of the MC 304 specification,
the values for aluminum were required to be calculated by multiplying the USSG values listed for mild steel by a factor
of 1.44. 


TTMA suggested several changes to the table for clarity. TTMA also recommended that the table be divided into two separate
tables: one for steel and one for aluminum. RSPA agrees with TTMA's recommendation. Therefore, in this final rule,
current paragraphs (i)(5) through (1)(7) are redesignated as paragraphs (i)(6) through (i)(8), and a new paragraph
(i)(5) containing two minimum thickness tables has been added. The tables include all thicknesses found in the eleven
specifications cited above, plus USSG number 7 which has been used by a number of manufacturers. For steel, nominal
thicknesses range from USSG number 19 to 3/8
'
' plate; for aluminum, nominal thicknesses range from 0.078
'
' to 0.540
'
'. 




Section 180.413


RSPA proposed to revise requirements on the repair, modification, stretching or rebarrelling of cargo tanks. A commenter
requested a revision to the record requirements contained in proposed paragraph (b) to require that the National
Board ``R-1'' report be completed for all repairs on ASME Code stamped cargo tanks. The commenter stated that
completing the document will ensure that the repair and method of repair conforms to the National Board Inspection
Code and is approved by an Authorized Inspector. RSPA believes this revision is unnecessary because  180.413
requires that any repair or modification involving welding on the tank head must be certified by a Registered Inspector,
and that any repair or modification to an ASME Code ``U'' stamped cargo tank must be in accordance with the National
Board Inspection Code. The National Board requires the use of the ``R-1'' forms for repairs and modifications.
Therefore, this commenter's recommendation is not adopted in this final rule. 


RSPA proposed to require that any repair, modification, stretching or rebarrelling of an ASME Code-stamped cargo
tank must be performed by a repair facility holding a National Board ``R'' stamp. The National Board allows a facility
other than a National Board ``R'' stamp holder to make repairs and modifications to ASME Code cargo tanks when authorized
within a governmental jurisdiction. Jurisdictional authorization is only recognized within state boundaries
where the repair facility is located. Therefore, because most cargo tank motor vehicles are operated in interstate
commerce, RSPA has adopted the proposal requiring repairs on DOT specification cargo tanks certified to the ASME
Code to be performed only by a facility holding a valid ``R'' stamp.

Based on a letter from TTMA stating that the regulations provide no distinction between a ``100 percent rebarrel''
and the manufacture of a new cargo tank, RSPA proposed to clarify the rebarrelling requirements and to differentiate
between ``rebarrelling a cargo tank'' and ``manufacturing a cargo tank''. It was never RSPA's intent to imply that
a repair facility holding only a National Board ``R'' stamp would be allowed to manufacture a new cargo tank or to perform
a ``100 percent rebarrel'' of a cargo tank. Such work can be performed only by a manufacturer who is registered with
DOT and holds an ASME ``U'' stamp. RSPA proposed adding a provision disallowing a repair facility from replacing an
entire cargo tank by performing a ``100 percent rebarrel.'' 
However, based on comments received in the proposed clarification, the reference to a ``100 percent rebarrelled
cargo tank'' has also caused confusion. Therefore, the proposed change is not adopted in this final rule, but RSPA
will seek to clarify this provision in a future rulemaking. 
CGA urged RSPA to add a new paragraph (e)(3)(v) specifying that modifications of MC 338 cargo tanks must conform to
the specification in effect at the time of manufacture or at the time of modification. CGA pointed out that many cryogenic
cargo tanks were operating under DOT exemption prior to adoption of the MC 338 cargo tank specification. Some of these
units do not conform to the design criteria in   178.338-3 and 178.338-10. CGA stated that
engineering and manufacturing costs to upgrade these cargo tanks to this new design criteria would be too restrictive.
Yet, CGA also stated that ``to encourage continuous modification and improvement, modifications to MC 338 cargo
tanks must be performed in accordance with the specifications in effect at the time of manufacture or at the time of
modification.'' 
Proposed  180.413 provides for a cargo tank to be modified in accordance with a current specification in effect
at the time the work is done. For example, a feature on an MC 305 cargo tank may be modified in accordance with the MC 306
specification until August 31, 1995, and after that date in accordance with the DOT 406 specification; an MC 330 cargo
tank may be modified in accordance with the MC 331 specification. Similarly, a cargo tank authorized under an exemption
issued before October 1, 1984 for transportation of a cryogenic liquid must be marked as a ``DOT MC 338'' cargo tank
in accordance with  180.405(d). The only cryogenic cargo tank specification is the MC 338. Thus, no feature
of an MC 338 cryogenic cargo tank can be modified in accordance with any other specification. However, an MC 338 cryogenic
cargo tank may be repaired in accordance with either its original design specified in the exemption under which it
was manufactured or the MC 338 specification requirements in effect at the time of the repair. Therefore, CGA's suggested
change is not adopted in this final rule. 
CGA recommended a revision to paragraph (e)(6) to clarify that a cargo tank manufacturer who welds attachments and
appurtenances which have no affect on the structural integrity or lading retention capability of a tank is not required
to have a National Board ``R'' or ASME ``U'' stamp. CGA also suggested a revision to paragraph (e)(7) to clarify that
mounting specifications should be governed by welding to the cargo tank ``shell and head'' rather than the cargo tank
``wall''. RSPA agrees and paragraphs (e)(6) and (e)(7) are revised for clarity.

IV. Docket HM-183D 



On September 3, 1993, RSPA published an interim final rule that amended requirements concerning the registration
of Registered Inspectors and Design Certifying Engineers for certification of cargo tank motor vehicles. RSPA extended
the closing of the registration period from December 31, 1991 to December 31, 1995. This action was in response to a
petition for rulemaking, P-1167, filed by NTTC. RSPA stated in the rule that although an opportunity for public
comment had not been provided, RSPA was seeking public comment to the action. RSPA further stated that any comments
received would be addressed along with comments received to the NPRM under Docket HM-183C. The effective date
of this rule was September 3, 1993. The comment period closed on October 13, 1993; RSPA received no comments in regard
to this action. Therefore, that extension remains in effect. 



V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and
was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the Regulatory
policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). A regulatory evaluation is available
for review in the docket. 



2. Executive Order 12612 



This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
(``Federalism''). Federal law expressly preempts State, local, and Indian tribe requirements applicable to the
transportation of hazardous material that cover certain subjects and are not ``substantively the same'' as the Federal
requirements. 49 U.S.C. 5125(b)(1). These covered subjects are: 

(A) the designation, description, and classification of hazardous material; 

(B) the packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous material; 

(C) the preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents related to hazardous material and requirements respecting
the number, contents, and placement of those documents; 

(D) the written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
material; or 

(E) the design, manufacturing, fabricating, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
packaging or a container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in transporting hazardous
material. 

This final rule addresses the design, manufacturing, repairing, and other requirements for packages represented
as qualified for use in the transportation of hazardous material. Therefore, this final rule preempts State, local,
or Indian tribe requirements that are not ``substantively the same'' as Federal requirements on these subjects.
Section 5125(b)(2) of Title 49 U.S.C. provides that when DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects
after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine and publish in the 

Federal Register

 the effective date of Federal preemption. The effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date
of issuance of the final rule and no later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective
date of Federal preemption of this final rule will be 90 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 

Because RSPA lacks discretion in this area, preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted. 



3. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
There are no direct or indirect adverse economic impacts for small units of government, businesses, or other organizations.




4. Paperwork Reduction Act 



This amendment imposes no changes to the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in the
June 12, 1989 final rule, which were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44
U.S.C. chapter 35 and assigned control number 2137-0014. 



5. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) 



A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each
year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified
Agenda.

(b) 

ASME Code design and construction. 

The static design and construction of each cargo tank must be in accordance with Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME
Code. The tank design must include calculation of stresses generated by the MAWP, the weight of the lading, the weight
of structures supported by the cargo tank wall and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient
temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in the calculation
of thermal stresses.
(1) Stress concentrations in tension, bending and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be
considered in accordance with Appendix G of Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code.
(2) Longitudinal compressive buckling stress for ASME certified vessels must be calculated using paragraph UG-23(b),
Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code. For cargo tanks not required to be certified in accordance with the ASME Code,
compressive buckling stress may be calculated using alternative analysis methods which are accurate and verifiable.
When alternative methods are used calculations must include both the static loads described in this paragraph and
the dynamic loads described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) 

Shell design. 

Shell stresses resulting from static or dynamic loadings, or combinations thereof, are not uniform throughout the
cargo tank motor vehicle. The vertical, longitudinal, and lateral normal operating loadings can occur simultaneously
and must be combined. The vertical, longitudinal and lateral extreme dynamic loadings occur separately and need
not be combined. 

(1) 

Normal operating loadings. 

The following procedure addresses stress in the tank shell resulting from normal operating loadings. The effective
stress (the maximum principal stress at any point) must be determined by the following formula: 




S = 0.5(S

y

 + S

x

) 

#

 [0.25(S

y

^S

x

)2 + S

S



2

]

0.5 



Where: 




(i) S = effective stress at any given point under the combination of static and normal operating loadings that can occur
at the same time, in psi. 

(ii) S

y

 = circumferential stress generated by the MAWP and external pressure, when applicable, plus static head, in psi.


(iii) S

x

 = The following net longitudinal stress generated by the following static and normal operating loading conditions,
in psi: 

(A) The longitudinal stresses resulting from the MAWP and external pressure, when applicable, plus static head,
in combination with the bending stress generated by the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank, all structural
elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall;

design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in  178.345-3(b) and
as generated by the loads described in  178.345-3(c).''. 
20. In  178.345-8, paragraphs (a)(3), (b) introductory text, (b)(1), (c) introductory text, (c)(1),
and (d)(3) are revised; and a new paragraph (e) is added to read as follows: 


 178.345-8 

Accident damage protection. 


(a) * * * 
(3) Accident damage protection devices attached to the wall of a cargo tank must be able to withstand or deflect away
from the cargo tank the loads specified in this section. They must be designed, constructed and installed so as to maximize
the distribution of loads to the tank wall and to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting the lading retention
integrity of the cargo tank. Accident induced stresses resulting from the appropriate accident damage protection
device requirements in combination with the stresses from the tank operating at the MAWP may not result in a tank wall
stress greater than the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Deformation
of the protection device is acceptable provided the devices being protected are not damaged when loads specified
in this section are applied. 


* * * * * 


(b) Each outlet, projection or piping located in the lower 1/3 of the tank circumference (or cross section perimeter
for non-circular tanks) that could be damaged in an accident that may result in the loss of lading must be protected
by a bottom damage protection device, except as provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and  173.33(e)
of this subchapter. Outlets, projections and piping may be grouped or clustered together and protected by a single
protection device. 
(1) Any bottom damage protection device must be able to withstand a force of 155,000 pounds (based on the ultimate strength
of the material) from the front, side, or rear, uniformly distributed over each surface of the device, over an area
not to exceed 6 square feet, and a width not to exceed 6 feet. Suspension components and structural mounting members
may be used to provide all, or part, of this protection. The device must extend no less than 6 inches beyond any component
that may contain lading in transit. 


* * * * * 


(c) Each closure for openings, including but not limited to the manhole, filling or inspection openings, and each
valve, fitting, pressure relief device, vapor recovery stop valve or lading retaining fitting located in the upper
2/3 of a cargo tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular tanks) must be protected by being located
within or between adjacent rollover damage protection devices, or by being 125 percent of the strength that would
be provided by the otherwise required damage protection device. 
(1) A rollover damage protection device on a cargo tank motor vehicle must be designed and installed to withstand loads
equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle applied as follows: normal to the tank shell (perpendicular
to the tank surface); and tangential (perpendicular to the normal load) from any direction. The stresses shall not
exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction. These design loads may be considered to be uniformly
distributed and independently applied. If more than one rollover protection device is used, each device must be capable
of carrying its proportionate share of the required loads and in each case at least one-fourth the total tangential
load. The design must be proven capable of carrying the required loads by calculations, tests or a combination of tests
and calculations. 


* * * * * 


(d) * * * 
(3) The structure of the rear-end protection device and its attachment to the vehicle must be designed to satisfy the
conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when subjected to an impact of the cargo tank motor vehicle
at rated payload, at a deceleration of 2 ``g''. Such impact must be considered as being uniformly applied in the horizontal
plane at an angle of 10 degrees or less to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. 
(e) 

Longitudinal deceleration protection.

 In order to account for stresses due to longitudinal impact in an accident, the tank shell and heads must be able to withstand
the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal
deceleration of 2 ``g''. For this loading condition, the allowable stress value used may not exceed the ultimate strength
of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Performance testing, analytical methods, or a combination
thereof, may be used to prove this capability provided the methods are accurate and verifiable. For cargo tanks with
internal baffles, the decelerative force may be reduced by 0.25 ``g'' for each baffle assembly, but in no case may the
total reduction in decelerative force exceed 1.0 ``g''. 
21. In 178.345-10, paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) are revised to read as follows:

(i) Each pressure relief device must be able to withstand dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design
set pressure and sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released
not exceeding one gallon before the relief device recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met

Specification shortages.

 If a cargo tank is manufactured which does not meet all applicable specification requirements, thereby requiring
subsequent manufacturing involving the installation of additional components, parts, appurtenances or accessories,
the cargo tank manufacturer may affix the name plate and specification plate, as required by  178.345-14
(b) and (c), without the original date of certification stamped on the specification plate. The manufacturer shall
state the specification requirements not complied with on the manufacturer's Certificate of Compliance. When the
cargo tank is brought into full compliance with the applicable specification, the Registered Inspector shall stamp
the date of compliance on the specification plate. The Registered Inspector shall issue a Certificate of Compliance
stating details of the particular operations performed on the cargo tank, and the date and person (manufacturer,
carrier, or repair organization) accomplishing the compliance. 
25. In  178.346-1, new paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) are added to read as follows:

(iii) 

Compliance test.

 Two test specimens of the material to be used in the manufacture of a cargo tank must be tested to failure in tension.
The test specimens must be of the same thicknesses and joint configuration as the cargo tank, and joined by the same
welding procedures. The test specimens may represent all the tanks that are made of the same materials and welding
procedures, have the same joint configuration, and are made in the same facility within 6 months after the tests are
completed. Before welding, the fit-up of the joints on the test specimens must represent production conditions that
would result in the least joint strength. Evidence of joint fit-up and test results must be retained at the manufacturers'
facility. 

(iv) 

Weld joint efficiency.

 The lower value of stress at failure attained in the two tensile test specimens shall be used to compute the efficiency
of the joint as follows: Determine the failure ratio by dividing the stress at failure by the mechanical properties
of the adjacent metal; this value, when multiplied by 0.75, is the design weld joint efficiency. 

(10) The requirements of paragraph UW-9(d), of Section VIII, Division 1, ASME Code do not apply.

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) amends certain regulations that pertain to migratory game bird hunting,
upland game hunting, big game hunting and sport fishing on individual national wildlife refuges. Refuge hunting
and fishing programs are reviewed annually to determine whether the individual refuge regulations governing these
programs should be modified, deleted or have additions made to them. Changing environmental conditions, State and
Federal regulations, and other factors affecting wildlife populations and habitat may warrant modifications to
ensure the continued compatibility of hunting and fishing with the purposes for which the individual refuges were
established. Modifications are designed, to the extent practical, to make refuge hunting and fishing programs consistent
with State regulations.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 50 CFR part 32 contains provisions governing hunting and fishing on national wildlife refuges. Hunting and fishing
are regulated on refuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the wildlife resource,
(3) protect other refuge values, and (4) ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adopting
State hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On other refuges, it is necessary to supplement
State regulations with more restrictive Federal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities,
as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific
hunting and fishing regulations may be issued only after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird hunting,
upland game hunting, big game hunting or sport fishing through publication in the 

Federal Register

. These regulations may list the wildlife species that may be hunted or are subject to sport fishing, seasons, bag limits,
methods of hunting or fishing, descriptions of open areas, and other provisions as appropriate. 


Previously issued refuge-specific regulations for hunting and 
fishing are contained in 50 CFR part 32. Many of the amendments to these sections are being promulgated to standardize
and clarify the existing language of these regulations. 


Request for Comments 


A proposed rule was published in the July 20, 1994, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 37134) and comments from the public were solicited. The only comments received were from the Region 3 Office
(Service) to point the omission of ``Kirtland's Warbler Wildlife Management Area'' under the State of Michigan.
This unit had been opened to hunting on July 27, 1987, but was inadvertently dropped from the listing of open areas.
The administrative change has been made to correct this omission. 


Statutory Authority 


The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge
Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically,
Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to permit the use of any area within the Refuge
System 
for any purpose, including but not limited to, hunting, fishing 
and public recreation, accommodations and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the major
purpose(s) for which the area was established.

The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer areas within the Refuge System for public recreation
as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent 
that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purpose(s) for which the areas were established. The
Refuge Recreation Act also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act. Hunting
and sport fishing plans are developed for each refuge prior to opening it to hunting or fishing. In many cases, refuge-specific
hunting and fishing regulations are included in the hunting and sport fishing plans to ensure the compatibility of
the hunting and sport fishing programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established. Initial compliance
with the NWRSAA and Refuge Recreation Act is ensured when hunting and sport fishing plans are developed, and the determinations
required by these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas open to hunting and fishing in 50
CFR part 32. Continued compliance is ensured by annual review of hunting and sport fishing programs and regulations.




Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 and assigned 
clearance number 1018-0014. The information is being collected to assist the Service in administering these
programs in accordance with statutory authorities which require that 
recreational uses be compatible with the primary purposes for which the areas were established. The information
requested in the application form is required to obtain a benefit. 

The public reporting burden for the application form is estimated to average six (6) minutes per response, including
time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing the form. Direct comments on the
burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to the Service Information Collection Clearance Officer, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street NW., MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget,
Paperwork Reduction Project (1018-0014), Washington, DC 20503. 



Economic Effect 



This rulemaking was not subject to the Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking
would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations
or governmental jurisdictions. This rule would have minimal effect on such entities.

Federalism 



This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Environmental Considerations 



Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)) and the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) is ensured when hunting and sport fishing plans are developed, and the determinations
required by these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas open to hunting and fishing in 50
CFR part 32. The amendment of refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations are subject to a categorical exclusion
from the NEPA process if they do not significantly alter the existing use of a particular national wildlife refuge.
The B.(5) Service exclusion is employed here as these amendments are considered ``[m]inor changes in the amounts
or types of public use on FWS or State-managed lands, in accordance with regulations, management plans, and procedures.''
These refuge-specific hunting and fishing revisions to existing regulations simply qualify or otherwise define
an existing hunting or fishing activity for purposes of resource management. The changes made in this rulemaking
would not substantially alter the existing uses of the refuges involved. Information regarding hunting and fishing
permits and the conditions that apply to individual refuge hunts, sport fishing activities and maps of the respective
areas are retained at refuge headquarters and can be obtained from the regional offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service at the addresses listed below:

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) adds Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge to the list of areas open for big
game hunting in North Dakota along with pertinent refuge-specific regulations for such activity. The Service has
determined that such use will be compatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established. The Service has
further determined that this action is in accordance with the provisions of all applicable laws, is consistent with
principles of sound wildlife management, and is otherwise in the public interest by providing additional recreational
opportunities of a renewable natural resource.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 National wildlife refuges are generally closed to hunting and sport fishing until opened by rulemaking. The Secretary
of the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishing upon a determination that such uses are
compatible with the purpose(s) for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available for development,
operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program. The action must also be in accordance with provisions
of all laws applicable to the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound wildlife management, and must
otherwise be in the public interest. This rulemaking opens Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge to deer hunting. The
hunt will be in accordance with State regulations pertaining to archery and firearms deer hunting, and as illustrated
in the North Dakota Hunting Guide (1993). 



A proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36348) and public comments were solicited. No comments were received. 



Statutory Authority 



The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended (NWRSAA) (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge
Recreation Act of 1962 (RRA) (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the 
administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes
the Secretary to permit the use of any areas within the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) for any purpose,
including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and 
accommodations, and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the purposes for which each refuge
was established. The Service administers the Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary. The RRA gives the Secretary
additional authority to administer refuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate
incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purposes
for which the refuges were established. In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under this Act,
the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available for the development, operation, and maintenance
of the permitted forms of recreation. 



Opening Package 



In preparation for this opening, the refuge unit has included in its ``openings package'' for Regional review and
approval from the Washington Office the following documents: a hunting/fishing plan; an environmental assessment;
a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI); a Section 7 evaluation or statement, pursuant to the Endangered Species
Act, that these openings are not likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat; and a letter of concurrence
from the affected States. From a review of the totality of these documents, the Secretary has determined that the opening
of the Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge to deer hunting is compatible with the principles of sound wildlife management
and will otherwise be in the public interest. 

In accordance with the NWRSAA and the RRA, the Secretary has also determined that this opening for deer hunting is compatible
and consistent with the primary purposes for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available to administer
the programs. A brief description of the hunting program is as follows: 



Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge 



Rock Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a 5,587 acre easement refuge located in Towner County, North Dakota. The
refuge was established in 1939 by an Executive Order as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife.
The refuge is administered by the Service's Devils Lake Wetland Management District, located in Devils Lake, North
Dakota. Rock Lake NWR occupies lands that were formed by glacial activity several million years ago. The glacial drift
moraine running through North Dakota is characterized by rolling grasslands interspersed with small closed basins.
Devils Lake is typical of this area. Principal wildlife found on Rock Lake NWR includes geese, ducks, various non-game
bird species, white-tailed deer, muskrat, mink and fox. Bald eagles, whooping cranes, and peregrine falcons use
the area on an occasional basis.

<TEXT>
 

Since hunting has been prohibited on Rock Lake NWR, deer from the surrounding area are drawn to the refuge during the
State firearms deer season. Unfortunately, following the close of the deer season they do not return to the areas from
which they came until the following spring. Heightened winter deer concentrations are destructive to refuge habitat
and lead to serious depredation problems on neighboring private lands, particularly during severe winters. This
refuge is the only large closed-to-hunting area for many miles. 


The primary objective of this hunt is to reduce the degradation of habitat used by nesting waterfowl and other wildlife,
migratory wildlife, rare and endangered wildlife, and native (resident) wildlife. The hunt will also reduce depredation
problems on privately owned land, redistribute deer, improve the health of the herd, reduce the risk of deer/vehicle
collisions, and provide recreational opportunities. A designated area of the refuge will be opened to deer hunting
only during the State firearms deer season and archery hunting will be open from the opening of the firearms season
until the close of the State archery season. All state regulations pertaining to archery and firearms deer hunting
will apply. Deer hunting will be monitored by refuge officers and State game wardens. Hunter numbers, number of deer
taken, and refuge deer populations will be monitored. The refuge will be open to all holders of a North Dakota 2E deer
hunting permit and all those with a valid North Dakota deer archery permit. The Service projects that 100-150
deer hunting visits will occur each year. If excessive harvest or winter mortality problems are evident, alternative
management would be proposed. 


Opening the refuge to the hunting of deer has been found to be compatible in a separate compatibility determination.
This determination noted also that most migratory birds will have migrated south prior to the opening of the State
deer hunting season. A Section 7 evaluation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act was conducted and it was determined
that the hunt is not likely to adversely affect any Federally listed or proposed for listing threatened or endangered
species or their critical habitats. Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an environmental
assessment was made and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made regarding the hunt. All neighbors and farm
operators in the local area were contacted about the hunt and they concurred with the proposed hunt. The environmental
assessment was prepared by the Devils Lake Wetland Management district and Wetland Habitat Office, Bismarck, North
Dakota, and with the assistance of the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. As the deer hunt will be monitored cooperatively
by refuge personnel and State game wardens, no special funding will be required to monitor and control the hunt. Refuge
monitoring would be a collateral duty of certain refuge personnel. No special refuge permits will be required. Therefore,
the Service has determined that there would be sufficient funds to administer the proposed hunt pursuant to the requirements
of the Refuge Recreation Act. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1018-0014. The information
is being collected to assist the Service in administering these programs in accordance with statutory authorities
which require that 
recreational uses be compatible with the primary purposes for which the areas were established. The information
requested in the application form is required to obtain a benefit. 

The public reporting burden for the application form is estimated to average six (6) minutes per response, including
time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing the form. Direct comments on the
burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to the Service Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, 1849 C Street, NW, MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork
Reduction Project (1018-0014), Washington, DC 20503. 



Economic Effect 



This rulemaking was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has revealed that the rulemaking would
not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations
or governmental jurisdictions. This rule would have minimal effect on such entities. 



Federalism 



This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environmental Considerations 



Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)),
an environmental assessment has been prepared for this opening. Based upon the Environmental Assessments, the Service
issued a Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the opening. A Section 7 evaluation was prepared pursuant
to the Endangered Species Act with a finding that no adverse impact would occur to any identified threatened or endangered
species.

SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) adds two national wildlife refuges (NWR(s)) to the list of areas open
for migratory game bird hunting, upland game hunting, and/or big game hunting and pertinent refuge-specific regulations
for those activities. The Service has determined that such uses will be compatible with and, in some cases, enhance
the purposes for which each refuge was established. The Service has further determined that this action is in accordance
with the provisions of all applicable laws, is consistent with principles of sound wildlife management, and is otherwise
in the public interest by providing additional recreational opportunities of a renewable natural resource.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 National wildlife refuges are generally closed to hunting and sport fishing until opened by rulemaking. The Secretary
of the Interior (Secretary) may open refuge areas to hunting and/or fishing upon a determination that such uses are
compatible with the purpose(s) for which the refuge was established, and that funds are available for development,
operation, and maintenance of a hunting or fishing program. The action must also be in accordance with provisions
of all laws applicable to the areas, must be consistent with the principles of sound wildlife management, and must
otherwise be in the public interest. This rulemaking opens two refuges to hunting. The hunting programs included
in this openings document have refuge-specific hunting regulations which are included in this rulemaking. 



A proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36342) and comments from the public were solicited. No comments were received. However, the
proposed rule indicated that big game hunting at Columbia National Wildlife Refuge and sport fishing at Delevan National
Wildlife Refuge may be closed. After consulting further with the Regional Office, a decision has been made to not close
these refuges to those activities. 



Statutory Authority 



The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, as amended (NWRSAA) (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge
Recreation Act of 1962 (RRA) (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the 
administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically, Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes
the Secretary to permit the use of any areas within the National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) for any purpose,
including but not limited to hunting, fishing, public recreation and 
accommodations, and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the purposes for which each refuge
was established. The Service administers the Refuge System on behalf of the Secretary. The RRA gives the Secretary
additional authority to administer refuge areas within the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate
incidental or secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purposes
for which the refuges were established. In addition, prior to opening refuges to hunting or fishing under this Act,
the Secretary is required to determine that funds are available for the development, operation, and maintenance
of the permitted forms of recreation. 



Openings Packages 



In preparation for these openings, the refuge units have included in their ``openings packages'' for Regional review
and approval from the Washington Office the following documents: a hunting/fishing plan; an environmental assessment;
a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or an Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision; a Section
7 evaluation or statement, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, that these openings are not likely to adversely
affect a listed species or critical habitat; a letter of concurrence from the affected States; and refuge-specific
regulations, as provided herein. From a review of the totality of these documents, and for each refuge unit specifically,
the Secretary determines that the opening of the areas to hunting are compatible with the principles of sound wildlife
management and will otherwise be in the public interest. 

In accordance with the NWRSAA and the RRA, the Secretary has also determined that these openings for hunting are compatible
and consistent with the primary purposes for which each of the refuges listed below was established, and that funds
are available to administer the programs. The hunting programs will be generally within State and Federal (migratory
game bird) regulatory frameworks. A brief description of the hunting programs follows:

1. Rydell National Wildlife Refuge 


The Service will open Rydell National Wildlife Refuge to the hunting of white-tailed deer. Rydell was established
in 1992 to preserve and enhance important wildlife habitat in western Minnesota and provide a regional wildlife and
fish management education center. The 2,120-acre refuge is located in Grove Park and Woodside Townships in Polk County,
just south of U.S. Highway 2 between the communities of Mentor and Erskine, Minnesota. The refuge is situated in the
Prairie Pothole Region of western Minnesota between the flat Red River Valley flood plain on the west and the rolling
hardwood forest and lake region on the east. The refuge is administered as a unit of the Detroit Lakes Wetland Management
District (DLWMD). The DLWMD, which has its headquarters near Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, also currently administers
155 Waterfowl Production Areas, 322 perpetual wetland easements and 14 Farmers' Home Administration (FmHA) Conservation
Easements in the five northwestern Minnesota counties of Becker, Clay, Mahnomen, Norman and Polk. Diverse habitat
on the refuge attracts an impressive variety and abundance of wildlife. Besides a large white-tailed deer population,
refuge habitat is used by both dabbler and diver waterfowl species, moose, mink, ruffed grouse, cormorants, herons,
rabbits, raccoon, otter, beaver, muskrat, various hawk and owl species, and more than 100 neotropical, water and
other migratory bird species. 
Opening the refuge to the hunting of white-tailed deer has been found to be compatible in a separate compatibility
determination. This finding was based on findings that (1) hunting is widely recognized by wildlife managers as an
integral part of a comprehensive wildlife conservation management plan; (2) the deer population of the refuge and
surrounding area has become so large that habitat damage and excessive crop depredation is occurring; (3) reducing
the deer population would improve the health and condition of the deer herd, eliminate the damaging effects of over-population
on refuge habitat and reduce the depredation damage caused by deer on crops that surround the refuge; and (4) deer hunting
would provide wildlife-oriented recreational opportunities in an area of Minnesota where hunting and fishing are
important recreational activities. 
Historically, this area of Minnesota has attracted large numbers of deer, especially in winter, because both prairie
and woodland habitat were available. Over the past 25 years, the previous owner actively encouraged deer to use the
area by planting many acres of lure crops, limiting hunting pressure and providing a high degree of protection for
the deer herd. Because of this, the deer population has increased and been concentrated in the relatively small refuge
area. Today, the refuge and surrounding area host a white-tailed deer population of about 300 during the spring and
fall and up to 500 in the winter. Preliminary surveys indicate that winter densities range from 18 to 20 deer per square
mile of the total land area of the refuge and 100 deer per square mile of forested habitat in the 27 square-mile area that
includes and surrounds the refuge. A large proportion of these deer use the three square-mile area of the refuge extensively
throughout the year. The refuge winter deer population is estimated at 60 to 70 deer per square mile of the total land
area of the refuge and more than 200 per square mile of forested habitat. Over-population by deer is evident by the presence
of browse lines in the refuge woodlands. The goal of the hunt is to lower the deer population to within the statewide
density range (1-15 per square mile of the total land area and 5-80 per square mile of forested habitat).
Field studies will be conducted to monitor habitat conditions and population dynamics to determine what the appropriate
deer population should be for the refuge and surrounding area. 
The Special Permit Area (SPA) will be hunted during the State's 4A and 4B firearms seasons. The SPA covers approximately
2,000 acres, excluding refuge facilities and occupied building sites. About 1,200 acres of the SPA are deemed huntable
during a normal hunting season. Initially, until the herd is reduced and under control, only antlerless deer would
be taken. As many as 60 permits will be issued for the two-day 4A season and up to 80 permits would be issued for the four-day
4B season. The maximum hunter density would be one hunter per 15 acres. Hunter and Service personnel safety will determine
the actual number of permits that are issued each season.

A Section 7 evaluation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act was conducted for the hunt. The refuge is in the breeding
range of bald eagles. Eagles also use the refuge regularly for feeding; however, they will have migrated south by the
time the firearms deer season opened in November. The refuge is in the peripheral range of the gray wolf; however, no
wolves have ever been seen on the refuge. The tight controls of the hunt will make the chance illegal take of a gray wolf
unlikely. While western prairie fringed orchids have been found in Polk County, no populations have been identified
on the refuge. Even if such a population were discovered, they would be dormant during the hunting season. The proposed
action is not likely to adversely affect any Federally listed or proposed for listing threatened or endangered species
or their critical habitats. 
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an environmental assessment was conducted and a Finding
of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made regarding the proposed hunt. Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District
and refuge staff, along with input from local Minnesota Department of Natural Resources representatives, were primarily
responsible for the development of the alternatives reviewed in making the FONSI conclusion. Refuge objectives
and Service concerns guided the process. Public needs and expectations were also taken into consideration during
the development of the alternatives. 
The annual cost of this hunting program will be approximately $3,000. Within the annual DLWMD budget of $676,000,
the necessary funds will be available for the development, operation and maintenance of this program pursuant to
the Refuge Recreation Act. 


2. Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge 


The Service will open Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge to the hunting of migratory game birds, upland game
hunting, and big game hunting. Established in 1990, the refuge became the first national wildlife refuge in West Virginia.
The refuge consists of 9 islands in the Ohio River. The acquisition boundary stretches 362 river miles from Shippingport,
Pennsylvania to Manchester, Ohio and includes four states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky). The
refuge was established under the authority of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956. The refuge's primary purpose is for
the development, advancement, management, conservation, and protection of fish and wildlife resources. This purpose
was further defined by the objectives stated in the refuge's management plan to include (1) the management and protection
of wildlife habitat, (2) the management and protection of wildlife populations, and (3) to allow appropriate public
uses including, but not limited to, hunting, fishing, trapping, wildlife observation and environmental education.

Twenty species of waterfowl have been recorded using the islands and associated riverine habitats of the Ohio River.
The majority of these waterfowl are migratory, using the river and island habitats as feeding and resting areas. More
than 5,800 individual waterfowl were observed using the islands during the 165 island visits from February 1992 to
September 1993. The take of migratory game birds will include waterfowl, coots, gallinules, rails, snipe, woodcock
and mourning dove. Seasons on the refuge will coincide with the appropriate State seasons. The take of all other migratory
birds will be prohibited. The migratory game bird hunting program will currently encompass 7 islands and 429 acres.
Aside from woodcock hunting, all migratory game bird hunting will, in reality, occur only on the shoreline perimeter
of the islands, which constitutes approximately 80 acres (15% of the current refuge acreage). 


Cottontail rabbits and fox squirrels are present on the Ohio River islands, with current numbers variable depending
on specific islands and their habitats. Much of the island habitats have succeeded beyond the early to late oldfield
habitats preferred by cottontail rabbits, and food available for fox squirrels is limited mostly to soft mast. However,
it is felt that these species are present in huntable populations. The refuge season for these species will coincide
with the appropriate State seasons. Method of take will be restricted to shotgun only for safety reasons. The take
of all other upland game, including turkey, grouse, pheasant, and quail, will be prohibited. 


White-tailed deer are found in varying numbers on the Ohio River Islands. The size and habitat conditions on each island
are different and deer utilization reflects this. Deer move
