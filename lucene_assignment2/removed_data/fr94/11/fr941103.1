Federal Grain Inspection Service

7 CFR Part 68


Fees for Beltsville Commodity Testing Laboratory Services


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Grain Inspection Service, USDA.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS), under authority of the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946, is
proposing to increase service fees charged by the FGIS Commodity Testing Laboratory at Beltsville, Maryland. FGIS
is also proposing to establish a test and unit fee for vomitoxin testing at the Laboratory.


These revisions are necessary to cover, as nearly as practicable, the projected operating costs, including related
supervisory and administrative costs, for commodity laboratory testing services.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act


This rule has been determined to be significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has been reviewed
by the Office of Management and Budget.
This proposed increase in the service fees is necessary to recover operating losses at the Beltsville Commodity Testing
Laboratory. These fees were last increased on December 17, 1984 (57 FR 59887), and due to increases in operating costs,
revenue is not covering operating costs. The overall cost of operating the laboratory increased between FY 92 and
93 by more than 8 percent. This cost increase occurred simultaneously with a more than 17 percent downturn in revenue
due to fewer service requests. Revenue of $1,035,411 did not cover the operating cost of $1,192,669 for FY 93, resulting
in a 1-year operating loss of $157,228. Given FY 93 volume, the proposed fee increase will generate revenue of $1,394,577
or an increase of $355,224.
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Federal Grain Inspection Service has determined that this proposed
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. This proposed rule will not pre-empt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies
unless they present irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be
exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to provisions of this rule.


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification


David R. Shipman, Acting Administrator, FGIS, has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601


et seq

.) because most users of the official commodity laboratory testing services do not meet the requirements for small
entities. In addition, FGIS is required by statute to recover the costs of providing official commodity laboratory
testing services, as nearly as practicable.

Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements



In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the previously approved information
collection and recordkeeping requirements concerning applications for inspection services, including official
commodity laboratory testing services, have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number
0580-0013.



Background



The fees for commodity laboratory testing services were last increased August 1, 1984, (49 FR 26547). Subsequent
adjustments were made on April 17, 1991, (56 FR 15483), adding several new laboratory test services and consolidating
others for clarity and efficiency. Currently, these fees appear in section 68.90, Table 4 of the regulations (7 CFR
68.90, Table 4).

FGIS is adding a vomitoxin laboratory testing service to the current list of fees, 7 CFR 68.90, Table 4. The new test
is required to accommodate frequent grain and food industry requests for this service.

FGIS continually strives to contain operating costs through program efficiencies and streamlining. In fiscal year
1992, FGIS took specific action to reduce chemical disposal costs by implementing new technology. FGIS further enhanced
laboratory procedures to improve overall efficiency. While these changes proved successful in reducing certain
costs, the overall cost of operating the laboratory increased between FY 92 and 93 by more than 8 percentum. This cost
increase occurred simultaneously with a more than 17 percentum downturn in revenue due to fewer service requests.
Revenue of $1,035,441 did not cover the operating cost of $1,192,669 for fiscal year 1993, resulting in a 1-year operating
loss of $157,228.

Given fiscal year 1993 volume, the proposed fee increase will generate revenue of $1,394,577 or an increase of $355,224.



Proposed Action



Section 203(h) of the AMA (7 U.S.C. 1622(h)) provides for the establishment and collection of fees that are reasonable,
and as nearly as practicable, to cover the costs of the services rendered.

These fees cover the FGIS administrative and supervisory costs for the performance of official services. FGIS costs
include personnel compensation, personnel benefits, travel, rent, communications, utilities, contractual services,
supplies, and equipment.

Section 68.90, Table 4 (as currently shown in section 68.90, Table 4 of the regulations) is revised to provide for the
increase in laboratory commodity testing fees and the addition of the vomitoxin laboratory testing as outlined in
the background.

The increased fees for laboratory tests are: Aflatoxin test (other than TLC or Minicolumn), Aflatoxin (TLC), Aflatoxin
(Minicolumn), Appearance & Odor, Ash, Bacteria count, Baking test (cookies), Bostwick (uncooked/cook test/dispersibility),
Brix, Calcium, Carotenoid Color, Cold test (oil), Cooking test (other than corn soy blend), Crude fat, Crude fiber,
Dough handling (baking), E. coli, Falling number, Fat (acid hydrolysis), Fat-stability (A.O.M.), Flash point (point
& closed cup), Free fatty acid, Hydrogen ion activity (pH), Iron enrichment, Linolenic acid (fatty acid profile),
Lovibond color, Moisture, Moisture & volatile matter, Performance test (prepared bakery mix), Peroxide value,
Pesticide residue (carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, ethylene dibromide), Phosphorus, Popcorn kernels (total
defects), Popping ratio/value popcorn, Potassium bromate, Protein, Salmonella, Salt or sodium content, Sanitation
(light filth), Sieve test, Smoke point, Solid fat index, Unsaponifiable matter, Urease activity, Visual exam (hops
pellet), Visual exam (insoluble impurities, oils, and shortening), Visual exam (pasta), Visual exam (processed
grain products), Vitamin enrichment, and Water activity.

Request for Comments Regarding Potential Modifications of NRC's Therapy Regulations


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments regarding potential modification of NRC's medical therapy regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A major revision of the regulations governing the medical use of byproduct material, and associated licensing and
inspection guidance is planned, to more easily accommodate changes in current technology and patterns of medical
use. The staff discussed the need for additional regulations and guidance for brachytherapy (in particular, high-dose-rate
brachytherapy) with NRC's Advisory Committee for the Medical Uses of Isotopes (ACMUI). The ACMUI advised the staff
to solicit additional information from the regulated community to sufficiently identify and evaluate the problems
and determine what additional regulations and guidance are necessary to further prevent errors. The NRC seeks input
from the medical community with regard to the adequacy of existing standards and procedures for brachytherapy and
radiopharmaceutical therapy and would like to discuss the future direction of guidelines and regulations. As one
aspect of these objectives, NRC is publishing this list of issues and questions for comment and response by members
of the medical community and any other interested parties.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Because of several recent incidents, the NRC has increasingly focussed on the medical use of byproduct material for
manual and remote afterloading brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy. The NRC has been notified of brachytherapy
errors that have included computer errors (treatment planning and data entry), misplaced sources, dislodged sources,
patient intervention, and human error. In particular, several incidents have been reported involving an error in
fractionated doses for brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy. In addition, there has been an increased
use of beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic purposes in both nuclear medicine and radiation oncology.


This list of issues and questions is being provided to allow the medical community to voluntarily provide comments
and responses regarding those areas of medical use of byproduct material that are currently being reviewed by NRC,
to determine if additional or revised regulations are warranted. Any party interested in providing input regarding
these issues may provide a written response to the address above.

Discussion



Background



On March 8, 1993, Hamilton Standard applied for an amendment to the type certificate of Model 247F propeller. This
propeller uses a new electronic propeller and pitch control system in place of the primary governor control and synchrophaser
unit.


</SUPPLEM>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-1-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The existing propeller pitch control is normally monitored by a governor which senses propeller speed and adjusts
the pitch to absorb the engine power and thus keeps the propeller at the correct RPM. When the primary governor fails,
the propeller pitch is controlled by an overspeed governor.

This type of system is conventional and its airworthiness considerations are addressed by part 35 of the FAR's.

Hamilton Standard requests special conditions to install an electronic propeller and pitch control in place of the
primary governor control and synchrophaser unit for the Model 247F propeller. This control is designed to operate
with existing mechanical and hydraulic interface of the engine and propeller.

Electronic propeller and pitch controls introduce potential failures that can result in unsafe conditions. These
types of failures are not addressed by the requirements of part 35. These failures can lead to the following possible
unsafe conditions:

(1) Loss of control of the propeller
(2) Instability of a critical function
(3) Unwanted change in propeller pitch causing improper thrust/overspeed
(4) Unwanted action of a critical control function resulting in propeller flat pitch or reverse.

Certification issues that must be addressed are possible loss of aircraft-supplied electrical power, aircraft
supplied data, failure modes, environmental effects including lightning strikes and high intensity radiated fields
(HIRF) and software design.

The FAA finds that under the provisions of  21.16 of the FAR, additional safety standards must be applied to the
Hamilton Standard electronic propeller control for Model 247F propellers to demonstrate that it is capable of acceptable
operation.



Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of  21.17 of the FAR, Hamilton Standard must show that the Model 247F propeller meets the
requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those FAR's are  21.21
and part 35, effective February 1, 1965, as amended.

The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 35, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for the Model 247F propeller. Therefore, the Administrator proposes special conditions
under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR's after public notice and
opportunity for comment, as required by   11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification
basis in accordance with  21.101(b)(2).



Novel or Unusual Design Features



Because of the unusual design features of the Hamilton Standard 247F propeller with electronic propeller and pitch
control, the FAA proposes special conditions under  21.16 of the FAR.



Conclusion



This action affects only the Hamilton Standard Model 247F propeller with a new system of electronic propeller and
pitch control. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for
approval of these features on the propeller.

The Proposed Special Conditions


Accordingly, the FAA proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the Hamilton
Standard 247F Model propeller with electronic propeller and pitch control system.
Considering that electronic propeller and pitch controls introduce potential failures that can result in unsafe
conditions, the following special conditions are proposed:
(a) Each propeller and pitch control system which relies on electrical and electronic means for normal operation
must:
(1) Be designed and constructed so that any failure or malfunction of aircraft-supplied power or data will not result
in an unacceptable change in propeller pitch setting or prevent continued safe operation of the propeller.
(2) Be designed and constructed so that no single failure or malfunction, or probable combination of failures of electrical
or electronic components of the propeller control system, result in an unsafe condition.
(3) Be tested to its environmental limits including transients (variations) caused by lightning and high intensity
radiated fields (HIRF) and demonstrate no adverse effects on the control system operation and performance or resultant
damage. These tests shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(i) Lightning strikes, such as multiple-stroke and multiple-burst
(ii) Pin-injected tests to appropriate wave forms and levels
(iii) HIRF susceptibility tests
(4) Be demonstrated by analysis/tests that associated software is designed and implemented to prevent errors that
would result in an unacceptable change in propeller pitch or an unsafe condition.
(5) Be designed and constructed so that a failure or malfunction of electrical or electronic components in the propeller
control system will not prevent safe operation of any remaining propeller that is installed on the aircraft.

Thiodipropionic Acid and Dilauryl Thiodipropionate; Proposed Removal of GRAS Status; Withdrawal of Proposed Rule


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; withdrawal.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing its proposal to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate
from the list of direct human food ingredients that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). FDA proposed to remove
these substances because it had not, at that time, received any reports that these substances were in use as direct
human food ingredients. The agency is withdrawing the proposal because of a report that these substances are being
directly used in food.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate are listed in   182.3109 and 182.3280 (21 CFR 182.3109
and 182.3280), as GRAS for direct food use as chemical preservatives at levels not exceeding 0.02 percent of the fat
or oil content. Thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate are listed in  181.24 (21 CFR 181.24) as
prior-sanctioned ingredients for use as antioxidants in food-packaging material, and are permitted for use as antioxidants
in  175.300 

Resinous and polymeric coatings

 (21 CFR 175.300). In addition, indirect use of thiodipropionic acid is listed in  178.2010 

Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.2010).


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1982 (47 FR 35240), FDA proposed to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate from
the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS. FDA stated that it was proposing to take this action because
FDA had not, at that time, received any reports that these substances were in use as direct human food ingredients.
FDA received three comments in response to its proposal. All three comments opposed the removal of these substances
from the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS. One of the comments contained information on the direct
use of these ingredients in food. In addition, two of the comments expressed concern that removing these compounds
from the list of direct GRAS ingredients would cause confusion about the GRAS or prior-sanctioned status of these
substances for indirect uses. Finally, two of the comments stated that the fact that the agency had not received any
reports of these substances being used in food was not an adequate reason to remove them from the list of direct food
ingredients that are GRAS.
FDA has considered all of these comments. In view of the comment that these substances are being directly used in food,
we have concluded that the orginal basis for the agency's proposal to remove these substances from the GRAS list is
not valid. FDA also wishes to clarify that its proposal to remove these substances from the list of direct human food
ingredients that are GRAS would not have affected their allowed indirect uses under   175.300, 178.2010,
or 181.24, as suggested by two of the comments. 
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.

), the agency announces that it is withdrawing the proposal that it published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1982 (47 FR 35240), to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate from the list of direct
human food ingredients that are GRAS.

The EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky
through the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet approving the redesignation to attainment
and maintenance plan of the Owensboro and Edmonson County areas because they meet the maintenance plan and redesignation
requirements. EPA also proposes to approve the 1990 baseline emissions inventory of the two areas. In the final rules
section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the Commonwealth's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency
views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for
the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the
direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested
in commenting on this document should do so at this time.

ACTION:

 Termination of rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document terminates a rulemaking proceeding that commenced in March 1985 when NHTSA granted a petition for rulemaking
from the United States Army Tank-Automotive Command. The petition requested that NHTSA amend Standard No. 106, 

Brake Hoses, 

to require brake hose compatibility with a brake fluid with DOT 5 characteristics, and amend Standard No. 116, 

Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids, 

to require compatibility of DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 test fluids with elastomeric seals and cups in hydraulic brake system
master and wheel cylinders. After receiving further information from the petitioner and after reviewing its own
data base, NHTSA has concluded there is no safety need to amend the standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background and Grant of Petition 


On March 20, 1985, NHTSA published a 

Federal Register

 document (50 

FR

 11213) granting a petition for rulemaking submitted by the United States Army Tank-Automotive Command (ATAC), to
amend Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Nos. 106, 

Brake Hoses, 

and 116, 

Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids. 

The petitioner requested NHTSA to expand the number and type of ``referee materials'' used to test samples of brake
hose (Standard No. 106) and brake fluid (Standard No. 116) for compliance with the requirements of those standards.

Referee materials are used in the test procedures of Standards Nos. 106 and 116 to represent typical fluids and components
that are present in real-world brake systems. The referee materials are combined with the test sample of brake hose
or fluid to determine the compatibility of the referee material and the test sample. At the time the petition was filed,
Standard No. 106 referenced a referee material called RM-1 SAE Compatibility Fluid to test hydraulic brake
hose and hose assemblies.

 Standard No. 116 also referenced RM-1 SAE Compatibility Fluid to test samples of DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 brake fluid.
In addition, Standard No. 116 referenced another referee material, ``SAE referee cups'' made of styrene butadiene
rubber (SBR), to test the compatibility of test samples of DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 brake fluid with the material. In all
cases involving the use of referee materials, the referee materials are combined with the test sample of hose or fluid
to see the effect of the combination. For example, in Standard No. 116's test evaluating the effect of brake fluid on
cups (S5.1.12), the referee SBR cups are immersed in the test fluid, heated, then examined for disintegration, hardness
changes and diametrical changes.

ATAC requested that Standard Nos. 106 and 116 be amended in two primary ways. First, the petitioner suggested that
Standard No. 106 be amended to require brake hose compatibility with a fluid with DOT 5 (silicone) brake fluid characteristics.
ATAC stated that the U.S. Army adopted DOT 5 silicone brake fluid as its standard operating fluid for its motor vehicles
with hydraulic brake systems. After replacing the brake fluid with DOT 5 fluid in some of its vehicles, the Army had
operational problems with aftermarket procured hydraulic brake system components. The Army believed it had traced
the problem to excessive swelling of elastomeric seals and cups within the hydraulic brake system master cylinder.
The swelling appeared to be caused by incompatibility problems between the DOT 5 brake fluid and brake system components
made of rubber. Since Standard No. 106 does not test brake hose and hose assemblies with a referee material brake fluid
representing DOT 5 (silicone) fluid, ATAC suggested amending Standard No. 106 to require brake hose compatibility
with a silicone fluid. 
Second, ATAC suggested that Standard No. 116 be amended to require that master and wheel cylinder cups made of ethylene
propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) be compatible with a DOT 3, DOT 4 and DOT 5 brake fluid referee material, and to
include specifications for these EPDM and other rubber components. The tests in Standard No. 116 that measure the
effect of brake fluid with rubber are run with SAE referee material SBR cups only. ATAC believed that the aftermarket
EPDM brake system components it encountered were incompatible with the DOT 5 brake fluid in its vehicles. 
The agency believed that the issues raised by ATAC warranted further consideration. Thus, NHTSA granted ATAC's petition.



Rationale for Termination 


Subsequent to its petition, ATAC provided further information to NHTSA indicating that its problem had been resolved.
Tests conducted by the Army at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, implied that there was some confusion as to what actually caused
the problem in the braking systems of the vehicles in question. Nevertheless, ATAC informed NHTSA that it solved its
problem by using only military specification (MIL spec) brake components and brake fluid in ATAC vehicles. ATAC indicated
that EPDM and SBR components that met the Army's MIL-C-14055, ``Cup, Hydraulic Brake Actuating Cylinder,
Synthetic Rubber'' specification perform satisfactorily with silicone brake fluid. ATAC further indicated that
if MIL spec MIL-C-14055 were used for parts procurement, it would avoid any problems of component deterioration
in the future. 
NHTSA supplemented this information with data for non-military motor vehicles. NHTSA believed that if brake fluid
compatibility problems similar to those experienced by ATAC were occurring in non-military vehicles, the public
would have reported some of these incidents to NHTSA's Auto Safety Hotline. The Hotline is a comprehensive database
that encompasses over 250,000 consumer calls, dating back to 1981, relating to vehicle and component performance
and complaints. Approximately 35,000 of these calls are about brake-related performance. NHTSA conducted a database
search for all complaints relating to brake fluid in passenger cars, light trucks, buses and heavy trucks, and found
no evidence of a safety problem. The agency found only 17 complaints that referred to ``brake fluid'' as the basis for
the complaint. The majority of the complaints referred to contamination problems (water, fuel, and other fluid intrusion
into the brake fluid).
Moreover, approximately 8 of the 17 complaints concerned vehicles that had traveled fewer than 50,000 miles. Because
of their relatively low mileage, NHTSA does not believe these vehicles had anything other than the original brake
fluid in them. Given the preponderance of vehicles manufactured with DOT 3 fluid over vehicles manufactured with
DOT 5 fluid, the agency believes the original brake fluid in the vehicles in question was DOT 3 fluid, not DOT 5 fluid.
There was one complaint referring to a problem with ``silicone'' brake fluid and brake system components, involving
an antique Jaguar car and a certain brand of silicone fluid. A single complaint in a database as encompassing as the
Hotline complaint file does not indicate the possible existence of a significant safety problem.
 
In conclusion, there is no evidence of a safety problem regarding the compatibility of silicone fluid and brake system
components. NHTSA believes that if there were a safety problem with brake fluid and component compatibility, evidence
of the problem would have appeared in the ten years since ATAC's petition was received by NHTSA. No such evidence has
manifested. Accordingly, the agency is terminating this rulemaking action.
