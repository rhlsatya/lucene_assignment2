<DOCTITLE>Bear Valley Ski Area Expansion, Stanislaus National Forest, Alpine County, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement, delay in filing final environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for the expansion of the Mt. Reba Ski Area was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on Friday, October 30, 1981, 46 FR 53734. A Revised Notice of Intent setting new dates for the release of the draft environmental
impact statement (DEIS) and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was published in the 

Federal Register

 on Thursday, September 23, 1982, 47 FR 42011. Another Revised Notice of Intent setting new dates for the release of
the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) and the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on Friday, July 7, 1989, 54 FR 28704. 



The scoping process included numerous public meetings and Forest Service interdisciplinary team analysis. The
DEIS was released on December 20, 1990. Five alternatives were identified, including a No Action Alternative, a Full
Development Alternative, and a Preferred Alternative which would authorize a 450 acre expansion. The primary issues
addressed include transportation system, parking, and local community services effects. The decision to be made
is to select an Alternative or modify an Alternative(s) in response to the ski area expansion proposal. The comment
period for the DEIS ended March 4, 1991. In June of 1991, a change of ownership of the permitted facilities occurred
and a new Special Use Permit was issued to the Bear Valley Ski Company.
Due to planning priorities on the Forest, and in order for the new Bear Valley Ski Company to have time to evaluate the
expansion proposal, the expansion planning project was put aside until the fall of 1992. During the latter part of
1992 and early 1993, the planning process was once again put on hold when the Forest Service was developing a policy
and program to address management of spotted owl habitat in California. In the summer of 1993, the Forest Service made
a decision that any spotted owl potential habitat would be evaluated prior to final approval of actual habitat disturbing
activity. This cleared the continuation of the planning process.
The estimated date for filing the FEIS is August, 1994.

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications for its Shreveport, Louisiana Minority Business Development Center (MBDC).



The purpose of the MBDC Program is to provide business development services to the minority business community to
help establish and maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate
public and private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of client services
to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority business.
The MBDC will provide service in the Shreveport, Louisiana Area. The award number of the MBDC will be 06-10-95004-01.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (13 months)
from March 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15%, $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those likely to further the
purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award.

The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,'' is not applicable to this program. Federal funds for this project include audit funds for non-CPA recipients.
In event that a CPA firm wins the competition, the funds allocated for audits are not applicable. Questions concerning
the preceding information can be answered by the contact person indicated above, and copies of application kits and
applicable regulations can be obtained at the above address. The collection of information requirements for this
project have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB control number 0640-0006.

Awards under this program shall be subject to all Federal laws, and Federal and Departmental regulations, policies,
and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards.



Pre-Award Costs



Applicants are hereby notified that if they incur any costs prior to an award being made, they do so solely at their own
risk of not being reimbursed by the Government. Notwithstanding any verbal assurance that an applicant may have received,
there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover pre-award costs.



Outstanding Account Receivable



No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either
the delinquent account is paid in full, repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received, or
other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made.



Name Check Policy



All non-profit and for-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal
if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges
such as fraud, theft, perjury or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty
or financial integrity.

Award Termination



The Departmental Grants Officer may terminate any grant/cooperative agreement in whole or in part at any time before
the date of completion whenever it is determined that the award recipient has failed to comply with the conditions
of the grant/cooperative agreement. Examples of some of the conditions which can cause termination are failure to

<DOCTITLE>Universal Service and Open Access to Telecommunications and Information Networks; Electronic Virtual Public Conference;
Meetings </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Virtual Public Conference on ``Universal Service and Open Access to Telecommunications and Information
Networks.'' 

 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and the Universal Service Working Group
of the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) will host an electronic Virtual Conference during the week of
November 14-18, 1994. The Virtual Conference will culminate a year-long effort by the Clinton Administration
to gather information and opinions about the issues of universal service and open access with respect to telecommunications
and information networks. 


 

The Conference is part of the Administration's initiative to promote the development of a National Information Infrastructure
(NII) and Global Information Infrastructure (GII). The Administration's report entitled the National Information
Infrastructure: Agenda for Action, released on September 15, 1993, describes the benefits of networking technology
and the potential for using the NII to create an electronic commons. The report includes the Administration's goals
of extending universal service to the information infrastructure and using the NII to conduct government business.
In addition, the Administration will be issuing in December, the Global Information Infrastructure Agenda for Cooperation,
which will address universal service issues in the global arena, among other issues. 


 The Virtual Conference will be conducted entirely through electronic networks_using the Internet, dial-up bulletin
board access, public information service providers, and commercial service providers. Although participants
may use their own computers, NTIA and the Universal Service Working Group seek to facilitate nationwide access by
encouraging public institutions to make their computer facilities available to the public during the week of the
conference. 


 Information collected during this conference and previously through field hearings will assist the Administration's
ongoing policy deliberations and may be used in future reports on universal service and open access. 



How the Conference Will Be Conducted 


 

During the week of November 14-18, 1994, NTIA will create a series of electronic discussion groups on specific
topics. Each topic will have an Internet mailing list and USENET newsgroup devoted to discussion of the specific topics
and hosted by an expert in the field. Any comments submitted as part of this electronic discussion will become part
of a publicly available electronic archive. Topics to be discussed at the Virtual Conference are:

 
 

 
_

Redefining Universal Service and Open Access:

 What is the minimum ``basket'' of telecommunications or information services or capabilities that all Americans
should be able to obtain today? Which services or capabilities, if any, should be available to all Americans on an optional
basis? What is the relationship between universal service and open access? 
 

 _

Affordability and Availability:

 Who lacks telecommunications services and why? Should training in the use of more advanced network services be available
to all who wish it? Who should pay for such training? How can rural concerns and inner city concerns best be accommodated
under a new universal service concept? How can government balance the need for universal service with the benefits
of a competitive environment for the telecommunications industry? 
 

 _

Intellectual Property:

 Does the traditional legal framework for intellectual property work with digital technology? What are the respective
roles of the government and the private sector in determining how authors and others who hold intellectual property
rights are reimbursed? Does the current legal framework for intellectual property rights help or hinder accessibility
to telecommunications and information networks? 
 

 _

Privacy:

 What potential is there for telecommunications and information networks to compromise personal privacy? To what
extent will perceptions of reduced privacy hinder widespread, seamless access to telecommunications and information
networks? 
 

 _

Interoperability:

 What is the relationship between interoperability and the concepts of universal service and open access? What are
the respective roles of the marketplace and the government in determining standards and protocols for interoperability?
What lessons can be learned from past efforts in standards setting, both domestically and internationally? 
 

 _

Universal Service and Open Access for Individuals with Disabilities:

 What is the current state of access to telecommunications and information services for the disabled? How can such
services help the disabled participate more fully in society? What design concepts for the disabled are transferable
to all users to improve overall network functionality?

 


 
Participants in the Virtual Conference are encouraged to review the following two documents recently issued by NTIA
and to comment on these documents electronically during the conference: (1) NII Field Hearings on Universal Service
and Open Access: America Speaks Out, and (2) Notice of Inquiry (NOI) on Universal Service and Open Access Issues. Comments
written on paper in response to this NOI are being received by NTIA and should be filed on or before December 14, 1994,
to receive full consideration. Both documents already are available through NTIA's IITF Gopher Server at iitf.doc.gov,
dial in to (202) 501-1920, and NTIA's Bulletin Board Service at (202) 482-1199, ntiabbs.ntia.doc.gov
(telnet, gopher or world-wide web). 



Call for ``Public Access Points'' 


 

Libraries and universities, as well as state and local governments, are encouraged to make their facilities available
to the public during the week of the Conference. Providing these public gateways will demonstrate the power of networking
and facilitate access for those who might not otherwise be able to participate. In order to register as a site, please
see the contact information below.

<USDEPT>CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Notification of Proposed Collection of Information; Structured Group Interviews Regarding the Use of Baby Walkers
and the Acceptability of Alternate Products </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Consumer Product Safety Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1981 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the Consumer Product Safety Commission
has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval of a proposed collection of information
in the form of a series of structured interviews of parents and adult caretakers of young children concerning use of
baby walkers and the acceptability of alternative products. The requested expiration date is April 1, 1995. 



A baby walker is a device that supports a child so that the child can use its feet to move about before or while learning
to walk. Typically, a baby walker consists of a fabric seat which has leg openings and is mounted to a rigid plastic deck.
The deck is attached to a base which usually is mounted on wheels to allow mobility. 

Earlier this year, the Commission published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to announce that the agency
is considering whether mandatory design, performance, or labeling requirements may be needed to eliminate risks
of death and injuries to young children associated with baby walkers. In 1993, an estimated 25,000 children were treated
in emergency rooms for injuries associated with baby walkers. The majority of these injuries resulted from falls
down stairs or steps. 

To issue a mandatory safety rule for baby walkers, the Commission is required by law to make and support findings about
the expected effects of the rule on the cost, utility, and availability of the products which would be subject to those
requirements. 

The Commission plans to interview six groups of approximately 12 persons each. The individuals in these groups will
be parents or adult caretakers of young children. The participants will be asked to describe their perceptions of
the benefits, if any, and disadvantages, if any, of conventional baby walkers. Participants will also be asked about
the acceptability of various products which might be substituted for conventional baby walkers. 

The Commission will use this information to assess the utility of baby walkers to consumers; to determine if mandatory
performance, design, or labeling requirements would diminish the utility of baby walkers, and if so, to what extent;
and to evaluate consumer acceptance of alternatives to baby walkers. 
The Commission has requested clearance of this request for approval of a collection of information within 30 days
in accordance with provisions of regulations implementing the Paperwork Reduction Act (5 CFR 1320.18).

<DOCTITLE>Computer Matching Program; Notice </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice_Computer matching between the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. 





Section 5301(a)(1) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (now designated as section 421(a)(1) of the Controlled Substances
Act (20 U.S.C. 862(a)(1)) includes provisions regarding the judicial denial of federal benefits. Section 5301 authorizes
federal and state judges to deny certain federal benefits (including student financial assistance under Title IV
of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended) to individuals convicted of drug trafficking or possession. 

In order to ensure that Title IV student financial assistance is not awarded to individuals subject to denial of benefits
under court orders issued pursuant to section 5301, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education implemented
a computer matching program. The current computer matching agreement expired on September 5, 1994. The Department
of Education must continue to obtain from the Department of Justice identifying information regarding individuals
who are the subject of section 5301 denial of benefits court orders. The purpose of this notice is to announce the continued
operation of the computer matching program and to provide certain required information concerning the computer
matching program. 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection
Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-503), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the Conduct of Matching
Programs (see 54 FR at 25818, June 19, 1989), and OMB Bulletin 89-22, the following information is provided:




1. Names of Participating Agencies 



The Department of Education (ED) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). 



2. Purpose of the Match 



This matching program is designed to assist ED in enforcing the sanctions imposed under section 5301 of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690). 



3. Authority for Conducting the Matching Program 



Under section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, as amended (21 U.S.C. 862), ED must deny federal benefits to any
individual against whom a federal or state court order has imposed a penalty denying eligibility for those benefits.
Student financial assistance under Title IV of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) is a federal benefit under section 5301 and ED must, in order to meet its
obligations under the HEA, have access to information about individuals who have been declared ineligible under
section 5301. 



The President's Denial of Federal Benefits 



Implementation Procedures of August 30, 1989 direct DOJ to act as the clearinghouse for federal agencies. While DOJ
provides information about section 5301 individuals who are ineligible to the General Services Administration
(GSA) for inclusion in GSA's List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs, DOJ
and ED have determined that matching against the DOJ data base would be more efficient and effective than access to
the GSA List. The DOJ data base has specific information about the Title IV, HEA programs for which individuals are
ineligible and has more complete identifying information about those individuals than does the GSA List. Both of
these elements are essential for a successful match. 



4. Categories of Records and Individuals Covered 



A. Department of Education Records 



Federal Student Aid Application File (18-40-0014): Composed of records of students applying for federal
student financial assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The social security number and the first two letters of an applicant's
last name will be used by ED for the match. 



B. Department of Justice Records 



Denial of Federal Benefits Clearinghouse System (DEBAR) 
(OJP-0013): Contains the names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and other identifying information
regarding individuals convicted of federal or state offenses involving drug trafficking or possession of a controlled
substance who have been denied federal benefits by federal or state courts. This system of records also contains information
concerning the specific program(s) for which benefits have been denied. The Department of Justice will make available
for the matching program the records of only those individuals who have been denied federal benefits under one or more
of the Title IV, HEA programs. 



5. Effective Dates of the Matching Program 



The matching program will become effective 40 days after a copy of the agreement, as approved by the Data Integrity
Board of each agency, is sent to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, or 30 days after publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register

, whichever date is later. The matching program will continue for 18 months after the effective date and may be extended
for an additional 12 months, if the conditions specified in 5 U.S.C. 522a(o)(2)(D) have been met. 



6. Address for Receipt of Public Comments or Inquiries 



Ms. Edith Bell, Program Specialist, Policy Development Division, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence
Avenue SW, (Room 4318, ROB-3), Washington, DC 20202, Telephone: (202) 708-7888. Individuals who use

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>

for Operation of the Glass Melter Thermal Treatment Unit at the 

U.S. Department of Energy's Mound Plant, Miamisburg, OH 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has prepared an environmental assessment (DOE/EA-0821) for the proposed
operation of the Glass Melter thermal treatment unit (``Glass Melter'') at DOE's Mound Plant in Miamisburg, Ohio.
The Glass Melter would thermally treat mixed waste (hazardous waste contaminated with radioactive constituents,
largely tritium, plutonium-238, and/or thorium-230) that was generated at the Mound Plant and is now in storage by
stabilizing the waste in glass blocks. Depending upon the radiation level of the waste, the Glass Melter may operate
for as short a time as one year, but not longer than six years. DOE considered two onsite alternatives to the proposed
action and seven offsite alternatives. 





Based on the analysis presented in the environmental assessment, DOE believes that the proposed action does not constitute
a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

 Therefore, DOE proposes to issue a finding of no significant impact. This proposed finding of no significant impact
is being made available for public review. DOE will consider any 

comments received in making a final determination on whether to issue a finding of no 

significant impact or to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed operation of the Mound Plant
glass melter thermal treatment unit.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed action would bring the Mound Plant Glass Melter out of cold shutdown mode and use it for treating mixed
waste that was generated at the Mound Plant and is now in storage. The Glass Melter, housed in an annex of the Liquid Waste
Disposal Building, consists of a burn chamber of stainless steel (lined with refractory material) with an exhaust
(offgas) system connected to a system of pipes and scrubbers ending in a stack. (Scrubbers are devices that remove
small particles, gasses, and airborne radionuclides generated during thermal treatment.) Waste in sealed drums
would be transported by truck from the Mound Hazardous Waste Storage Building or Radioactive Mixed-Waste Storage
Building to the annex, staged on a concrete loading dock adjacent to the annex, and then moved individually to a fume
hood in the annex where the contents would be transferred into a feed system for processing in the melter. The waste
would be added to molten soda-lime silica glass in the burn chamber of the Glass Melter. Ash from the combustion process
would fall to the glass surface, where it would be incorporated into the melt. When the molten glass would reach a prescribed
chemical mix (or a prescribed level of radioactivity), it would be discharged from the melter into 
19 liter (five gallon) containers. The containers would then be transferred to a storage area in the building using
mechanical aids (e.g., hoists and a roller conveyor system) to cool and to await transport by truck to existing onsite
storage facilities. 



The Glass Melter would have an estimated annual capacity of approximately 48,000 kg (106,000 lb) of wastes, based
on an average throughput of 23 kg/hour (51 lb/hr) and a 2,080-hour work year. As originally proposed by the Department,
and as analyzed in the environmental assessment, operating at this capacity would have enabled DOE to eliminate the
existing backlog of approximately 43,000 kg (95,000 lb) of mixed waste in approximately six years, while processing
hazardous and mixed wastes [approximately 39,000 kg (86,000 lb) annually of nonradioactive solvents and mixed wastes]
as generated. 

Since the environmental assessment was written, DOE has decided to close the Mound Plant. DOE proposes, therefore,
to use the Glass Melter only for the mixed waste backlog. DOE has not yet fully characterized this waste for radioactive
contamination levels. The radiation level of the waste feed would be limited by the need to comply with the Environmental
Protection Agency's National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants and by internal Mound limitations.
If, after characterization, the radiation level of the waste is determined to be low enough that the capacity of the
Glass Melter would be the factor controlling the processing rate, then the schedule for treatment of the backlog waste
could be as short as one year. 

The environmental impacts of the proposed treatment of only the mixed waste backlog are adequately covered, and are
bounded by, the analysis in this environmental assessment, because calculations of radiological exposures and
impacts were based on assumptions of waste radioactivity content that would exceed the actual content under the current
proposed action. (According to the environmental assessment, the mixed waste backlog is estimated to have a total
activity of 211 curies of tritium and 0.42 curies of plutonium-238; the calculations for Glass Melter operations,
however, are based on a total waste activity content of 
240 curies/yr of tritium and 0.48 curies/yr of plutonium-238.) The discussion below, which is based on the environmental
assessment, therefore, would apply equally to 
the new proposed action. If the Department later proposes to use the Glass Melter to 
treat other than mixed waste backlog, it will undertake appropriate further review under the National Environmental
Policy Act. 

Routine operation of the Glass Melter would generate treated offgas, scrubber sludge, scrubber liquid effluent,
and several solid waste streams. The sludge generated by the scrubbing operations [approximately 770 kg (170 lb)
per year] would be transferred by pipeline (1) back to a Glass Melter feed port for reprocessing, (2) to an existing
cementation process for immobilization in concrete, or (3) to container storage for any subsequent additional treatment
required under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) land disposal restrictions. Filtered liquid scrubber
effluent [approximately 36,000 kg (79,000 lb) per year], depending on its composition, would be (1) pumped to an existing
wastewater treatment facility, (2) pumped to the cementation process for immobilization as concrete (if the waste
processed involved significant tritium concentrations), or (3) packaged for any subsequent additional treatment
required under RCRA land disposal restrictions. Most liquid effluent would be treated at Mound's existing radioactive
wastewater treatment facility and released via an existing outfall permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System. 

The Glass Melter would generate, per year, approximately 3,200 kg (7,000 lb) of glass block (mixed waste); 8,900 kg
(20,000 lb) of cementized scrubber effluent and sludge (also mixed waste); and 1,900 kg (4,200 lb) of maintenance
wastes (filters, replacement parts, etc.). (The maintenance wastes will generally be considered mixed waste, although
certain of the replacement parts may have only surface radioactive contamination or may not be hazardous waste.)
The mixed wastes would be stored onsite until a mixed waste disposal facility is available.

The immediate result of Glass Melter treatment would be the conversion of waste that is primarily liquid and combustible
to a stable, inorganic form that would present very little environmental concern in storage. Most of the waste would
eventually require transport to a radioactive mixed waste land disposal facility. (Any waste that is not mixed waste
would be disposed of with other, similar Mound wastes, e.g., hazardous waste is shipped offsite for disposal.) 


Environmental Impacts:

 In a series of test burns conducted in January 1985, the Glass Melter demonstrated the capability to thermally treat
hazardous wastes in compliance with regulatory requirements. In June 1987, the Glass Melter was further tested and
demonstrated effective treatment of low-level radioactive waste while meeting applicable regulatory requirements.
Proposed future treatment of wastes using the Glass Melter would also meet all applicable environmental requirements.
The Glass Melter is considered a ``thermal treatment unit,'' not an ``incinerator'' under the Environmental Protection
Agency regulations (40 CFR 260.10). Under the regulations for miscellaneous treatment, storage, and disposal units
(40 CFR Part 264, Subpart X), any permit for the glass melter may include appropriate conditions from the incinerator
regulations (Subpart O). Thermal treatment is one of the limited options DOE currently has to meet the requirement
for site treatment plans under the Federal Facility Compliance Act. 
The Environmental Protection Agency issued a Draft Strategy for Combustion of Hazardous Waste in Incinerators and
Boilers on May 18, 1993, initiating a reexamination of its existing regulations and policies on waste combustion.
In the draft strategy the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that, ``if conducted in compliance with regulatory
standards and guidance, combustion can be a safe and effective means of disposing [of] hazardous wastes.'' To the
extent that the Glass Melter would destroy hazardous wastes it would effectively ``dispose'' of that portion of the
mixed waste backlog. Nevertheless, the thermal treatment of mixed wastes would 
necessitate the disposal of treatment residues as a mixed waste, which would be stored pending final disposal in an
approved location. 
Emissions of nonradiological pollutants to the air during routine operations of the Glass Melter would include arsenic,
cadmium, chromium, lead, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. Predicted concentrations
of nonradiological pollutants would meet applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standards and the maximum acceptable
ground-level concentrations established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. During routine operations
of the Glass Melter the effective dose equivalent of radiation to the maximally exposed individual at the Mound Plant
boundary [approximately 470 meters (510 yd) north-northeast from the Glass Melter stack] would be 0.07 mrem/year
(tritium, plutonium-238, and 
thorium-230) from inhalation and ingestion pathways. These emissions would not cause the Mound Plant to exceed the
individual effective dose equivalent limit of 10 mrem/year in the Environmental Protection Agency's National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Based on the 1990 population distribution surrounding the Mound Plant,
the collective effective dose equivalent to the total population residing within 80 km (50 mi) of the facility would
be 2.6 person-rem/year. The environmental assessment shows that the health risk from such exposures would be very
small.

Onsite personnel would not be exposed to unique hazards and would be adequately protected from potential exposure
to radionuclides or other hazards by the existing health and safety programs. Existing facility design features
would reduce direct worker contact with radioactive materials. 

The formation of dioxins from Glass Melter operation would be virtually precluded due to specific technological
design features of the equipment. For instance, the elevated operating temperatures of the Glass Melter would result
in a high destruction and removal efficiency (99.9999% in test burns). In addition, the rapid cooling of the offgases
below dioxin-forming temperatures, as recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency for municipal waste
incinerators, would also be used to preclude dioxin formation. 

The worst reasonably foreseeable accident involving the Glass Melter would be a fire on the loading dock that would
result in the complete vaporization of the contents of ten mixed waste storage drums. The estimated frequency of such
an accident is once every 100,000 years. The effective dose equivalent to the maximally exposed individual [approximately
200 m (220 yd) downwind] would be 0.2 mrem, well below Environmental Protection Agency standards. The environmental
assessment shows that the health risk from such exposures would be very small. Predicted concentrations of nonradiological
pollutants would meet the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's maximum acceptable ground-level concentrations.
Taking account of the low probability of such an event and the small magnitude of the consequences, the health risk
posed by the accident is insignificant. 

No endangered species, critical habitats, floodplains, wetlands, or historical or archaeological resources would
be affected by the proposed action. 



Alternatives Considered:

 In the environmental assessment, DOE considered two onsite alternatives to the proposed action and seven offsite
alternatives in the context of the original proposed action (i.e., assuming the continuing operation of the Mound
Plant). The discussion below, however, while being based on the environmental assessment, reflects the current
proposed use of the Glass Melter following DOE's decision to close the Plant, which is to treat only mixed waste backlog.


 

No Action.

 The present practices of waste storage and disposal would continue and the Glass Melter would not be used. Most of the
mixed waste backlog is liquid, and much of it is combustible. Storage of the untreated waste, therefore, could adversely
impact human health and the environment, especially in the case of a fire in the storage facility. 

 

Administrative Action.

 Another alternative would be to rely upon the established Mound Waste Minimization and Pollution Prevention program
to identify, screen, and analyze options to reduce the generation of waste. Waste that is in storage would not be affected
by this program. The need for treatment options would persist. 

 

Offsite Treatment and Disposal.

 These alternatives would involve the transportation of mixed wastes to designated sites. DOE considered seven options
for offsite treatment. All of the offsite treatment alternatives (i.e., all offsite alternatives except the Nevada
Test Site) would involve thermal treatment.

 


_

Quadrex HPS, Inc. (Gainesville, FL)

. This commercial facility cannot accept certain of the Mound mixed wastes, so this alternative would not, by itself,
address the need to treat such wastes.

_

Diversified Scientific Services, Inc. (Kingston, TN). 

This commercial facility could accept most of the mixed waste from Mound. Treatment, however, may be restricted by
air permit conditions limiting the type of waste used for fuel and by Environmental Protection Agency regulations
for boilers and industrial furnaces (40 CFR 266.100-112 and Appendices I-IX). 


_

Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). 

INEL has a permitted incinerator facility, the Waste Experimental Reduction Facility (WERF), capable of burning
radioactive material and hazardous waste. WERF is currently shut down, and its operation is contingent upon completion
of National Environmental Policy Act review and DOE approval of a Safety Analysis Report. The current waste acceptance
criteria for WERF limit the radioactive and chloride content of wastes and prohibit receipt of any free liquids. These
criteria would prohibit the acceptance at WERF of almost all of the waste proposed for treatment in the Glass Melter.
The criteria could not be changed without substantial upgrades to WERF. 

_

Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

The proposed Controlled Air Incinerator is currently being permitted and undergoing National Environmental Policy
Act review for operation at production capacity. Current operational plans do not include acceptance of offsite
wastes, and the draft RCRA permit proposes to prohibit treatment of offsite waste. 

_

Savannah River Site. 

DOE is currently constructing the Consolidated Incinerator Facility under a construction permit from the State
of South Carolina that does not allow out-of-state waste to be treated in the facility. DOE is preparing an environmental
impact statement on waste management at the Savannah River Site, which will include further analysis of operation
of the Consolidated Incinerator Facility and other volume reduction alternatives. Trial burns and operation of
the facility are being deferred until the completion of the environmental impact statement process. 


_

Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. 

The incinerator at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant currently treats mixed waste. The primary sources of waste
treated at this incinerator are the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and
the Oak Ridge Reservation. A substantial backlog of waste exists that will take several years to treat. Thus, this
alternative would not be available to Mound for several years and would not meet Mound's immediate needs. 

_

Nevada Test Site.

 Disposal of mixed waste at the Nevada Test site is considered a possible alternative to treatment in the Glass Melter.
Land disposal restrictions under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act would require, however, that any mixed
waste be treated before disposal. The Nevada Test Site would only, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for Mound
waste already treated at another facility. DOE has not yet decided to what extent the Nevada Test Site would be used
for future disposal of offsite waste; such decisions will be made after completion of the Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and the Nevada Test Site Sitewide Environmental
Impact Statement.




Proposed Determination 



Based on the information and the analysis in the environmental assessment, DOE believes the proposed action (operation
of the Glass Melter for treatment of backlog mixed waste only) does not constitute a major Federal action that would
significantly affect the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy
Act. Therefore, DOE proposes to issue a finding of no significant impact and not require the preparation of an environmental
impact statement. DOE will make a final determination after considering the comments received during a 30-day public
comment period.

<DOCTITLE>NorAm Gas Transmission Co.; Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Line F Replacement Project</DOCTITLE>



October 28, 1994.




The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC of Commission) has prepared an environmental assessment
(EA) on the natural gas facilities proposed by NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT) in the above-referenced dockets.

The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that
approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the proposed Line F Replacement Project including:




 Construction of about 90.9 miles of 20-inch-diameter pipeline to replace about 87 miles of 20-inch-diameter
pipeline on Line F in Caddo, Bossier, Webster, Claiborne, Lincoln, Union, and Ouachita Parishes, Louisiana;

 Rerouting a portion of Line F included in the above 90.9 miles of replacement pipeline to connect Line F directly
to the Ruston Compressor Station in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana;

 Reclassification of about 8.2 miles of Line F as a low-pressure gas supply line and operate it as part of Line
F-1-F in Caddo Parish, Louisiana;

 Abandonment of Line 1-F in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, a 0.8-mile-long, 20-inch-diameter storage line
no longer needed after the reroute of Line F;


 Abandonment of Line FT-5 in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, a 0.9-mile-long, 10-inch-diameter gas supply
line, no longer needed after the reroute of Line F;

 Construction of 10 new metering and regulating facilities at various locations on Line F;

 Abandonment of 66 delivery taps on Lines F, 1-F, and FT-5 installed to deliver gas to rural customers
served by Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company;

 Construction of about 2.2 miles of 20-inch-diameter pipeline (Line ACT-4) in Hot Spring County, Arkansas;

 Installation of one 2,200-horsepower compressor unit and the rearrangement and upgrading of existing facilities
at the existing Ruston Compressor Station in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana;

 Abandonment of about 0.4 mile of Line S in Harrison County, Texas; and

 Uprating the maximum allowable operating pressure on NGT's Line S from 880 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)
to 930 psi in Harrison County, Texas; Caddo, Bossier, and Webster Parishes, Louisiana; and Columbia County, Arkansas.






NGT indicates that the Line F Replacement Project would enhance the safety, reliability, and efficiency of its pipeline
system.

The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104, Washington,
DC 20426, (202) 208-1371.

Copies of this EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
newspapers, and parties to this proceeding.

A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental
Review and Compliance Branch I, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7312, PR-11.1, 825 North Capitol Street,
N.E., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208-0325.

Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket Nos. CP94-267-000
and -001 and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426.

Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than November 28, 1994 to ensure consideration
before a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be sent to Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Environmental
Project Manager, Room 7312 at the above address.


Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any
person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR 385.214).

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your comments considered.

Additional information about this project is available from Ms. Lauren O'Donnell, Environmental Project Manager.

<DOCTITLE>Peak Power Corp., Kvaerner Venture, Inc., and Las Vegas Energy Storage Limited Partnership; Notice of Intent To Prepare
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings and a Site Visit</DOCTITLE>



October 28, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application to construct and operate the proposed
Sheep Mountain Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 11367. The off-stream project would be located approximately
19 miles south of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. This proposed project would involve federal lands managed by the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the FERC staff intends to direct a third-party contractor
in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (Pub. L. 91-190. 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347, January 1,
1970, as amended by Pub. L. 94-52, July 3, 1975, Pub. L. 94-83, August 9, 1975, and Pub. L. 97-258,  4(b),
September 13, 1982). The EIS will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts
of the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis.
BLM will be a cooperating agency on the EIS.

The Draft EIS (DEIS) will be circulated for review and comment by all interested parties, and FERC will hold a public
meeting for the DEIS. FERC and BLM will consider and respond to comments received on the DEIS in the Final EIS. The FERC
staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching
its final licensing decision. BLM will use the information in the EIS to make its decision on issuing a right-of-way
grant for the project.

Scoping: Affected landowners, concerned citizens, special interest groups, local governments, and any other interested
parties are invited to comment on the scope of the environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. Scoping
will help ensure that all significant issues related to this proposal are addressed in the EIS, and also will identify
significant or potentially significant impacts that may result from the proposed project.

The FERC will conduct two scoping meetings on November 15 and 16, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented towards the public
will begin at 7:30 p.m. on November 15, 1994, at the Clark County Library located at 1401 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas,
Nevada. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will begin 1:30 p.m. on November 16, 1994, at the BLM offices
located at 4765 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada. (The public and the agencies may attend either or both meetings, however.)

Objectives: At the scoping meetings FERC staff will (1) identify preliminary environmental issues related to the
proposed project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis;
(3) identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EIS; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of,
the staffs' preliminary views.

Procedures: The meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) thereby become
a part of the official record of the Commission proceedings for the Blue Diamond South Project. Individuals presenting
statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.

To help focus discussions at the scoping meeting, FERC will mail a Scoping Document I, outlining subject areas to be
addressed in the EIS, to agencies and interested individuals on the project mailing list. Copies of the scoping document
will also be available at the scoping meetings.

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record at the meetings. In addition, written scoping comments
may be filed with Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC
20426 until December 12, 1994. All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first
page: Sheep Mountain Pumped Storage Project, FERC No. 11367-000.

Intervenors_those on the Commission's service list for this proceeding (parties)_are reminded of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document
on each person whose name appears on the official service list. Further, if a party or interceder files comments or
documents with the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular
resource agency, they must also serve a copy of the document on that resource agency.

Site Visit: A site visit to the Sheep Mountain Project is planned for November 15, 1994. Attendees will meet at the parking
lot of the Gold Strike Casino, located in Jean, Nevada (east side of route 15) at 9 a.m. Those who wish to attend should
contact Mike Strzelecki at (202) 219-2827.

For Further Information Contact: Mike Strzelecki, FERC-OHL, (202) 219-2827 or Roy Lee, BLM Las Vegas

<DOCTITLE>CNG Transmission Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



October 27, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. CNG Transmission Corp. 



[Docket No. CP95-32-000] 



Take notice that on October 21, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West
Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP95-32-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural
Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon certain pipelines, measurement and regulating stations, compressor
stations, and rights-of-way as well as certain firm transportation points, all located within Boone, Kanawha and
Raleigh Counties, West Virginia by sale to Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation (Cabot), all as more fully set forth in the
application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

The facilities that CNGT proposes to abandon were transferred to CNGT from its predecessor, (now Hope Gas, Inc.) effective
January 1, 1984. The transfer and classification of assets was approved by the Commission in Docket No. CP80-346-000
on December 20, 1983. Facilities constructed since 1984 have been added under CNGT's blanket certificate granted
at 21 FERC 62,172 (1982) in Docket No. CP82-537-000. 

The facilities are currently used to gather and transport gas for CNGT's system supply and to render interruptible
transportation service for various shippers. In addition, CNGT provides firm transportation for Hope Gas, Inc.
(Hope), an affiliate of CNGT. Hope makes sales to individual consumers along the facilities and has its own distribution
facilities connected to the facilities. No interruption of Hope's consumer service will occur. 



Cabot or a subsidiary will provide non-jurisdictional gathering service for the transportation provided by CNGT
to producers on the pipelines to be sold to Cabot. Associated with this filing, Cabot or a Cabot subsidiary will file
a Petition for Declaratory Order Disclaiming Jurisdiction relating to the facilities being abandoned and transferred
to Cabot. 



Comment date: 

November 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Williams Gas Processing_Kansas Hugoton Co.



[Docket No. CP95-12-000]



Take notice that on October 5, 1994, Williams Gas Processing_Kansas Hugoton Company (WGP-KHC), P. O. Box 3102,
Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP95-121-000 a petition for declaratory order requesting
that the Commission declare that the facilities to be acquired from Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) are gathering
facilities exempt from the Commission's Regulations pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA, all as more
fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

WGP-KHC states that it would, pursuant to a Transfer and Assignment Agreement dated October 3, 1994, between
WGP-KHC and WNG, acquire at net book value, all of WNG's Kansas Hugoton gathering facilities located in Finney,

4. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation 

 

[Docket No. CP95-34-000] 


 

Take notice that on October 24, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue,
S.E., Charleston, West Virginia 25314-1599, filed in Docket No. CP95-34-000 an application pursuant

 Columbia proposes to replace approximately 1.3 miles of deteriorating 18-inch pipeline located in Greene and Madison
Counties, Ohio and designated as Columbia's Line A, with approximately 1.3 miles of 20-inch pipeline. Columbia states
that the sections proposed here for replacement were constructed in 1944 and 1948, using coupled pipeline and are
the last coupled sections of Line A between Howell and Mt. Sterling Stations to be replaced. Columbia reports that
recent examinations of Line A have confirmed general corrosion to the extent that replacement is required in order
to maintain service to Columbia's existing customers.

Columbia states that it has concluded that since 18-inch pipeline is a non-standard size and the cost difference in
using 20-inch pipe in place of 18-inch pipe is minimal, it will use 20-inch pipe for all future age and condition replacements
on this line. Columbia asserts that the change in pipeline size will create a 

de minimus

 increase of less than 300 Dth/d of added capacity. Columbia estimates the cost of the proposed construction to be $557,200.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp.; Notice of Request Under Blanket Authorization </DOCTITLE>



October 28, 1994. 



Take notice that on October 20, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP95-28-000 a request pursuant to   157.205, 157.216 and
157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216, 157.212) for authorization
to abandon certain facilities and to construct and operate upgraded replacement facilities, under TGPL's blanket
certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-426-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

TGPL proposed to expand its existing Gordonsville, Louisa County, Virginia Delivery Point (Gordonsville) by removing
and retiring the existing meter station and constructing a new meter station and two twelve-inch taps at milepost
1523.38 on its ``B'' and ``C'' main lines. TGPL states that it currently delivers up to 2,000 Mcf of gas per day, on a firm
basis, to Commonwealth Gas Services, Inc. (Commonwealth) at Gordonsville. TGPL asserts that the new facilities
would enable it to deliver an additional 67,000 Mcf of gas per day, on an interruptible basis, to Commonwealth. TGPL
mentions that Commonwealth would deliver up to 66,500 Mcf/day of this gas to a new cogeneration plant to be owned by
Gordonsville Energy Limited Partnership and up to 500 Mcf/day to the City of Gordonsville. TGPL avers that it has sufficient
system delivery flexibility to accomplish these additional deliveries at Gordonsville without detriment to its
other customers and that it is not proposing to alter the total volumes of gas authorized for delivery to Commonwealth.

TGPL states that the estimated cost of the proposed facilities is $1,333,537 and the Commonwealth would reimburse
TGPL for all costs associated with these facilities. TGPL also asserts that it would obtain all required environmental
clearances prior to the commencement of any abandonment or construction work in the vicinity of Gordonsville. 
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefore, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the procedures for disbursement
of $100,697.87, plus accrued interest, in refined petroleum product violation amounts obtained by the DOE pursuant
to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order issued to Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay), Case No. LEF-0074. The
OHA has determined that the funds obtained from Beacon Bay, plus accrued interest, will be distributed to customers
who purchased gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



In accordance with 10 C.F.R. 205.282 (b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $100,697.87,
plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order. In the Remedial Order, the DOE
found that, during the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay had sold motor gasoline at prices in
excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. 

The OHA has determined to distribute the funds obtained from Beacon Bay in two stages. In the first stage, we will accept
claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay who may have been injured by overcharges. The specific
requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section III of the Decision. Claimants
who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the number of gallons of gasoline
which they purchased from Beacon Bay. 

If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance
with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07.


Applications for Refund must be postmarked by May 1, 1995. Instructions for the completion of refund applications
are set forth in the Decision that immediately follows this notice. Applications should be sent to the address listed
at the beginning of this notice. 

Unless labelled as ``confidential,'' all submissions must be made available for public inspection between the hours
of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings
and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585.

Decision and Order of the Department of Energy
Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 





Name of Firm: 

Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. 


Date of Filing: 

July 20, 1993. 


Case Number: 

LEF-0074.

 


On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to distribute the
funds which Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. (Beacon Bay) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a June 21, 1982 Remedial Order.
Beacon Bay has remitted $100,697.87 pursuant to the order, to which $3,919.39 in interest has accrued as of September
30, 1994. In accordance with the provisions of procedural regulations at 10 C.F.R. part 205, subpart V (subpart V),
the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects
of regulatory violations set forth in the Remedial Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute
these funds. 



I. Background 



During the period relevant to this proceeding, Beacon Bay operated 11 retail service stations in Southern California.
The ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Beacon Bay on July 29, 1980. The PRO alleged that, during the period
August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980, Beacon Bay sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling
price, in violation of Federal petroleum price regulations. The DOE amended the PRO and issued a Final Remedial Order
on June 21, 1982, after considering Beacon Bay's objections to the PRO. Beacon Bay Enterprises, 9 DOE  83,039
(1982). On August 23, 1982, Beacon Bay appealed the DOE's Final Remedial Order to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). The FERC issued a Proposed Order on November 15, 1982, Beacon Bay Enterprises, 21 FERC  62,295 (1982),
and an Order on January 25, 1983, Beacon Bay Enterprises, 22 FERC  61,059 (1983), both of which affirmed and adopted
the DOE's Final Remedial Order. Beacon Bay has since remitted $100,697.87 to the DOE, in compliance with the Remedial
Order (the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund), which is now available for distribution through Subpart V. 



II. Jurisdiction and Authority 



The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan for the distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures
to distribute refunds, see Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. 4501 

et seq.;

 Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE  82,508 (1981); Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE  82,597 (1981) (Vickers). 

We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Beacon Bay Remedial
Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's
plan to distribute this fund. 



III. Refund Procedures 



On August 19, 1994, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PD&O) establishing tentative procedures to
distribute the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. That PD&O was published in the 

Federal Register

, and a 30-day period was provided for the submission of comments regarding our proposed refund plan. See 59 FR 44720)
(August 30, 1994). More than 30 days have elapsed and the OHA has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures
for the distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. Consequently, the procedures will be adopted as proposed.


We will implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order Fund. In the first
stage, purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order may submit Applications
for Refund. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants generally with fall
into the following categories: (i) End-users; (ii) regulated entities, such as cooperatives; and (iii) resellers
and retailers. 



A. First-Stage Refund Procedures 



In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline
from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order_August 1979 through March 1980. If the gasoline was
not purchased directly from Beacon Bay, the claimant must establish that the gasoline originated with Beacon Bay.
Additionally, a reseller or retailer claimant, except one who chooses to utilize the injury presumptions set forth
below, will be required to make a detailed showing that it was injured by Beacon Bay's overcharges. This showing will
generally consist of two distinct elements. First, a reseller or retailer claimant will be required to show that it
had ``banks'' of unrecouped increased product costs in excess of the refund claimed.

1

 Second, because a showing of banked costs alone is not sufficient to establish injury, a claimant must also provide
evidence that market conditions precluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additional costs associated
with the overcharges. See Vaqueros Energy Corp./Hutches Oil Co., Inc., 11 DOE  85,070 at 88,105 (1983). Such
a showing could consist of a demonstration that a firm suffered a competitive disadvantage as a result of its purchases
from Beacon Bay. See 

National Helium Co./Atlantic Richfield Corp

., 11 DOE  85,257 (1984), 

aff'd sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. DOE

, 618 F. Supp. 1199 (D. Del. 1985). 





Our experience also indicated that the use of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund
process without incurring inordinate expense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient
manner possible. See, 

e.g., Marathon Petroleum Co

., 14 DOE  85,269 (1986) (

Marathon

). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R.
 205.282 (e). Accordingly, we will adopt the presumptions set forth below.

1. 

Calculation of Refunds. 

First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of Beacon Bay's sales of gasoline
during the period covered by the Remedial Order. In accordance with this presumption, refunds are made on a pro-rata
or volumetric basis.

2

 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally
required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 




Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of the Remedial Order fund is equal to the number
of gallons purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order times the per gallon refund amount.
In the present case, the per gallon refund amount is $0.0690. We derived this figure by dividing the amount of the Remedial
Order fund, $100,697.87, by 1,460,321 gallons, the volume of gasoline which Beacon Bay sold from August 1, 1979 through
March 31, 1980. A claimant that establishes its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable
share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued interest.

3

 




In addition to the volumetric presumption, we will also adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for claimants
in each category listed below. 
2. 

End-Users. 

In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we will adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer
of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the overcharges
resolved by the Remedial Order. See, 

e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp., 

12 DOE  85,069 at 88,269 (1984) (

TOGCO

). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls
during the period covered by the Remedial Order, and were not required to keep records which justified selling price
increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices
of goods and services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. 

Id.


Accordingly, end-users of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay need only document their purchase volumes from Beacon
Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the overcharges.

3. 

Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. 

In order to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmental
agency, i.e. a public utility, or an agricultural cooperative which is required by its charter to pass through cost
savings to its member-purchasers, need only submit documentation of purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative,
sold to its members. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative will also be required to certify that it will notify
the appropriate regulatory body or membership group of the receipt of the refund. See 

Marathon

, 14 DOE at 88,514-15. This requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm,
any overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should
be passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreement which controls
its business operations would ensure that the overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed through to its
member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury.

4

 




4. 

Resellers and Retailers. 

a. 

Small Claims Presumption. 

We will adopt a ``small claims'' presumption that a firm which resold gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay and requests
a small refund was injured by the overcharges. Under the small claims presumption, a reseller or retailer seeking
a refund of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest, will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond documentation
of the volume of gasoline it purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order. See 

TOGCO

, 12 DOE at 88,210. This presumption is based on the fact that there may be considerable expense involved in gathering
the types of data necessary to support a detailed claim of injury; for small claimants the expense might possibly exceed
the potential refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified refund procedures for small claims could deprive
injured parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, the use of the small claims presumption is desirable
in that it allows the OHA to process the large number of routine refund claims expected in an efficient manner.

5

 




b. 

Mid-Level Claim Presumption. 

In addition, a reseller or retailer claimant whose allocable share of the refund pool exceeds $5,000, excluding interest,
may elect to receive as its refund either $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share.

6

 The use of this presumption reflects our conviction that these larger, mid-level claimants were likely to have experienced
some injury as a result of the overcharges. See 

Marathon

, 14 DOE at 88,515. In some prior special refund proceedings, we have performed detailed analyses in order to determine
product-specific levels of injury. See, 

e.g., Getty Oil Co., 

15 DOE  85,064 (1986). However, in 

Gulf Oil Corp.

, 16 DOE  85,381 at 88,737 (1987), we determined that based upon the available data, it was more accurate and efficient
to adopt a single presumptive level of injury of 40 percent for all mid-level claimants, regardless of the refined
product that they purchased, based upon the results of our analyses in prior proceedings. We believe that approach
generally to be sound, and we will therefore adopt a 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all mid-level claimants
in this proceeding. Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentation of its
purchase volumes of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the Remedial Order period in order to be eligible to receive a refund
of 40 percent of its total allocable share or $5,000, whichever is greater.

<TEXT>
 

c. 

Spot Purchasers. 

Finally, we will adopt a rebuttable presumption that a reseller or retailer that made only spot purchases from Beacon
Bay did not suffer injury as a result of those purchases. As we have previously stated, spot purchasers generally had
considerable discretion as to the timing and location of their purchases, and therefore would not have made spot market
purchases from a firm at increased prices unless they were able to pass through the full amount of the firm's selling
price to their own customers. See, 

e.g., Vickers,

 8 DOE at 85,396-97. Accordingly, a spot purchaser claimant must submit specific and detailed evidence to rebut
the spot purchaser presumption and to establish the extent to which it was injured as a result of its spot purchases
from Beacon Bay.

8

 





B. Refund Application Requirements 



To apply for a refund from the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund, a claimant should submit an Application for Refund containing
all of the following information: 

(1) Identifying information including the claimant's name, current business address, business address during
the refund period, taxpayer identification number, a statement indicating whether the claimant is an individual,
corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, or other business entity, the name, title, and telephone number
of a person to contact for any additional information, and the name and address of the person who should receive any
refund check.

9

 If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant
should specify those names; 





(2) The applicant's use of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay: e.g., consumer (end-user), reseller, cooperative,
or public utility; 

(3) A monthly purchase schedule covering the period August 1, 1979 through March 31, 1980. The applicant should specify
the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an applicant should use actual records
from the refund period, if available. If these records are not available, the applicant may submit estimates of its
gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable and must be explained in detail; 

(4) If the applicant was a direct purchaser from Beacon Bay, it should provide its customer number. If the applicant
was an indirect purchaser from Beacon Bay (i.e., it purchased Beacon Bay gasoline through another supplier), it should
submit the name, address, and telephone number of its immediate supplier and should specify why it believes that the
gasoline was originally sold by Beacon Bay; 

(5) If the applicant is a regulated utility or cooperative, certifications that it will pass on the entirety of any
refund received to its customers, will notify its state utility commission, or other regulatory agency, or membership
body of the receipt of any refund, and a brief description of how the refund will be passed along; 

(6) If the applicant is a retailer, reseller, or refiner whose allocable share exceeds $5,000 (i.e., whose purchases
equal or exceed 72,471 gallons), it must indicate whether it elects to rely on the appropriate reseller injury presumption
and receive the larger of $5,000 or 40% of its allocable share. If it does not elect to rely on the injury presumption,
it must submit a detailed showing that it absorbed Beacon Bay's overcharges. See Section III.A.4 

supra; 

(7) A statement as to whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or has authorized any individual to file on its
behalf, any other application in the Beacon Bay refund proceeding. If so, an explanation of the circumstances of the
other filing or authorization should be submitted; 

(8) A statement as to whether the applicant is or was in any way affiliated with Beacon Bay. If the applicant was so affiliated,
it should explain this affiliation, including the time period in which it was affiliated;

<TEXT>
 

(9) A statement as to whether the ownership of the applicant's firm changed during or since the Remedial Order period.
If an ownership change occurred, the applicant should list the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any prior
or subsequent owners. The applicant should also provide copies of any relevant Purchase and Sales Agreements, if
available. If such written documents are not available, the applicants should submit a description of the ownership
change, including the year of the sale and the type of sale (e.g., sale of corporate stock, sale of company assets);


(10) A statement as to whether the applicant has ever been a party in a DOE enforcement action or a private Section 210
action. If so, an explanation of the case and copies of relevant documents should also be provided; 

(11) The statement listed below signed by the individual applicant or a responsible official of the firm filing the
refund application: 

I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true and correct to the
best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the federal
government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I understand that the information
contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application
which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room. 

All applications should be either typed or printed and clearly labeled ``Beacon Bay Special Refund Proceeding, Case
No. LEF-0074.'' Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application. If the applicant believes
that any of the information in its application is confidential and does not wish for this information to be publicly
disclosed, it must submit an original application, clearly designated ``confidential,'' containing the confidential
information, and two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications
should be postmarked no later than May 1, 1995, and sent to: Beacon Bay Special Refund Proceeding, Office of Hearings
and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., Washington, D.C. 20585.

 


In addition, we will adopt the following procedures relating to refund applications filed on behalf of applicants
by ``representatives,'' including refund filing services, consulting firms, accountants, and attorneys. See


Texaco Inc., 

20 DOE   85,147 (1990). Each such filing service shall, contemporaneously with its first filing in the Beacon
Bay proceeding, submit a statement indicating its qualifications for representing refund applicants and containing
a detailed description of the solicitation practices and application procedures that it has used and plans to use.

11

 This statement should contain the following information:

12

 






(1) A description of the procedures used to solicit refund applications in the Beacon Bay proceeding 
and copies of any solicitation materials mailed to prospective Beacon Bay applicants; 

(2) A description of how the filing service obtains authorization from its clients to act as their 
representative, including copies of any type of authorization form signed by refund applicants; 

(3) A description of how the filing service obtains and verifies the information contained in refund 
applications; 

(4) A description of the procedures used to forward refunds to its clients; 

(5) A description of the procedures used to prevent and check for duplicate filings. 

Upon receipt of this information, we may suggest alteration of a filing service's procedures if they do not conform
to the procedural requirements of 10 CFR Part 205 and this proceeding. 

Second, we will require strict compliance with the filing requirements as specified in 10 CFR 205.283, particularly
the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant. 

Third, in any case where an application has been signed and dated before the issuance of this Decision and Order, we
will require a certification statement, signed and dated by the applicant after the date of the issuance of this Decision
and Order. The certification should state that the applicant has not filed and will not file any other Application
for Refund in the Beacon Bay proceeding and that, after having been provided a copy of this Decision and Order, it still
authorizes that filing service to represent it. 

Fourth, we will require from each representative a statement certifying that it maintains a separate escrow account
at a bank or other financial institution for the deposit of all refunds received on behalf of applicants, and that its
normal business practice is to deposit all Subpart V refund checks in that account within two business days of receipt
and to disburse refunds to the applicants within 30 calendar days thereafter. Unless such certification is received
by the OHA, all refund checks approved will be made payable solely to the applicant. Representatives who have not previously
submitted an escrow certification form to the OHA may obtain a copy of the appropriate form by contacting: Marcia B.
Carlson, HG-13, Chief, Docket & Publications Branch, Department of Energy, Washington, D.C. 20585.

 


Finally, the OHA reiterates its policy to scrutinize applications filed by filing services closely. Applications
submitted by a filing service should contain all of the information in this Decision and Order. 



C. Distribution of Funds Remaining After First Stage 



Any funds that remain after all first stage claims have been decided shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C.   4501-07.
The PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not
be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments
for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated those responsibilities to the OHA, and
any funds in the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution
to injured customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the PODRA. 



It Is Therefore Ordered

 That: 

(1) Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Departement of Energy by Beacon Bay Enterprises, Inc. pursuant
to the Remedial Order issued on June 21, 1982, may now be filed. 

(2) Applications for Refund must be postmarked no later than May 1, 1995.

ACTION:

 Notice of Implementation of Special Refund 
 Procedures. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the proposed procedures for disbursement
of the total amount of $5,982.32 in crude oil overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that
DOE issued to Doma Corporation (DOMA) and Don Martin (Martin), Case No. LEF-0049. OHA has determined that the
funds obtained from DOMA and Martin, plus accrued interest, will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified
Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below.
The Decision sets forth the procedures that DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $5,982.32, plus
accrued interest, obtained under the terms of a Remedial Order that DOE issued to Doma Corporation and Don Martin on
July 25, 1985. The Remedial Order found that Doma Corporation and its President, Don Martin, both violated provisions
of the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations involving the sale of crude oil during the period of November
1973 through June 1977. 


OHA will distribute the Remedial Order funds in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy
in Crude Oil Cases (the MSRP). 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided
between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the
states are distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control
period. Refunds to eligible purchasers are based on the total volume of petroleum products purchased and the degree
to which they can demonstrate injury. 
Because the June 30, 1994 deadline for crude oil refund applications has passed, no new applications for purchasers
of refined petroleum products will be accepted for these funds. Instead, the share allocated to these purchasers
will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool used for direct restitution.

Decision and Order of the Department of Energy 
Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


October 27, 1994.





Name of Firm: 

Doma Corporation and Don Martin 


Date of Filing: 

September 17, 1992 


Case Number: 

LEF-0049 



This Decision and Order considers a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures (Petition) filed
by the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) for crude oil overcharge funds. Under the procedural regulations
of the Department of Energy (DOE), ERA may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement
special refund procedures. See Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures, 10 CFR 205.281. These
procedures are used to refund monies to those persons who were injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price
regulations. We have considered ERA's September 17, 1992, request to implement Subpart V procedures with respect
to the monies received from Doma Corporation (DOMA) and Don Martin (Martin) and have determined that such procedures
are appropriate. 
The Petition filed by ERA seeks to implement special refund procedures for monies that were remitted by DOMA and Martin
pursuant to Final Remedial Order No. HRO-0209 (the Order) issued on July 25, 1985, by OHA. Under this Order, DOMA
and Martin were found to have violated provisions of the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during
the period November 1973 through June 1977 (the audit period). A total amount of $5,982.32 has been remitted to the
DOE.

I. Background 


DOMA was incorporated in the state of Texas on May 31, 1973, and was headed by Don Martin, President. Its crude oil trading
activities, during the audit period, were based in Abilene, Texas and consisted primarily of purchasing and reselling
crude oil (without substantially changing its form) to purchasers other than ultimate consumers. DOMA was, therefore,
a reseller as that term is defined at 10 CFR 212.31. 
On June 13, 1979, ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation (NOPV) alleging that during the audit period DOMA committed
violations of DOE regulations in its sales of crude oil. On February 7, 1984, ERA issued an Amended Proposed Remedial
Order (APRO) Case No. 6A0X00111. The APRO alleged that both DOMA and Martin charged prices in excess of the maximum
legal selling price; purchased uncertified barrels of bottoms oil and sold them as new or stripper oil; and miscertified
various petroleum products as new or stripper crude oil in violation of the following statutory provisions: 10 CFR
205.202, 210.62(c), 212.10, .93, .131. 
This Office issued the APRO as a Final Remedial Order to DOMA and Martin on July 25, 1985. See Final Remedial Order at
29. DOMA and Martin have remitted $5,982.32, plus interest, to the Office of Controller, of the Department of Energy.
These funds are available for distribution through Subpart V and currently are being held in an interest-bearing
escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution.



II. Jurisdiction and Authority 


The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify the persons who
were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each
person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of OHA to fashion procedures to
distribute refunds, see 

Office of Enforcement

, 9 DOE  82,508 (1981) and 

Office of Enforcement

, 8 DOE  82,597 (1981). 


III. The Crude Oil Refund Procedures 


A. Crude Oil Refund Policy 


The monies remitted by DOMA and Martin will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP). 

See 

51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). This policy has been utilized in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil
violations. 

See 

Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986) (the August 1986 Order). 
Under the MSRP, 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be refunded to the federal government, another 40
percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may initially be reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The
MSRP also specified that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid will be disbursed
to the federal government and the states in equal amounts. 

See, In re

: 

The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation

, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement)
for a more detailed discussion of the MSRP. 

On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments received in response to the August 1986 Order.
52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). This Notice provided guidance to claimants that anticipated filing
refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. In general, we stated that all claimants
would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through
January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period; and (2) prove they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges.
End-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry would be presumed to have
been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and would not be required to submit proof of injury. 

See City of Columbus, Georgia

, 16 DOE  85,550 (1987). 


B. The Proposed Decision and Order 


On November 12, 1992, OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the crude oil violation amount that had been obtained from DOMA and Martin. The amount of money covered by the PDO is
$5,982.32, plus accrued interest. OHA tentatively concluded that the funds should be distributed in accordance
with the MSRP and the April Notice. Pursuant to the MSRP, OHA proposed to reserve 20 percent of these funds ($1,196)
for direct refunds to applicants who claim that they were injured by the crude oil violations. We stated that the remaining
80 percent of the funds would be distributed to the states and the federal government for indirect restitution. After
all valid claims have been paid, any remaining funds in the claim reserve would also be divided between the states and
the federal government. The federal government's share ultimately would be deposited into the general fund of the
Treasury. 
The PDO proposes evaluating claims for the DOMA and Martin crude oil refund proceeding in exactly the same manner as
OHA has evaluated claims submitted in other crude oil proceedings. Claimants generally will be required to document
their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.
The PDO proposed that the refunds be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount which has been calculated
in accordance with the description in the April Notice. We further stated that the crude oil overcharges were presumed
to have been absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants who were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated
to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Price
and Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751-760h. In order to receive a refund, end-user claimants need
not submit any evidence of injury. 

See Shell

, 17 DOE at 88,406. 
We provided a period of 30 days from the date of the PDO's publication in the 

Federal Register

 in which the public could submit comments regarding the tentative refund procedures. More than 30 days have elapsed,
and OHA has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures. Accordingly, the OHA will finalize the PDO as
set forth below. 
Under the terms of the MSRP, 80 percent of the crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision or $4,785.86 in principal,
plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for indirect restitution.
Accordingly, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to transfer one-half of that amount, or $2,393.00,
plus interest, into an interest bearing subaccount for the states, and one-half, or $2,393.00, plus interest, into
an interest bearing subaccount for the federal government. In accordance with previous practice, when the amount
available for distribution to the states reaches $10 million, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to
make the appropriate disbursement to the individual states. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption
of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds allocated to
each state is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to
the same limitations and reporting requirements that apply to any other crude oil funds received by the states in accordance
with the Stripper Well Agreement.

<TEXT>
 

We must also determine the appropriate method for disbursing the 20 percent of the fund available for direct restitution
($1,196). The application period for crude oil overcharge refunds ended on June 30, 1994. As we discussed in 

King Petroleum, Inc.

, Case No. LEF-0125, August 8, 1994 (Proposed Decision and Order), we will not hold a separate refund proceeding
for monies that become available for direct restitution after the June 30, 1994 closing date. 59 Fed. Reg. 41755 (August
15, 1994). Therefore, the funds in this case ($1,196) will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool for direct
restitution to those applicants who applied by the June 30, 1994 deadline. 
It Is Therefore Ordered That: 
(1) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll, Office of Departmental Accounting and Financial Systems Development,
Office of the Controller, Department of Energy, shall take all steps necessary to transfer $5,982.32, plus accrued
interest, from the DOMA and Martin escrow account Number 6A0X00111Z, as specified in Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of
this Decision. 
(2) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $2,393, plus accrued interest, of the funds referenced
in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-States,'' Number 999DOE003W. 
(3) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $2,393, plus accrued interest, of the funds referenced
in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Federal,'' Number 999DOE002W. 
(4) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $1,196, plus accrued interest, of the funds referenced
in Paragraph (1) above, into the subaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Claimants 4,'' Number 999DOE0010Z. 
(5) This is a final Order of the Department of Energy.

Adjustment. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is given of the confirmation and approval by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) of Rate Order
No. WAPA-63 and Rate Schedule SLIP-F5 placing firm power rates for capacity and energy from the Integrated
Projects of the Western Area Power Administration (Western) into effect on an interim basis. The provisional rates
will remain in effect on an interim basis until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) confirms, approves,
and places them into effect on a final basis or until they are replaced by other rates. 


The provisional firm power rates to be effective from December 1, 1994, through November 30, 1999, consist of an energy
charge of 8.90 mills per kilowatthour (mills/kWh) and a capacity charge of $3.83 per kilowatt month (kW-month), which
result in a composite rate of 20.17 mills/kWh. This is a 7.9-percent increase over the current energy charge of 8.40
mills/kWh and the current capacity charge of $3.54/kW-month which results in a composite rate of 18.70 mills/kWh.
A comparison of existing and provisional rates follows:

Public Notice and Comment 



The Procedures for Public Participation in Power and Transmission Rate 
Adjustments and Extensions, 10 CFR Part 903, have been followed by Western in 
the development of this firm power rate. The provisional firm power rate 
represents an increase of more than 1 percent in total Integrated Projects 
revenues; therefore, it is a major rate adjustment as defined at 10 CFR   
903.2(e) and 903.2(f)(1). The distinction between a minor and a major rate 
adjustment is used only to determine the public procedures for the rate 
adjustment. 

The following summarizes the steps Western took to ensure involvement of 
interested parties in the rate process: 

1. A preliminary 

Federal Register

 notice (FRN), published July 1, 1993 
(58 FR 35449), invited interested parties to participate in the determination of whether an Integrated Projects'
firm power rate increase was 
necessary. Western also invited participation in deciding the issues that 
should be addressed in the process.

2. Several informal meetings were held between the publication of the July 1, 1993, FRN and the beginning of the public
rate adjustment process. These meetings, involving personnel from Western, Reclamation, and represen- tatives
from organizations of interested parties, produced many issue papers that identified and discussed the items which
should be considered in a firm power rate adjustment. Agreement as to how to approach many of the issues was reached
during this time, considerably reducing the number of unresolved issues and easing the later formal public process.


3. On December 27, 1993, letters were mailed from Western's Loveland, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City Area Offices to all
Integrated Projects customers and other interested parties announcing an informal public meeting to be held on January
31, 1994. 

4. At the informal meeting held on January 31, 1994, Western and Reclamation representatives explained the need for
a rate increase and answered questions. 

5. An FRN was published on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19008), officially announc- ing the proposed firm-power rate adjustment,
initiating the public consultation and comment period, announcing the public information and public comment forums,
and presenting procedures for public participation. 

6. On April 22, 1994, a rate announcement package was mailed from Western's Salt Lake City Area Office to all Integrated
Projects customers and other interested parties announcing the publication of the FRN of April 21, 1994, and the beginning
of the formal public process to adjust firm power rates. The package contained (1) a letter announcing the upcoming
public information and comment forums, (2) a copy of the April 21 FRN, and (3) a copy of the April 1994 Integrated Projects
Firm Power Rate Adjustment brochure. Rate announcement packages were mailed to customers served by Western's Loveland
and Phoenix Area Offices on April 25, 1994. 

7. At the public information forum held on May 24, 1994, Western and Reclamation representatives explained the need
for the rate increase in greater detail and answered questions. 

8. The comment forum was held on June 30, 1994, to give the public an opportunity to comment for the record. Four persons
representing customers and customer groups made oral comments. 

9. Nine comment letters were received during the 97-day consultation and comment period. The consultation and comment
period was originally scheduled to end on July 20, 1994. A letter was sent to all interested parties from the SLCAO on
July 19, 1994, stating that Western would continue to accept written comments through July 27, 1994. Letters were
mailed from the Loveland and Phoenix Area Offices on July 20, 1994. All comments submitted by the end of the comment
period have been considered in the preparation of this rate order. 



Project History 



The Integrated Projects consist of the CRSP and the Rio Grande and Collbran Projects. The projects were integrated
for marketing and ratemaking purposes on October 1, 1987. The goals of integration were to increase marketable resources,
simplify contract and rate development and project administration, assure repayment of Collbran and Rio Grande
Projects' costs, and create a common rate. The projects maintain their individual identities for financial accounting
and repayment purposes, but their revenue requirements are integrated into one PRS for ratemaking. 



Power Repayment Studies 



PRSs are prepared each FY to determine if power revenues will be sufficient to pay, within the prescribed time periods,
all costs assigned to power. Repayment criteria are based on law, policies, authorizing legislation, and DOE Order
RA 6120.2. 



Existing and Provisional Rates 



A comparison of the existing and provisional rates follows:






Certification of Rate 



Western's Administrator has certified that the Integrated Projects firm power rate placed into effect on an interim

Discussion 



Many factors influenced this rate adjustment. The items having an impact upon the proposed Integrated Projects firm
power rates are summarized in the table below. Because rates must earn sufficient revenues to pay for estimated future
costs, the table compares the change in the average annual projections used in the FY 1991 Rate Order PRS (which set
the rate effective October 1, 1992) and the ratesetting PRS prepared for this rate adjustment. 










The existing and proposed revenue requirements for the Integrated Projects are as follows: 










The rate increase is necessary to satisfy the cost-recovery criteria set forth in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2. This rate
schedule, which will be effective on an interim basis beginning December 1, 1994, replaces Rate Schedule SLIP/F4
which FERC approved through September 30, 1996 at 62 FERC  61,159 (February 18, 1993). 





Statement of Revenue and Related Expenses 


The following table provides a summary of revenue and expense data through the 5-year proposed rate approval period.







Basis for Rate Development 


The provisional Integrated Projects rate was designed to continue to maintain an approximate 50/50 split between
revenue earned from demand charges and that earned from energy charges. The cost to individual customers will vary
because of differences in the amounts of capacity and energy they purchase from the Integrated Projects. 
The provisional rate contains a $3.83/kW/month firm-capacity charge and an 
8.90 mills/kWh firm-energy charge in FY 1995. The necessary composite rate is 
20.17 mills/kWh, which is an increase of 7.9 percent above the existing rate. 
The rate terminates on November 30, 1999. 


Comments 


During the 97-day comment period, Western received nine letters commenting on the rate adjustment. One letter was
received after the close of the comment 
period. Additionally, four persons commented during the June 30, 1994, public 
comment forum. All comments received by the end of the comment period were 
reviewed and considered in the preparation of this rate order. 
Written comments were received before the comment deadline from the following 
sources: 



Bountiful City Light and Power (Utah)

Most of the comments received at the public meetings and in correspondence 
dealt with cost, purchased power, and water depletion projections. 
The comments and responses, paraphrased for brevity when it does not affect the meaning of the statement(s), are discussed
below. Direct quotes from comment letters are used for clarification where necessary. 
The issues discussed are: (1) Depletion-related issues, (2) purchased power expense, (3) future flow restrictions
at Glen Canyon Dam, (4) O&M-related issues, (5) construction-related projections, (6) environmentally-related
expenses, (7) miscellaneous comments, and (8) issue paper resolution. 


1. Depletion-Related Issues 


Extensive comments were made regarding the deferred recognition of water 
depletions for water projects in the Colorado River Basin after FY 2010. 
Western's responses are listed sequentially: 


a. Comment: 

Western is being guided solely by RA 6120.2 in the rate-setting process without paying sufficient attention to the
CRSP Act 
of 1956 and other relevant legislation. The rate does not accurately 
reflect the intent of the CRSP Act, which is to produce rates that 
result in full repayment of the power system costs.

Response: 

Western disagrees. Western complies with requirements of 
the CRSP Act of 1956, other relevant legislation, and DOE Order 
RA 6120.2 in assuring repayment of all CRSP costs assigned to power. 
Legislation takes precedence when there is conflict with DOE Order 
RA 6120.2. 
Treatment of depletions in the same manner has been approved by FERC 
twice prior to the present rate adjustment. Two of FERC's criteria 
for rate approval are whether the proposed rate will repay all 
obligations assigned to power in full and on time consistent with 
requirements of the CRSP Act and whether the methodology which 
achieves this result is in compliance with DOE Order RA 6120.2. The 
requested FY 1995 rate adjustment meets these criteria and satisfies 
all repayment requirements. 


b. Comment: 

If power rates are set without providing for future 
depletions, it will affect Upper Basin development under the (Colorado River and Upper Colorado River Basin) compacts.
Every time 
someone wants to build a project or open a business that will deplete 
water, the power rates will have to go up if those increased depletions have not already been factored into the rates.

Can full repayment be truly represented by rates derived assuming 
water is available for release through powerplants when that water 
will not be available because of depletions by the Upper Division 
States above the powerplants? 


Response: 

Total depletions forecasted by the Basin States for the 
use of Colorado River water have been included in the proposed rate. 
The water has been allocated by compacts for use by the Upper Basin 
States. Furthermore, Western is obligated to assure that funds are 
available on schedule to meet repayment requirements regardless of 
depletion schedules. 
In its proposed treatment (deferral) of uncertain depletions, Western 
assumes that greater amounts of Colorado River water will be available for release through CRSP powerplants than
would be suggested by 
current rapid-growth forecasts of water development projects and 
their associated depletions. 
Western's experience has been that out-year depletion estimates are 
subject to frequent revision. It is reasonable, therefore, to give 
more weight to near-term projections. Western prepares an annual PRS 
for every project to assure that repayment is proceeding satisfacto- 
rily. Thus, there will be many future opportunities to revise the 
Integrated Projects rate appropriately as the near-term projections 
are changed and more accurate long-term estimates are made available. 
Western has determined that depletions affect the firm power rate, at 
most, by 0.32 mills/kWh (composite). The impact is small enough so 
that power rates could (and would) be adjusted to assure full repayment, if more rapid depletions take place in the
Upper Basin States. 
It is not likely that this small impact on power rates would constrain water depletions.

c. Comment: 

By its own terms the 1983 Agreement between Reclamation and 
Western does not apply to State and private projects or developments 
and that the agreement reveals the parties' intent to use full 
depletion levels in setting rates under the terms of the Agreement. 


Response: 

Western disagrees that the intent of the 1983 Agreement 
was for Western to use ``full'' (or ultimate) depletion levels in 
setting rates. Rather, a provision of the agreement that addresses 
depletions only requires that water depletion schedules used for 
power repayment studies ``. . . be consistent with construction 
schedules for participating projects.'' 
Western agrees that provisions of the 1983 Agreement between Western 
and Reclamation did not explicitly address State and private projects 
or developments. In defining a ``reasonable expectation standard,'' 
the 1983 Agreement establishes necessary steps by Reclamation to 
demonstrate the potential for construction of future Federal participating projects before the costs of these projects
would be included 
in the ratesetting years. This reasonable expectation standard has 
been applied to the future development of all water development 
projects for ratesetting purposes by Western in setting the lowest 
possible rates consistent with sound business principles. 
Therefore, Western has included total depletions forecasted by the 
Upper Basin States for the use of Colorado River water for all 
projects, with deferral of less-certain water developments (depletions) beyond the ratesetting period in the proposed
rate. Future 
rate adjustments will allow for movement of depletions into the rate- 
setting years. 


d. Comment: 

Western arbitrarily suppressed depletions from 2010 through 
2090 only justified by the fact that such a method of suppression 
(capping) was utilized in the 1990 study and did so without adequate 
consultation with Reclamation. 


Response: 

The decision by Western to defer uncertain depletions 
beyond the ratesetting period is not arbitrary. In the 1990 rate 
process, Western gave considerable attention to the reasonableness of 
the then-proposed depletion deferral and to the associated rate 
effect when applied. Further, Western has given renewed and height- 
ened attention to the treatment of depletions in the proposed rate 
through preparation of numerous issue papers, informal discussions 
with both customer and water user representatives, and in Western's 
April 1994 rate brochure. 
Figure 1, on page 12-5 of the rate brochure, shows that Western 
presently assumes full development (full depletions) of all Upper 
Basin water projects by FY 2090. 
Projects with uncertain schedules have been placed in the PRS so that 
they do not impact the rate at this time, in accordance with 
Western's practice to set the lowest possible rate consistent with 
sound business principles. 
Western also disagrees with the claim that inadequate consultation 
occurred with Reclamation in the past on this deferral treatment. 
Reclamation, along with other interested parties, has either participated in or has attended many of the public forums
scheduled in the 
development of all Integrated Projects rate proposals. In these 
public forums, Western has detailed the components of the rate 
adjustment, including the treatment of depletions. Reclamation and 
interested parties have been and will continue to be afforded ample 
notice and opportunity to comment on future rate proposals. 


e. Comment: 

Five comments said: DOE RA 6120.2 seems to require the use of operation studies based on historical streamflows including
hydrologic data current to within 5 years. 


Response: 

Western believes that it is in compliance with DOE RA 
6120.2. This requirement is valid for most projects. However, 
exceptions, as discussed in DOE RA 6120.2, Section 10.e.(4), are 
provided for those projects which are anticipated to have extensive 
water development in the future. CRSP operation studies are based on 
historic streamflows, which are then reduced by projected water 
depletions supplied by the Upper Basin States and modified by 
Reclamation. 


f. Comment: 

Western suggests that its departure from the 1990 depletion 
schedule represents better data than utilized by Reclamation in its 
energy and capacity studies. 


Response: 

Both Reclamation and UCRC staff have told Western infor- 
mally that the depletion schedule used in this process is a more 
accurate reflection of the current situation than the earlier ``Energy 
and Capacity Studies'' which was available when the ratesetting PRS 
was prepared. 


g. Comment: 

The 1990 cap at 2010 resulted in an approximate 11-percent 
reduction of Basin States' depletions and an artificially low power 
rate. The proposed super-imposition of a 1990 mentality beginning in 
2010 to a substantially revised 1992 unofficial depletion schedule 
results in excess of 20-percent reduction of depletions and does not 
even fully recognize the future depletions of projects currently 
under construction. 


Response: 

Western agrees that the deferral of some estimated deple- 
tion effects until 2060 suggests a significant (20-percent) reduction 
from the 1992 depletion schedule contained in the CRSM demand data. 
Western believes there should be greater certainty of development 
regarding this 20-percent prior to including the associated reduction 
in hydrogeneration in the PRS in a way that affects the firm power 
rates. Also, Western agrees that its deferral postpones future 
depletions of projects currently under construction, based on the 
principles of the 1983 agreement. Again, because the timing of the 
development of the associated consumptive use is uncertain, Western 
chooses to not include future depletions within the ratesetting 
years. As more current information is supplied by the UCRC to 
Reclamation, Western will apply the ``reasonable expectation'' standard 
to these updated depletions. 


h. Comment: 

Western did not use the depletion schedule dated July 1994 
which was received in draft form in April 1994.

Response: 

Western was provided a draft work-in-progress depletion schedule by UCRC representatives in April 1994. This latest
unofficial schedule demonstrated a reduced and delayed schedule for development of Upper Basin projects. However,
the schedule had yet to be approved by the Basin States and, once received by Reclamation, would still have required
considerable work by Reclamation staff to modify depletion (demand) data used by the CRSM. In addition, subsequent
analysis by Western's power resources and rates staff would have taken considerable time and effort before new information
could be verified and supported for inclusion in any revised PRS for this proposed rate process. For example, the final
PRS used for the April 1994 rate brochure was created in March of 1994. Its power projections were the end result of several
months of work by Western and Reclamation resources staff. An official depletion schedule ready for use in July of
1994 would have delayed the public process for the current rate adjustment by several additional months. 

Western is responsible for seeing that the Integrated Projects earn sufficient revenues to pay all of their obligations
on time. Such a lengthy delay in implementing the rate adjustment would have resulted in increased interest cost to
customers, lost revenues, and, as a result, higher firm power rates. 

Western has assured UCRC that when official depletion information is available, has been incorporated into Reclamation's
CRSM data files, and there is a common understanding of the reasonable certainty of future water projects, the associated
generation effects will be weighed and a decision made by Western regarding their inclusion in any future PRS. 



i. Comment: 

The attorney for a customer stated: 

. . . the treatment of depletions in this rate case has nothing to do with the water rights of the Upper
Basin States. Nor does it have anything to do with how those rights will be exercised in the future. Western has no power
over the water rights of the Upper Basin States. Conversely, the power users should not be punished because of delays
in Upper Basin water use development and fears of Upper Basin water users that such development may ultimately not
occur. 



Response: 

Western agrees with this comment. 



2. Purchased Power Expense



Four large customer organizations all commented extensively on purchased power expense: 



a. Comment: 

A customer organization stated: 

The assumed lower prices for surplus energy sales are, in fact, at odds with recent experience for the SLCA/IP. 

It is clear that experience does not support Western's pricing assumptions, which were based on combining various
pricing and cost data in an inconsistent and somewhat arbitrary fashion. (The commentor) recommends that Western
modify its pricing assumptions by setting prices for surplus sales at the same levels as those used for purchases.




Response: 

Western agrees, in part, with comments that assumed nonfirm surplus sales pricing in the estimation of future-year
net purchased power expenses does not reflect an extension of historic pricing trends. This fact is supported in documentation
prepared by Western on the methodology and assumptions developed in previous rate proceedings and consistently
applied again in this proposed rate adjustment. The imposed restrictions at Glen Canyon Dam have caused Western to
sell off-peak surplus energy. The impact of these sales is based upon the market conditions. Western has explained
that the basis for assumptions of future surplus sales pricing is based upon consideration of the potential market
conditions. Western assumes that there will be a need to dispose of limited onpeak surpluses in southern markets,
which will mean competing against low-cost sales from the Navajo Generating Station. Western will also try to sell
significant surpluses in northern markets, competing against low-cost sales from regional northern utilities.
Certain general conclusions may be drawn: (1) average nonfirm surplus energy prices, both offpeak and onpeak, will
be less than historic conditions, this also implies that period pricing (onpeak or offpeak) will be less than recent
experience, (2) historic pricing differentials, onpeak versus offpeak, winter versus summer season, will continue,
and (3) Western's hourly modeling of constrained operations at Glen Canyon is reasonable. 

Though the method developed is believed to be a reasonable tool for forecasting future surplus sales pricing, Western
acknowledges that some merit exists in comments that suggest a closer link to recent historic trends is reasonable.
Western will continue to refine the methods for forecasting future market conditions, both purchases and surplus
sales, and will continue to give greater weight to recent historic pricing trends in future pricing projections.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-2-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Western disagrees with the comment which suggests that surplus sales 
and purchase pricing should be identical, without consideration of 
the nature of the constraint condition at Glen Canyon. The methods 
developed by Western for assessment of conditions with and without 
interim release constraints at Glen Canyon currently predict (a) that 
higher, but acceptable, average purchase prices will result in the 
near future from deliveries under several long-term purchase agreements and (b) lower average surplus sale prices
will occur due to 
significant ``forced sales'' during offpeak and shoulder onpeak hours. 
However, should additional operation experience suggest modification 
to this base assumption, Western will consider future improvements in 
the methods used. 


b. Comment: 

Western applied the hourly modeling of net purchased power 
expense to only 3 years. The other years between and beyond the 
3 years modeled were estimated based on a regression analysis of the 
3 years' results . . . regression analysis using three data points to 
interpolate and extrapolate results may be unreliable and is certainly less than ideal. (The commentor) recommends
that the hourly model 
be used to calculate annual net expense at least through the 
year 2002, when the recovery of the hydrosystem and increases in firm 
load . . . have stabilized. 


Response: 

Western disagrees with the suggestion that additional 
years of hourly modeling in its current form would significantly 
improve the reliability of forecasted net purchase power expenses. 
The methodology developed by Western to forecast the net purchase 
power expense considers several significant variables such as hourly 
firm load and available hourly hydrogeneration in determination of 
hourly deficits or surpluses. The method then considers seasonal 
variation in purchase and surplus sales pricing structures in 
estimation of the net purchase power expense. Given the simplifying 
assumptions made in the methods, Western recognizes a significant 
correlation between deficit (or surplus) hydrogeneration and the 
associated net purchase power expense. 
In balancing the limited time required to complete the analysis and 
the precision required for the net expense estimate, Western determined that modeling all hours within each month
for 3 years (i.e., 
36 months) would be adequate and that hourly modeling for additional 
years would not significantly improve the reliability of the forecasted net purchase power expense. 
Western continues to support the general application of these methods 
to express the causal relationship between deficit (or surplus) hydrogeneration and annual net purchase power expenses.
However, Western 
acknowledges that some future modifications may be beneficial, such 
as (1) additional refinements of the model, (2) validation of key 
assumptions, and (3) application of refined methods and assumptions 
to additional future periods (i.e., months, years) to increase the 
sample size. Such changes will be considered in future net purchase 
power expense forecasts. 


c. Comment: 

A large customer organization says that it has been unable 
to understand or replicate Western's results.

<PARENT> FR941103-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

Western has made a conscientious effort to provide all of 
the information needed to develop the purchased power expense 
analysis in a timely manner. Western's staff has provided explanations to customers and their consultants and are
available and 
willing to provide additional clarification as needed. 


3. Future Flow Restrictions at Glen Canyon Dam 




a. Comment: 

A large customer organization expressed concern that Western has overstated revenues of $3 to $8 million per year
from short-term 
capacity sales through 2004. 


Response: 

It is improbable that flows restricted for environmental 
reasons will ever again provide enough firm power from the Glen Canyon 
Unit to reach levels used in past power projections. Western does not 
know which of many possible flow regimes will finally be imposed at 
the Glen Canyon Unit. The treatment of short-term sales has been 
consistent with the firm power assumptions. Therefore, it is 
impossible to modify power projections for the proposed rate adjustment to recognize the reduced power output. The
only course of action 
Western is able to follow is to stay with historic power projection 
figures, using the methodology already used in previous processes, 
until the Glen Canyon regime is finally determined. 
Western will evaluate the firm power rate then in place when the new 
flow regimes from the Glen Canyon Dam are decided. If it is needed, a 
firm power rate adjustment will be proposed then. 


b. Comment: 

An organization of several customers stated: 
While it is understood that a degree of uncertainty surrounds the exact level of flows at Glen Canyon, Western 
should conduct a sensitivity analysis predicated on the 
alternative flow assumptions identified in the Operation of 
Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement. Such 
sensitivity analysis (sic) would give customers a range of 
possible replacement power costs. 


Response: 

Western has done extensive analyses of the power and rate 
impact of every flow regime identified for study in the GCD-EIS. 
Detailed descriptions of the studies and their results are reported in 
the draft GCD-EIS, and will be contained in the final GCD-EIS when it 
is published. 
In the meantime, Western is specifically required, by law and by 
regulation, to use known or statistically probable estimates of future 
activity in creating rates. The level of uncertainty still existing 
with the GCD-EIS prevents the use of any of its data at this time. As 
is noted above, when a decision about environmentally related flows 
through Glen Canyon Dam is made, a revised PRS will be prepared, and a 
new rate will be proposed, if needed. 


4. O&M-Related Issues 




a. Western O&M: 

CREDA signed an agreement with Western and Reclamation dated September 24, 1992, which states: 
Western shall utilize the Work Program Information made available to its Customers by Western and Reclamation (including
adjustments thereof which may result from reviews, from internal corrections or the dispute resolution process
provided for in these Joint Procedures but excluding the costs of future transmission system additions in a Planning
Year or Out Year which are conceptual in nature), to prepare the power repayment studies upon which 
it relies to promulgate any interim or final rates proposed or adopted for SLCAIP firm power or transmission services.

Several customers and their member organizations are concerned about 
the implementation of the 1992 Agreement. 


(1) Comment: 

(One commentor) continues to be concerned 
with Western's inconsistent use of budgeted information in the preparation of the PRS . . . (the commentor) has been
some-what frustrated in its attempts in this rate adjustment process to reconcile certain information used in the
1994 Rate Brochure PRS with the information previously provided in the Work Program review process. 


Response: 

The FY 1995 Work Program is merely a copy of the 
proposed FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission. It was used 
as the starting point in planning expenditures for the FY 1995 
congressional budget. 
CREDA's September 1992 agreement with Western and Reclamation 
allows power customers to have meaningful input to the new congressional budget. However, this work program document
is prepared too early in the planning process for either customers or Western to say that no further changes will be
made. Western feels that the timing and use of documents stated in the agreement should be revisited. Western is willing
to continue 
to work with the customers in improving the budget and work plan review process in the future.

<PARENT> FR941103-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To illustrate the process, the transformation of the FY 1995 Work Program into the final FY 1995 Budget is outlined
below: 
(a) (The commentor) reviewed the FY 1995 Work Program and had opportunity to make suggested changes. 
(b) The revised FY 1995 Work Program became the FY 1995 Internal Review Budget. At this point, more changes were made.
Those changes then were reviewed by Western. Further changes, usually a lowering of spending projections, are common
in this stage of budget preparation. 
(c) The FY 1995 Internal Review Budget was then sent to Washington to be approved by DOE. There are usually reductions
in spending estimates at this stage, as well, dictated by DOE's spending priorities. The DOE-approved budget was
called the FY 1995 OMB Budget Request and was sent to that agency for review and approval. Any changes were then incorporated
into a document called the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. 
(d) Finally, the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission went before Congress, where any final changes desired by
the legislative branch of Government were made. Only after it was approved by Congress after public debate was the
final FY 1995 Budget determined. 
The FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission was officially sent to Congress in January 1993. When the April 1994 rate
brochure PRSs were being prepared, the data in the FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission/1995 Work Program was
already more than 2 years old (having begun as the FY 1994 Work Program in early 1992). Because of this timing, most of
the information was outdated. 
Western had completed turning the FY 1995 Work Program into the FY 1995 
Congressional Budget Submission by that time. As is usually the case, some of the planned expenditures had been deleted
in the process. Further, because of extra impetus to keep costs down, a Western-wide decision was made in which O&M
costs would be allowed to rise only 2-percent per year between FYs 1994 and 1996. 
In keeping with Western's policy to set rates at the lowest possible level consistent with sound business principles,
Western used data from the lower-cost (and more current) FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission rather than that
in the customer-reviewed FY 1995 Work Program in the Rate Brochure PRS. 
When Reclamation, Western, and CREDA entered into the September 1992 agreement, the parties did not anticipate that
expenditure plans would change significantly between the Work Program review and the congressional budget submission.
Events have proved otherwise.

(2) Comment: 

Two comments expressed concern that: Western's projected O&M expenses for 1994 are more than 25-percent higher
than actual O&M expenses in 1993 and more than 20-percent higher than the 1994 O&M expenses included in the
1995 Work Program documents. 



Response: 

Western has been unable to duplicate the analysis in this comment. Some of the figures in the commentor's table are
incorrect. This gives the impression of a problem where Western believes none exists. Most significantly, Western's
actual FY 1993 CRSP O&M expense of $17.964 million shown in the commentor's tables is incorrect. The proper amount,
from the Results of Operations (financial statements) as shown below, is $21.418 million. This should be the basis
for the commentor's percentage calculations.

Below is a table comparing the table submitted by the 
commentors, the FY 1995 Work Program, and the amounts used in 
the PRS. 





 

The average annual growth rate in the rate brochure PRS from 1993 through 
1996 is a negative 0.33 percent. This is considerably below the 2-percent 
maximum annual growth rate which is Western's goal. 



5. Reclamation O&M 





a. Comment: 

Reclamation explained the increase in Regional Office 
expense in 1995 O&M expenses over the level shown in the 1995 Work 
Program (which was $564,000) as the inclusion of the Dolores Project 
O&M expense. The O&M expenses for the Dolores Project are shown in 
the 1995 Work Program as $301,000 for 1995, leaving $263,000 of the 
increase in this account category unexplained.

Response:

 The statement that the Regional Office expense in 1995 
included the Dolores Project is incorrect. The Regional Office 
expense category applies only to the initial CRSP units (i.e., 
Aspinall, Flaming Gorge, Glen Canyon, and Navajo), and not to the 
Dolores Project. Dolores Project costs are shown in their own, 
separate PF-3 budget document. 

Regional Office expenses shown in the initial units (CRSP) work plan 
differ from those included in the PRS because Western inadvertently 
used an unofficial version of Reclamation's PF-3. This document did 
not differ from the official budget in total costs for the CRSP 
initial units. An adjustment within the program was made, which 
increased the Regional Office expense by $564,000. This was made to 
balance to the FY 1995 Budget Submission funding amount. 



b. Comment.

 The O&M figures (for the Rio Grande Project) in the PRS 
appear to double count capitalized moveable equipment (CME) 
expenses for the years 1995, 1997, and 1998 . . . . 


Response: 

Western agrees with the comment and has rerun the RGP study 
to eliminate this error. 



c. Comment:

 For 1994, the difference in expenses between the Work 
Program and the PRS appears to be comprised of the $35,000 
for CME less a $20,500 expense reduction, which is unex- 
plained. 



Response:

 Western's numbers were correct and have been used in the PRS. The commentor's table shows a difference of $28,885.
There are four reasons for the difference: (1) O&M expenditures planned for FY 1993 on the Elephant Butte Dam of
$67,548 (portion assigned to power = $67,548 X 20.8% = $14,050) were not spent in FY 1993, but were obligated and actually
spent in 1994; (2) expenditures planned on the Elephant Butte Powerplant ($30,854, of which 100-percent is repayable
by power revenues) were not spent in FY 1993, but were obligated and actually spent in FY 1994; (3) the $35,000 referred
to as CME for FY 1994 is not CME, but miscellaneous tools which is charged off to O&M and is properly includable in
the total O&M for the year; and (4) item number (2) was further complicated by the fact that both the Work Program
and the FY 1995 Budget Congressional Submission are based on an incorrect version of the summarized report. A line
item (which should be included in the Other Expense line) which appears on the detailed report was coded incorrectly
so that it does not appear on the summarized reports, but is included in the totals of both reports. Thus, the totals
are $40,000 higher in the Work Program than the total of the numbers shown and $23,921 higher than the total of the numbers
shown in the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. The $40,000 budgeted Other Expense item was later reduced to
$23,921, which matches the $1,141,775 figure shown in the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. Following is
a table which recaps the above information starting with the figures shown in the commentor's table:

6. CRSP-Wide O&M 





a. Comment.

 A customer organization stated: 

The average annual increase in projected O&M expenses which 
results in a $8.2 million annual revenue requirement is troublesome. How this figure was obtained in the modeling
effort 
undertaken at Western is not explained in detail in the brochure. If the projected figure is based upon an extrapolation

of historical data adjusted for inflation, the cost figure may 
not reflect all of the possible areas of cost reduction available to both Western and the Bureau of Reclamation. 



Response.

 Only two projections used in the Integrated Projects and/or 
CRSP PRS are based on computer modeling: the water available for 
power production and the ultimate power-related revenue requirements 
for the participating projects. Estimates for future O&M expenses are 
taken directly from official budgets; the budgets include modest 
approximations of labor cost increases. All equipment spending in the 
5-year budget window is made up of actual projections received from 
workers in the field, reporting which equipment is likely to need 
replacement and when. Miscellaneous revenue and expense projections 
are based on historical averages and known future commitments. 



b. Comment.

 A customer organization said: 

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) has served as the catalyst 
for increasing competition in wholesale generation. They would 
anticipate that Western begin to streamline its operations in 
order that it position itself competitively in the new electricity market. 



Response.

 Western's management is presently looking for ways to 
improve customer service while cutting costs through Western's Strategic Planning initiative. Some of the decisions
made to date include: 

(1) Delayering. This is a reduction in the number of supervisory 
employees, to reduce red tape and inertia while increasing 
customer service. The emphasis will be on empowering the 
employees. The initiative is already under way.

(2) Western will limit increases in annual operating expenses to less than 2-percent per project per year through
FY 1996. Thereafter, increases in annual operating expenses will not exceed the annual rate of inflation. 

(3) As the marketing agent for Federal power, Western will participate in the decision making process with other resource
agencies whose operating decisions significantly affect Federal power rate and repayment obligations whenever
possible. 

(4) Proposals for construction of new facilities will be assessed using integrated resource planning principles
and must meet at least one of three criteria before construction may begin: 

(a) Increased revenues from new facilities must exceed their annual cost over the cost-evaluation period. 

(b) Customers must benefit sufficiently to support new facilities in spite of a possible rate increase. 

(c) The new facilities will be funded by non-Western sources. 



7. Construction-Related Projections



A customer organization has a series of questions about construction-related cost projections. 



a. Comment: 

Some of the commentators said: . . . they have been unable to find support in the 1995 Work Program for
a majority of the significant (>$100,000) additions and replacements included in the 1994 rate brochure and rate brochure
PRS . . . .



Response: 

For a detailed outline of the budget process, Western refers the reader to earlier replies to questions about O&M.
To reiterate, the FY 1995 Work Program had, in many instances, higher cost projections than the FY 1995 Congressional
Budget Submission. Western has used the lower figures in the ratesetting PRS. 

In the case of CRSP construction, this change dramatically reduced the cost projections. Table VI on pages 12 and 13
of the April 1994 Rate Brochure shows a $276 million decrease in budgeted power-related construction costs through
FY 1998 between the FY 1995 Work Program (referred to in the brochure as the FY 1994 Congressional Budget Submission)
and the FY 1995 Congressional Budget Submission. Western has used the lower figure where it is considered reliable.




b. Comment: 

(The commentor) has been unable to find support for the investments included in the Collbran/Rate Brochure PRS. 



Response: 

It is not possible to find the correlation between the investments in a budget document or work program and those in
a PRS without some intermediate steps. 

The annual figures in the 1995 Work Program are only planned cash expenditures. Investments are large items, often
taking more than 1 year to complete. The total spent on any one investment, then, is the sum of the annual expenditures
shown in the work programs, plus any applicable IDC. 

Western is required to record an investment in a PRS in the year that it becomes operational. This permits the establishment
of the proper repayment period and begins the annual payment of interest on investment (due until the investment's
cost is completely repaid). Future investments appear in a PRS in the year they are planned to be in-service, if that
is within the 5-year budget window. Future investments (excluding future replacements) planned for completion
at some time after the 5-year window are normally excluded from a PRS, unless legislation directs otherwise (as is
the case with the CRSP's participating projects). Annual cash outlays for an investment that takes more than 1 year
to complete have no counterpart in a PRS. Indeed, there may be several years of investment costs shown in work programs
and budgets which do not appear in PRSs. However, the total sum, plus IDC, will appear in the PRS in the year when the item
is anticipated to be operational. 

It is not unusual for the first future year in a budget document to show projections higher than those shown in the previous
budget document for that same year. It is common to have obligated amounts at the end of the year just closed that do not
get paid in that year. They are then carried over and added to the next year. Also, CWIP that has been completed, but that
did not get moved to plant-in-service in the financial records, is carried over to the next year (with the assumption
that it will be moved to plant-in-service at that time). This also adds to the total amount shown in the subsequent year.



c. Comment: 

(The commentor's) Table 7 below uses information provided in response to WAPA/CREDA-76 to illustrate the differences
between the 1995 Work Program and the PRS. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-2-00067 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(The commentor) believes that some or all of the decrease may result from elimination or reduction of dam repair work
described in Reclamation's response to (the commentor's) comments on the 1995 Work Program review. The increases
(i.e., increases over and above the amounts shown in the 1995 Work Program) are unexplained, however, by changes presented
in the 1995 Work Program. Therefore, (the commentor) recommends use of the investments shown in line 31 of table 7 in
the Collbran/Rate PRS. 




Response: 

Table 7 in the commentor's July 27 comment letter displays Collbran investment as shown in the FY 1995 Work Program.
Western agrees with the commentor's figures for FY 1994 through FY 1998, except that carry-over from FY 1993 must also
be added to FY 1994's total number. Western's brochure study also contained some figures from the FY 1995 Congressional
Budget Submission. There have since been changes to that budget that have reduced some of those costs by approximately
$450,000. Western has rerun the Collbran ratesetting PRS using these changes. 

The following table illustrates how incremental investment in budget figures is transformed into a PRS entry. Figures
from Reclamation's FY 1995 Work Program are used. The Collbran Project was used for this example because it contains
no IDC or multipurpose investment, thereby simplifying the illustration.

<TEXT>
 





d. Comment: 

All years in the (Rio Grande) PRS except 1994 match the values from the 1995 Work Program. In 1994, the difference is
$619,806. (The values shown in line 14 of Table 9 should be used in the PRS.) 



Response: 

 The commentor is correct. An additional $619,806 has been added to the work program amount shown in FY 1994. Not all
of the work in the Work Program for FY 1993 was completed or posted in that year. The amounts not completed, including
those obligated but not spent in 1993, were carried over into FY 1994. This was the case with the $619,806 noted by the
commentor. This is necessitated because of Western and Reclamation's accounting procedures (as explained in the
previous section on the Collbran Project), which require the total investment (including IDC) to be moved to the plant-in-service
account in the year it becomes operational, rather than recording incremental amounts of annual spending. 

Western has used the figures recommended by the commentor. The figures are the basis for the projected investment
through the cost evaluation period (FY 1994-98). However, these amounts do not appear in the PRS in those years.
As previously explained (see the example of the Collbran Project above), these amounts (plus IDC, where applicable)
are shown in the PRS in the year the particular investment is scheduled to go into service. 



e. Comment: 

Commentor stated that: 
The intent of the work program review was to provide a less formal process through which customers could receive information
and provide input regarding Western's and Reclamation's programs, allowing for this same information to then be
used in determining the adequacy of rates. In departing in the rate process from data developed in the FY 1995 Work Program,
the principal benefit of the process is effectively undone. Moreover, the departures were not trivial. For Western's
O&M expenses, the 1994 figure used in the Rate Brochure PRS exceeds that contained in the FY 1995 Work Program by
almost $4 million, or 20 percent. 

In new construction projects, the commentor identified over $45 million in additional investment included in the
PRS that was not identified or had been excluded in the work program review. 



Response: 

Western has given a detailed explanation of the changes in the 1994 O&M figures between the FY 1995 Work Program
and the 1993 ratesetting PRS earlier in this Rate Order. Construction cost modifications are also listed in detail.


Western disagrees with the thrust of the commentor's statement. As Western follows its policy to develop the lowest
rate to consumers consistent with sound business principles, all power customers, including the commentor's members
benefit. 

For example, the FY 1995 Work Program includes over $527 million in construction costs for the SLCAO alone. Deducting
what would normally be excluded from the PRS because it is not planned for completion by FY 1998 leaves $284 million.
This figure ($284 million) is still more than double what Western finally included in the Rate Brochure PRS as new investment
$131 million. The difference between these two figures (the $284 million in the FY 1995 Work Program and the $131 million
in the Rate Brochure PRS) equals approximately 0.75 mills/kWh in the composite rate. In other words, following the
commentor's instructions would have resulted in a 3/4 mills/kWh higher firm power rate than Western is proposing.
Finally, Western will continue to work with its customers to identify and correct problems with the work program review
process. 



8. Environmentally Related Expenses





a. Comment: 

The sum of environmental costs in the 1994 Rate Brochure is more than $0.5 million greater in 1993 and 1994 than contained
in the FY 1995 Work Program. Western's response to CREDA's information request (WAPA/CREDA 67) indicated that the
additional costs in 1994 were explained by about $6.0 million in ``unliquidated obligation'' in 1993. While actual
costs were indeed lower than planned in 1993, the reduction does not explain the still greater increase indicated
in the 1994 rate brochures. Environmental study costs should be limited to the amounts (with some allowance for carryover
from prior years) developed in the work program process. 



Response: 

To compare environmental costs spent and budgeted for FYs 1993 and 1994 in the 1995 budget and work plan, the unliquidated
obligations must be taken into consideration, as shown below: 








b. Comment: 

A customer organization says: 
It is clear that environmental expenses associated with Glen Canyon Dam have gotten out of hand, are not under control,
and are not being subjected to any sort of cost-control analysis or audit. They urge Western to do what it can to urge
the Bureau of Reclamation to limit environmental study expenditures to those that are calculated to produce necessary,
credible information.

Response: 

As a part of Western's Strategic Planning initiative: Western will, as the marketing agent for Federal power, participate
in the decision making process whenever possible with other resource agencies whose operating decisions significantly
affect Federal power rate and repayment obligations. Western will do so to sustain the marketability of the Federal
hydroelectric resource. 



9. Miscellaneous Comments



Long-term Capacity Sales: 

(1) 

Comment: 

(The commentor) notes that there is a discrepancy between the projection of capacity sales shown in Western's ``1993
Power Projections'' and the values in the PRS. Upon inspection of the two set of values, it appears that the values used
in the PRS may have been misentered 1 year below the proper year. This causes the amount of capacity sales to be slightly
understated in several years. 



Response: 

Western agrees. Western has checked these data and has found a disconnect between the kW of capacity sales estimate
found in the work papers and that in the PRS. It appears that the data from FYs 1993 through 2003 in the work papers were
put into the PRS in FYs 1994 through 2004. The error has been corrected. 



(2) Comment: 

Western calculates the PRS for Integrated Projects such that replacements are repaid up to the rate-setting year.
In part, this is due to the assignment of a lower repayment priority (to irrigation) in the PRS. Assigning the lower
priority (to irrigation) causes a less than optimal rate calculation, since the rate could be lowered by allowing
for some replacements to remain unpaid beginning 9-10 years prior to the ratesetting year. 



Response: 

Western recognizes that some replacements have been paid earlier in the PRS than required. Western conducted a test
to determine if forcing payments to irrigation obligations would postpone early payment of replacements, thus lowering
the rate. Forcing payments reduces the composite rate 0.13 mills/kWh. This change has been made in the ratesetting
PRS. 



10. Untimely Responses to Data Requests





a. Comment: 

Three commentors stated that their consultant did not receive all the information needed to reconcile certain key
portions of the proposed rate and did not have adequate time to verify all the data underlying the rate adjustment.




Response: 

The consultant submitted five official data requests. Responses were as follows: 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-2-00070 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-2-00031 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Customers originally had 97 days to submit comments and request 
information; 56 of those days were after the public information 
forum. The largest and most detailed request for data was 
received by Western on July 1, 1994, which was 19 days before 
the original close of the comment period. The final response to 
this request was faxed to the consulting firm, on July 19, 1994, 
1 day before the original end of the comment period. Western 
then extended the date it would accept comments to July 27, 
1994, to provide commentors extra time to prepare a reply. 
Western believes that ample time has been allowed for public 
comment and that information was furnished to requestors in a 
timely manner. However, Western also recognizes that there 
could be confusion and misunderstanding regarding the information needed by the commentators and that some of the
information received may not be what was needed. Western will continue to 
work with customers and interested parties to find a more 
efficient and acceptable process to respond to data requests and 
meet the commentors' needs. 


b. Comment: 

A customer organization said: 
Given the backdrop of structural changes in the industry 
and increasing environmental concerns over hydro power 
generation, it would seem that Western should develop a 
pricing policy based upon a firm understanding of price 
sensitivity. The lack of any such analysis is a major 
omission. 


Response: 

One of Western's primary concerns is the impact the 
prices for its products have on possible sales. Based on 
knowledge of the electrical power market, Western's proposed 
combined rates for firm power are below other sources of firm 
electrical power available to Integrated Projects customers. 
For this reason, Western has not undertaken a specific study to 
analyze price effects on the electrical power purchased by 
Western's Integrated Projects customers. 
There may be reductions of Integrated Projects energy usage in 
the short-term by Western's customers as a result of the 
proposed increase in the energy rate. Some of Western's Integrated Projects customers with their own electrical
power 
generating resources may be faced with variable costs that allow 
them to produce energy more cheaply than purchasing from Western 
at the proposed new rate. Information on the cost of generation 
is considered sensitive and is not available to Western. 
However, published sources of information which relate to coal 
prices and other components of the variable costs of power 
generation indicate that the proposed energy rate is less than 
Western's estimate of their cost of generating thermal energy. 
Western has received no comments to indicate otherwise. 


c. Comment: 

To help customers respond more completely to Western's 
proposals, a customer organization suggests that, in the future, 
when Western entertains the thought of extending the time for 
commenting as done here, tie the extension to a period of time 
following completion of responses to requests for information. 


Response: 

Western believes that the existing customer review 
process and the public rate process sufficiently provide for 
both flexibility for input and measurability of the progress 
toward the completion of a rate. 


d. Comment: 

Several customers concur with changing the expression 
of the firm power rate from a `combined rate' to a `composite 
rate'. 


Response: 

Western agrees with the customer comment and believes 
that the composite rate will make the price of Integrated 
Projects power more easily comparable with that from other 
sources.





e. Issue: 

A customer states that they believe it is very unfair to 
continue to increase the burden on the ratepayers to fund (environmental) studies which will result in further increases
in 
costs and/or reductions in the amount of power available. 


Response: 

As noted earlier, Western is working with Reclamation 
to more closely monitor these costs. 


11. Issue Papers Resolution: 

Several issues which Western believes would 
have caused considerable protracted comment were discussed in detail 
during the pre-rate-adjustment process of informal meetings between 
various stakeholders and the exchange of issue papers. The stakeholders liked the process. The issues which were
resolved in this 
process are summarized below:

Environmental Evaluation


In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.; 

Council on Environmental Quality Regulations 
(40 CFR Parts 1500-1508); and DOE NEPA Regulations (10 CFR Part 1021), Western 
has determined that this action is categorically excluded from the preparation 
of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. 


Executive Order 12866 


DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it 
does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has 
an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; 
accordingly, no clearance of this notice by OMB is required.

Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects; Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming; Schedule of Rates
for Firm Power Service



Effective 



Beginning December 1, 1994, through November 30, 1999, or until superseded by another rate schedule, whichever occurs
earlier. 



Available 



In the area served by the Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects. 



Applicable 



To the wholesale power customers for firm power service supplied through one 
meter at one point of delivery, or as otherwise established by contract. 



Character 



Alternating current, 60 hertz, three-phase, delivered and metered at the 
voltages and points established by contract. 



Monthly Rate 



Demand Charge: $3.83 per kilowatt of billing demand. 
Energy Charge: 8.90 mills per kilowatthour of use. 




Billing Demand 



The billing demand will be the greater of: 

1. The highest 30-minute integrated demand measured during the month up to, 
but not more than, the delivery obligation under the power sales contract, 
or 

2. The contract rate of delivery. 



Adjustment for Transformer Losses 



If delivery is made at transmission voltage but metered on the low-voltage 
side of the substation, the meter readings will be increased to compensate for 
transformer losses as provided for in the contract. 



Adjustment for Power Factor 



The customer will be required to maintain a power factor at all points of 
measurement between 95-percent lagging and 95-percent leading. 



Adjustment for Purchased Resources 



Purpose of Adjustment



To ensure that Western Area Power Administration 
(Western) has sufficient revenues to support resource purchases made necessary 
because of restricted generation from Glen Canyon Dam as the result of 
restrictions on water releases from the dam. 



Applicability



To those contractors who are not receiving service under an 
Interim Purchase Amendment to the firm power sales contract. 



Adjustment



If Western finds it necessary to purchase resources to replace 
generation lost at Glen Canyon Dam because of the above-listed restrictions, 
Western will, beginning on the first month that such purchases are made, 
include in the contractor's monthly power bill an estimate of that 
contractor's proportionate share of net capacity purchase costs. The cost of 
purchasing these resources will be offset by the revenue that Western receives 
for the sale of energy, if any, associated with the purchased resources. 

In its October bill each year, Western will reconcile the previous fiscal 
year's actual purchased power expenses and the monthly estimated costs paid by 
the contractor. If the contractor has paid more than its proportionate share 
of actual purchased power expenses, the excess amount will be shown as a 
credit to the contractor's October power bill. If the contractor has paid 
less than its proportionate share of actual power purchase expenses, Western

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of written exemptions.




</ACTION>

SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is issuing, as a direct final action, written exemptions from the Acid Rain
Program permitting and monitoring requirements to 55 utility units at 32 plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program
regulations (40 CFR part 72). Because the Agency does not anticipate receiving adverse comments, the exemptions
are being issued as a direct final action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

timely received will be addressed in a subsequent issuance or denial of exemption based on the relevant draft exemption

and monitoring requirements for any new utility unit that serves one or more generators with total nameplate capacity
of 25 MW or less and burns only fuels with a sulfur content of 0.05 percent or less by weight. On the earlier of the date
a unit exempted under 40 CFR 72.7 burns any fuel with a sulfur content in excess of 0.05 percent by weight or 24 months
prior to the date the exempted unit first serves one or more generators with total nameplate capacity in excess of 25
MW, the unit shall no longer be exempted under 40 CFR 72.7 and shall be subject to all permitting and monitoring requirements
of the Acid Rain Program.

resume operation unless the designated representative submits an application for an Acid Rain permit and installs

Title:

 Application for Ship Radio Inspection or Survey


Form Number:

 FCC Form 801


Action:

 Revision of a currently approved collection 


Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses)


Frequency of Response:

 Annually and once every five years


Estimated Annual Burden:

 4,000 responses; .25 hours average burden per response; 1,000 hours total annual burden 


Needs and Uses:

 The FCC rules require the periodic inspection of the radio installations aboard United States vessels that are required
to carry radio installations for safety purposes. The FCC Form 801 is used to apply for these required inspections.
It is also used to advise the FCC local office staff to plan necessary travel and allocate resources to accomplish the
task. The information is provided by ship radio station licensees to request an inspection of the radio installation
aboard their vessels by FCC field office personnel. The information enables FCC personnel to identify the particular
vessel to be inspected, determine the vessel's location, the date and time it will be available for inspection, and
the particular regulatory requirements applicable to that particular vessel. If the information were not collected,
FCC personnel would be unable to perform the required inspection due to lack of information about the vessel including
ports of call, sailing schedule, and ports where the inspection could be performed. The form is being revised to provide
for new payment options available to applicants (payments by credit card, electronic funds transfer, and by Western
Union) and to make the form compatible with the new FCC Form 159, Fee Remittance Advice. We are also removing four questions
requesting information which is no longer needed in advance of the inspection. The instructions for completing the
form have been revised to conform to the revised format mandated by the new FCC Form 159.

<DOCTITLE>Consensus Development Conference on Effect of Indirect Markers of Infectious Diseases on Blood Transfusion Safety
</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given of the NIH Consensus Development Conference on ``Effect of Indirect Markers of Infectious
Diseases on Blood Transfusion Safety,'' which will be held January 9-11, 1995, in the Masur Auditorium of the
National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The conference begins at 8:30 a.m.
on January 9 and 10 and at 9 a.m. on January 11. 

In the approximately 50 years since the U.S. has had an organized national blood collection and distribution system,
an increasing number of tests have been mandated, recommended by regulatory authorities, or adopted voluntarily
to minimize the transmission of infectious diseases and make blood transfusion as safe as possible. 

In the last 10 years alone, blood collection agencies have implemented five new tests on all donated blood_Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) antibodies (later expanded from HIV-1 to HIV-1 and -2); hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb);
serum alanine aminotransferare (ALT); antibodies to Human T-cell Lymphotrophic Virus (HTLV) 1 and 2; and, most recently,
antibodies to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). And there are pressures to add tests for emerging diseases_most recently,
for example, Chagas' Disease. 

Most of the newer tests have been improved since they were introduced, adding to transfusion safety and reducing false
positive tests and the unnecessary loss of donors. However, several of the tests that are now performed are not specific
for the diseases they are targeting. Some (ALT, HBcAb) were introduced as surrogates for diseases now subject to more
specific testing. Another (Serological Test for Syphilis-STS) was introduced to protect against one disease,
but is being retained as much as a sign of lifestyle as for evidence of disease. 

The contribution some of these tests make to transfusion safety is uncertain. This issue is important if they do not,
in fact, improve safety. It has become increasingly difficult to locate donors to replace those lost to false positive
tests, which results in more frequent and severe blood shortages. And the cost of the tests themselves needlessly
makes blood processing and blood transfusions more expensive. 

The purpose of this consensus conference is to evaluate the continued use of the syphilis, hepatitis B core antibody,
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tests, as well as to examine the process for adding new infectious disease screening
tests to improve transfusion safety. This conference will bring together specialists from the fields of hematology,
cardiology, transfusion medicine, infectious disease, and nursing as well as representatives from the public.


After 11/2 days of presentations and audience discussion, an independent, non-Federal consensus panel will weigh
the scientific evidence and write a draft statement that it will present to the audience on the third day. The consensus
statement will address the following key questions: 

 What are the indications for the introduction of an infectious disease screening test to improve transfusion
safety and what should be the requirements of such a test? 

 To what extent do the following contribute to transfusion safety: tests for syphilis and for hepatitis B core
antibody; should they continue to be used as now or should their use be modified? 

 To what extent does the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test contribute to transfusion safety; should it continue
to be used as now or should its use be modified? 

 What are the appropriate ways to manage potential threats to transfusion safety from emerging infectious
diseases such as, for example, Chagas' disease? 

 What are the highest priorities for research to improve transfusion safety by reducing the transmission of
infectious disease? 

The primary sponsors for this conference are the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the NIH Office of Medical
Applications of Research. The conference is cosponsored by the Transfusion Medicine Branch of the NIH Clinical Center.
This is the 99th Consensus Development Conference held by NIH since the establishment of the Consensus Development
Program in 1977. 

Advance information on the conference program and conference registration materials may be obtained from: Debra
Steward, Technical Resources International, Inc., 3202 Tower Oaks Blvd., Suite 200, Rockville, Maryland 20852,
(301) 770-3153. 

The consensus statement will be submitted for publication in professional journals and other publications. In addition,
the consensus statement will be available beginning January 11, 1995, from the NIH Consensus Program Information
Service, P.O. Box 2577, Kensington, Maryland 20891, phone 1-800-NIH-OMAR (1-800-644-6627).

<DOCTITLE>Current List of Laboratories Which Meet Minimum Standards To Engage in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies and
Laboratories That Have Withdrawn From the Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS (Formerly: National Institute on Drug Abuse, ADAMHA,
HHS).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (59 FR 29916, 29925).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 



If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
a quarterly performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 



Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum
requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS
(formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 

In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

Privacy Act of 1974; Proposed Amendment to a Systems of Records


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of a proposed amendment to an existing system of records.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposes to amend its system of records entitled ``Single Family
Computerized Homes Underwriting Management System (CHUMS), HUD/H-5'' in its inventory of systems of records
notices subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended. Notice of this system was last published at 55
FR 17676, April 26, 1990.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

HUD/H-5 contains a variety of records relating to HUD's single-family underwriting process. This system aids
the Department in the processing of mortgagee applications for property appraisal and commitment for HUD/FHA mortgage
insurance, and in the subsequent administration of HUD/FHA mortgage insurance programs. Pursuant to the Privacy
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) as amended, notice is given that HUD proposes to add a new routine use category to reflect
the fact that the records will be utilized in a computer matching program. This new routine use identifies the categories
of users (i.e., the Department of Agriculture, Education, Veteran Affairs, the Small Business Administration,
and other agencies) to whom records may be disclosed pursuant to authorized and approved computer matching programs
undertaken for debt collection purposes.


The amended portion of the system notice is set forth below. Previously, the system and a prefatory statement containing
the general routine uses applicable to all HUD systems of records was published in the ``Federal Register Privacy
Act Issuances, 1991 Compilation, Volume I.''
Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (4) and (11) provide that the public be afforded a 30-day period in which to comment on the new
record system.
The system report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), has been submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of
the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), pursuant to paragraph 4c of Appendix I to OMB Circular A-130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals'' dated June 25, 1993 (58 FR 36075, July 2, 1993).





Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 552a, 88 Stat. 1896; sec. 7(d), Department of HUD Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).



Issued at Washington, D.C., September 26, 1994.

Edward M. Berntsen; Continuance in Control Exemption; Tacoma Eastern Railway Co.



Edward M. Berntsen (petitioner) has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Tacoma Eastern Railway Co.
(TE), upon TE becoming a class III rail carrier.

TE, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32591, 

Eastern Railway Co._Lease and Operation Exemption_City of Tacoma, Washington,

 to lease and operate approximately 124.9 miles of rail lines owned by the City of Tacoma (City) or leased by the City
from Weyerhaeuser Co., in Pierce, Thurston and Lewis Counties, WA. That transaction was expected to be consummated
on or after October 11, 1994.

Petitioner also controls a nonconnecting class III rail carrier, Lewis & Clark Railway Company (LC).
 It appears that LC leases and operates a 29.5-mile line owned by Chelatchie Prairie Railroad, Inc., between Rye and
Chelatchie, in Clark County, WA.







Petitioners state that: (1) the properties operated by TE and LC do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance
in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or
any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the
transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. 

See

 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist.,

 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979).

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Fritz R. Kahn,

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Owen M. Babbe, Jr., Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>


On March 3, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Owen M. Babbe, Jr., D.D.S. of Coeur D'Arlene, Idaho, proposing to revoke his
DEA Certificate of Registration AB7962891, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner.
21 U.S.C. 823(f) (1992). The Basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Babbe lacked authority to handle controlled
substances in the State of Idaho, 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3), and that his continued registration is inconsistent with the
public interest, as the term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).
The Order to Show Cause was sent to Dr. Babbe's registered location in Coeur D'Arlene, Idaho by registered mail on March
3, 1994, but was returned to DEA unclaimed. Based on information obtained from the Washington State Department of
Licensing, on April 26, 1994, the Order to Show Cause was sent registered mail to the address provided on Dr. Babbe's
driver's license. On May 2, 1994, a signed receipt was returned to DEA indicating a delivery date of April 28, 1994.
Thereafter, on June 10, 1994, the Order to Show Cause, in its original envelope, was returned marked unclaimed. More
than thirty days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was delivered at Dr. Babbe's last known address. The DEA has
received no response from Dr. Babbe or anyone purporting to represent him.
Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Babbe has waived his opportunity
for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the
investigative file in this matter and enters his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57.
The Deputy Administrator finds that on October 10, 1991, the Idaho State Board of Pharmacy suspended Dr. Babbe's controlled
substance registration. On June 24, 1992, the Idaho State Board of Dentistry (Dentistry Board) revoked Dr. Babbe's
license to practice dentistry for a period of five (5) years. The Dentistry Board concluded that on four occasions
Dr. Babbe's treatment acts and dental practices constituted gross malpractice and on four other occasions his actions
constituted malpractice.
The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is
without State authority to handle controlled substances. 

Nathaniel S. Lehrman, M.D., 

59 FR 44780 (1994) and 

Franz A. Arakaky, M.D., 

59 FR 42074 (1994); 

see also Elliott Monroe, M.D., 

57 FR 23246 (1992) and 

Bobby Watts, M.D., 

53 FR 11920 (1987). Dr. Babbe is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled
substances in the State of Idaho wherein he is registered with the DEA. In light of this, the Deputy Administrator concludes
that it is not necessary to address whether Dr. Babbe's continued registration is otherwise consistent with the public
interest.
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that Dr. Babbe's
DEA registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator pursuant to the authority
vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate
of Registration, AB7962891, previously issued to Owen M. Babbe, Jr., D.D.S., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that
any pending applications for the renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective
on November 3, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Justice, Office of Community-Oriented Policing Services (``COPS'') announces the availability
of grants for the hiring of law enforcement officers under COPS Accelerated Hiring, Education and Deployment (``COPS
AHEAD'') and the COPS Funding Accelerated for Smaller Towns Application (``COPS FAST Application''). Eligible
applicants under COPS AHEAD are those state, local and other public law enforcement agencies, Indian tribal governments,
other public and private entities, and multi-jurisdictional or regional consortia that employ sworn law enforcement
officers and that serve a population of 50,000 or more individuals. Eligible agencies under the COPS FAST Application
are those agencies serving populations of fewer than 50,000 persons.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Overview



The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-322) authorizes the Department of Justice
to make grants for the hiring or rehiring of law enforcement officers to participate in community policing. COPS AHEAD
and the COPS FAST Application are approaches developed by the Department of Justice to speed the deployment of new
officers devoted to community policing on the streets and rural routes of this nation.



COPS AHEAD for Populations of 50,000 and Over



The COPS AHEAD program permits eligible agencies serving a population of 50,000 or more individuals to select and
train up to a maximum of 3 percent of their actual level of sworn officers as of October 1, 1994, prior to submission and
approval of a COPS grant application. Funding will begin once the new officers have been sown and a satisfactory grant
application has been submitted and approved. Grants will be made for up to 75 percent of the total salary and benefits
of each officer over three years, up to a maximum of $75,000 per officer, with the remainder to be paid by state or local
funds. If funding requests exceed the funds available under COPS AHEAD, the maximum amount or starting date of grants
may be adjusted to accommodate demand.

A law enforcement agency interested in participating in COPS AHEAD must send a letter of intent to the address identified
above postmarked no later than November 10, 1994. The COPS Office expects to confirm the eligibility of applicants
and proposed funding levels no later than November 21, 1994. Officers proposed to be funded under COPS AHEAD must be
hired no later than the agency's first class starting in 1995.

At the time that proposed funding levels are confirmed, a formal grant application will be sent which will request
information concerning the agency's strategic community policing plan for the use of the officers that have been
approved to be hired, budget plans and projections, and other information to enable the COPS Office to confirm compliance
with grant conditions.

An application or grant award under COPS AHEAD will not affect the consideration of an agency's application for a grant
under any other COPS program. An agency that receives funding under COPS Phase I is eligible to receive additional
funding under COPS AHEAD if the combined hiring under both programs does not exceed 3 percent of the actual October
1, 1994 force level.



COPS FAST Application for Populations Under 50,000



The COPS FAST Application dramatically simplifies the process of applying for a federal grant. The FAST Application
is a one-page, fill-in-the-blank form that requests basic identifying information about the agency, the number
of police officers currently on the force and the number of new officers requested, basic financial information and
an agreement to abide by standard legal requirements. Applications will be available by November 1, 1994, and will
be mailed to all eligible agencies. Completed applications will be due to the COPS Office by December 31, 1994. The
COPS Office will advise applicants of an authorized hiring level by February 1, 1995. Before funding may begin, jurisdictions
designated for funding will be required to submit necessary budget information and a brief description of community
policing plans. Technical assistance with the development of policing plans will be provided to jurisdictions in
need of such assistance. Funding will begin once the new officers have been sworn. Grants will be made for up to 75 percent
of the total salary and benefits of each officer over three years, subject to a maximum of $75,000 per officer.

Through the COPS FAST Application, the COPS program will provide up to $165 million in grants this fiscal year to state,
local and other public law enforcement agencies. If requests exceed the funds available, the amount or starting date
of grants may be adjusted to accommodate demand. An award under COPS FAST will not affect the consideration of an agency's
application for a grant under any other COPS program. An agency that receives funding under COPS Phase I is eligible
to receive additional funding under COPS FAST.



General Comments



COPS grant funds may not be used to replace funds that eligible agencies otherwise would have devoted to future office
hiring. In other words, any hiring under COPS AHEAD or the COPS FAST Application must be addition to, and not in lieu
of, officers that otherwise would have been hired. In hiring new officers, agencies may not reduce the scope of their
customer screening and training procedures, and must include community policing principles and methods in their
training curricula. In addition, to the extent practicable, COPS grant funds should be used to increase the representation
of women and racial and ethnic minorities within the ranks of sworn officers.

In light of the expedited nature of these approaches, the time frames responses from interested agencies are relatively
short. A complete description of program requirements will be contained in the application kits. Additional COPS
grant programs will be announced in the near future.

ACTION: 

Notice of availability of funds and solicitation for grant application (SGA).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA), announces a demonstration program
to identify job development brokers that will link specific job opportunities with the development of appropriate
curricula and support mechanisms for eligible dislocated workers to be funded with Secretary's National Reserve
funds appropriated through Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA).




This notice describes the process that eligible entities must use to apply for demonstration funds, the subject area
for which applications will be accepted for funding, how grantees are to be selected, and the responsibilities of
grantees. Up to $2 million will be made available for funding the approximately three to five demonstration projects
covered by this solicitation.

Everything needed to apply is contained in this announcement.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

Part I. Background



A. Authorities



Section 324 of the Job Training Partnership Act authorizes the use of funds reserved under Part B of Title III for demonstration
programs. The Secretary shall conduct or provide for an evaluation of the success of each demonstration program.



B. Purpose of the Demonstration



Job Development Broker Demonstration Projects funded through this solicitation are to provide reemployment and
retraining services_as described in sections 314(c) and 314(d) JTPA_to eligible dislocated workers. The goals
of this retraining program are to:




_Expand the retraining resources available to dislocated workers being served under Title III of the Job Training
Partnership Act; and

_Support the development of a job development marketplace where brokers with retraining and employment opportunities
can compete to provide assistance to dislocated workers on the basis of performance and customer satisfaction.




The purpose of this demonstration is to identify brokers that will link specific job opportunities with the development
of appropriate curricula and support mechanisms so that eligible dislocated workers who successfully complete
the program will get those jobs, at a cost that will be competitive with other program options available for the dislocated
worker substate grantees and their customers.



C. Demonstration Policy



1. Awards



DOL will select approximately three to five applicants, making awards up to $2.0 million in total, to conduct demonstrations
for job development brokers. It is anticipated that individual grant awards will be approximately $300,000 to $500,000
each; however, in no case will an award exceed $750,000.



2. Evaluation



Under a separate announcement, DOL will select and fund an evaluation contractor to: (1) Provide technical assistance
to selected grantees in establishing appropriate data collection methods and processes; and (2) conduct an independent
evaluation of the outcomes, impacts and benefits of the demonstration projects. Grantees will be expected to make
available participant records and access to personnel, as specified by the evaluation contractor.

In addition, DOL will establish, for each demonstration project site, an oversight group made up of federal, State
and substate staff.



3. Eligible Participants



Workers eligible for assistance under these demonstration grants are those eligible dislocated workers who are
participants in Title III funded programs operated by State and substate grantees.

4. Allowable activities



Grant funds awarded under this demonstration may be used to provide the services described in JTPA Section 314(c)
and Section 314(d). The establishment of linkages with employers, development of appropriate training curricula,
and negotiation of agreements with the Title III State and substate grantees will be critical parts of this demonstration,
but they must be combined with delivery of services and placement of participants in unsubsidized employment.



5. Grant Period



Projects must be completed not later than June 30, 1996. Applications must clearly describe project activities to
be undertaken during the proposed grant period. Funding of project activity subsequent to the approved period of
performance will be the responsibility of the applicant. Additional grant funds will not be available under this
demonstration.



6. Cost Limitations



Demonstration grants are not subject to the cost limitations for formula-funded Title III grants at Section 315 of
the JTPA. However, any offeror proposing administrative costs higher than 15 percent of the budget and supportive
services higher than 25 percent of the funds requested in the application shall provide a narrative justification.



D. Demonstration Topic



DOL is soliciting applications for demonstration projects to test the ability of brokers to market services that
link specific job opportunities with appropriate training and support mechanisms so that eligible dislocated workers
who successfully complete the program will get those jobs, at a cost which will be competitive with other program options
available for Title III substate grantees and their participants.



Part II. Application Process



A. Eligible Applicants



Eligible applicants under this demonstration include (1) employers and associations of employers, (2) unions and
organizations representing workers, and (3) education and training institutions. Consideration will be given
to awarding at least one grant in each of the three categories of eligible applicants. While matching funds will not
be required, applicants will have to demonstrate the ability to market their services to dislocated worker program
grantees that have training resources, including Title III formula-allotted funds to States and substate grantees,
or Title III National Reserve Account funds.



B. Submission of Proposals



An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate
and distinct parts_Part I, the Financial Proposal, and Part II, the Technical Proposal.

1. Financial Proposal



The Financial Proposal shall contain the SF-424, ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (three ink signed
originals) Appendix No., and SF 424-A, ``Budget Information'' (Appendix No. 2). The Federal Domestic Assistance
Catalog number is 17.246. The budget shall include on separate pages: a cost analysis of the budget, identifying in
detail the amount of each budget line item attributable to each of the Title III cost categories at Section 314 of JTPA
for funds requested through this grant; an identification of the amount of each budget line item which will be covered
by other funds, and the sources of those funds (including other Title III funds, employer funds, in-kind resources
secured and unsecured loans, grants, and other forms of assistance, public and private); and an analysis of the cost
effectiveness in terms of unit costs for the delivery of services to individual dislocated workers in comparison
with similar services available to dislocated workers through Title III, and in terms of the scope of the effort with
regard to the projected number of placements available and the number of different dislocated worker program operators
(States and substate grantees) which will be involved.

Federal funds cannot be used to support training which an employer is in a position to, and would otherwise, provide.

Federal funds may not be used for acquisition of production equipment. The only type of equipment that may be acquired
with Federal funds is equipment necessary for the operation of the grant. Grant funds may cover only those costs which
are appropriate and reasonable. In the instance of a purchase, the cost of the equipment is to be prorated over the projected
life of the equipment to determine the cost to the grant. Awardee must receive prior approval from the Department of
Labor/Employment and Training Administration's Property Officer for the purchase and/or lease of any property
and/or equipment with a per unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more, and a useful life of more than one year as defined
in OMB Circulars A-102 and A-110. This includes the purchase of ADP equipment. The request must be directed
through your Grant Officer's Technical Representative (GOTR) and must include a detailed description and cost of
the items to be acquired.

Applicants may budget limited amounts of grant funds to work with technical expert(s) to provide advice and develop
more complete project plans.



2. Technical Proposal



The technical proposal shall demonstrate the offeror's capabilities in accordance with the Statement of Work/Project
Summary as described in Part III of this announcement. NO COST DATA OR REFERENCE TO PRICE SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE TECHNICAL
PROPOSAL.



3. Page Count Limit



Applications are to be limited to 30 single-side pages, single-spaced. The technical proposal should include a 2
to 3 page executive summary.



C. Hand-Delivered Proposals



Proposals should be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the closing date. However, if proposals are hand-delivered,
they shall be received at the designated place by 2 p.m., Eastern Time by December 16, 1994. All overnight mail will
be considered to be hand-delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified time and closing date.
Telegraphed and/or faxed proposals will not be honored. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis
for a determination of nonresponsiveness.



D. Late Proposals



Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it_

<DOCNO> FR941103-2-00119 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Was sent by the U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the
date specified for receipt of the application (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt
of applications by the 15th of the month must have been mailed by the 10th); or 

(2) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays. 

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by the U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark''
means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that
is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees to the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. 

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent by ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope and wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S.
Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined above. Therefore, applicants should request the postal
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation ``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.




E. Withdrawal of Proposals



Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person or by an applicant or an authorized representative thereof, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before an award. 



F. Period of Performance 



The period of performance will be from the date of grant execution through not later than June 30, 1996. 



G. Funding 



DOL has set aside up to $2.0 million to be awarded, based on receipt of meritorious proposals consistent with the criteria
identified in this announcement. It is expected that grant awards will be approximately $300,000 to $500,000 each.
However, in no case shall an award exceed $750,000. 



Part III. Statement of Work




Each application must include in the appropriate section(s): (1) Information that indicates adherence to the provisions
described in Part I of this announcement; (2) information that responds to the requirements in this part; and (3) other
information the offeror believes will address the selection criteria identified in Part IV. Each application should
follow the format outlined here: 



A. Target Group 



A description of the qualifications or criteria for participation in the demonstration project, and the process
to be used to identify and select participants to be served through this demonstration project from among the total
number of eligible individuals served by the Title III program in the area covered by the demonstration application.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a proposed revision to a guide in its Regulatory Guide
Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable
to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in
evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications
for permits and licenses.

The draft guide, temporarily identified by its task number, DG-0005 (which should be mentioned in all correspondence
concerning this draft guide), is a second proposed revision 2 to Regulatory Guide 10.5, ``Applications for Licenses
of Broad Scope.'' This guide is being revised to provide guidance on the type and extent of information needed by the
NRC staff to evaluate applications for a specific license of broad scope for byproduct material.

This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position
in this area. It has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position.

Public comments are being solicited on the draft guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written
comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Comments will be
most helpful if received by January 25, 1995.

Although a time limit is given for comments on this draft, comments and suggestions in connection with (1) items for
inclusion in guides currently being developed or (2) improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Company; (Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2)</DOCTITLE>


Exemption


I


Georgia Power Company (GPC or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-68 and NPF-81,
which authorize operation of the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2 (the facilities) at steady-state
reactor power level not in excess of 3411 megawatts thermal, each. The license providers, among other things, that
it is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC) now
or hereafter in effect. Each unit at the facility consists of a pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's
site in Burke County, Georgia.


II


Section 50.54(q) of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires a licensee authorized to operate a nuclear
power reactor to follow and maintain in effect emergency plans which meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements
of Appendix E to 10 CFR 50. Section IV.F.2 of Appendix E requires that each licensee annually exercise its emergency
plan. Section IV.F.3 of Appendix E requires that each licensee shall exercise with offsite authorities such that
the State and local government emergency plans are exercised biennially.
The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a) are (1) authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances. Special circumstances exist when application of the regulation
in the particular circumstance would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the
underlying purpose of the rule (10 CFR 50.12(a)(2) (ii)). Special circumstances also exist when the exemption would
provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply
with the regulation (10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v)). The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50, Appendix E, Sections IV.F.2 and
IV.F.3, is to demonstrate that the emergency plans are adequate and capable of being implemented, and that the state
of emergency preparedness provides reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken
in the event of a radiological emergency.


III


By letter dated July 21, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.47 and Appendix
E to conduct an annual exercise of the Vogtle Emergency Plan in 1994. The licensee had planned to conduct a full-participation
exercise involving both the states of Georgia and South Carolina and local response organizations on July 27, 1994.
The licensee requested that an exemption be granted because the state of Georgia requested to delay the 1994 annual
exercise from July 27, 1994, to January 11, 1995. The request to move the exercise date was originated by the Georgia
Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) because they would be unable to participate on July 27, 1994, as GEMA personnel
were required to respond to a federally-declared flood disaster in South Georgia. This proposed delay will prevent
Vogtle from meeting the annual requirement to exercise the Vogtle emergency plan as specified in Appendix E to 10 CFR
50, and therefore, GPC requested a schedular exemption.
The previous emergency preparedness exercise at Vogtle was successfully conducted on August 4, 1993, and no violations,
deviations or exercise weaknesses were identified. Offsite participation was limited to receiving Emergency Notification
Messages. A joint plume and ingestion exposure pathway exercise involving the States of Georgia and South Carolina
and the four local governmental agencies was conducted on May 19, 1992.
The licensee had scheduled, planned and coordinated the 1994 exercise with participating Federal, State, and local
agencies for mid-July. The scope and objectives, and the final scenario documentation for the July 1994 exercise
were submitted to the NRC on April 14, 1994, and May 17, 1994, respectively, which is within the time frames established
for their submittal in support of a July 1994 exercise. Thereby, the licensee demonstrated good faith effort in attempting
to comply with the regulation.
The schedule for future exercises will not be affected by this exemption. GPC has stated it will conduct the previously
scheduled 1995 exercise the week of July 19, 1995, as planned. The licensee states that concurrence for the proposed
date of January 11, 1995, has been received from FEMA, NRC Region II, and the affected State and local agencies. FEMA
confirmed its support for the revised exercise date on September 1, 1994.
The most recent NRC Systematic Assessment of Licensee Performance (SALP) report for Vogtle, issued on August 12,
1994, for the period January 3, 1993, through July 2, 1994, indicates that the performance of the emergency preparedness
program was strong; weaknesses observed during the previous assessment period (relating to state and local staff
notification and protective action recommendations) were effectively addressed and observed to be corrected during
the 1993 annual exercise; performance during the conversion to new emergency action levels was effective and well
controlled; training of shift supervisors and off-site personnel was excellent; attention to emergency response
facility and equipment material condition continued to be effective; and overall, excellent emergency preparedness
program performance was demonstrated by proper classification and reporting of three events.


IV


Based upon a review of the licensee's request for an exemption from the requirement to conduct an exercise of the Vogtle
emergency plan in1994, the NRC staff finds that the underlying purpose of the regulation will not be adversely affected
by the rescheduling of the July 27, 1994 exercise to January 11, 1995. The effective response capability demonstrated
by the licensee during the 1993 emergency preparedness exercise, the activities in preparation for the 1994 exercise,
including a table top exercise with the states and counties and the readiness of the licensee's emergency preparedness
program as reflected in its SALP rating and the most recent inspection report, provide assurance that the resources
and personnel necessary for proper emergency response are in place to respond to a nuclear emergency at the Vogtle
site. Thus, an exercise in 1994 is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule and the requested exemption
from the requirement in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F, to defer the performance of an exercise of the Vogtle
emergency plan until January 11, 1995, will not adversely affect the overall state of emergency preparedness at the
Vogtle site.
For these reasons, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the exemption requested by the licensee's
letter of July 21, 1994, as discussed above, is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health
and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security, and that special circumstances are present as
set forth in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2) (ii) and (v).
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting this exemption will have no significant impact
on the environment (59 FR 52841 dated October 20, 1994).
This Exemption is effective upon issuance.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Its Allocation Policy and Procedures


 October 27, 1994.


I. Introduction


On August 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change requesting permanent approval of revisions to its Allocation Policy and Procedures that were
implemented on a one year pilot basis.







The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34644 (September 7, 1994),
59 FR 47192 (September 14, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.


II. Description of the Proposal


The NYSE Allocation Policy and Procedures (``Policy'') governs the allocation of equity securities to NYSE specialist
units.
 The intent of the Policy is to ensure that each equity security listed on the Exchange is allocated in the fairest manner
possible to the best specialist unit for that security. In its continuing efforts to enhance allocation decisions,
the Exchange conducts periodic reviews of the allocation process.
 In October of 1993 the NYSE amended its Policy on a one-year pilot basis to revise, among other things, the allocation
criteria, the composition of the Allocation Committee (``Committee'')
 and Allocation Panel (``Panel''),
 and the Committee's disclosure policy.

The Exchange fully implemented the changes to the Policy, detailed in the Pilot Release, in February of 1994. The Exchange
states that it has reviewed the changes to the Policy as they have impacted on the allocation process and it believes
that there has been a beneficial effect in terms of the way in which stocks are allocated. The Exchange further maintains
that it continues to subject this vital function to rigorous scrutiny, looking to refine the process, as is evidenced
by the filing of further changes to the Policy cited earlier.



III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of
a free and open market, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Further, the Commission finds
that the proposal is consistent with Section 11(b) of the Act
 and Rule 11b-1 thereunder,
 which allow exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists in order to maintain fair and orderly markets.
For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the amended Policy should enhance the Exchange's allocation
process, encourage improved specialist performance and, thereby, protect investors and the public interest.






Specialists play a crucial role in providing stability, liquidity and continuity to the trading of securities. Among
the obligations imposed upon specialists by the Exchange, and by the Act and the rules thereunder, is the maintenance
of fair and orderly markets in their designated securities.
 To ensure that specialists fulfill these obligations, it is important that the Exchange develop and maintain stock
allocation procedures and policies that provide specialists with an incentive to strive for optimal performance.
The Commission fully supports and encourages the NYSE's continuing effort to develop meaningful and effective allocation
policies that encourage improved specialist performance and market quality.




The Commission believes that the proposed revisions to the NYSE's Policy should refine the Exchange's allocation
process and, thereby, encourage improved specialist performance. As discussed in more detail in the Pilot Release,
the NYSE's Policy emphasizes that the most significant allocation criterion is specialist performance. In the Commission's
view, performance-based stock allocations not only help to ensure that stocks are allocated to specialists who will
make the best markets, but will provide an incentive for specialists to improve their performance or maintain superior
performance.

The Commission believes that the use of Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire (``SPEQ'')
 ratings, objective performance measures, and the Committee's professional judgment under the revised Policy should
enable the Committee to review specialist performance in a more precise and comprehensive fashion. Specifically,
the Commission believes that it is appropriate to limit the weight that the SPEQ may be given in allocation decisions
to one-third and to increase the emphasis given to objective measures of performance. Although the SPEQ remains a
useful tool to measure performance, the Commission has long believed that objective indications of performance
should play an important role in allocation decisions. In particular, the Commission believes that objective performance
measures can identify poor market making performance that otherwise may not be reflected in a unit's SPEQ survey results.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-2-00128 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to require that SPEQ performance data be presented to the Committee
in four tiers, with units listed alphabetically in each comparable group, is a reasonable means of ranking units for
comparison. In this regard, the Commission recognizes that a unit might not have SPEQ scores which, from a statistical
perspective, are significantly different from the next higher or lower unit. The presentation of the SPEQ results
in four tiers that differ significantly should provide the Committee with appropriate groupings of specialist units
for its use in allocation decisions. This should help the Committee in its evaluation of applicants for a new listing.

The Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to amend its Policy to state that in the case of spin-offs, listings
of related companies and relistings of securities, the NYSE will honor a listing company's request that it not be allocated
automatically to its former specialist unit or the specialist in the parent or related company, should provide an
opportunity for the listed company to provide input into the allocation of an affiliated listing. However, a listing
company's preference should not be allowed to take significance over or negate specialist performance. A listing
company's preference is a minor, supplemental factor and only should be used to distinguish between the best qualified
units based on performance related criteria.
 In this regard, the listing company's request would serve only to open the allocation to all units.





The Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to delete the reference to specific aspects of trading foreign
issues on the Exchange floor should provide the NYSE with additional flexibility in allocating foreign issues. Again,
the foreign listing considerations in the Policy are supplemental in that specialist performance remains the key
factor in allocation decisions.

The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to eliminate specialist representation on the Committee will solve
the appearance of a conflict of interest on the Committee and, thereby, enhance confidence in the allocation process.
The Commission concurs with the NYSE's conclusion that floor brokers and allied members are in a better position to
judge the relative strengths and weaknesses of specialist units. The Commission also agrees that an effort should
be made to appoint individuals that have not yet served on the Committee before reappointing past Committee members.
This should ensure that a broader segment of the trading floor community will have an opportunity to serve on the Committee.
In this regard, the Commission also agrees with the NYSE in that the Panel should consist of a core group of experienced,
senior professionals and supports its proposal to select a significant number of floor members on the Panel from among
the Exchange's senior floor officials, floor governors and former allocation committee chairmen. Accordingly,
the Commission believes that the revised mix of both Committee and Panel members is appropriate and consistent with
the Act.

The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to require that the list of Committee members be kept confidential
and prohibit members and investment bankers from initiating contact with Committee members regarding pending allocations
should minimize potential conflicts in allocation decisions. Under the revised Policy, Committee members still
would be permitted to initiate contact with any specialist if they believe it would be beneficial when making an allocation
decision. The Commission believes that this revision to the Policy should help to ensure that specialist performance,
rather than subjective recommendation, is the most significant criterion in allocation decisions.

<PARENT> FR941103-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to amend the Policy to discontinue the practice of distributing
a summary of reasons for each allocation decision to Exchange floor members provides for more efficient resource
allocation and reduces unnecessary paperwork. At the same time, the Commission emphasizes, however, that the Exchange
will make such information available to those who are interested by continuing to publish
 allocation decisions for its membership and listing companies.





The Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to permit all current Committee members, including outgoing
members, to vote for an incoming Committee Chairman is reasonable in that outgoing Committee members have gained
valuable experience with candidates with whom they have been serving. Therefore, the Commission believes that outgoing
members' input should broaden the scope of the election of the NYSE's Committee Chairman, and help to ensure the selection
of the best qualified Chairman of the Committee.






The Commission believes that the proposed amendments to the allocation application procedure to require information
about a specialist unit's contacts with listed companies and NYSE member organizations should help to facilitate
compliance with NYSE Rule 106. NYSE Rule 106(c) requires each specialist to report to the Exchange semi-annually,
a record of their contacts with senior officials of their listed companies, their off-floor contacts with representatives
of each of the 15 largest Exchange member organizations, their off-floor contacts with each other member organization
that is a significant customer of the specialist unit, and their off-floor contacts with any other member organization
that requests such contact. Because the revised application would specify the Exchange's current specialist contact
requirement, the proposal should assist specialists in their responsibilities under the rules of the Exchange.

Finally, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the NYSE to implement the revised Policy on a permanent
basis. The Commission believes that the pilot period has provided the Exchange and the Commission with an opportunity
to study the effects of the revised Policy on the NYSE's allocation process. During the pilot period, the Exchange
has monitored carefully the effects of the revised Policy and has reported its findings to the Commission. The Commission
has reviewed and analyzed the reports submitted by the Exchange and on that basis, and for the reasons discussed above,
believes that the revised Policy is consistent with the Act and furthers the objectives of the Exchange to develop
an efficient and reliable allocation procedure.



It Is Therefore Ordered

, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-30) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Storage of Option Customer Account Information for Supervisory Purposes</DOCTITLE>


October 27, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on July 5, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposal to amend paragraph (d), ``Maintenance of Customer Account
Records,'' of PHLX Rule 1025, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' to allow member organizations to maintain customer information
and account statements off-site, rather than at the principal supervisory office, as long as the records are readily
accessible and promptly retrievable.







The proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34561 (September 12, 1994), 59 FR 47660 (September 16, 1994).
 No comments were received on the proposal.




Currently, PHLX Rule 1025(d) requires member organizations to maintain at the branch office servicing the customer's
account and at the principal supervisory office background and financial information of customers who have been
approved for options transactions. In addition, Commentary .03 to PHLX Rule 1025 requires member organizations
to maintain, at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the office servicing the customer's account,
information to permit review of each customer's options account to determine the compatibility of options transactions
with investment objectives, the size and frequency of options transactions, commission activity in the account,
profit or loss in the account, undue concentration in any options class or classes, and compliance with the provisions
of Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board. The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1025(d) and Commentary .03 to allow
member organizations to maintain the required customer information and account statements off-site, rather than
at the principal supervisory office, as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. However,
branch offices must continue to maintain customer account information on site.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941103-2-00131 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941103-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The PHLX states that the increasing use of computers, fax machines, optical disk and other technology, coupled with
the expense of storing records on-site, have resulted in more member organizations storing records away from their
principal supervisory offices.
 In view of technological advances, the Exchange believes that it is appropriate to permit the off-site storage of
customer records previously required to be maintained at a principal supervisory office. The Exchange also believes
that offsite storage should not compromise the supervisory obligations of member/participant organizations because,
under the proposal, the customer information necessary to fulfill those responsibilities must be easily accessible
and promptly retrievable.





Accordingly, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general,
and, in particular with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
as well as to protect investors and the public interest.

The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate
transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.






Specifically, by allowing off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices,
the commission believes that the proposal should provide the PHLX's members with a cost-effective means to utilize
computers, facsimile machines, optical disks, and other technology to store the required customer account information
off-site while ensuring that member firms will continue to have easy access to all of the customer account information
necessary to discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In this regard, the proposal provides that options
customer account information stored off-site must be ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable,''
 thereby preserving the Exchange's ability to access and investigate customer account records. Thus, the Commission
believes that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the PHLX's interest in allowing member organizations
to reduce the cost of storing customer account information and ensuring that the information continues to be available
for supervisory purposes.





In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to allow off-site storage of customer account
information maintained at supervisory offices, but not of account information stored at branch offices, because
branch offices are responsible for the day-to-day administration of customer accounts and require immediate access
to account information. For example by continuing to require branch offices to store customer account information
on-site, the proposal facilitates broker compliance with the suitability requirements applicable to options customers.



It is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PHLX-94-35) is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Trust is a unit investment trust, organized in series form and registered under the Act. Units of each Series
will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and will be offered to the public. Each Series
will be organized pursuant to a trust indenture that will incorporate a master trust agreement relating to the entire
Trust (the agreement and indenture are collectively referred to as the ``Trust Agreement''). The Trust Agreement
will name a qualified bank as trustee (the ``Trustee'').

2. Each unit of a Series will represent an undivided interest in an unmanaged portfolio consisting of (i) U.S. Treasury
bonds or notes paying no current interest (zero coupon obligations) and (ii) shares of a Fund. Each Series will acquire
an amount of zero coupon obligations that, upon termination of the Series, will be sufficient to pay each initial investor
purchasing units of the Trust Series on the first date such units are offered for sale, the total amount that the investor
originally invested in the Series, plus sales charges incurred. The remainder of the Series' proceeds will be invested
in shares of a single Fund.

<TEXT>
 

3. The Sponsor will deposit in each Series zero coupon obligations at a price determined by an independent evaluator
and shares of a Fund at their net asset value. With the deposit of the zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in a Series,
the Sponsor will have established a proportionate relationship between the principal amount of zero coupon obligations
and Fund shares so that the initial investors will receive at least their original purchase price, including sales
charges, upon termination of the Series. Simultaneously with such deposit, the Trustee will deliver to the Sponsor
registered certificates for units in each Series which will represent the entire ownership of the Series. The units
of a Series will be offered for sale to the public by the Sponsor through the final prospectus after the registration
statement of Form S-6 under the Securities Act has been declared effective and clearance with the applicable
state authorities has been obtained.

4. The units will be offered initially at a price based on the net asset value of the shares of a Fund selected for deposit
in that Series, the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations deposited in the Series, plus a sales charge.
An independent evaluator will charge each Series an evaluation fee for the cost of determining the value of zero coupon
obligations that are deposited in the Series. No such fee will be charged on Fund shares deposited in the Series because
the value of those securities is readily available. Upon redemption, each Series will redeem units in that Series
at prices based on the aggregate bid side value of the zero coupon obligations plus the net asset value of the Fund's
shares.

5. Although it will not be obligated to do so, the Sponsor will contract with a registered broker-dealer (the ``Market
Maker''), initially expected to be an organization unaffiliated with the Sponsor, to maintain a secondary market
for the units. The Market Maker will repurchase the units at a price based on the aggregate bid side value of the zero
coupon obligations plus the net asset value of the Fund's shares (excluding sales loads on Fund shares) and will reoffer
the units at this price plus a sales charge. The extent to which the Market Maker maintains a secondary market for the
units will reduce the number of units presented to the Series for redemption and thus obviate the need for the Series
to sell zero coupon obligations or Fund shares to meet redemption requests. In the event that the Sponsor does not enter
into or maintain a contract with the Market Maker, or the Market Maker does not maintain a secondary market in the units,
the Sponsor will instruct the Trustee to sell Fund shares or zero coupon obligations, the latter only if after the sale
the original proportional relationship between zero coupon obligations and unit value is maintained.

6. The Sponsor will be permitted under the Trust Agreement to deposit additional securities, which may result in a
potential corresponding increase in the number of units outstanding. Such units may be continuously offered for
sale to the public by means of a prospectus. The Sponsor anticipates that any additional securities deposited in the
Series subsequent to the initial date of deposit in connection with the sale of these additional units will maintain
the proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in the Series.

7. Each Fund will be an open-end management investment company that is registered under the Act. Each Fund will be advised
by the Adviser, have its shares distributed by the Distributor, or otherwise be a fund within the same group of investment
companies, within the meaning of rule 11a-3 under the Act. The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

8. Some of the Funds may impose front-end sales loads (``FESL''), contingent deferred sales charges (``CDSC'') in
accordance with an exemptive order (the ``CDSC Order''),
 or rule 12b-1 fees. Any FESL or CDSC will be waived by the Fund on purchases by a Series and any rule 12b-1 fees
will either be waived or rebated immediately to the Trustee of a Series by the Fund. In the event that a rule 12b-1
fee is rebated in this manner, the Series will use the rebated fee to pay for that Series' expenses and distribute to
unit holders any remainder. If rule 12b-1 fees are not charged by the Fund, the Series will pay for its expenses
from any income received from distributions paid on Fund shares and, if necessary, will sell Fund shares to pay for
expenses. Zero coupon obligations held by a Series will not be sold to pay for Series or Trust expenses.

9. Each Series will terminate after a stated period of years, initially expected to be approximately 10 to 15 years.
At the termination of a Series, unitholders will have a choice of receiving (1) their pro rata share of the underlying
Fund shares in kind and the cash proceeds from the zero coupon obligations, (2) their pro rata share of cash upon the
liquidation of the Fund shares and zero coupon obligations or (3) their pro rata share of the underlying Fund shares
in kind and investing the amount of cash proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in additional Fund shares without
paying a FESL or CDSC, if any. After termination of a Series, unitholders electing the first or last option will become
shareholders of the particular Fund and will be subject to their pro rata share of any rule 12b-1 fees charged
by the Fund, as are all other shareholders of the Fund.



Applicants' Legal Conclusions





1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires that investment companies have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering.
As the Sponsor intends to sell all of the Trust Series' units to the public, thereby withdrawing certificates representing
the entire beneficial ownership of the Trust, applicants request exemptive relief from the net worth requirement
of section 14(a). Applicants will comply in all respects with rule 14a-3, which provides an exemption from section
14(a), except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.''


2. Section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 thereunder make it unlawful for a registered investment company to distribute
long-term capital gains more often than once every twelve months. Applicants request an exemption from section 19(b)
and rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to permit any capital gains resulting from the redemption of Fund shares
to be distributed to unitholders along with the Trust's regular quarterly distributions. In all other respects,
applicants intend to comply with rule 19b-1 under the Act.


3. Section 11(a) makes it unlawful for any registered open-end investment company or principal underwriter for such
company to make or cause to be made certain offers of exchange on any basis other than the relative net asset values of
the securities to be exchanged, unless the terms of the exchange offer have first been approved by the SEC. Section
11(c) provides that section 11(a) will be applicable to any type of exchange offer involving securities of a registered
unit investment trust, irrespective of the basis of exchange. Upon termination of the Trust, unitholders will have
the option, which could be viewed as an exchange offer, to receive their pro rata share of the underlying Fund shares
in kind and invest the amount of cash proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in additional Fund shares without the
imposition of a FESL or CDSC (although rule 12b-1 fees will be imposed on the Fund shares ultimately held by the
unitholder) (the ``Exchange Option''). The ``exchange'' of Series' unit proceeds for Fund shares will be at relative
net asset value since the Fund will waive any FESL or CDSC that it might otherwise impose if a unitholder selects the
Exchange Option. As such, aside from a rule 12b-1 fee, if any, that would be imposed on unitholders once they became
shareholders of a Fund that imposed such a fee, there will be no economic incentive for a broker to encourage a unitholder
to select the Exchange Option at the termination of the Series. Applicants believe that the terms of the Exchange Option
are fair and reasonable to the unitholders and consistent with the policy and purpose of section 11.




4. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act make it unlawful for any affiliated person or principal underwriter
for a registered investment company, and any affiliated person of such persons, acting as principal, to effect any
transaction in which such registered company is a joint or a joint and several participant with such person, unless
the SEC has granted an order approving of the transaction. Applicants believe that the conditions imposed in any order
granted will ensure that the proposed arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the
Act, and that neither the Trust nor the Fund will participate in the arrangement on a different or less disadvantageous
basis than other participants.

5. Applicants do not request relief under section 12(d)(1) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1) limits purchases by registered
investment companies of securities issued by other investment companies. Section 12(d)(1) (E) provides, however,
that section 12(d)(1) shall not apply to securities purchased by a registered unit investment trust if the securities
are the only ``investment securities'' held by the trust. Applicants believe that the U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations
are not ``investment securities'' for purposes of section 12(d)(1) (E)
 and that the Fund shares are the only ``investment securities'' which the Trust will hold. Accordingly, they do not
believe relief from section 12(d)(1) is necessary.




Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree to the following as conditions to the granting of the requested order:
1. The Trustee will not redeem Fund shares except to the extent necessary to meet redemptions of units by unitholders,
or to pay Trust expenses should distributions and rebated rule 12b-1 fees received on Fund shares prove insufficient
to cover such expenses.
2. Any rule 12b-1 fees received by the Sponsor or the Distributor in connection with the distribution of Fund
shares to the Trust will be immediately rebated to the Trustee.
3. All Trust Series investing in shares of the same Fund will be structured so that their maturity dates will be at least
thirty days apart from one another.
4. Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Trust will not
restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.''
5. Shares of a Fund which are held by a Series of the Trust will be voted by the Trustee of the Trust, and the Trustees will
vote all shares of a Fund held in a Trust in the same proportion as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust are
voted.
6. No sales charge or redemption fee will be imposed on shares of a Fund which are held by any Series of the Trust or on any
shares acquired by unitholders through reinvestment of dividends or distributions or through reinvestment at termination.
7. The prospectus of each Trust Series and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of a reinvestment
option will disclose that shareholders who elect to invest in Fund shares will incur a rule 12b-1 fee if the Fund
imposes a rule 12b-1 fee.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Modification of a Previously Approved Antitheft Device; </DOCTITLE>
Volkswagen 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of petition for modification of a previously approved antitheft device.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In 1988, this agency granted Volkswagen of America, Inc.'s (Volkswagen) petition for exemption from the parts marking
requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the Audi 100 and Audi 200 lines. The lines have been redesignated
for model year 1995 as, respectively, the Audi A6 and Audi S6. This notice grants Volkswagen's petition for a modification
of the exemption originally granted in 1988, and modified in 1992. The agency grants this petition because it has determined,
based on substantial evidence, that the modified antitheft device described in Volkswagen's petition to be placed
on the car lines as standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as
compliance with parts marking requirements. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In February 1988, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice granting the petition from Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen) for an exemption from the parts marking
requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for two model year (MY) 1989 Volkswagen car lines, the Audi
100 and Audi 200. (See 53 FR 4095, February 11, 1988). The agency determined that the antitheft device which Volkswagen
intended to install on the two car lines as standard equipment was likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring
motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard. 




Subsequently, on April 29, 1992, NHTSA published a notice granting Volkswagen's petition for a modification of the
1988 exemption so that company could begin installing a new version of its antitheft device (See 57 FR 18203). The new
device was placed as standard equipment on the MY 1992 Audi 100 and S4 (formerly the 200) lines. Volkswagen stated that
the MY 1992 antitheft device included a modified central locking system, and included, on the higher priced models
in the 100 line, a remote control signaling unit.

In a letter dated May 11, 1994, Volkswagen informed NHTSA of contemplated changes to the antitheft device to be placed
as standard equipment on the MY 1995 Audi A6 and S6 car lines, and requested that the modified antitheft device be permitted.
In a letter dated July 14, 1994, Volkswagen submitted a letter showing ``good cause'' why NHTSA should make the grant
of the petition for modification applicable to MY 1995. In a letter dated August 3, 1994, Volkswagen provided supplemental
information addressing section 543.6(a)(4), reasons for the petitioner's belief that the antitheft device will
be effective in reducing motor vehicle theft, and section 543.6(a)(5), reasons for the petitioner's belief that
NHTSA should determine that the antitheft device is likely to be as effective as parts marking. Together, Volkswagen's
submissions of May 11, July 14, and August 3 constitute a complete submission, as required by 49 CFR 543.9(c)(2), in
that the petition meets the general content requirements of section 543.5 paragraphs (b) (1) through (3) and (7);
and the specific content requirements under section 543.6. 


In a letter dated May 23, 1994 to Volkswagen, the agency granted the petitioner's request for confidential treatment
of bracketed information in its May 11, 1994 letter. On September 6, 1994, Volkswagen informed NHTSA in writing that
the names of the A6 and S6 car lines and the model year of their introduction, had been publicly released, and therefore,
Volkswagen no longer requested confidential treatment for this information. 


Volkswagen's petition contains a detailed description of the identity, design, and location of the components of
the antitheft device, including the electrical schematics of the device. There are locks on the trunk, the driver's
door, and the front passenger door. Volkswagen stated that the antitheft device planned for MY 1995 is activated by
removing the key from the ignition and locking the driver's door or trunk. When the operator removes the ignition key,
exits from the vehicle and locks the driver's door with the key, the central locking system is activated. Activation
of the central locking system renders the starter motor nonfunctional and arms an audible alarm. The alarm is triggered
by sensors in the light contact switches for the doors and engine compartment, by a sensor located in the trunk key cylinder,
and by disconnection of the ground wire between the radio housing and the antitheft alarm unit. 


The theft deterrent system of the antitheft device planned for MY 1995 has an engine starter interrupt function. While
the system is armed, any breach of it will automatically interrupt the starter relay. Once the alarm has been triggered,
the engine cannot be started until the alarm has been deactivated with the key in one of the front doors or the trunk lock.

Volkswagen states that the antitheft device planned for the MY 1995 car lines differs somewhat from the device on the
MY 1992 lines. Volkswagen states that the differences in the planned MY 1995 device are a revision in the central locking
system, the addition of an LED activation indicator, and changes in the audible and visible warning devices. 
With the MY 1992 antitheft device, once the central locking system and alarm are activated, the operator could choose
to open only a specific door lock or the trunk lock by turning the key and quickly releasing it. Holding the key for more
than 0.5 seconds in the open position deactivates the alarm, and opens both door locks and the trunk lock. Additionally,
when the key is inserted and turned counterclockwise to open the trunk lock, the central locking system also opens
both door locks and deactivates the alarm system. Turning the key in either front door lock or in the trunk lock rearms
the device and locks both doors and the trunk. Tampering with the device will cause both the horn and lights to activate
for up to 4 minutes. 
For MY 1995, Volkswagen plans to modify the antitheft device so that when the key is inserted into a front door lock or
trunk lock, the key will only open the lock being turned. However, an operator can open all the door locks and the trunk
lock simultaneously if, within 5 seconds of the first turn of the key, the operator turns the key a second time to the
open position. Tampering with the MY 1995 system would cause the horn to sound for 30 seconds, instead of sounding for
up to 4 minutes, as the MY 1992 system does. In addition, the device planned for MY 1995 will utilize the hazard warning
flashers, which operate up to 5 minutes. For MY 1995, an LED activation indicator light will be added on the front dashboard.
A flashing light shows that the antitheft device is activated. 
For the planned MY 1995 device, Volkswagen provided a drawing indicating that all the switches and wiring activating
the device are protected. The door, trunk, and engine hood contact switches are all hidden within the vehicle. Additionally,
the control unit for the antitheft device is located in the passenger-side dashboard, with the battery being protected
under the hood. If an unauthorized attempt should be made to open the hood, an audible signal and flashing of the hazard
warning lamps will be triggered via the contact switch for the engine compartment light when it is opened. The alarm
system horn is located in the trunk compartment and can only be reached after the trunk lock is opened. 
Volkswagen addressed the reliability and durability of its antitheft device by providing a list of Volkswagen's
internal performance and durability tests that were conducted on the device. Among these tests were tests for: Material
requirements; operating voltages; temperature stability; mechanical properties; electrical requirements;
electromagnetic compatibility; environmental compatibility; and service life. With its petition, Volkswagen
included a certification that the antitheft device was tested according to Volkswagen's standard, including those
tests relating to electrical and mechanical durability, and passed all the performance requirements of the tests.

As further evidence of the antitheft device's reliability and durability, Volkswagen stated that the functions
of the antitheft device are to be handled by a specially developed microchip manufactured with the latest complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (C-MOS) technology. Volkswagen asserts that among the advantages of this method
are that it reduces the number of discrete components by about 60 percent compared with conventional antitheft devices;
it has better reliability, as there are fewer solder joints; it has a high degree of parameter stability; and by the
use of a chip, the suggestion of contact bounce and interference on input signals from the protected areas can be digitalized.
Volkswagen further states that in addition to a high degree of protection (the unit will withstand ^150 V to +100 V pulses
without damage), this achieves a high degree of resistance to interference. 
Volkswagen stated that the antitheft device planned for the MY 1995 A6 and S6 car lines is, except for the changes noted
earlier, almost identical to the devices on the Audi 100, S4, 500 and Quattro car lines that have been granted exemptions
from parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard. 
The agency has reviewed the theft experience of the Audi 100 and 200 car lines equipped with the antitheft device as
standard equipment, for 1989, 1990, and 1991. The data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, NHTSA's
official source of theft data, show that for 1990/91 the most recent year for which theft data is available, the Audi
100/200 had a theft rate of 1.3564 (per thousand vehicles produced), a rate that is below the 1990/91 median theft rate
of 3.5826. For 1990/91, out of 235 vehicle lines, the Audi 100/200 line was ranked 204, far lower than the median rank
of 116. 
In discussing why it believes the antitheft device will be effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft,
Volkswagen compared its MY 1995 antitheft device to similar devices for which NHTSA has previously granted exemptions
from parts marking. Volkswagen stated that the theft rates of these comparable lines decreased when the antitheft
device was made standard equipment, and have remained, for the most part, below 1983/84 median theft rate of 3.2712
(per thousand vehicles produced). (See 50 FR 46666, November 12, 1985). Volkswagen stated its belief that its device
proposed for MY 1995 is equivalent to all of these comparable devices previously granted an exemption by the agency.
The agency believes that the MY 1995 Volkswagen antitheft device is comparable to the devices on the car lines cited
below.

Based on data from the FBI's National Crime Information Center, Volkswagen showed that the theft rate of the Toyota
Cressida went from 4.7 (all figures provided are for thefts per thousand vehicles produced) in 1985 to 4.26 in 1986;
the theft rate of the Toyota Supra went from 10.39 in 1985 to 2.79 in 1986; the theft rate of the Nissan Maxima went from
4.18 in 1984 to 1.99 in 1985; the theft rate of the Nissan 300ZX went from 8.74 in 1983/84 to 5.14 in 1989; and the theft
rate of the Mazda RX-7 went from 12.11 in 1984 to a theft rate of 6.09 in 1989. 
For these reasons, Volkswagen believes that the antitheft system planned for installation on its MY 1995 A6 and S6
lines is likely to be as effective in reducing thefts as compliance with the parts marking requirements of part 541.

NHTSA believes that there is substantial evidence indicating that the modified antitheft system planned to be installed
as standard equipment on the MY 1995 Audi A6 and S6 car lines will likely be as effective in reducing and deterring motor
vehicle theft as compliance with the requirements of the theft prevention standard (49 CFR part 541). This determination
is based on the information that Volkswagen submitted with its petition and on other available information. The agency
believes that the modified device will continue to provide the types of performance listed in section 543.6(a)(3):
promoting activation; attracting attention to unauthorized entries; preventing defeat or circumventing of the
device by unauthorized persons; preventing operation of the vehicle by unauthorized entrants; and ensuring the
reliability and durability of the device. 
As required by 49 CFR section 543.6(a)(4), the agency also finds that Volkswagen has provided adequate reasons for
its belief that the modified antitheft device will reduce and deter theft. This conclusion is based on the information
Volkswagen provided on its device. This information included a description of reliability and functional tests
conducted by Volkswagen for the antitheft device and its components. 
In 49 CFR 543.9, paragraph (h)(2)(ii) permits the agency to establish an effective date for the modification of the
exemption earlier than ``the model year following the model year in which NHTSA issued the modification decision''
upon a showing of good cause by the manufacturer that an earlier effective date for modifying its exemption is consistent
with the public interest and purposes of 49 U.S.C. section 33106. In its petition, Volkswagen stated that making the
modification of its antitheft system effective beginning with MY 1995 is in the public interest since it would permit
expeditious manufacture and sale of vehicles with the modified antitheft system as standard equipment. Volkswagen
cited the 1990/91 theft data published by NHTSA in the 

Federal Register

 (59 

FR

 12400, March 16, 1994) shows that the Audi 100/200 car lines had a theft rate of 1.3564 (per thousand vehicles stolen),
substantially below the 1990/91 theft rate of 3.5826. Volkswagen stated its belief that the antitheft device proposed
for the MY 1995 Audi A6 and S6 car lines, with essentially the same device, will continue to have a theft rate well below
the median. NHTSA has reviewed this showing of ``good cause'' and finds that making the modification of Volkswagen's
petition effective beginning with the 1995 model year is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. section
33106. 
For the foregoing reasons, the agency hereby exempts the Volkswagen Audi A6 and S6 car lines that are the subject of
this notice, in whole, from the requirements of 49 CFR part 541. 
If, in the future, Volkswagen decides not to use the exemption for the car line that is the subject of this notice, it
should formally notify the agency. If such a decision is made, the car line must be fully marked according to the requirements
under 49 CFR 541.5 and 541.6 (marking of major component parts and replacement parts). 
The agency notes that the limited and apparently conflicting data on the effectiveness of the pre-standard parts
marking programs continue to make it difficult to compare the effectiveness of an antitheft device with the effectiveness
of compliance with the theft prevention standard. The statute clearly invites such a comparison, which the agency
has made on the basis of the limited data available. With implementation of the requirements of the ``Anti Car Theft
Act of 1992,'' NHTSA anticipates more probative data upon which comparisons may be made. 
NHTSA notes also that if Volkswagen wishes in the future to modify the device on which this exemption is based, the company
may have to submit a petition to modify the exemption. Part 543.7(d) states that a Part 543 exemption applies only to
vehicles that belong to a line exempted under this part and equipped with the antitheft device on which the line's exemption
is based. Further, section 543.9(c)(2) provides for the submission of petitions ``(t)o modify an exemption to permit
the use of an antitheft device similar to but differing from the one specified in that exemption.'' 
However, the agency wishes to minimize the administrative burden which section 543.9(c)(2) could place on exempted
vehicle manufacturers and itself. The agency did not intend in drafting Part 543 to require the submission of a modification
petition for every change to the components or design of an antitheft device. The significance of many such changes
could be 

de minimis.

 Therefore, NHTSA suggests that if the manufacturer contemplates making any changes the effects of which might be
characterized as 

de minimis,

 it should consult the agency before preparing and submitting a petition to modify.

<DOCTITLE>Pipeline Safety Advisory Bulletin ADB-94-05; Pipelines Affected by Flooding </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advisory to each owner or operator of a hazardous liquid or natural gas transmission pipeline operating in areas that
may be subject to severe flooding. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This advisory is for all operators of pipelines which may be affected by flooding. It provides observations from RSPA,
Texas Railroad Commission (TRC), and other federal and state agencies as a result of the recent floods near Houston.
This advisory also includes actions that operators should consider taking to assure the integrity of pipelines in
case of flooding.


Background 


As the result of unprecedented flooding of rivers and streams in the Houston area, seven natural gas and hazardous
liquid pipelines failed in or near the San Jacinto River over the three day period October 19-21, 1994. These
failures included: an Exxon 8-inch diameter LPG line; an Exxon 8-inch diameter fuel line; an Exxon 20-inch diameter
hazardous liquid line; a Colonial 40-inch diameter products (gasoline) line; a Colonial 36-inch diameter products
(heating oil) line; a Texaco 20-inch diameter crude oil line; and a Valero 12-inch diameter natural gas line. While
no determination of cause of failure has been made for any of these lines, RSPA and the TRC believe that the extreme flooding
by the San Jacinto River was probably a substantial contributing factor in each of the failures. 
The damage to pipelines caused by the flood may have resulted either from the extreme force of the flowing water, as
the San Jacinto carved new temporary channels, or from pipelines being struck by heavy debris that was reported as
having flowed down river at the height of the flooding. Because RSPA and the TRC cannot at this time determine the exact
effects of the flooding, operators should consider the potential effects of flooding as posing a possible threat
to the integrity of their lines. 


Advisory 


As the result of seven natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline flood-related failures in or near the San Jacinto
River in Texas on October 19-21, 1994, operators should consider the actions recommended in this Advisory Bulletin
for application to pipelines located in any area of the United States subject to widespread flooding.

RSPA pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR 192.613 for natural gas pipelines, and 49 CFR 195.401 for hazardous liquid
pipelines, require an operator to maintain continuing surveillance of its facilities and to correct damage to its
pipeline that could affect the safe operation of the pipeline (such as damage that may result from extreme flood conditions).
If the operator of a natural gas pipeline determines that the pipeline is in unsatisfactory condition and no immediate
hazard exists, the operator must recondition or phase out the segment involved, or reduce the maximum allowable operating
pressure. For hazardous liquid pipelines, if the condition presents an immediate hazard to persons or property,
the operator may not operate the affected part of the system until the unsafe condition is corrected. In summary, if
the operator has reason to believe that flooding has adversely affected, or will adversely affect, its pipeline,
the operator must take corrective or preventative action. 

In addition, operators must consider the application of RSPA's reporting requirements in 49 CFR Part 191, and subpart
B of 49 CFR Part 195, as well as applicable state requirements, that require operators to submit telephonic and written
reports when natural gas or hazardous liquids are released causing damages meeting the reporting thresholds. Finally,
RSPA regulations also require operators to submit reports of safety-related conditions involving potentially
unsafe conditions on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines (49 CFR 191.23 and 191.25, and 49 CFR 195.55 and 195.56).

Operators need to direct their resources in a manner that will enable them to determine the potential effects of the
flooding on their systems, and take the following actions as appropriate: 

 Deploy personnel so that they will be in position to take emergency actions, such as shut down, isolation, or
containment. 

 Extend regulator vents and relief stacks above the level of anticipated flooding, as appropriate. 

 Evaluate the accessibility of pipeline facilities that may be in jeopardy, such as valve settings, needed
to isolate water crossings or other sections of a pipeline. 

 Perform frequent patrols, including overflights as appropriate, to evaluate right-of-way conditions at
water crossings during flooding and after waters subside. Determine if flooding has exposed or undermined pipelines
as a result of new river channels cut by the flooding or by erosion or scouring.

 Coordinate with emergency and spill responders on pipeline location and condition, and provide maps and other
relevant information to them. 
 Coordinate with other pipeline operators in the flood area and establish emergency response centers to act
as liaison for pipeline problems and solutions. 
 Determine if facilities which are normally above ground (e.g., valves, regulators, relief sets, etc.) have
become submerged and are in danger of being struck by vessels or debris; if possible, such facilities may be marked
with an appropriate buoy with Coast Guard approval. 
 Perform surveys to determine the depth of cover over pipelines and the condition of any exposed pipelines,
such as those crossing scour holes. Where appropriate, surveys of underwater pipe should include the use of visual
inspection by divers or instrumented detection. Information gathered by these surveys should be shared with landowners.
Agricultural agencies may help to inform farmers of the potential hazard from reduced cover over pipelines. 
 Assure that line markers are still in place or are replaced in a timely manner, and notify contractors, highway
departments, and others involved in post-flood restoration activities of the presence of pipelines and the risks
posed by reduced cover. 


If a pipeline operator has suffered damage to its line, or has shut in the line, or has operated at a reduced pressure
as a precautionary measure during the flood, the operator should advise the State Pipeline Safety Office (for intrastate
lines), or RSPA's Regional Pipeline Safety Office (interstate lines) prior to returning the line to service, on increasing
the operating pressure, or otherwise changing the operating status of the line. The State Safety Division or the RSPA
Regional Pipeline Safety Office, as appropriate, will advise on a case-by-case basis whether, and under what conditions,
a line can safely be returned to full service.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Internal Computer Matching Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Computer Matching Program. 





Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to conduct an internal computer matching
program. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Finance and Information
Resources Management (FINANCE) are the components responsible for managing the systems of records that will be subject
to the matching program. The purpose of the program is to identify and locate VA employees who owe delinquent debts
to the Federal Government as a result of their participation in benefit programs administered by VA. Once identified
and located, the debtors may become subject to involuntary offset of their pay under the provisions of the Debt Collection
Act of 1982.

The legal authority for undertaking this matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L.
97-365), 31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government,
31 U.S.C. 3711 (Collection and Compromise) and 5 U.S.C. 5514 (Installment Deduction for Indebtedness). These statutes
authorize Federal agencies to offset a Federal employee's salary as a means of satisfying delinquent debts owed the
United States. VBA and FINANCE have concluded an agreement to conduct the matching program pursuant to provisions
of the Privacy Act of 1972, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(o)). 

VBA is the recipient component and will perform the computer match. FINANCE will provide VBA with an abstract file
from the Personnel Accounting Integrated Data system (PAID). The records entered on this abstract are limited to
those employees who are identified as veterans by an indicator in the original PAID record. Each PAID abstract record
includes the employee's full name, social security number and duty station identifier. The records in the PAID abstract
are, then, matched to the Veterans and Beneficiaries Identification and Records Location Subsystem (BIRLS) file
by comparing social security numbers in both PAID and BIRLS records. In those instances where a PAID abstract record
and a BIRLS record have identical social security numbers, the BIRLS file number is entered on the abstract file. In
many instances, the file number will be the same as the employee's social security number. After the abstract file
is updated with file numbers from BIRLS, the file is compared to the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS)
file. In each instance where a file number from the PAID/BIRLS match is identical to the file number in a CARS record,
the CARS record will be updated with the employee's duty station identifier.

If the abstract tape was not updated with the employee's file number, the employee's social security number in the
PAID abstract will be compared to the CARS file number. If those numbers are an identical match, the employee's CARS
record will be updated with his or her duty station identifier from the PAID abstract. 



Records to be Matched: 

The systems of records maintained by the respective components from which records will be disclosed for the purpose
of this computer match are as follows: FINANCE: Personnel Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) Master Records in the
Personnel and Accounting Pay System-VA, 27VA047, which appears at page 942 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances,
1991 Compilation, Volume II. This system contains records of approximately 220,000 active VA employees. VBA: (a)
``Compensation, Pension, Education and Rehabilitation Records-VA'' (58VA21/22) appearing at page 967 of the document
entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. (b) ``Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home
Loan Applicant Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records and Vendee Loan Applicant Records-VA'' (55VA26),
appearing at page 962 of the document entitled Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Comp., Volume II. (c) Veterans and Beneficiaries
Identification and Records Location Subsystem-VA (BIRLS), 38VA23, which appears at page 952 of the document entitled
Privacy Act Issuances, 1991 Compilation, Volume II. Exchange of data pursuant to this matching program is consistent
with 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1) and 38 U.S.C. 5701(b)(6). The debtor records actually used to perform the match are maintained
in the Centralized Accounts Receivable System (CARS). CARS records, which number about 414,000, are a subset of those
found in Privacy Act system of records 58VA21/22. In some instances, data in an individual's record in the Privacy
Act system of records 58VA21/22 include certain data extracted from the same individual's record maintained under
55VA26. This would occur, for instance, where an individual has a delinquent debt as the result of his or her participation
in the VA loan guaranty program. 

The matching program is expected to begin on or about December 5, 1994, and continue in effect for 18 months. Matching
activity will begin no sooner than 30 days after publication of this notice or 40 days after a report of this is matching
program has been provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), whichever is later. The agreement
governing the matching program and, thus, the matching program, may be extended an additional 12 months with the approval
of VA's Data Integrity Board. Such extension must occur within three months prior to expiration of the 18-month period
set forth above and under the terms set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o)(2)( D). 



</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This information is required by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(12)). A copy of this notice has
been provided to both Houses of Congress and OMB.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; New System of Records</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of new system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(4)) requires that all agencies publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of the existence and character of their systems of records. Notice is hereby given that the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) is adding a new system of records entitled ``Accounts Receivable Records_VA'' (88VA20A6).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Veterans Benefits Administration is responsible for collecting debts resulting from individuals' participation
in certain programs administered by VA. These programs include_but are not limited to_compensation, pension, educational
allowance, guaranteed and direct home loans as well as education loans. VA established the Centralized Accounts
Receivable System (CARS) in 1975 as a pilot project for automation of debt collection and indebtedness record retrieval.
At the time, and for a number of years after, collection activity was shared among the Centralized Accounts Receivable
Division (CARD)_a division of the VA Regional Office and Insurance Center in St. Paul, Minnesota_and the 58 individual
VA regional offices. Generally, collection techniques were limited to written requests for payment and referral
for litigation to the United States Attorneys. CARD collected only certain categories of debts while the regional
offices had responsibility for the remaining categories. Methods of locating delinquent debtors were relatively
expensive and labor-intensive.



Since the inception of the CARS pilot project, additional means of automated collection and locating debtors have
either been authorized or made available by new technologies. Chief among the vehicles broadening the scope of debt
collection authority was the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365). The Act authorized disclosure of
personal information to consumer reporting agencies, made possible disclosure of taxpayer mailing addresses to
creditor agencies and authorized disclosure of debtor information for purposes of administrative and Federal salary
offset. Since the enactment of Pub. L. 97-365, new technologies have enabled creditor agencies to pursue authorized
collection activities with increased efficiency and innovative methods. These methods, in many cases, involve
some form of computer matching. Among the new technologies is the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System
(CAIVRS). This is an automated telephone system enabling participating Government agencies to verify information
provided by new loan applicants. Information for CAIVRS is retrieved from an automated data base.

In 1990 and 1991, VBA debt collection activities for major benefit programs were, for the most part, consolidated
under one automated system_CARS_and one organization_Debt Management Center (DMC), The Director, DMC, reports
directly to the VBA Chief of Staff. CARS is, now, the system of record for indebtedness accounts resulting from participation
in all major VBA programs, except the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program (38 U.S.C. ch. 30 and 10
U.S.C. ch. 106). While that program's indebtedness records are maintained on a personal computer system, certain
ch. 30/106 debt-related computer matching services are performed by DMC through CARS.

With the new means of collection and locating debtors developed over the years, computer matching with other Government
agencies has become a significant part of the routine activity conducted by DMC. Computer matching using CARS data
is performed in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended. Disclosures
are made as routine uses under Privacy Act systems of records 58VA21/22, ``Compensation, Pension, Education and
Rehabilitation Records-VA'', and 55VA26, ``Loan Guaranty Home, Condominium and Manufactured Home Loan Applicant
Records, Specially Adapted Housing Applicant Records, and Vendee Loan Applicant Records-VA''. Typically, the
responsibility for revising or introducing new routine uses associated with debt collection falls upon program
staff who are not directly responsible for debt collection operations.


This new system of records is being established to reflect the centralized environment VBA continues to build for
collection activity as well as to provide the public with one reference for routine use disclosures related to debt
collection. The debt collection program adheres to VA security and reporting requirements under title 38, Code of
Federal Regulations and other Federal regulations, as well as the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a),
and the appropriate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, title 26, United States Code.




Approved: October 27, 1994.

88VA20A6


System name:


Accounts Receivable Records-VA.


System location:


Automated indebtedness records for compensation, pension, educational assistance, survivors' and dependents'
educational assistance and home loan debts are maintained at the VA's Austin Automation/Systems Development Center
in Texas. Extracts of those automated records are maintained in the Benefits Delivery Network for accounting and
adjudication purposes. The Benefits Delivery Network is administered by the Benefit Delivery Center, Hines, Illinois.
Certain paper records, microfilm and microfiche are maintained at the VA Debt Management Center (DMC), Ft. Snelling,
Minnesota. Education loan automated, paper, microfilm and microfiche records are maintained at DMC. Automated
and paper indebtedness records related to the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program are also maintained
at DMC. Paper records related to accounts receivable may be maintained in individual file folders located at the VA
regional office having jurisdiction over the domicile of the claimant or the geographic area in which a property securing
a VA guaranteed, insured or direct loan is located. Generally, such papers maintained at regional offices are not
used directly in the debt collection process unless they are forwarded by conventional mail, electronic mail or facsimile
to DMC. Records provided to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for inclusion in the Credit Alert
Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS) are located at the HUD Data Processing Center in Lanham, Maryland.


Categories of individuals covered by the system:


Persons indebted to the United States Government as a result of their participation in benefit programs administered
by VA under title 38, United States Code, chapters 11, 13, 15, 21, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36 and 37, including persons indebted
to the United States Government by virtue of their ownership of property encumbered by a VA-guaranteed, insured,
direct or vendee loan. Persons indebted to the United States Government as a result of their participation in a benefit
program administered by VA under 10 U.S.C. ch. 106. Persons who received benefits or services under 38 U.S.C. or 10
U.S.C. ch. 106, but who did not meet the requirements for receipt of such benefits or services.


Categories of records in the system:


Information varies depending on the benefit or home loan program from which the debt arose. Identifying information,
including VA claim number, Social Security number, name and address and, when appropriate, loan reference number
