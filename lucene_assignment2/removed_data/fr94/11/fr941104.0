ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F,
14SF, and 6/5500/F (formerly Hamilton Standard/British Aerospace 6/5500/F) series propellers, that currently
requires initial and repetitive inspections of the propeller control unit (PCU) servo ballscrew internal spline
(BIS) teeth for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of PCU servo BIS assemblies. This amendment increases the repetitive
inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection for propellers that have a
ballscrew quill damper installed. This amendment is prompted by the availability of improved hardware that restricts
quill motion and enhances the lubrication of the BIS and significantly reduces BIS wear. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to prevent inability to control the propeller blade angle due to tooth wear in the PCU servo BIS
assembly.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93-16-02,
Amendment 39-8659 (58 FR 44441, August 23, 1993), which is applicable to Hamilton Standard 14RF, 247F, 14SF,
and 6/5500/F (formerly Hamilton Standard/British Aerospace 6/5500/F) series propellers, was published in the


Federal Register

 on May 27, 1994 (59 FR 27510). That action proposed to increase the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500
hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection for propellers that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

Seven commenters concur with the rule as proposed. 

One commenter concurs with the proposal to extend the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours TIS,
but also states that paragraph (a)(5) of the NPRM requires inspection at 1,500 hours TIS if a damper is installed, but
previously ``new'' PCU's were not required to be inspected until 1,800 hours TIS since new. The commenter further
states that this interval is not consistent since it is a decrease of 300 hours with the improved hardware, and recommends
the interval to be extended to 1,800 hours TIS for new PCU's. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly.


The commenter also recommends the following changes to Appendix 1 of the NPRM: 

The commenter states that the date of the damper installation should not be required since those receiving a ``new''
PCU or one from a repair station where the damper was installed may not have access to the actual installation date.
What should be required is an answer to the question, ``Damper installed?'' (answer either ``Yes'' or ``No''), and
if ``Yes'', and the indication of whether it was installed ``at this inspection'' or ``previously.'' The FAA concurs
and has revised this final rule accordingly. 

The commenter states that the requirement to list the aircraft model is not required provided the PCU part number is
complete with the dash or ``A'' number. The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly. 

The commenter states that blanks are not needed for the items ``Estimated Time on PCU'' and ``Actual Time on PCU.''
What is needed is an indication as to which one of those statements applies to the following: ``Time Since New (hours)''
and ``Time Since Last Ballscrew Inspection/Repair (hours).'' The FAA concurs and has revised this final rule accordingly.


The commenter states that there is no requirement to indicate (a reminder to complete) completion of the ``pull check''
of the PCU quill after it is reinstalled. The FAA concurs and has added this item to Appendix 1 of this final rule.

Two commenters indicate that the installation of the damper had merit and should reduce the PCU's vulnerability to
wear. However, the commenters believe that the inspection interval should not be extended to 1,500 hours TIS for the
following reasons: 

The first commenter states that the root cause or single reason for the ballscrew internal spline wear has not been
identified. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) bench test of the modified ballscrew internal spline quill
installation does not demonstrate a test that duplicates actual operation; e.g., there is retaining wire wear due
to axial preload from the damper. Also, currently there is inadequate scientific basis for reliance on the test data
as there is insufficient field experience data. 

The second commenter also states that the specific cause of wear has not been positively identified. The proposed
modification does not correct the negative failure modes in the PCU should a wear induced failure occur. Finally,
this commenter expresses concern that the field data used to justify the increased inspection interval is being collected
only from a small percentage of units in operation. 

The FAA does not concur with these comments. The FAA has researched these issues and reviewed the data from numerous
tests and investigations that have been conducted to determine the cause of extreme wear when it occurs on a very small
number of splines in service. The FAA has determined that by these tests and investigations a number of factors contribute
to how or if the spline joint will wear. These factors include: 

Magnitude and direction of vibratory environment. 

How well the spline joint is lubricated. 

Motion of elements within the joint due to stack up of clearances. 
Thickness of chrome plating on spline teeth. 

The FAA has therefore determined that there is no single factor for wear of this complex joint. However, the major contributors
of the listed factors have been found to be lubrication and axial motion. Laboratory tests and controlled field service
data has proven the damper reduces the wear factor by well over 20 times the rate before its installation. 

The retaining wire wear is not a phenomenon associated with the damper introduction. The retaining wires generally
show some degree of marking (mainly dents in the wire) from the flat end of the ballscrew spline teeth bearing on the
round wire. This marking occurs on retaining wires on PCU's with and without dampers installed. After an initial ``Seating''
of the parts, the retaining wire continues to operate without distress. 

Currently, the FAA has reported data from high time controlled field service units in multiple model installations
to have accumulated over 2,138 hours TIS with the same damper installed. In addition, the damper modification has
been available to operators since January 1, 1994. The manufacturer has shipped over 2,800 modification kits and
has conservatively estimated that over 300,000 hours of field time has been logged by operators with the modification
installed. 

Based on the investigative reports, satisfactory field inspection data, and improved wear factors resulting from
the installed damper modification, the FAA has determined that a negative failure mode should not occur within the
new inspection interval of 1,500 hours TIS. The FAA has therefore adopted the inspection interval stated in the NPRM.


After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.

There are approximately 2,506 propellers of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,150
propellers installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5
work hours per propeller to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, and on the average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year equating to 4 inspections, the total
cost impact of the current AD per year on U.S. operators is estimated to be $379,500. However, based on an average utilization
rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year, this superseding AD will eliminate 2.7 inspections per year per propeller, resulting
in an approximate yearly cost savings to U.S. operators of $256,163. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document publishes in the 

Federal Register

 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) 94-17-07 which was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 series helicopters by individual letters. This AD
requires an inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor (T/R) drive and replacement of
the T/R gearbox, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by two incidents in which the T/R output key (key) was not
installed between the output shaft and the output pinion during assembly of the T/R gearbox. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control
of the helicopter.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 25, 1994, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 94-17-07, applicable to Robinson Helicopter Company
R22 series helicopters, which requires an inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor
(T/R) drive, and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. That action was prompted by two incidents in which the
T/R output key (key) was not installed between the output shaft and the output pinion during assembly of the T/R gearbox.
The key is required to prevent the output gear from rotating on the output shaft. Both incidents resulted in slippage
of the T/R drive. On June 2, 1994, Registro Aeronautico Italiano (RAI), the Airworthiness Authority of Italy, issued
RAI AD No. 94-131 to require a daily inspection to determine if there had been any slippage of the T/R drive between
the output shaft and the output pinion. This condition, if not corrected, could result in slippage of the T/R drive,
loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 


The FAA has reviewed Robinson Helicopter Company R22 Service Bulletin (SB) 

#

74, dated July 18, 1994, that describes procedures for determining slippage of the T/R drive using a 35-lb. load on
the T/R blade and checking for correct alignment of dots that have been marked in accordance with SB 

#

74, dated July 18, 1994. The FAA is issuing this AD to require the initial marking of dots and an inspection prior to further
flight, rather than within the next 20 hours time-in-service (TIS) as specified by SB 

#

74, dated July 18, 1994. 
Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22
series helicopters of the same type design, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 94-17-07 to prevent slippage
of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The AD requires the
installation of alignment marks, an initial inspection prior to further flight, daily pre-flight visual checks
for slippage of the T/R drive, and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. The actions are required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This AD is considered to be an interim action. The FAA
is considering further rulemaking to require opening the T/R gearbox and verifying installation of the key as the
terminating action to this AD.

Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual letters issued on August 25, 1994, to all known U.S. owners and operators of Robinson Helicopter Company
Model R22 series helicopters. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the 

Federal Register

 as an amendment to section 39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) to make it effective to all persons.



Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-SW-10-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

and Budget and assigned OMB control number 2120-0056.
(b) Before the first flight of each day, check for misalignment of the alignment dots installed on the tail cone skin
and the drive shaft flange by rotating the T/R blade so that the alignment dot is visible in the inspection window and
the tip of the T/R blade leading edge aligns with the dot on the tail cone skin. Next, ensure that the drive shaft flange
dot is aligned with the dot on the centerline of the tail cone skin at the edge of the inspection window. If any misalignment
is detected, before further flight, conduct the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD. The checks required
by this AD may be performed by an owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate, and must be entered into
the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD, in accordance with section 43.11 and 91.417(a)(2)(v) of the
Federal Aviation Regulations.
(c) Verification of the presence of the key through disassembly and reassembly of the T/R gearbox in accordance with

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 


Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 


Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 


This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a) 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.




The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 




The Rule




This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided. 


Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 


The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.


The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication

number.


The Rule


This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports. All SIAP amendments
in this rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as
an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, 1. is not a ``significant

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains corrections to the final rule [FR Doc. 94-24498] published on October 18, 1994 (59 FR
52640). The published list of items to be included in the kit inadvertently listed an item that previously had been
deleted. This document corrects that error and one editorial omission.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 18, 1994, the FAA published a final rule amending the regulations that list the items required in the first
aid kits carried on board aircraft operated in air carrier, air taxi, and commercial operations (59 FR 52640). In the
list published in the final rule, the item ``Burn compound, 1/8 oz or an equivalent of other burn remedy'' appeared
in the listing under   125.207 and 135.177. The inclusion of burn compound was in error. Burn compound
was removed by an earlier amendment (59 FR 1780, January 12, 1994).



Further, in the amendment to  121.309, a period was omitted at the end of paragraph (d)(1). 



Correction of Publication 



Accordingly, the publication on October 18, 1994 of the final rule that was the subject of FR Doc. 94-24498 is
corrected as follows: 



 121.309 

[Corrected]



1. On page 52642, in the third column, in  121.309, in paragraph (d)(1), in the last line, add a period after the
words ``of this part''. 



 125.207 

[Corrected]



2. On page 52643, in the first column, in  125.207, in the table in paragraph (a)(1)(iii), in the column titled
``Contents'' remove the entry that reads ``Burn compound, 1/8 oz or an equivalent of other burn remedy''; in the column
titled ``Quantity'' remove the entry ``6'' that corresponds to the burn compound entry. 



 135.177 

[Corrected]



3. On page 52643, in the third column, in  135.177, in the table in paragraph (a)(1)(iii), in the column titled
``Contents'' remove the entry that reads ``Burn compound, 1/8 oz or an equivalent of other burn remedy''; in the column
titled ``Quantity'' remove the entry ``6'' that corresponds to the burn compound entry.

on Permit-Required Confined Spaces, 29 CFR 1910.146 in the 

Federal Register

. On June 29, 1993 at 58 FR 34844, OSHA published a corrections document for that final rule which contained corrections
to the regulatory text and to several appendices of the final rule. Another document was published on May 19, 1994 at
59 FR 26114 which added a metric equivalent in paragraph (k)(3)(ii) and further revised the ``Atmospheric monitoring''
section of Appendix E, ``Sewer System Entry'', of the final rule. This document revises one paragraph of the preamble
discussion of the definition of confined space in the January 14, 1993 document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 OSHA published its final rule on Permit-Required Confined Spaces (PRCS), 29 CFR 1910.146, on January 14, 1993 at 58
FR 4462. Corrections to the regulatory text and to several appendices were published on June 29, 1993 at 58 FR 34844.
A technical amendment was published on May 19, 1994 at 59 FR 26114.



Amendment to Preamble of 29 CFR 1910.146



In the Permit-Required Confined Spaces standard, on pages 4477 and 4478 of the January 14, 1993 

Federal Register

 document preamble, OSHA made the following statement:




As indicated in the preamble to the proposal [54 FR 24089], OSHA notes that doorways and other portals through which
a person can walk are not to be considered limited means for entry or exit.




This sentence was intended to limit the application of the definition of confined spaces to those areas where an employee
would be forced to enter or exit in a posture that might slow self-rescue, or make rescue more difficult. These spaces
warrant additional consideration as to whether they pose a hazard to entrants and would, therefore, be regulated
as permit-required confined spaces (permit spaces). For example, even if the door or portal of a space is of sufficient
size, obstructions could make entry into or exit from the space difficult. The Agency intended that spaces which otherwise
meet the definition of confined spaces, and which have obstructed entry or exits even though the portal is a standard
size doorway, be classified as confined spaces. OSHA acknowledges that the preamble to the final rule did not clearly
express that intent.

Accordingly, OSHA is adding preamble language to follow the above-mentioned statement. This text will make OSHA's
original intent clear, without changing the PRCS standard.



Exemption From Notice and Comment Procedures



With regard to this action, OSHA has determined that it is not required to follow procedures for public notice and comment
rulemaking under either section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or under section 6(b) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655(b)). This action does not affect the substantive requirements or coverage of
the standards themselves. This technical amendment does not modify or revoke existing rights or obligations, nor
does it establish new ones. This action simply provides additional information on the existing regulatory burden.
OSHA, therefore, finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable and unnecessary within the meaning of
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). For the same reasons, OSHA also finds that, in accordance with 29 CFR 1911.5, good cause exists
for dispensing with the public notice and comment procedures prescribed in section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act.



Exemption From Delayed Effective Date Requirement



Under 5 U.S.C. 553, OSHA finds that is good cause for making this technical amendment effective upon publication in
the 

Federal Register

. This technical amendment simply provides additional information on the existing regulatory burden without increasing
that burden.

and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.

As indicated in the preamble to the proposal [54 FR 24089], OSHA notes that doorways and other portals through which
a person can walk are not to be considered limited means for entry or exit. However, a space containing such a door or
portal may still be deemed a confined space if an entrant's ability to escape in an emergency would be hindered.

Background


Executive Order 12710 of April 5, 1990, 3 CFR, 1990 Comp., p. 282, terminated the national emergency declared on April
8, 1988, with respect to Panama, and lifted sanctions imposed against the Noriega regime. Pursuant to section 207(a)(2)
of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1706(a)(2), however, the order continued the blocking
of certain Government of Panama assets in the United States, with the understanding of the Government of Panama, to
facilitate resolution of claims of U.S. persons. Because all such claims known to the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(``FAC'') and arising prior to the lifting of sanctions have either been settled or provided for by the Government
of Panama, including its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities such as Air Panama, the residual
blocking has fulfilled its purpose. Therefore, FAC is revising  565.510 of the Panamanian Transactions Regulations,
31 CFR part 565 (the ``Regulations''), to authorize, November 4, 1994, all transactions otherwise prohibited by
the Regulations with respect to property and property interests in which the Government of Panama has an interest.

Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, does not apply.

Washington: Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program Revisions 



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of Washington has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the State
of Washington's application and has reached a decision that the State of Washington's hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA is granting final authorization
to the State of Washington to operate its expanded program, subject to the authority retained by EPA in accordance
with the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended
(``RCRA''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 to RCRA (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements. 
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260-266, 268 and 270. 


B. State of Washington 


The State of Washington initially received final authorization on January 31, 1986. The State of Washington received
authorization for revisions to its program on November 23, 1987 (52 FR 35556, 9/22/87) and on October 16, 1990 (55 FR
33695, 8/17/90). On January 12, 1994, the State of Washington submitted a program revision application for additional
program approvals. On March 30, 1994, EPA published a proposal to approve the State of Washington's application for
program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(4). 
EPA has reviewed the State of Washington's application, and has made a final decision that Washington's hazardous
waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA is granting final authorization for the additional program modifications to Washington's hazardous waste program.
Attachments 1, 2, 5, 6, 8-17 and Appendices 1-4 of the State's application are provided for information
only.

C. Washington's Corrective Action Program 


The State of Washington's authorized RCRA program is set forth in Chapter 173-303 of the Washington Administrative
Code (WAC), entitled ``Dangerous Waste Regulations''. The Dangerous Waste Regulations include both authorized
and non-authorized requirements. Washington has amended the Dangerous Waste Regulations to include corrective
action requirements; however, Washington may also rely on its existing state ``superfund-like'' cleanup authority,
Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), and its implementing regulations in Chapter 173-340 entitled ``Model Toxics
Control Act Cleanup Regulation'', to implement corrective action requirements and to compel corrective actions.

The statutory authority for the Dangerous Waste Regulations is found in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), Chapters
70.105 and 70.105D. RCW 70.105D.030(1)(d) is the statutory provision which allows the State of Washington Department
of Ecology (Ecology) to carry out all state programs authorized under the federal RCRA statute. RCW 70.105.130 designates
Ecology as the agency tasked with implementing the authorized RCRA program and provides Ecology with the authority
to establish a permit system for owners or operators of facilities which treat, store, or dispose of dangerous waste.
RCW 70.105.020 authorizes Ecology to revise and modify the Dangerous Waste Regulations. Statutory authority for
MTCA is also found in RCW Chapter 70.105D. RCW 70.105D.030(2) authorizes Ecology to adopt rules to set cleanup standards
for remedial actions taken under MTCA authority. RCW 70.105D.050(1) explicitly grants Ecology the authority to
issue orders under MTCA to direct potentially liable parties to conduct remedial action. 
Washington may compel corrective action by issuing orders pursuant to MTCA to owners and operators of facilities
seeking or required to have a permit to manage dangerous waste. Such orders are referred to as ``state corrective action
orders''. State corrective action orders will be somewhat hybrid, presenting RCRA corrective action requirements
in the context of a state ``superfund-like'' cleanup. EPA emphasizes that corrective action requirements are not
being deferred to a state superfund-like authority; rather, the state authority will be used to compel RCRA corrective
action requirements. In order to fulfill the RCRA Section 3004 (u) and(v) requirement that all RCRA permits must include
corrective action permit conditions, state corrective action orders will be incorporated into RCRA permits issued
pursuant to the authorized State program permitting regulations. 
Washington's corrective action program would allow corrective action to be specified through the terms of a State-issued
order which is incorporated by reference into operating or post-closure permits issued to facilities. The State
could: 1) issue the order in advance of the permit; 2) modify the permit to incorporate the order; or 3) simultaneously
issue the order and the permit with the order incorporated into the permit. Under the Washington program, a State order
would be considered to be part of the authorized RCRA program only when the order is incorporated into an existing RCRA
permit, or when the order is issued simultaneously with and incorporated by reference into a new RCRA permit. 


D. Comparison of Washington's Corrective Action Program to the Federal Program 


Ordinarily, States await promulgation of Federal regulations prior to submitting their applications. However,
there is no impediment under the RCRA statutory provisions which would bar a State from seeking authorization of a
program in advance of Federally promulgated regulations provided the State bases its program on existing Federal
statutory language. An existing Federal counterpart is the critical nexus in the authorization program. 
Washington's corrective action program goes slightly beyond the EPA-promulgated regulations (see 40 CFR 264.100
and 264.101) which implement the statutory provisions of sections 3004(u) and (v) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6924(u) and (v),
in which facilities seeking a permit are required to undertake corrective action for all releases of hazardous waste
or constituents from any solid waste management unit (SWMU) and to undertake such corrective actions beyond the property
boundary where necessary. Washington's program will instead utilize its existing Superfund-like cleanup order
authority (the Model Toxics Control Act) through the State's authorized RCRA program by linking the cleanup order
authority with the State's authorized RCRA program permitting requirements to fulfill the mandates of sections
3004(u) and (v) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6924(u) and (v). 
The statutory language of Section 3004(u) of RCRA applies to corrective action at solid waste management units. Although
no statutory or regulatory definition of ``solid waste management unit'' has been promulgated, EPA's proposed Subpart
S corrective action rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 27, 1990 (55 FR 30798), contains EPA's most current interpretation of key terms in section 3004(u) of RCRA.
This is and will be the controlling interpretation against which Washington's regulatory definition of solid waste
management unit shall be measured until EPA codifies a statutory or regulatory definition. 
The statutory language of section 3004(u) of RCRA also applies to ``facilities seeking a permit.'' Such facilities
include those hazardous waste management facilities which are required to obtain permits to operate and to those
subject to post-closure permits. EPA has interpreted this language to mean that corrective action must be specified
in operating or post-closure permits issued to such facilities.

State corrective action orders will be issued to facilities subject to the Washington State Dangerous Waste Regulations,
codified in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) in Chapter 173-303, but these orders will rely in part on the
State of Washington's Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) statutory and regulatory provisions and will require current
owners and operators of SWMUs to conduct corrective action at those units in accordance with the Dangerous Waste Regulations.

EPA is not delegating RCRA section 3008(h) authority [42 U.S.C. 6928(h)] as part of this authorization. No Federal
enforcement authorities are delegated when EPA authorizes state programs under section 3006 of RCRA. 
Any orders issued to a facility under MTCA will not be considered to be part of the EPA-authorized corrective action
program unless and until they are incorporated into a RCRA permit. Terms of the orders which go beyond the scope of the
authorized Dangerous Waste regulations will be considered broader in scope, and thus not Federally enforceable.
Federal enforceability does not affect the ability of the State to impose requirements pursuant to their legitimate
State statutory authorities or to enforce those requirements in lawfully-issued orders or permits. 
Some portions of Washington's revised program are broader in scope than the Federal program, and thus are not Federally
enforceable. Due to Washington's statutory mandate to address all releases of hazardous substances, Washington
has developed corrective action requirements which are, in part, broader in scope than the Federal corrective action
requirements in RCRA Section 3004(u), in that dangerous waste management facilities in Washington will be required
to conduct corrective action as necessary to protect human health and the environment for all releases of dangerous
waste and dangerous constituents at or from the facility, regardless of the source of the release. 
Some portions of Washington's revised program are more stringent than the Federal program. The requirement to implement
corrective action for releases which have migrated beyond the facility boundary is more stringent than the Federal
requirement, in that it is not limited by the ``best efforts'' language in the Federal requirement. 
To clarify, Washington will be authorized for the following provisions as part of this authorization (see State Authorization
Checklists 17L, 38, 44A, 44B, 121): 






In order to approve the State of Washington to use orders issued under MTCA to compel RCRA corrective action, it was
necessary to identify the essential elements of a RCRA corrective action program and to determine that the State had
the necessary authorities to meet these substantive RCRA requirements. The following table identifies those substantive
RCRA corrective action requirements and demonstrates that the corresponding State authorities exist which allow
the State to meet these requirements. Whereas certain of the state authorities listed are already authorized or are
being authorized in today's action, this table only serves to demonstrate that orders issued under MTCA can compel
corrective action which would meet all substantive RCRA corrective action requirements and is provided here for
information only. As stated above, orders issued by the state are not part of the RCRA authorized program until such
order is incorporated into a RCRA permit.

Washington is not seeking authorization to operate on Indian lands. 


F. Public Hearing and Comments 


Although EPA received three requests for a public hearing, EPA did not find that the bases for the requests warranted
a public hearing, since the issues raised were outside the scope of this authorization action. 
EPA received a number of comments during the public comment period. A detailed Response to Comments has been prepared
and is available upon request. The following is a summary of the comments received and EPA's responses to those comments.

One commenter was concerned about the interaction between regulation of radioactive materials under the Atomic
Energy Act (AEA) and of hazardous wastes under RCRA, specifically that EPA's authorization of the State of Washington
for RCRA corrective action under the State's Hazardous Waste Management Act (HWMA) would allow the Washington Department
of Ecology to ``preempt'' the State Department of Health's regulatory authority (delegated by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission) over the operation of their facility. The commenter was also concerned about certain conflicting state
regulatory and statutory provisions regarding the regulatory authority of the Department of Health. 

In response, the State of Washington has not asked that the statutory provision cited by the commenter [RCW 70.105.240(2)]
be authorized as part of the federally authorized RCRA program. As such, RCW 70.105.240(2) will not be part of the federally-authorized
state RCRA corrective action program which will operate in lieu of the federal RCRA corrective action program. This
will remain a ``state-only'' provision and EPA will not enforce it. 

The State of Washington is today being authorized to implement its corrective action program in lieu of the federal
RCRA corrective action program. The RCRA corrective action program seeks to address releases of hazardous waste
and constituents from solid waste management units at a facility. ``Regulated units'' are units such as landfills,
waste piles, surface impoundments, and land treatment units used to treat, store, or dispose of RCRA-regulated hazardous
wastes and are subject to full regulation under subtitle C of RCRA. 

See 

40 CFR 264.90. ``Solid waste management units,'' or ``SWMUs,'' are any discernable units at which ``solid wastes''
may have been placed at any time. 

See 

55 FR 30798, 30874, July 27, 1990 (proposed RCRA Subpart S Rule). If EPA determines that the presence of solid or hazardous
waste at either a regulated unit or a solid waste management unit has led to a release or a threatened release of a hazardous
waste or constituent from such units, EPA can require the owner or operator of a unit to address such releases by taking
necessary ``corrective action'' at the unit. 

EPA's ability to require corrective action at such units does 

not 

mean that SWMUs are ``regulated'' under the RCRA ``base program'' and therefore subjected to RCRA permitting requirements.
The RCRA ``base program'' consists, in part, of those provisions of RCRA that govern the generation, transport, treatment,
storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. The RCRA ``base program'' is considered to be those provisions of the RCRA
program before the passage of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (``HSWA'') of 1984 to RCRA. HSWA introduced
the corrective action requirements into the RCRA statute. In contrast and in general, only ``regulated units'' and
generator accumulation areas are subject to the operational requirements of the RCRA ``base program.'' These operational
requirements are separate and apart from any corrective action requirements that might be imposed by the State of
Washington under the authorized state corrective action program. 

Therefore, the commenter's concern that EPA's authorization of the State of Washington for RCRA 

corrective action 

will allow the Department of Ecology to ``preempt'' the Department of Health's regulatory authority over the 

operation

 of the commenter's facility is unfounded. If the State of Washington wanted to regulate the daily operations of the
facility's radioactive waste management activities under RCRA, it would have to do so under the state's dangerous
waste ``base'' RCRA program. 

One commenter stated that ``Given that EPA has stated that it will interpret Washington's regulatory definition
of SWMU against its discussion in the proposed corrective action rule, [the commenter] requests that the State of
Washington through its authorized program will not be allowed to assert jurisdiction over mixed waste activities
prior to July 3, 1986, as well.'' The commenter cites the State of Washington's recent definition of ``solid waste
management unit'' which was added to the State's Dangerous Waste regulations, which ``means any discernable location
at a facility, as defined for the purposes of corrective action, where solid wastes 

have been placed at any time

. . .'' (emphasis added). The commenter further states that ``the preamble to EPA's corrective action
rule did not attempt to retroactively apply EPA's jurisdiction over mixed waste prior to July 3, 1986.'' 

In response, EPA has consistently interpreted the radioactive mixed waste to be a solid waste under RCRA for the purposes
of RCRA corrective action (

see 

55 FR 30798 at 30860, July 27, 1990 and 51 FR 24504 Footnote 

#

1, July 3, 1986). Therefore, it is clear that EPA considers radioactive mixed waste to be a solid waste under RCRA for
purposes of RCRA corrective action. Corrective actions under RCRA which address releases from solid waste management
units are not limited to releases of hazardous waste or constituents after any certain date. EPA's proposed definition
of a ``solid waste management unit'' in EPA's proposed Subpart S rule (

see 

55 FR at 30808-30809) and the State of Washington's promulgated definition of a ``solid waste management unit'' in
its Dangerous Waste Regulations (

see 

WAC 173-303-646(2)(a)) both define a SWMU to include in part (state regulatory language differences are in brackets):


 


Any discernable unit [location at a facility] . . . at which solid wastes have been placed at any time,
irrespective of whether the unit was intended for the management of solid or hazardous [dangerous] waste. 

 


Thus, EPA's determination that the hazardous component of radioactive mixed waste was 

regulated 

and subject to permitting requirements of Subtitle C of RCRA in 1986 does not affect EPA's ability (or a state's ability,
when that state has been authorized for corrective action under RCRA) to require 

corrective action 

for the hazardous component of radioactive solid waste at SWMUs where such waste was disposed of before 1986.

EPA, in its authorization of the State of Washington for RCRA corrective action, is not authorizing the State to ```regulate'
mixed waste disposed of prior to 1986'' as suggested by the commenter. Rather, the authorization will allow the State
to assert 

corrective action

 (cleanup of past releases) jurisdiction, which is not RCRA 

operational

 (day-to-day waste handling and management) jurisdiction, over solid waste (which includes the hazardous component
of radioactive mixed waste) at solid waste management units at facilities seeking permits under RCRA. The State of
Washington received final authorization for RCRA operational jurisdiction over radioactive mixed waste on November
23, 1987.
