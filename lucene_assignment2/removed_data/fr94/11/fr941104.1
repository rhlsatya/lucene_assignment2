OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Retirement; Alternative Forms of Annuity



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing changes in our current regulations on alternative forms of
annuity to implement the changes in sections 8343a and 8420a of title 5, United States Code, made by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. These regulations provide for the termination of the alternative form of annuity for
employees whose annuities commence on or after October 1, 1994, except for employees who have a life-threatening
affliction of other critical medical condition. They would also revise the list of critical medical conditions considered


prima facie

 evidence of eligibility. The regulations are necessary to conform the current regulations with current law.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since 1986, some individuals retiring under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement
System have been eligible to elect an alternative form of annuity. The alternative form of annuity consisted of a lump-sum
payment of the individual's retirement deductions plus reduced monthly benefits. The amount of the reduction was
determined so that the present value of the future unreduced annuity would be actuarially equivalent to the present
value of the lump sum plus the future reduced annuity payments.



The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-66, amended sections 8343a and 8420a of title 5, United
States Code, to limit eligibility for the alternative form of annuity for individuals whose annuities commence on
or after October 1, 1994, to those with a ``life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.'' These
regulations would change sections 831.2203(h) and 842.703(d) to reflect this new statutory eligibility requirement.

Our proposed change in sections 831.2207 and 842.707 refines the list of medical conditions that constitute 

prima facie

 evidence of a ``life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.'' We are removing two conditions
from the list (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular flutter). We are also clarifying the severity required for
four other medical conditions before we will accept those conditions as 

prima facie 

evidence. Of course, this change in no way affects a claimant's right to show that medical conditions, not on the list,
are qualifying conditions under sections 831.2207(c)(3)(iv) and 842.707(c)(3)(iv) of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations.



E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation will only affect Federal employees and agencies and retirement payments to retired Government
employees and their survivors.

Federal Staffing Provisions Supporting Sunset of the Federal Personnel Manual



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule places into regulation a limited number of Federal staffing provisions that were formerly in the
Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). The remaining ``provisionally retained'' portions of the FPM will be abolished
by December 31, 1994. This proposed rule deletes or replaces regulatory language which references the FPM. Its provisions
also define or clarify terms and describe procedures used in veterans' preference, reductions in force, veterans'
readjustment appointments, term appointments, seasonal and intermittent employment, noncompetitive term appointments
based on Peace Corps service, exemption of certain employees from coverage of the Part-time Career Employment Act,
physical requirements for employment, and actions taken during a national emergency (including the possible appointment
of relatives). They extend delegations to agencies for assigning persons serving under excepted appointments to
the work of positions in the competitive service; making temporary appointments of worker trainees pending establishment
of a register (TAPER); and extending time limits for overseas temporary appointments. The proposed provisions also
delete requirements for a number of regular reports. In the case of part 351, Reduction in Force, and part 353, Restoration
to Duty From Military Service or Compensable Injury, sections are reworded for clarity and consistency with decisions
of the Merit Systems Protection Board.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




The Vice President's National Performance Review (NPR) recommended that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
``phase out the entire 10,000 page Federal Personnel Manual (FPM).'' The President endorsed the NPR recommendations.

In planning to abolish the FPM, OPM met over an extended period with representatives of agencies and employee unions
to identify which FPM policies should be dropped, which should be continued in regulation, and which should be available
as a helpful reference in an alternative format. The resulting recommendations were reviewed and endorsed by the
Interagency Advisory Group of agency personnel directors and by the National Partnership Council.

This proposed rule carries out the recommendations of those groups to retain selected current policies. Regulations
to establish new policies, including implementation of Pub. L. 103-353 (veterans' reemployment rights),
will be proposed separately.



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Personnel Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities

PART 211_VETERAN PREFERENCE


1. Part 211 is revised to read as follows:



Sec.


211.101 Purpose
211.102 Definitions
211.103 Administration of preference.





Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 1302.


 211.101



Purpose.


The purpose of this chapter is to define veterans' preference and the administration of preference in Federal employment.
(5 U.S.C. 2108)



 211.102



Definitions.



For the purposes of preference in Federal employment the following definitions apply:

(a) 

Veteran 

means a person who was separated with an honorable discharge or under honorable conditions from active duty in the
armed forces performed_

(1) In a war; or,

(2) In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or,

(3) During the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955; or,

(4) For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period beginning
February 1, 1955, and ending October 14, 1976.

(b) 

Disabled veteran 

means a person who was separated under honorable conditions from active duty in the armed forces performed at any time
and who has established the present existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability
retirement benefits, or pensions because of a public statute administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs
or a military department.

(c) 

Preference eligible 

means veterans, spouses, widows, or mothers who meet the definition of ``preference eligible'' in 5 U.S.C. 2108.
Preference eligibles are entitled to have 5 or 10 points added to their earned score on a civil service examination
(see 5 U.S.C. 3309). They are also accorded a higher retention standing in the event of a reduction in force (see 5 U.S.C.
3502). Preference does not apply, however, to inservice placement actions such as promotions.

(d) 

Armed forces 

means the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.

(e) 

Uniformed services 

means the armed forces, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the commissioned corps of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
(f) 

Active duty or active military duty 

means full-time duty with military pay and allowances in the armed forces, except for training or for determining
physical fitness and except for service in the Reserves or National Guard.

(g) 

Separated under honorable conditions 

means either an honorable or a general discharge from the armed forces. The Department of Defense is responsible for
administering and defining military discharges.



 211.103



Administration of preference.



Agencies are responsible for making all preference determinations except for preference based on a common law marriage.
Such a claim should be referred to OPM's General Counsel for decision.



PART 230_ORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT



2. The authority citation for Part 230 is revised to read as follows:






Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 1302, 3301, 3302; E.O. 10577, 3 CFR 1954-1958 Comp., p. 218; sec. 230.402 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 1104.




3. In  230.402, paragraphs (a) through (h) are redesignated as paragraphs (b) through (i), respectively; a
new paragraph (a) is added; and newly redesignated paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows:



 230.402



Agency authority to make emergency-indefinite appointments in a national emergency.



(a) 

When a national emergency exists_

(1) Definition. 

A national emergency must meet 

all 

of the following conditions:

(i) It was declared by the President or Congress.
(ii) It involves a danger to the United States' safety, security, or stability that results from specified circumstances
or conditions and that is national in scope.

(iii) It requires a national program specifically intended to combat the threat to national safety, security, or
stability.

(2) 

Termination of a national emergency. 

A national emergency no longer exists if it is officially terminated by the President or Congress, or if the 

specific 

circumstances, conditions, or program cited in the original declaration are terminated or corrected.

(b) 

Basic authority. 

Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appointments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined
in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM's approval to
make emergency-indefinite appointments without a declared national emergency when the President has authorized
the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that
normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments
is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must
make emergency-indefinite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available
eligibles.

of part 333 of this chapter when making a TAPER appointment.

(b) 

Specific authority for Worker-Trainee positions. 

Agencies may make TAPER appointments to positions at GS-1, WG-1, and WG-2 and may reassign or promote

PART 330_RECRUITMENT, SELECTION, AND PLACEMENT (GENERAL)



20. The authority citation for part 330 continues to read as follows: 








Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 1302, 3301, 3302; E.O. 10577; 3 CFR, 1954-58 Comp., p. 218;  330.102 also issued under 5 U.S.C.
3327; subpart B also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3315 and 8151;  330.401 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 3310; subpart H also
issued under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) and 8457(b); subpart I also issued under sec. 4432 of Pub. Law 102-484.






21. Section 330.201 is revised to read as follows:



 330.201 

Establishment and maintenance of RPL.



(a) The reemployment priority list (RPL) is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their
former competitive service employees separated by reduction in force (RIF) or fully recovered from a compensable
injury after more than 1 year. The RPL is a required component of agency positive placement programs. In filling vacancies,
the agency must give RPL registrants priority consideration over certain outside job applicants and, if it chooses,
also may consider RPL registrants before considering internal candidates. 

(b) Each agency is required to establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting area in which
it separates eligible competitive service employees by RIF or when a former employee recovers from a compensable
injury after more than 1 year, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this subpart, ``agency''
means ``Executive agency'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. All components of an agency within the commuting area utilize
a single RPL and are responsible for giving priority consideration to the RPL registrants. 

(c) An agency need not maintain a distinct RPL for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates
a placement program for its employees and obtains OPM concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements
of this subpart. The intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are
effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.


22. In  330.202, paragraph (a)(1) is revised and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows: 



 330.202 

Application. 



(a)(1) To be entered on the RPL, an eligible employee under  330.203 must complete an application prescribed
by the employing agency and inform the agency of any significant changes in the information provided. This application
must provide for the employee to specify the conditions under which he or she will accept employment, including grade,
occupation, and minimum hours of work per week, in addition to positions at the same representative rate and type of
work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, seasonal, intermittent, on-call, etc.) as the position from which the
employee was or will be separated. Registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part
351 of this chapter, or a Certification of Expected Separation as provided in  351.807 of this chapter, has been
issued. The employee must submit the application within 30 calendar days after the RIF separation date. An employee
who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the RPL. If an agency has components scattered
throughout a large commuting area, the agency may allow eligibles to indicate their availability only for certain
sub-areas within the commuting area. However, the agency cannot deny consideration throughout the entire commuting
area if the eligible wants it. 



* * * * *



(c) Agencies should assist employees to identify positions within the agency for which they qualify and these positions
should be listed on the RPL application. 

23. In  330.203, paragraphs (a)(4) and (c) are revised and paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) are added to read
as follows:



 330.203 

Eligibility due to reduction in force. 



(a) * * *

(4) Have not declined an offer under subpart G of part 351 of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule
and a representative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee was or will be separated.



* * * * *



(c) A tenure group I employee is eligible for the RPL for 2 years, and a tenure group II employee is eligible for 1 year,
from the date the employee is entered on the RPL.

(d)(1) When an individual declines an offer of career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time
limit or fails to reply to an inquiry, under this subpart, and the position meets the acceptable conditions shown in
his or her application, he or she loses RPL consideration for all positions with a representative rate at or below that
grade. However, subject to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, the individual retains eligibility for positions
with a higher representative rate up to the last grade held.

(2) Also, an individual is taken off the RPL before the period of eligibility expires when the individual:
(i) Requests removal.
(ii) Receives a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit in any agency.
(iii) Declines an offer of career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit or fails to reply
to an inquiry, under this subpart, by the employee's former agency, concerning a specific position having a representative
rate at least as high, and with the same type of work schedule, as that of the position from which the person was or will
be separated.
(iv) Separates for some other reason before the RIF separation takes effect (such as retirement, resignation, etc.).
An employee who retires the day after separation by RIF, or later, does not lose RPL eligibility.
(v) Declines an interview or fails to appear for a scheduled interview only if notified in advance of this requirement
and the subsequent consequences.

(vi) In the case of an individual enrolled on an RPL for Alaska or overseas, leaves the area covered by that RPL or becomes
disqualified for overseas employment because of previous service or residence.
(3) When an agency removes an individual from the RPL because of failure to reply to a specific permanent job offer or
an inquiry of availability for a specific permanent vacancy, the agency must have evidence to show that a written offer
or inquiry was made and received. The written offer or inquiry to the individual must clearly state that failure to
respond will result in loss of RPL consideration for all grades or for lower grades, as appropriate.

(e) Declination of nonpermanent employment has no effect on RPL eligibility or continuation of RPL consideration.
(f) Consideration for all jobs (whether permanent or nonpermanent) is suspended for any individual who cannot be
reached by the agency. Submission of an updated application can reinstate consideration, but the period of eligibility
is not extended beyond the original time set in paragraph (c) of this section.
(g) Eligibles who had agreed to transfer with their function but were separated by RIF from the gaining competitive
area are registered on the RPL of the gaining competitive area.
24. In  330.204, paragraphs (a) and (b)(3) are revised and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows:

 330.204


Eligibility due to compensable injury.



(a) A competitive service employee in tenure group I or II who is separated (or who accepts a lower graded position in
lieu of separation) because of a compensable injury or disability (as defined in part 353 of this chapter) who has fully
recovered more than 1 year after compensation began is entitled to be placed on the RPL provided the individual applies
within the timeframes addressed in  330.202. Part 353 of this chapter contains information on eligibility.



* * * * * *



(b) * * *

(3) Declines an offer or fails to respond to an inquiry of availability about a specific position that is the same as
or equivalent to the position from which separated.

(c) A former employee must request reemployment consideration within the time limits set in  330.202.

25. Section 330.205 is revised to read as follows:



 330.205


Employment restrictions.



(a) The restrictions in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the filling of all competitive service vacancies, regardless
of whether an agency plans to make a temporary, term, or permanent appointment. This means an agency must consider
RPL registrants for nonpermanent as well as permanent positions when they have indicated such interest on their RPL
application.

(b) When a qualified individual is available on an agency's RPL, the agency may not make a final commitment to an individual
not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position by:

(1) A new appointment, unless the individual appointed is a qualified 10-point preference eligible; or

(2) Transfer or reemployment, unless the individual appointed is a preference eligible, is exercising restoration
rights under part 353 of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or
disability within 1 year, or is exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights.

(c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to actions involving employees on an agency's rolls, as authorized
below, or in filling a specific position:

(1) When all qualified individuals on the RPL decline an offer of a specific position or fail to respond to an official
agency inquiry about their availability for it; or

(2) By a current, qualified employee of the agency through:

(i) Detail or position change (promotion, demotion, reassignment); or

(ii) Conversion to competitive appointment of employees currently serving under appointments that carry a noncompetitive
conversion eligibility (e.g., Veterans Readjustment Appointee, 30 percent disabled veterans, disabled employees
under Schedule A appointment, Presidential Management Interns, cooperative education students under Schedule
B appointment, and TAPERS); or

(iii) Reappointment without a break in service to the same position currently held by an employee serving under a temporary
appointment of 1 year or less (only to another temporary appointment not to exceed 1 year or less and not to a permanent
appointment); or

(iv) Extension of an employee's temporary appointment up to the maximum permitted by the appointment authority or
as authorized by OPM.

(3) By a 30-day special needs appointment or 700 hour temporary appointment of a severely disabled or mentally retarded
individual, when the agency's staffing policies provide for these exceptions.

(d) An agency must clear the RPL at the grade level at which it fills a position (regardless of the full performance level).
Similarly, if an agency advertises a position at multiple grade levels, it must clear the RPL only at the grade level
at which the position is ultimately filled.

(e) Once an agency has cleared its RPL and made a final employment commitment to an individual, the later registration
of another employee on the RPL does not prevent the fulfillment of the original commitment, regardless of when the
individual actually enters on duty.

(f) An agency may make an exception to this section and appoint an individual not on the RPL as authorized by  330.207(d).

(g) When submitting a request for referral of eligibles, an agency is required to indicate that no qualified RPL registrant
is available for the vacancy and therefore the agency may make a new appointment. Similarly, an agency must clear its
RPL before making appointments under a direct-hire authority, which includes the Outstanding Scholar provision,
or delegated examining authority.

26. In  330.206, paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) are revised to read as follows:



 330.206 

Job consideration.



(a) (1) An eligible employee under  330.203 is entitled to consideration for positions in the commuting area
for which qualified and available that are at no higher grade (or equivalent), have no greater promotion potential
than the position from which the employee was or will be separated, and have the same type of work schedule. In addition,
an employee is entitled to consideration for any higher grade previously held on a nontemporary basis in the competitive
service from which the employee was demoted under part 351 of this chapter.

(2) An employee is considered for positions having the same type of work schedule as the position from which separated
except that the agency, at its discretion, may adopt provisions permitting empoyees to request consideration for
other work schedules in addition to that formerly held.



* * * * *



(b) (1) An eligible employee under  330.204 is placed on the RPL for reemployment consideration for his or her
former position or an equivalent one. If the individual cannot be placed in such a position in the former commuting
area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency at the time
and in a manner as the agency determines will provide the individual with maximum opportunities for consideration.

(2) In lieu of expanded consideration in other locations, an individual who cannot be placed in his or her former or
equivalent position in the former commuting area may elect to be considered for the next best available position in
the former commuting area.

27. In  330.207, paragraphs (a), (b), (c)(1), and (d) are revised to read as follows:



 330.207 

Selection from RPL.



(a) 

Options. 

An agency must adopt one of the selection methods in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for use in operating a single
RPL. The agency may adopt the same method for each RPL it establishes or may vary the method by location, but it must adopt
a written policy for each RPL it establishes and maintains. After a method is adopted, the agency uses that method in
filling all positions. While an agency may not vary the method used by individual vacancy, it may at any time switch
selection methods for employees enrolled on the RPL.

(b) 

Retention standing order. 

For each vacancy to be filled, the agency shall place qualified individuals in group and subgroup order in accordance
with part 351 of this chapter. In making a selection, an agency may not pass over an individual in group I to select from
group II and, within a group, may not pass over an individual in a higher subgroup to select from a lower subgroup. Within
a subgroup, an agency may select an individual without regard to order of retention standing. A person has no greater
priority for the grade or position from which separated than any other person on the list who is qualified for the vacancy.
An agency may make an exception to this selection order only in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(c) 

Rating and ranking. 

(1) For each vacancy to be filled, the agency rates qualified individuals according to their job experience and education.
To do this, an agency shall develop job-related evaluation procedures capable of distinguishing differences in
qualifications measured, which shall be applied in a fair and consistent manner. Based on these procedures, the agency
shall assign qualified individuals a numerical score of at least 70 on a scale of 100. The agency shall grant 5 additional
points to preference eligibles under section 2108(3) (A) and (B) of title 5, United States Code, and 10 additional
points to preference eligibles under section 2108(3) (C) through (G) of that title.

(d) 

Exceptions. 

An agency may make an exception to this subpart and appoint an individual who is not on the RPL or has lower standing than
others on the RPL only when necessary to obtain an employee for duties that cannot be taken over without undue interruption
(as defined in  351.203 of this chapter) to the agency by an individual who is on the RPL or has higher standing
than the one appointed. The agency shall notify, in writing, each individual on the RPL who is adversely affected by
an appointment under this paragraph of the reasons for the exception and of the right of appeal to the Merit Systems
Protection Board.
28. In  330.208, paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) introductory text are revised and paragraph (a)(4) is added to read
as follows:


 330.208

Qualification requirements.


(a)* * *
(1) Meets OPM-established qualification standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum educational
requirements, and any selective placement factors established by the agency;


* * * * *


(4) Meets any other applicable requirement for appointment to the competitive service.
(b) An agency may make an exception to the qualification standard and adopt an alternative standard under the following
conditions (this provision does not authorize waiver of the selection order required by  330.207):

33. In  340.202, paragraph (c) is revised to read as follows: 


 340.202 

General. 


* * * * * 



(c) 

Mixed Tours of Duty. 

The provisions of this subpart and the term ``part-time career employment'' do not apply to employees with appointments
in tenure groups I or II who work under mixed tours of duty. For this purpose, a mixed tour of duty consists of annually
recurring periods of full-time, part-time, or intermittent service as long as the employee does not work part-time
more than 6 pay periods per calendar year. 
34. Subpart D of part 340 is revised to read as follows:

Sec. 



340.401 Definitions. 

340.402 Seasonal employment. 

340.403 Intermittent employment.

(a) 

Seasonal employment 

means annually recurring periods of work less than 12 months each year. Seasonal employees are permanent employees
who are placed in nonduty/nonpay status and recalled to duty in accordance with preestablished conditions of employment.
(b) 

Intermittent employment 

means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty.


 340.402


Seasonal employment.



(a) 

Appropriate use. 

Seasonal employment allows an agency to develop an experienced cadre of employees under career appointment to perform
work which recurs predictably year-to-year. Consistent with the career nature of the appointments, seasonal employees
receive the full benefits authorized to attract and retain a stable workforce. As a result, seasonal employment is
appropriate when the work is expected to last at least 6 months during a calendar year. Recurring work that lasts less
than 6 months each year is normally best performed by temporary employees. Seasonal employment may not be used as a
substitute for full-time employment or as a buffer for the full-time workforce.


(b) 

Length of the season. 

Agencies determine the length of the season, subject to the condition that it be clearly tied to nature of the work.
The season must be defined as closely as practicable so that an employee will have a reasonably clear idea of how much
work he or she can expect during the year. To minimize the adverse impact of seasonal layoffs, an agency may assign seasonal
employees to other work during the projected layoff period. While in nonpay status, a seasonal employee may accept
other employment, Federal or non-Federal, subject to the regulations on political activity (part 733 of this title)
and on employee responsibilities and conduct (part 735), as well as applicable agency policies. Subject to the limitation
on pay from more than one position (5 U.S.C. 5533), a seasonal employee may hold more than one appointment.

(c) 

Employment agreement. 

An employment agreement must be executed between the agency and the seasonal employee prior to the employee's entering
on duty. At a minimum, the agreement must inform the employee:

(1) That he or she is subject to periodic release and recall as a condition of employment,
(2) The minimum and maximum period the employee can expect to work,
(3) The basis on which release and recall procedures will be effected, and
(4) The benefits to which the employee will be entitled while in a nonpay status.
(d) 

Release and recall procedures. 

A seasonal employee is released to nonpay status at the end of a season and recalled to duty the next season. Release
and recall procedures must be established in advance and uniformly applied. They may be based on performance, seniority,
veterans' preference, other appropriate indices, or a combination of factors. A seasonal layoff is not subject to
the procedures for furlough prescribed in parts 351 and 752 of this title. Reduction in force or adverse action procedures,
as applicable, are required for a seasonal layoff that is not in accordance with the employment agreement, for example,
if an agency intends to have an employee work less than the minimum amount of time specified in the employment agreement.
However, an agency may develop a new employment agreement to reflect changing circumstances.


(e) 

Noncompetitive movement. 

Seasonal employees serving under career appointment may move to other positions in the same way as other regular career
employees.



 340.403

Intermittent employment.


(a) 

Appropriate use. 

An intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that
a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in advance. When an agency is able to schedule work in advance on a regular
basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time or full-time to
ensure proper service credit.


(b) 

Noncompetitive movement. 

Intermittent employees serving under career appointment may move to other positions in the same way as other regular
career employees.

 351.202

Coverage.



* * * * *




(c) * * *


(7) A change in an employee's work schedule from other-than-full-time to full-time. (A change from full-time to other-than-full-time
for a reason covered in 351.201(a)(2) is covered by this part.)


37. Section 351.203 is amended by adding alphabetically the definitions of ``Furlough'' and ``Undue interruption''
to read as follows:



 351.203

Definitions.



* * * * *






Furlough

 under this part means the placement of an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 consecutive
calendar days, or more than 22 workdays if done on a discontinuous basis, but not more than 1 year.



* * * * *






Undue interruption

 means a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the
employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within
the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands.
However, a work program would generally not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more than 90 days after
the reduction in force to preform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may be extended if placement
is made under this part to a low priority program or to a vacant position.


38. In  351.301, the current paragraph is redesignated as paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) is added to read as
follows:



 351.301

Applicability.



* * * * *




(b) In a transfer of function, the function must cease in the losing competitive area and continue in an identical form
in the gaining competitive area (i.e., in the gaining competitive area, the function continues to be carried out by
competing employees rather than by noncompeting employees).


39. In  351.302, paragraphs (f) and (g) are added to read as follows:



 351.302

Transfer of employees.



* * * * *




(f) An agency may not separate an employee who declines to transfer with the function any sooner than it transfers employees
who chose to transfer with the function to the gaining competitive area.


(g) Agencies may ask employees in a canvass letter whether the employee wishes to transfer with the function when the
function transfers to a different local commuting area. The canvass letter must give the employee information concerning
entitlements available to the employee if the employee accepts the offer to transfer, and if the employee declines
the offer to transfer. An employee may later change an initial acceptance offer without penalty. However, an employee
may not later change an initial declination of the offer to transfer.


40. In  351.303, paragraph (a) is revised and paragraph (c)(3) is added to read as follows:



 351.303

Identification of positions with a transferring function.




(a) The competitive area losing the function is responsible for identifying the positions of competing employees
with the transferring function. A competing employee is identified with the transferring function on the basis of
the employee's official position. Two methods are provided to identify employees with the transferring function:


(1) Identification Method One; and


(2) Identification Method Two.



* * * * *




(c) * * *


(3) In determining what percentage of time an employee performs a function in the employee's official position, the
agency may supplement the employee's official position description by the use of appropriate records (e.g., work
reports, organizational time logs, work schedules, etc.).



* * * * *




41. In  351.403, paragraph (a) is revised, paragraph (b)(5) is removed, and paragraph (b)(6) is redesignated
as (b)(5) to read as follows:



 351.403

Competitive level.




(a) (1) Each agency shall establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are
in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification
requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position
to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption.


(2) Competitive level determinations are based on each employee's official position, not the employee's personal
qualifications.


(3) Sex may not be the basis for a competitive level determination, except for a position OPM designates that certification
of eligibles by sex is justified.


(4) A probationary period required by subpart I of party 315 of this chapter for initial appointment to a supervisory
or managerial position is not a basis for establishing a separate competitive level.

Order of retention-competitive service.



* * * * *



(b) * * *

(1) Group I includes each career employee who is not serving a probationary period. (A supervisory or managerial employee
serving a probationary period required by subpart I of part 315 of this title is in group I if the employee is otherwise
eligible to be included in this group.) The following employees are in group I as soon as the employee completes any
required probationary period for initial appointment:

(i) An employee for whom substantial evidence exists of eligibility to immediately acquire status and career tenure,
and whose case is pending final resolution by OPM (including cases under Executive Order 10826 to correct certain
administrative errors);

(ii) An employee who acquires competitive status and satisfies the service requirement for career tenure when the
employee's position is brought into the competitive service;

(iii) An administrative law judge;

(iv) An employee appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3104, which provides for the employment of specially qualified scientific
or professional personnel, or a similar authority; and

(v) An employee who acquires status under 5 U.S.C. 3304(c) on transfer to the competitive service from the legislative
or judicial branches of the Federal Government.

(2) Group II includes each career-conditional employee, and each employee serving a probationary period under subpart
H of part 315 of this chapter. (A supervisory or managerial employee serving a probationary period required by subpart
I of part 315 of this title is in group II if the employee has not completed a probationary period under subpart H of part
315 of this title.) Group II also includes an employee when substantial evidence exists of the employee's eligibility
to immediately acquire status and career-conditional tenure, and the employee's case is pending final resolution
by OPM (including cases under Executive Order 10826 to correct certain administrative errors).

43. Section 351.502 is revised to read as follows:



 351.502 

Order of retention-excepted service.



(a) Competing employees shall be classified on a retention register in tenure groups on the basis of their tenure of
employment, veteran preference, length of service, and performance in descending order as set forth under section
351.501(a) for competing employees in the competitive service.

(b) Groups are defined as follows:

(1) Group I includes each permanent employee whose appointment carriers no restriction or condition such as conditional,
indefinite, specific time limit, or trial period.

(2) Group II includes each employee:
(i) Serving a trial period; or
(ii) Whose tenure is equivalent to a career-conditional appointment in the competitive service in agencies having
such excepted appointments.

(3) Group III includes each employee:
(i) Whose tenure is indefinite (i.e., without specific time limit), but not actually or potentially permanent;
(ii) Whose appointment has a specific time limitation of more than 1 year; or
(iii) Who is currently employed under a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less, but who has completed 1 year
of current continuous service under a temporary appointment with no break in service of 1 workday or more.

44. In  351.506, paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows:



 351.506 

Effective date of retention standing.


* * * * *



(b) The retention standing of each employee retained in a competitive level as an exception under section 351.607
or section 351.608 is determined as of the date the employee would have been released from the competitive level had
the exception not been used. The retention standing of each employee retained under either exception remains fixed
until completion of the reduction in force action which resulted in the temporary retention.

45. In  351.701, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:



 351.701 

Assignment involving displacement.



(a) 

General.

 When a group I or II competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful
(Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather
than furlough or separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to another competitive
position which requires no reduction, or the least possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must
be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last at least 3 months,
and have the same type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as the position from
which the employee is released. Upon accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under this
part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of the offered position
is not a consideration in determining an employee's right of assignment.

 353.102 

Definitions. 



In this part: 



Agency 

means: 

(1) With respect to restoration following a compensable injury, any department, independent establishment, agency,
or corporation in the executive branch, including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission, and any
agency in the legislative or judicial branch; and 

(2) With respect to military duty, all of the foregoing except for any agency in the legislative or judicial branch,
but including the Government of the District of Columbia. 



Fully recovered 

means compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of
the position he or she left or an equivalent one. 



Injury 

means a compensable injury sustained under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, subchapter I, and includes, in addition
to accidental injury, a disease proximately caused by the employment. 



Leave of absence 

means military leave, annual leave, leave without pay (LWOP), furlough, continuation of pay, or any combination
of these. 



Military duty 

means a period of: 

(1) Active duty for training or for service in the Armed Forces of the United States; 

(2) Inactive duty training in the Armed Forces of the United States; and 

(3) Active duty in the Public Health Service that is covered by 38 U.S.C. 4304(b). For the purpose of coverage under
38 U.S.C. 4304 (c) and (d), full-time training or other full-time duty performed by a member of the National Guard under
32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 is considered active duty for training in the Armed Forces of the United States.
For the purpose of 38 U.S.C. 4304(d), inactive duty training performed by that member under 32 U.S.C. 502 or 37 U.S.C.
206, 301, 309, 402, or 1002 is considered inactive duty training. 



Partially recovered 

means an injured employee, though not yet able to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently
to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. Ordinarily,
it is expected that a partially recovered employee will fully recover eventually. 



Physically disqualified 

means that: 

(1) (i) For medical reasons the employee is unable to 

perform 

the duties of the position formerly held or an equivalent one, or 

(ii) There is a medical reason to restrict the individual from some or all essential duties because of possible incapacitation
(for example, a seizure) or because of risk of health impairment (such as further exposure to a toxic substance for
an individual who has already shown the effects of such exposure). 

(2) The condition is considered permanent with little likelihood for improvement or recovery. 



 353.103 

Persons covered. 



(a) The provisions of this part concerned with military duty cover each employee of an agency who enters on military
duty from: 

(1) A career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service; or 

(2) An appointment without time limitation in a position outside the competitive service. 

(b) The provisions of this part concerning employee injury cover a civil officer or employee in any branch of the Government
of the United States, including an officer or employee of an instrumentality wholly owned by the United States, who
was separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury; but do
not include_

(1) A commissioned officer of the Regular Corps of the Public Health Service; 

(2) A commissioned officer of the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service on active duty; or 

(3) A commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

(c) Section 353.111 covers the restoration rights of employees serving under temporary appointments pending establishment
of a register (TAPER).

 353.104 

Notification of rights and obligations.


When an agency separates, places on leave of absence, restores or fails to restore an employee because of military
duty or compensable injury, it shall notify the employee of his or her rights, obligations, and benefits relating
to Government employment, including any appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as required by
 1201.21 of this title, or where appropriate, the right to grieve under a negotiated grievance procedure. However,
regardless of notification, an employee is still obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights,
and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by chapter 43 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, for reemployment
after military service or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.


 353.105 

Maintenance of records.


Each agency shall identify the position vacated by an employee who is injured or leaves to enter on military duty. It
shall also maintain the necessary records to assure that all such employees are preserved the rights and benefits
granted by this law and this part.


 353.106 

Personnel actions during employee's absence.


(a) Agency promotion plans must provide a mechanism by which employees who are absent because of military duty or compensable
injury can be considered for promotion.
(b) An employee whose position is reclassified while he or she is absent because of military duty or compensable injury
shall be considered for that position in accordance with the provisions in part 335 of this chapter.


 353.107 

Status upon reemployment.


Upon reemployment, an employee who was absent on military duty or because of compensable injury is generally entitled
to be treated as though he or she had never left. This means the entire period from the time the employee entered military
service or was injured until he or she was reemployed is creditable for purposes of rights and benefits based upon seniority
and length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, completion of probation, and leave rate
accrual.


 353.108 

Effect of performance and conduct on restoration rights.


The laws covered by this part do not permit an agency to circumvent the protections afforded by other laws to employees
who face the involuntary loss of their positions. Thus, an employee may not be denied restoration rights because of
poor performance or conduct that occurred prior to the employee's departure for compensable injury or military duty.
However, separation for cause that is substantially unrelated to the injury or to the performance of military duty
negates restoration rights. If during the period of injury or military duty the employee's conduct is such that it
would disqualify him or her for employment under OPM or agency regulations, restoration rights may be denied.


 353.109 

Transfer of function to another agency.


If the function of an employee absent on military duty or compensable injury is transferred to another agency, and
if the employee would have been transferred with the function under part 351 of this chapter had he or she not been absent,
the employee is entitled to be reinstated to a position in the gaining agency that is equivalent to the one he or she left.
It shall also assume the obligation to restore the employee in accordance with law and this part.


 353.110 

OPM placement assistance.


(a) 

Employee returning from military duty.

(1) OPM will provide placement assistance to an employee with restoration rights in the executive or legislative
branch, who either has competitive status, or if in the legislative branch is able to acquire competitive status under
5 U.S.C. 3304(c), provided_ 

 (i) The employee's executive branch agency is abolished and its functions are not transferred, or it is not possible
for the agency to restore the employee, or 

 (ii) It is not possible for a legislative branch employee to be restored in the legislative branch. 

 (2) If OPM determines the individual is qualified for a position in the executive branch which is either vacant or filled
under temporary appointment, the returning employee will be offered the position. 

 (b) Employee returning from compensable injury.

 OPM will provide placement assistance to an employee with restoration rights in the executive, legislative, or judicial
branches who cannot be placed in his or her former agency and who either has competitive status or is eligible to acquire
it under 5 U.S.C. 3304(c). If the employee's agency is abolished and its functions are not transferred, or it is not
possible for the employee to be restored in his or her former agency, OPM will provide placement assistance by enrolling
the employee in OPM's Priority Placement Program under part 330 of this chapter. 

 (c) This section does not apply to employees serving under a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register
(TAPER). 

 

 353.111 

 

Restoration rights of TAPER employees. 

 

An employee serving in the competitive service under a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register
(TAPER) under section 316.201 of this chapter (other than an employee serving in a position classified above GS-15),
is entitled to be restored to the position he or she left or an equivalent one in the same commuting area. 

 

Subpart B_Military Service 

 

 353.201 

 

Leave of absence. 

 

(a) 

Entitlement. 

 (1) The following employees are entitled under 38 U.S.C. 4304 to a leave of absence in connection with military duty:


 (i) A member of a Reserve component (Reserve or National Guard) who performs active duty for training or inactive duty
(38 U.S.C. 4304(d)), or 

 (ii) An employee who reports for enlistment, induction or physical examination (38 U.S.C. 4304(e)). 

 (2) There is no limitation in law as to the timing or duration of leaves of absence, nor is there any authority for an agency
to deny a leave of absence. If an agency has concerns about the timing, frequency, or length of an employee's requests
for a leave of absence, it should contact the commander of the military unit to determine if the duty can be changed.


 (b) Authorization required.

 To be eligible for a leave of absence, the employee must be under military orders. Any of the following is acceptable
evidence of orders: 

 (1) Written military orders, 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941104-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941104-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) An inactive duty training or ``drill schedule'' published by the employee's military command or unit, or
(3) Verbal confirmation of such orders from the employee's military command or unit or military superior.
(c) 

Work schedules.

 An agency is not required to reschedule an employee's work in order to accommodate his or her Reserve obligation, and
may not require the employee to reschedule his or her work in order to perform military duty on his or her own time.
(d) 

Return to duty.


(1) An employee on a leave of absence for military duty is required to report for work at the beginning of the first regularly
scheduled workday following release, rejection for service or completion of physical examination. If hospitalized
incident to training or examination, the employee is required to report at the beginning of the first regularly scheduled
workday following discharge from hospitalization, or within 1 year of release from military duty, whichever is earlier.
In all cases, necessary travel time or other delays beyond the individual's control may extend the reporting date.
An employee who fails to report within these time limits is subject to normal agency disciplinary procedures related
to absences from work.
(2) An employee on a leave of absence returns to the position he or she left, or if applicable, to the position to which
reassigned or promoted while absent. The employee is entitled to the same seniority, status, pay and vacation he or
she would have had if not absent on military duty.
(3) An employee returning from a leave of absence has no special protections against discharge without cause. However,
the employee may not be disadvantaged where vacation leave is concerned. Thus, insofar as possible, the employee
is entitled to have an annual vacation period of extended leave for rest and recreation approved for the same time as
it would ordinarily have been granted.



 353.202 

Mandatory restoration.



(a) 

Basic entitlement.

 An individual returning from military duty who is entitled to restoration rights under 38 U.S.C. 4301 (inducted)
or 4304 (a), (b), or (c) (enlisted, called to active duty, Reservist entered on active duty, or Reservist serving basic
training), must be restored as soon as possible after making application, but in no event later than 30 days after the
individual's release from military duty.
(b) 

Conditions.

 To be eligible for restoration, the employee must have left his or her employment for the purpose of entering the military,
must satisfactorily complete his or her period of service, and apply for restoration_

(1) Within 90 days of release from active duty (or from hospitalization continuing after discharge for a period of
no more than 1 year) in the case of employees returning under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (a) or (b); and
(2) Within 31 days of release from active duty (or from hospitalization incident to the military service, or 1 year
after the employee's scheduled release from military training, whichever is earlier), in the case of employees returning
under 38 U.S.C. 4304(c).

<PARENT> FR941104-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Length of military duty. 

Each time an employee leaves his or her employment to enter military service, he or she is subject to the time limits
prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 4304 (a) and (b) for purposes of restoration rights. Generally, these are as follows:
(1) 

Regular active duty 

soldiers have 4 years plus 1 additional year if the additional duty was ``at the request and for the convenience of the
Federal Government.'' (Their orders or DD Form 214 must so state.) Also, in the event of a Presidential call-up such
as Operation Desert Storm, numerous active duty troops in key positions may be held over beyond their enlistments.
This additional duty is covered because it is ``additional service imposed pursuant to law.''
(2) 

Reserves and National Guard 

are covered under 38 U.S.C. 4304(b)(2). Normally, their restoration rights are limited to 4 years. (They do not get
the extra 5th year ``at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government.'') To go beyond 4 years, their
service has to be other than for training, it is limited by the time period that the President is authorized to call up
troops (currently 180 days), and, if voluntary, their orders or DD Form 214 must say that the additional duty was at
the request and for the convenience of the Government.
(3) 

Mobilization authority. 

(i) Since 1978, 10 U.S.C. 673b has authorized the President to call up as many as 200,000 members of the Selected Reserve
for up to 90 days. In 1986, this authority was broadened to allow the President to extend the call-up for an additional
90 days, if necessary, without regard to a state of national emergency or war, for the purpose of augmenting the active
component forces for an operational mission.
(ii) The President is also authorized by 10 U.S.C. 673a to call up as many as one million members of the Ready Reserves
for not longer than 24 months in a national emergency.
(iii) Under 10 U.S.C. 672, with a declaration of war or national emergency by the Congress, all Reserve components,
including Standby and Retired, could be ordered to active duty for the duration of the war, plus 6 months.


 353.203


Physical disqualification.


An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or an equivalent one because of disability sustained
during military service shall be placed in the agency in another position for which qualified that will provide the
employee with the same seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances
in each case.


 353.204


Retention protection.


(a) 

While on military duty. 

An employee with restoration rights under 38 U.S.C. 4301 or 4304 (a), (b), or (c) may not be demoted or separated (other
than military separation) while on military duty. He or she is not a ``competing employee'' under section 351.404
of this chapter. If the employee's position is abolished during such absence, the agency must reassign the employee
to another position of like seniority, status, and pay. An employee on a leave of absence under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (d) or
(e) has no special protections in a reduction in force.
(b) 

Upon reemployment. 

Upon reemployment, an employee with a restoration right under 38 U.S.C. 4301 or 4304 (a) or (b) may not be discharged
for a period of 1 year except for cause. A member of a Reserve component returning from an initial period of active duty
for training under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (c) may not be discharged for a period of 6 months except for cause. (Reduction in force
is not considered ``for cause.'') Employees returning from a leave of absence under 38 U.S.C. 4304 (d) or (e) have no
special protections against discharge.
(c) 

TAPER employees. 

This section does not apply to employees serving under a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register.


 353.205


Prohibition against discrimination.


A person who seeks or holds a position in the Federal Government may not be denied hiring, retention in employment,
or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component
of the Armed Forces.

Subpart C_Compensable Injury



 353.301 

Restoration rights.



(a) 

Fully recovered within 1 year.

 An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from
the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins
after the employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to be restored immediately
and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. Although these restoration rights are agencywide,
the employee's basic entitlement is to the former position or equivalent in the local commuting area the employee
left. If a suitable vacancy does not exist, the employee is entitled to displace an employee occupying a continuing
position under temporary appointment or tenure group III. If there is no such position in the local commuting area,
the agency may offer the employee a position (as described above) in another location. This paragraph also applies
when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.
A fully recovered employee is expected to return to work immediately upon the cessation of compensation.

(b) 

Fully recovered after 1 year

. An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from
the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins
after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority
consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies
for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the
individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted
service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration
for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how
this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when
an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.

(c) 

Physically disqualified

. An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent because of a compensable injury,
is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same seniority,
status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in each case. This right
is agencywide and applies for a period of 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins. After 1 year, the
individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable.

(d) 

Partially recovered

. Agencies must make every effort to restore, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially
recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating
these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as
amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for
the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment
as soon as he or she is able.



 353.302 

Status upon reemployment.



An individual who is restored following a compensable injury is generally entitled to be treated as though he or she
had never left. This means that the entire period the employee was receiving compensation is creditable for purposes
of rights and benefits based upon length of service, including within-grade increases, career tenure, leave rate
accrual, and completion of probation. However, an injured employee enjoys no special protections in a reduction
in force. Separation by reduction in force or for cause while on compensation terminates entitlement to credit for
the subsequent period the individual continues to receive compensation, and also means the individual has no restoration
rights.



Subpart D_Appeal Rights



 353.401 

Appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board.



(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an employee or former employee of an agency in the executive
branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) who is covered by this part may appeal to
the MSPB an agency's failure to restore, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee following a leave
of absence. All appeals are to be submitted in accordance with MSPB's regulations.

(b) An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal
to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.

(c) An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether
the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. Upon reemployment, a partially recovered
employee may also appeal the agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits
based upon length of service.

Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning; Workshop on Site-Specific Advisory Boards 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of workshop. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 22, 1994, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for comment a proposed rule on Radiological Criteria
for Decommissioning (59 FR 43200). Section 20.1406(b) of this proposed rule requires that a Site Specific Advisory
Board (SSAB) be convened in cases where a licensee proposes to request restricted release of the site. The objective
of this workshop is to conduct an informed discussion among affected interests on the implementation of this requirement.
The workshop will be facilitated by an independent facilitator and will involve approximately fifteen to twenty
invited participants representing a broad range of affected interests including, for example, government (local,
State, tribal, Federal), industry, and environmental and citizen groups. The workshop will be open to the public
with sufficient time being provided for public comment and questions throughout each day of the workshop. The workshop
proceedings will be transcribed and the transcript will be available for public review. 


An Issues Paper containing a detailed description of the SSAB implementation issues is being developed by the NRC
staff for use as a background discussion document for the workshop. This Issues paper will be distributed to participants
in advance of the workshop. A detailed agenda and list of participants for the workshop is also being developed for
distribution to participants in advance of the workshop. Copies of the Issues Paper, the Workshop Agenda, and the
list of workshop participants will be made available to the public at the workshop. Copies of these documents will
be placed in the NRC Public Document Room and will also be available for downloading and viewing on the NRC bulletin
board as described below. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In situations where a licensee proposes to decommission a site under restricted release conditions, proposed Section
20.1407 would require the licensee to establish a SSAB for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected interests
on the proposed decommissioning. 

There are many important issues related to the SSAB concept that must be further developed before the final rule is
promulgated to facilitate implementation of the SSAB concept at NRC licensed sites. These include determining the
exact scope and functions of an SSAB and the appointment and composition of an SSAB. A national workshop will be extremely
useful in developing information on how these issues should be addressed, as well as for developing the final NRC position
on the SSAB concept. The objective of the workshop will not be to develop a consensus on the implementation of an SSAB
but will rather be a discussion of information, ideas, and concerns about SSAB implementation issues, as well as identifying
areas of agreement and disagreement on the implementation issues.

SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the reopening of the comment period for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) Occupant Protection
Standards for Commuter Category Airplanes. The comment period for this NPRM is being reopened for 120 days to allow
the public and industry the opportunity to evaluate additional supporting data and to allow the Joint Aviation Authorities
additional time to comment on the NPRM.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited



Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Comments relating to the environmental, energy, federalism, or economic
impact that might result from adopting the proposals in this notice are also invited. Substantive comments should
be accompanied by cost estimates. Comments should identify the regulatory docket or notice number and should be submitted
in triplicate to the Rules Docket address specified above. All comments received on or before the closing date for
comments specified will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on this proposed rulemaking. The
proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received will be available,
both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report
summarizing each substantive public contact with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) personnel concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their
comments in response to this notice must include a preaddressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 27344.'' The postcard will be date stamped and mailed to the commenter.



Availability of NPRM's

Background



On July 14, 1993, the FAA issued NPRM 93-71 (58 FR 38028), and the comment period closed November 12, 1993. The
NPRM proposed to amend the airworthiness standards for commuter category airplanes by upgrading the seat restraint
and seat cushion flammability requirements. On September 17, 1993, GAMA requested the FAA withdraw the proposal
until additional supporting documentation was made available to the public. By letter dated October 4, 1993, the
Joint Aviation Authority requested that the comment period be extended to enable the JAA Study Group additional time
to review the proposal and prepare a recommendation.

The FAA received an additional report on commuter airplane accident data analysis in October 1994. This report is
the additional information that GAMA requested be available before the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was made available
to the public for comment.



Conclusion



In view of the possibility of obtaining additional technical information and to provide for a more consistent set
of airworthiness standards, the FAA agrees that it would be in the public's best interest to reopen the comment period.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) 
is considering the establishment of a viticultural area in 
the State of California to be known as ``St. Helena.'' The 
proposed area is located totally within Napa County. This 
proposal is the result of a petition submitted by 
Mr. Charles A. Carpy, Chairman of the St. Helena Appellation 
Committee. The establishment of viticultural areas and the 
subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of 
origin in wine labeling and advertising will help consumers 
better identify the wines they may purchase, and will help 
winemakers distinguish their products from wines made in 
other areas. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 
 

On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR 
Part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of 
definitive viticultural areas. The regulations allow the 
name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an 
appellation of origin on wine labels and in wine 
advertisements. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new Part 9 to
27 
CFR, for the listing of approved American viticultural areas. 
 Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27 CFR, defines an American 
viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region 
distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of 
which have been delineated in Subpart C of Part 9. 
 Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for 
proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested 
person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region 
as a viticultural area. The petition should include: 
 (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural 
area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the 
area specified in the petition; 
 (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries 
of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
 (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features 
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
from surrounding areas; 
 (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
viticultural area, based on the features which can be found 
on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the 
largest applicable scale; and

Petition 
 

 ATF has received a petition from Mr. Charles A. Carpy, 
Chairman of the St. Helena Appellation Committee, proposing 
to establish a new viticultural area in Napa County, 
California, to be known as ``St. Helena.'' The St. Helena 
Appellation Committee is composed of various vineyard and 
winery owners located throughout the St. Helena area. The 
proposed St. Helena viticultural area is located 
approximately 16 miles northwest of the city of Napa. It is 
located totally within the larger and previously established 
Napa Valley viticultural area. As stated in the petition, 
the St. Helena viticultural area covers approximately 9,060 
acres, and is densely planted to vines. There are over 30 
wineries within the area. The petition provides the 
following information as evidence that the proposed area 
meets the regulatory requirements discussed previously. 
Mr. Charles Sullivan, Napa Valley historian, has provided 
the petitioner with most of the historical information 
concerning the St. Helena area that is covered in the 
petition whereas Dr. Deborah Elliott-Fisk of the University 
of California has provided the petitioner with most of the 
information in the petition concerning soils, geology and 
physical geography of the St. Helena area. 


Evidence That Viticultural Area Name Is Widely Known 
 

 Data prepared by Mr. Sullivan in support of the 
petition provides the following historical information. 
  The town of St. Helena was founded by Henry Still, who 
bought land from the Edward Bale family in 1855. By 1858 
there was a school house and a little Baptist church. Four 
years later Professor William Brewer of the Whitney party 
called it a ``pretty little village with fifty or more 
houses * * * nestled among grand old oaks.'' Early winemakers in 
the St. Helena area included Charles Krug and George Belden 
Crane. At the end of the 1879 vintage the 

San Francisco 
Post

 ran an article on northern California wines which noted 
the flavor characteristics of Napa clarets. This article 
was copied by the 

St. Helena Star 

which predicted that there 
would be 2,000 acres of grapes planted in the Napa Valley in 
1880. According to Mr. Sullivan, the final total was closer 
to 3,000, and concentrated in the St. Helena area. 
  As early as 1869, San Francisco's 

Alta California

 was 
making reference to a ``St. Helena district,'' as did the 


Pacific Rural Press.

 These were references to vineyard 
plantings in the area. In 1872 the Napa Reporter made 
reference to the boom in vineyard land around St. Helena. 
The 

Alta California 

ran an article on the area in 1878, 
treating St. Helena as a specific district with a great 
reputation. By then Charles Krug, the Beringers, Crane, 
John Lewelling, H. A. Pellet, and 14 other producers had 
built cellars in the St. Helena area. 
  In 1875 Krug and Pellet organized the producers and 
growers in the district, a move that culminated in the 
formation of the St. Helena Viticultural Club on January 22, 
1876. According to Mr. Sullivan, others outside the 
district could join, but it was a local St. Helena 
organization. In 1880 the Club constructed Vintners Hall, a 
two story building with a reading room, meeting rooms, and a 
social hall upstairs. 
  Mr. Sullivan states that by the end of the 1870s there 
was no question concerning Napa's special reputation as a 
winegrowing region, or about St. Helena's as a discrete 
district in that region. As support for this statement, 
Mr. Sullivan cites the 

Alta California 

which concluded in an 
article published in 1880 that ``Napa is now the leading 
wine-growing county of California, and * * * St. Helena has 
become the center of the most prosperous wine district in 
the State.'' 
  According to Mr. Sullivan, by the turn of the century 
Napa prices were still higher than those of other districts, 
but the special position accorded St. Helena wines had 
ceased to exist. The popular image of the wines of 
Oakville, Rutherford, Larkmead, and Howell Mountain had 
ended the perception of St. Helena wines standing above all 
others. After Prohibition, the regional association of the 
leading Napa Valley producers was far from foremost in 
consumers' minds and in the minds of wine writers according 
to Mr. Sullivan. However, Mr. Sullivan states that more 
recently there has been a tendency for wine writers to make 
reference to the St. Helena ``district'' and to its wines, 
particularly to its Cabernet Sauvignons. 
  In addition to the historical name information 
mentioned above, the ``St. Helena'' name appears on a U.S.G.S. 
7.5 minute series map entitled ``St. Helena Quadrangle'' which 
includes the city of St. Helena and much of its surrounding 
area.

Evidence of Boundaries 



According to the petition, there have never been 
precise historic boundaries for the St. Helena viticultural 
district. However, the petitioner states that history does 
provide an imprecise ``St. Helena District'' within the 
geographic structure of State winegrowing established by the 
first Board of State Viticultural Commissioners in the 
1880s. According to the petition, the State was divided 
into districts, one being Napa, which included Napa, Solano, 
and Contra Costa Counties. Charles Krug was the first 
commissioner for the district in 1880. Napa County was then 
divided into administrative districts: Napa (City), 
Yountville, St. Helena, and Calistoga. According to the petition, these were not considered viticultural districts

at the time. The St. Helena District included the vineyards 
of Howell Mountain, most of Rutherford, and Larkmead. This 
is discussed in E.C. Priber's report to the Board in 1893. 
Even Chiles and Conn Valleys were included in the St. Helena 
District, although Priber gave separate statistics for these 
areas. 

Although the wineries and vineyardists in the Priber 
report are listed in administrative districts, Priber's man 
in the field, A. Warren Robinson, asked each where his or 
her operation was located, and the answer was given as a 
place, not necessarily a post office. Bernard Ehlers said 
he lived at Lodi Station. Mrs. Lillie Coit listed Larkmead. 
According to the petitioner, such data make it possible to 
make an attempt to draw historically accurate lines. 

The petitioner states that a more accurate listing of 
viticultural districts was given by Charles Krug in his 
report of 1887. In it he traces the development of each 
district in Napa County since 1881, by acreage, production, 
and type of grape vines. Krug listed Yountville, Oakville, 
Rutherford, St. Helena, Spring Mountain, Howell Mountain, 
Calistoga and five others. Although he did not include a 
map, the precision of his statistics indicates that he and 
others had the limits of these districts in mind. 

From the information discussed above, the petitioner 
has tried to plot the northern and southern boundaries of the St. Helena viticultural area. From a historical point

of view, the petitioner states that any one of three 
landmarks could be used as the northern boundary of the St. 
Helena viticultural area. These landmarks include Ritchie 
Creek, Bale Lane, and Big Tree Road. However, the 
petitioner feels that from a practical, as well as 
historical point of view, Bale Lane is the best choice. 

The petitioner states that the southern boundary of the 
St. Helena viticultural area was discussed at length during 
the December 9, 1992, ATF public hearing held in Napa, 
California, concerning the northern boundary of the 
Rutherford viticultural area. From the information 
submitted at that hearing, it was determined that Zinfandel 
Avenue, known locally as Zinfandel Lane, was the best 
northern boundary for the Rutherford viticultural area. 
Consequently, the petitioner states that Zinfandel Avenue 
(Zinfandel Lane) should also be used as the southern 
boundary of the adjacent St. Helena viticultural area. 


The petitioner states that the southeast boundary of 
the St. Helena appellation should include the Spring Valley 
area since this area was included in the St. Helena area on 
the 1895 ``Official Map of the County of Napa.'' On this map, 
the properties of George Mee and Antonio Rossi (Spring 
Valley) were listed as being in the St. Helena district 
whereas Charles Scheggia, just to the south, listed himself 
as being in Rutherford.

<TEXT>
 

According to the petitioner, the western boundary of 
the St. Helena viticultural area is not strictly delineated 
by historical custom. The petitioner states that this 
western boundary should be dictated by the eastern boundary 
of the adjacent Spring Mountain District viticultural area 
which utilizes the 400-foot contour line. The petitioner 
states that although some people might draw the western 
boundary of the St. Helena viticultural area at the 500 or 
600-foot contour line, the 400-foot contour line defies no 
historical precedent and prevents the overlapping of the St. 
Helena viticultural area with the Spring Mountain District 
viticultural area. 

In regard to the eastern boundary, the petitioner 
states that the historical records indicate that Conn Valley 
is a separate area and should not be included in the St. 
Helena viticultural area. The records indicate, however, 
that Pratt Valley is clearly part of the St. Helena area 
from the location of the Pratt and Chabot winegrowing 
properties, according to the petitioner. In addition, the 
Crystal Springs Road area and Dago Valley should be 
included, according to the petitioner, due more to recent 
developments there rather than earlier history. However, 
the petitioner states that the old Rossini property, where 
the historic Burgess-Souverain Winery is located today, and 
the Leunenberger property, where the original Sutter Home-Ballantine Winery was located (today Deer Park Winery),

should not be included because they are located on the lower 
slopes of Howell Mountain rather than in the St. Helena area. 

The petitioner uses mostly the 400-foot contour line 
and a short portion of Howell Mountain Road and a longer 
portion of Conn Valley Road to delineate the eastern 
boundary of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area. 



Geographical Features 



Data prepared by Dr. Elliott-Fisk in support of the 
petition provides the following geographical information. 



Climate. 

The proposed St. Helena viticultural area 
lies within a relatively narrow and constricted portion of 
the upper Napa Valley proper. There exists a subtle 
interaction of climatic factors which affect grapes grown in 
this valley floor area. These subtle climatic influences 
are part of a continuum across the entire floor of the Napa 
Valley. 

The Napa Valley proper is classified as a coastal 
valley. Along the valley floor from Napa to Calistoga, 
there are pronounced mesoclimatic variations which relate to 
the penetration of marine influences from San Pablo Bay and, 
to a lesser extent, to the rise in elevation as one proceeds 
up Napa Valley. This marine air incursion is caused by 
warming of the valley floor and surrounding hillsides during 
the daylight hours of the growing season. This warming land 
mass causes the air in the area to rise, creating pressure 
gradients which draw in marine air off of San Pablo Bay to 
the south. During the growing season, this phenomenon 
generally begins in the early afternoon and continues into 
the evening. Due to proximity to the bay, the areas in the 
southern portion of the valley receive the most direct 
impact of these pressure gradient winds. These winds have a 
cooling effect throughout the Napa Valley. 

During the grape growing season, this cooling plays an 
important role in the development of the grapes by allowing 
them to better retain their natural acidity which is 
critical in the production of high quality wines, according 
to the petitioner. In the proposed St. Helena viticultural 
area, this cooling effect is moderated compared to the areas 
further south. However, while the St. Helena area has 
relatively warm conditions, it is the daily maximum 
extremes, for which the area to the north (Calistoga) is 
better known, that distinguish the St. Helena and Calistoga 
areas. 

Traditionally, the dividing line between the area of 
Calistoga's higher daily extremes and St. Helena's warm 
coastal climate has been the section of land around Bale 
Lane. It is at this point that the Napa Valley and Napa River take a pronounced directional change of course from 
north/northwesterly to more westerly. To the north of Bale 
Lane, the exposure of the valley floor to the sun also is 
more directly aligned than to the south where there is more 
shading. 

The area to the north of the proposed St. Helena 
viticultural area, particularly around the city of 
Calistoga, is also affected by a secondary marine air 
incursion, far less dramatic than that off of San Pablo Bay, 
which penetrates the upper Napa Valley through the Knights 
Valley area. This marine influence, according to the 
petitioner, does not typically penetrate as far south as the 
St. Helena viticultural area. When present, these moist, 
cooling winds serve to moderate the generally hotter 
temperatures in Calistoga, making this area ideal for 
growing premium wine grapes. 

Dr. Elliott-Fisk also finds that there are significant 
climatic differences between the St. Helena viticultural 
area and the surrounding mountains. To the east of St. 
Helena lies Howell Mountain and to the west is Spring 
Mountain. These mountain areas range in elevation from 400 
to 2,600 feet for Spring Mountain and from 1,400 to 2,400 
feet for Howell Mountain. On average, temperatures fall 
along the valley floor approximately 2.8 degrees Fahrenheit 
for each 1,000 foot fall in elevation.

<TEXT>
 

The mountain areas with south or southwest slopes, such as those generally found in the Howell Mountain viticultural
area, receive approximately 20 percent more solar radiation during the growing season compared to the valley floor.
Northeast and northwest slopes, such as those that typically occur in the Spring Mountain District viticultural
area, receive approximately 20 percent less solar radiation than those found on the valley floor in the proposed St.
Helena viticultural area. In addition to these differences related to aspect, the relative absence of fog in the higher
altitudes increases the solar radiation there compared to the valley floor which often is covered by early morning
fog. 
According to the petitioner, precipitation has been more important in the formation of topography and soils in the
Napa Valley than in the definition of distinct climate zones. Outside of annual physiological water needs which are
almost exclusively augmented by irrigation, precipitation directly affects grape vines during late spring and
early fall, which are the critical periods of the growing and harvest seasons. Cooler areas, those generally found
to the south of the St. Helena appellation, are more negatively affected by such conditions. 


Soils, Geology, and Physical Geography


The proposed St. Helena viticultural area is in the northern Napa Valley and is defined by the petitioner as the valley
floor area and lower mountain slopes (i.e., toe-slopes) from Zinfandel Lane in the south to Bale Lane in the north.

According to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, the geology of the St. Helena area is characterized by steep mountain fronts composed
of the (1) Franciscan Formation (largely sandstones, mudstones and various metamorphic inclusions) overlain by
the moderate thicknesses of Sonoma Volcanics on the west side in the Mayacamas Range, and (2) deep flows of Sonoma Volcanics,
volcanic vents, and volcanic domes over Great Valley sandstones on the east side in the Vaca Range. Both mountain slopes
have been faulted and heavily eroded, with much of this activity believed to be synonymous with the formation of the
Sonoma Volcanics in the last 2-5 million years. 
Dr. Elliott-Fisk further states that the topography of the Napa Valley floor is largely the product of (1) the marine
incursion of San Pablo Bay, and consequent marine erosion and deposit, (2) tectonic uplift and land displacement
along faults and fold structures (e.g., anticlines), (3) bedrock resistance to erosion, (4) slope stability, and
(5) discharge volumes of the Napa River and its tributaries. The proposed St. Helena viticultural area, extending
from Bale Lane on the north to Zinfandel Lane on the south, has a fairly uniform, steep gradient (as compared to the entire
Napa Valley floor), indicating that it is a zone of erosion of a former more powerful Napa River. The valley in this area
is narrow and is almost entirely the product of river erosion, unlike any other stretch of the valley floor. The one
break in gradient occurs where the river turns southward near Big Tree Road (just south of Bale Lane) and exerts more
force to cut through bedrock. Thus, although alluvial fans extend across the valley floor from their tributary canyons
to the Napa River, the fans are small and relatively young compared to the rest of Napa Valley. Sulphur Creek fan is the
largest of the group, as it issues from a very large drainage basin. Fans of the eastern side of the proposed appellation
are very small, largely due to the resistance of obsidian (i.e., volcanic glass) bedrock here and small tributary
basin size. 
The topographic uniformity of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area is further substantiated by climatological
data and bioclimatic maps. Growing degree-days (i.e., temperature regime), according to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, are
very uniform along this stretch of the valley floor and lower slopes, averaging just under 3600 degree-days. Mean
annual precipitation is 35-38 inches. Just north of the proposed northern boundary of the St. Helena viticultural
area (e.g., around Dunaweal Lane), the vegetation changes from Valley Oak Savanna to Mixed Hardwood Woodland. These
gradients of climate and vegetation from south to north up Napa Valley, according to the petitioner, further support
the designation of viticultural areas, as climate is an important factor influencing vine growth and fruit characteristics,
with natural vegetation telling the viticulturalist what vine production will be like.

Soils and Geomorphology of the Napa Valley 


Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that soils can be consistently identified and mapped in Napa Valley through knowledge of
the geomorphology (i.e., landforms and landform history) of the area. These soil differences are relevant viticulturally
and can be used in the delimitation of viticultural areas. This soil and geomorphic mapping, which is based on very
detailed field and laboratory studies, produces soil units that are similar to those shown in the Napa County Soil
Survey (USDA-Soil Conservation Survey), but with more detail, precision, and most importantly, a different classification
scheme, according to the petitioner. The resolution of the mapping of Napa Valley's soils has increased from the 1938
survey (and the old Marbut soil classification scheme) to the newer 1977 survey (using the new 7th Approximation system
of soil classification) to a more detailed depiction of Napa Valley's soils based on an increased understanding of
(1) the geomorphological history of the Napa Valley, and (2) the importance of soil parent material and time as soil-forming
factors. There are many more soil types (or potential soil series) in Napa County than the Napa County Soil Survey depicts
according to the petitioner. 
Dr. Elliott-Fisk further notes that a geomorphic (landscape) surface of a given age will have soils of the same type
across it. This is because soil formation is controlled by five factors (known as the soil-forming factors): climate,
biota (plants and animals), parent material, relief (topography) and time. The petitioner states that much of the
variation of soil types in Napa County is due to variation in the parent material and time factors. Different soil types
will be derived from sedimentary bedrock versus volcanic bedrock, whether or not these soils are upland residual
soils (with weathering and soil formation in place or 

in situ

) or transportation/depositional soils (with soil formation beginning once river or other sediments are deposited).
Alluvial soils of different ages (old versus young) will also differ significantly. 
On any particular geomorphic surface (such as the Sulphur Creek fan), the parent material, relief and time factors
are held constant, with the soils very similar (if not identical) across this surface. For depositional landforms
(e.g., mudflow lobes, river terraces, alluvial fan units, etc.), the older deposits will have more strongly formed
soils. If a geomorphic surface is disturbed by erosion or deposition, its soil will be altered (if not destroyed),
with a new soil then forming. 
In Napa Valley, distinct differences are seen between hillside soils and valley floor soils, at least in most situations.
Hillside soils tend to be formed from bedrock and are shallow, whereas valley floor soils tend to be formed from alluvium,
colluvium or bay deposits and are often deep. As Napa Valley has been tectonically active, however, these deeper,
depositional soils are occasionally found up on the hillsides, uplifted above the valley floor. It is important to
separate these depositional hillside soils from residual bedrock soils. They have much higher water-holding capacities
and deeper rooting depths, influencing vine growth significantly. 
Dr. Elliott-Fisk further indicates that the floor of Napa Valley (excluding the bedrock ``islands'' which form small
hills) has soils formed on (1) alluvial fans of various lithologies, textures, and sizes emerging from tributary
watersheds towards the Napa River, (2) alluvial floodplains of various ages along the Napa River and the lower reaches
of its tributaries (such as Sulphur Creek), and (3) bay deposits of various types, formed when San Pablo Bay extended
into the valley proper. The alluvial fans in particular show marked contrasts in soil types north-south and east-west
in the valley as a function of their (1) watershed or drainage basin geology and (2) stream gradient (i.e., topography).
Dr. Elliott-Fisk concludes that the soils scientist then expects to find one soil series on fans derived from sedimentary
bedrock and another on fans derived from volcanic bedrock. 


Geomorphic Units of the Proposed St. Helena Viticultural Area 


The valley floor of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area is covered by a series of small fans and contains important
areas of Napa River floodplain. Dr. Elliott-Fisk has described the geomorphic units as follows: 


North to South on West Side of Valley


(1) Ritchie Creek Fan (the southern edge of it extending south of Bale Lane into the proposed viticultural area); principally
in the area north of St. Helena; 
(2) Mill Creek Fan; 
(3) Hirsch Creek Fan; 
(4) York Creek Fan; 
(5) Sulphur Creek Fan; and 
(6) Bear Canyon Fan Complex (in approved Rutherford viticultural area). 


North to South on East Side of Valley


(1) Simmons Canyon Fan (north of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area);

(2) Dutch Henry and Biter Creek Fan Complex (north 
 of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area, 
 reaching almost to Bale Lane); 
 (3) Unnamed Fan west of Bell Canyon Reservoir and 
 Crystal Springs Road; 
 (4) Base of Pratt Valley (very small fan); 
 (5) Base of Deer Park (unnamed tributary; small 
 fan); 
 (6) Base of Spring Valley (very small fan; mostly 
 within Spring Valley); and 
 (7) Conn Creek Fan Complex (in approved Rutherford 
 viticultural area). 
 

Napa River Floodplain and River Terraces
 

(1) Current incised channel of the Napa River; 
 (2) Current floodplain of the Napa River; and 
 (3) Older floodplains of the Napa River at higher 
 elevations.

 
 
[These landforms follow the channel of the Napa 
 River, except for older terraces along the 
 hillsides, which are largely obscured by dense 
 hillside woodland and forest; these terraces are 
 discovered through intensive field studies.]

 
 
Dr. Elliott-Fisk notes that the geomorphic depositional 
units (i.e., landforms) in the proposed St. Helena 
viticultural area are composed almost exclusively of volcanic lithologies (around 85-90 percent volcanics

typically, occasionally dropping to 70 percent on parts of 
the Sulphur Creek fan, with the remainder sedimentary and 
metamorphic inclusions from the bedrock underlying the 
Sonoma Volcanics). The upper part of the Sulphur Creek 
Basin contains small units of sandstone and metamorphic 
lithologies exposed at the surface through faulting and 
slope failure. Despite this, volcanic rhyolitic tuff, 
rhyolite, dacite and andesite are by far the dominant 
surficial geologies, compared to the Bear Canyon Fan Complex 
to the south which is 30 percent or less volcanics and the 
remainder sedimentary. 
 Dr. Elliott-Fisk further observes that although several 
types of volcanic rocks compose the St. Helena hillside, the 
most widespread (and as such, ubiquitous) units are volcanic 
ash-flows, referred to as tuffs, with occasional volcanic 
mudflows. The matrix is rhyolitic in composition, with 
incorporated clasts of obsidian, rhyolite, andesite, dacite 
and tuff. Occasional metamorphic clasts of cobble or 
smaller size are seen. This geologic parent material is 
slightly acidic to acidic, with water-holding capacity of 
tuffaceous bedrock units moderate. This potential soil 
parent material is brought down both slopes to the west and 
east of the valley floor by hillside erosion, runoff, and 
tributary streamflow. 
 According to Dr. Elliott-Fisk, the Napa River has 
incised through these fan deposits discharging on the valley 
floor and migrated as a consequence of the resistance of 
these deposits versus its own stream power. The Napa River 
floodplain, and its associated recent terraces, varies in 
width throughout this section of Napa Valley but has formed 
important terraces along the eastern valley edge. Distinct 
breaks in the natural vegetation are seen at the 
terrace/alluvial fan transition, as the terraces have more 
fertile soils with a greater water-holding capacity. As the 
width of the valley floor in the St. Helena area is on the 
average less (e.g., more narrow) than anywhere else in the 
Napa Valley, these terraces form less viticultural acreage 
than in the southern or middle sections of Napa Valley. 
 The lower hillside slopes below the 400-foot elevation 
are difficult to map on a broad scale depicting geomorphic 
surfaces. This is largely a function of abrupt changes in 
slope angle and vegetation type, which influence long-term 
slope stability. Small areas of uplifted depositional 
surfaces (alluvial fans and stream floodplain terraces) were 
found across these lower slopes in the proposed St. Helena 
area, however. 


Soils of the Proposed St. Helena Viticultural Area 
 

With regard to the soils within the proposed 
viticultural area, Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that the Sonoma 
Volcanics rim all sides of the valley in the St. Helena area, and as such the depositional valley floor soils (which

may be very bouldery deposits across alluvial fans or finer, 
but still gravelly deposits along the Napa River proper, all 
principally Xerolls) are volcanic in origin, and deep, very 
gravelly sandy loams to sandy clay loams to clay loams, with 
low to moderate water holding capacities. Sediments have 
been transported relatively short distances from their 
origins, as this is the headwater area of the Napa River 
system, and as such the soils contain a higher percentage of 
coarse clasts (especially boulders), with sand dominating 
the fine fraction of almost every soil. Dr. Elliott-Fisk 
notes that small sections of the upper stream basins of 
Sulphur Canyon and the Spring Mountain region contain the 
massive Franciscan marine sandstone and conglomerate, with 
its affiliated volcanic and metamorphic inclusions. The 
lithology of the fine clasts that compose the alluvial fans 
in this immediate region (i.e., Sulphur Creek fan) include a 
higher portion of non-volcanic clasts (up to 15 percent, to 
occasionally 30 percent) than alluvial fans to the north, 
such as the Ritchie Creek fan below Diamond Mountain, 
located largely north of the proposed northern St. Helena 
viticultural area boundary. However, the percentage of 
non-volcanic clasts is much higher to the south of the St. 
Helena viticultural area (i.e., Bear Canyon fan). The lower 
toe-slopes of the mountain slopes in the St. Helena area (below the 400-foot elevation) contain both Xerolls and 
Xeralfs, depending on slope stability and age. 
 Dr. Elliott-Fisk states that she has excavated an 
additional 17 soil trenches in the process of her scientific 
investigation in this area. She states that she has done 
previous soils work in this region and has excavated over 
350 soil trenches in Napa Valley. She has provided, as part 
of the petition, profile drawings, descriptive field, and 
analytical laboratory data for 17 soils by horizon. Four of 
these soils are from property outside of the proposed 
boundaries of the St. Helena viticultural area and were 
chosen to be representative of those areas. 


Soil Summary 
 

The soils of the proposed St. Helena viticultural area, 
according to the petition, are deep alluvial soils of 
moderate age, with well-formed horizonation, textural B 
horizons, sandy clay loam to clay loam textures, reddish 
colors, high gravel content (primarily of cobbles), and near 
neutral pH. In this erosional zone of the valley floor, 
where the width is restricted, groundwater and the 
groundwater table have a significant influence, bringing in 
additional dissolved minerals and increasing the pH (and 
nutritional content) above the valley floor soils to the 
north (Calistoga region) and south (Rutherford and 
Oakville), as well as the hillsides (Spring Mountain, Diamond Mountain, Howell Mountain and Pritchard Hill). The

soil drainage in the St. Helena area is typically good since 
the water table drops in the spring, summer and fall to 
allow the vines an adequate root zone with free oxygen and 
carbon dioxide, thus providing vigorous conditions for grape 
growing. The moderate climate, with warm summer 
temperature, balances well with this soil environment, and 
allows the wine grower to manipulate the vines to extract 
what the winemaker desires from a particular varietal. As 
such, Dr. Elliott-Fisk concludes that this provides a stable 
and predictable environment for grape growing, and the 
physical geography of the region has promoted the production 
of fine wines in the St. Helena area for many decades. 


Conclusion 
 

According to the petitioner, the proposed St. Helena 
viticultural area is uniform topographically and can be 
distinguished from the steeper hillsides to the east (Howell 
Mountain) and west (Spring Mountain District) as well as 
from the valley floor areas to the south (Rutherford) and 
north (Calistoga). This is an area where the valley floor 
narrows from around 19,000 feet at Oakville Cross Road and 
11,000 feet at Zinfandel Lane to around 3,500 feet at Lodi 
Lane and Bale Lane. The area is marked by a uniform, steep 
gradient and significant river erosion. The bedrock geology 
is primarily volcanic, in contrast to the sedimentary soils 
to the south.

The petitioner states that along the eastern edge of 
the proposed St. Helena area, geologic and geographic 
evidence support the inclusion of Spring Valley and Pratt 
Valley and the exclusion of Conn Valley and the higher 
mountain slopes. 


Proposed Boundary 
 

The boundary of the proposed St. Helena viticultural 
area may be found on three United States Geological Survey 
(U.S.G.S.) maps with a scale of 1:24,000. The boundary is 
described in proposed  9.149. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 
 

The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 
Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320, do not apply to 
this notice of proposed rulemaking because no requirement to 
collect information is proposed. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 
 

It is hereby certified that this proposed regulation 
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The establishment of a 
viticultural area is neither an endorsement nor approval by 
ATF of the quality of wine produced in the area, but rather 
an identification of an area that is distinct from 
surrounding areas. ATF believes that the establishment of 
viticultural areas merely allows wineries to more accurately 
describe the origin of their wines to consumers, and helps 
consumers identify the wines they purchase. Thus, any 
benefit derived from the use of a viticultural area name is 
the result of the proprietor's own efforts and consumer 
acceptance of wines from that region. 
 Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
required because the proposal, if promulgated as a final 
rule, is not expected (1) to have significant secondary, or 
incidental effects on a substantial number of small 
entities; or (2) to impose, or otherwise cause a significant 
increase in the reporting, recordkeeping, or other 
compliance burdens on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12866 
 

It has been determined that this proposed regulation is 
not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive 
Order 12866. Accordingly, this proposal is not subject to 
the analysis required by this Executive Order. 


Public Participation 
 

ATF requests comments from all interested parties. 
Comments received on or before the closing date will be 
carefully considered. Comments received after that date 
will be given the same consideration if it is practical to 
do so, but assurance of consideration cannot be given except 
as to comments received on or before the closing date. 
ATF will not recognize any comment as confidential. 
Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any material which 
a commenter considers to be confidential or inappropriate 
for disclosure to the public should not be included in the 
comment. The name of the person submitting a comment is not 
exempt from disclosure. During the comment period, any 
person may request an opportunity to present oral testimony 
at a public hearing. However, the Director reserves the 
right to determine, in light of all circumstances, whether a 
public hearing will be held.

Standards for Damage Stability of New Domestic Passenger Vessels


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting; re-opening of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855), the Coast Guard proposed to amend the rules, on standards for damage stability, that
it adopted on December 10, 1992. Amended rules are necessary to relieve certain vessels of an unforeseen regulatory
burden. The proposed rules would relieve those vessels of that burden and yet minimize the potential for capsizing
and other casualties caused by inadequate damage stability. To obtain further information from members of the regulated
community and the general public, the Coast Guard will conduct a second public meeting and re-open the comment period
on the amended rules.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments


The comment period for the amended rules is being extended to allow sufficient time for the public to review the report
of the Department of Transportation Volpe Transportation Systems Center on the effect of the new damage stability
rules on the domestic passenger vessel fleet. This detailed analysis of twenty-one domestic vessel designs was released
in late September 1994, and a copy has been placed in this docket. Information on obtaining a copy of this report may
be obtained by contacting the person listed above under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

.
This notice extends the period for submission of comments on the proposed changes to 46 CFR 171.080(e) described in
the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published on August 10, 1994 (59 FR 40855). It is the Coast Guard's goal to implement
regulations that will best address both the safety and the operational needs of all vessels. These standards were
based on one developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for any passenger vessel allowed to carry
12 or more passengers on an international voyage (under a ``SOLAS Passenger Ship Certificate'').
The Coast Guard again seeks advice from owners and operators of vessels and shipyards, and from naval architects,
its own inspectors, classification societies' inspectors, consumers, crews of vessels, and others involved in
the affected vessels' compliance with  171.080(e) as this proposed rule would amend it. Interested persons
are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written data views and arguments.
Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice [CGD 94-010],
identify the specific paragraph of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or
sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. The Coast Guard will acknowledge receipt of comments if
a stamped, self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments.


Public Meeting Date


The Coast Guard has determined that the opportunity to make further oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process
and will hold a second public meeting from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on December 1, 1994, in room 2415 of Coast Guard Headquarters,
Washington, DC 20593-0001. With advance notice, and as time permits, members of the public may make oral presentations
during the meeting. Persons wishing to make oral presentations should notify the person listed above under the 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

no later than the day before the meeting. Written material may be submitted prior to, during, or after the meeting.

Financial Reporting Requirements and Rate of Return Methodology in the Domestic Offshore Trades


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Maritime Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking; reply comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission is seeking reply comments to its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning financial reporting requirements
and the rate of return methodology in the domestic offshore trades. The Commission has received seven comments on
the proposed rule which have raised issues which require further comment. Comments are requested on, and are to be
limited to, the calculation of the cost of capital, working capital, the selection of proxy groups, and the deletion
of alternative methodologies.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 7, 1994, the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'' or ``Commission'') published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(``NPR'') (59 FR 16592) which proposed to amend its regulations governing financial reporting requirements and
rate of return methodology applicable to vessel-operating common carriers by water in the domestic offshore trades.
Among other things, the proposed rule would change the method of determining the reasonableness of a carrier's return
on rate base from the comparable earnings test to the weighted average cost of capital methodology. At the request
of Matson Navigation Company, the Commission extended the comment period for interested parties to file until July
20, 1994 (59 FR 27002). Seven parties filed comments on the NPR. Commenters include: American President Lines (``APL''),
Crowley Maritime Corporation (``Crowley''), Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (``Matson''), Puerto Rico Maritime
Shipping Authority (``PRMSA''), United States Department of Transportation (``DOT''), Marsoft Incorporated
(``Marsoft''), and the State of Hawaii (``Hawaii'').


Based on its review of the comments, the Commission has determined that reply comments on four issues would be beneficial.
In order that the Commission have the most complete information available to enable it to make an informed judgment
in these matters, interested persons are invited to submit comments on the issues discussed below.


Issue 1: Calculation of the Cost of Capital


PRMSA addresses the issue of the calculation of the before-tax weighted average cost of capital (``BTWACC'') and
its relationship to the projected rate of return on rate base. PRMSA states that the formula for the BTWACC contained
in the proposed rule is correct.
 PRMSA asserts, however, that since the projected rate of return in the proposed rule is computed on an after-tax basis_with
return on rate base being computed by dividing net income plus interest expense by the trade rate base_the proposed
before-tax weighted average cost of capital is being compared to the after-tax projected return on rate base. PRMSA
suggests, therefore, that either the weighted average cost of capital should be changed to an after-tax basis so it
can be compared to the after-tax projected return on trade rate base currently specified, or the BTWACC should be retained
and the projected return on trade rate base should be changed to a before-tax basis.






PRMSA's comments appear to have merit. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to retain the before-tax weighted
average cost of capital contained in the proposed rule and change the calculation of the projected rate of return on
rate base to a before-tax basis. Retention of the BTWACC seems appropriate because it is employed by a large majority
of regulatory commissions. The before-tax weighted average cost of capital would be calculated as it is in the proposed
rule. However, the projected rate of return on rate base stated in the proposed rule would be changed to:








The Commission thus proposes to amend section 552.6(d)(2) to read:

(2) 

Return on Rate Base.

 The return on rate base will be computed by 

dividing

 Trade net income 

plus 

interest expense 

plus

 provision for income taxes 

by 

Trade rate base.

The Commission requests comments on this amendment to the proposed rule.


Issue 2: Working Capital



The proposed rule adopted Hawaii's suggestion in FMC Docket No. 91-51, 

Financial Reports of Common Carriers by Water in the Domestic Offshore Trades, 

that insurance expense be treated in the same manner as other operating expenses in calculating working capital,
i.e., include that amount applicable to the duration of an average voyage. In its comments on this proposed rule, Hawaii
suggests an additional modification of the calculation of working capital, namely, the exclusion of interest expense.

<TEXT>
 

In support of its proposal, Hawaii states that interest expense is a source of working capital funds, and is not paid
to the bond holder until after related revenue is received. Hawaii concludes, therefore, that interest expense does
not create a need for working capital. Comments are requested on the validity of the proposal to exclude interest expense
from the calculation of working capital.



Issue 3: The Selection of Proxy Groups



A number of parties commented on the selection of the proxy group. Hawaii indicates a concern with the criteria prescribed
in selecting a comparable group of companies when the proxy group is used in determining the cost of common-stock equity.
Hawaii believes that the companies in the 

Value Line Investment Survey 

which satisfy the Commission's criteria for the proxy group do not have business risks similar to those of Matson.
Hawaii claims that these companies are generally consolidated companies; are not dominant in their trades; and do
not have statutory barriers to entry.
Marsoft states that according to its research only three marine transportation companies and four trucking companies
meet the proposed guidelines for the proxy group. Marsoft does not believe that airlines, railroads, or full-load
trucking companies should be included in the proxy group, because they do not provide comparable services. Marsoft
states that in many cases large, geographically and operationally diverse companies will be compared to small, highly
specialized private carriers. Marsoft believes that the comparison may not be credible in some cases.

PRMSA comments that the proxy group should not be restricted to the freight transportation business. PRMSA asserts
that equity capital in the regulated carrier competes against the broad spectrum of companies in the economy, not
just against companies involved in freight transportation. The nature of a business is said to be only one ingredient
of business risk, not the sole determinant. PRMSA notes that as of June 1994, there were a total of 39 companies listed
in 

Value Line Investment Survey 

which were involved in air transport, trucking, maritime, and railroading. Allegedly, not all of these companies
were involved in freight transportation as required by the proposed rule. PRMSA concludes from this that the potential
list of comparable companies is highly limited.

Under the proposed rule, the proxy group is selected from companies which operate and derive a major portion of their
gross revenues primarily as common carriers in the business of freight transportation, and own and operate transportation
vehicles or vessels. The Commission requests specific suggestions on industries other than freight transportation
covered by the 

Value Line Investment Survey 

which have business and financial risks similar to those of the domestic carriers that may be added to the current proxy
group criteria.



Issue 4: Deletion of Alternative Methodologies


The proposed rule revises paragraph (b) of section 552.1 by deleting the provision that the methodology employed
in each case will depend on the nature of the relevant carrier's operations and financial structure. Also, the proposed
rule adds language to that paragraph that specifies the extent of possible alternative methodologies. Paragraph
(b) reads:




(b) In evaluating the reasonableness of a VOCC's overall level of rates, the Commission will use return on rate base
as its primary standard. A carrier's allowable rate of return on rate base will be set equal to its before-tax weighted
average cost of capital. However, the Commission may also employ the other financial methodologies set forth in  552.6(f)
in order to achieve a fair and reasonable result.




Paragraph (d) of the same section has been deleted. That paragraph provided that the Commission may use some other
basis for allocation and calculation and may consider other operational factors in any instance where it is deemed
necessary to achieve a fair and reasonable result.

APL informs that these provisions are at the heart of a major dispute in FMC Docket No. 89-26, 

The Government of the Territory of Guam, et al. 

v. 

Sea-Land Service, Inc. and American President Lines, Ltd. 

It points out that the NPR does not give any reasons for the proposed changes to section 552.1 and contends that the changes
cannot be legally adopted unless and until the FMC identifies its reasons for such a change and allows opportunity
for comment.

In the abbreviated comments it did provide, APL contends that the proposed changes can have no substantive effect
on a pending complaint docket focused on a prior time period. APL further urges the Commission to ``make clear, as a
general matter, that its decision in the prospective rulemaking proceeding is not intended to pre-judge issues in
the retrospective complaint proceeding.'' APL contends that sections 552.1(b) and 552.1(d) merely make explicit
an agency's authority that is implicit in any regulatory scheme. Further, APL questions why the FMC would want to amend
a regulation in a way that might imply that it was denying itself the ability to do something necessary to achieve a fair
and reasonable result.

The Guam trade is unique in that the trade is a very small portion of the carriers' overall service. However, whether
the current method of allocation is appropriate in such a case need not be decided here, because the two carriers serving
Guam, APL and Sea-Land Service, Inc., currently file most, if not all, of their rates with the Interstate Commerce
Commission. Neither carrier files full financial reports under 46 CFR Part 552. In the event an FMC-regulated carrier
initiates such a service in the future, the Commission will address the need for any change in 46 CFR Part 552 in a separate
rulemaking proceeding. Paragraph (d) was eliminated because the Commission did not want such determinations to
be made on an 

ad hoc

 basis during a rate investigation. It is essential that significant issues relating to the underlying methodology
to be employed in determining the reasonableness of rates be settled prior to any rate investigation. The 180-day
limit specified by section 3 of the Shipping Act, 1933, 46 U.S.C. app. 845, cannot be met if parties are permitted to
change methodologies during the course of a rate case. Moreover, it is unfair; parties to a rate proceeding are entitled
to rely on the Commission's rules. They should not have to respond to ever-changing methodologies proposed by other
parties.

It is understandable that APL is concerned that the Commission's decision here may affect the outcome in Docket No.
89-26. However, any changes that may be made to Part 552 as a result of this proceeding will only be applied prospectively.
They will have no application in pending cases such as Docket No. 89-26.

 Notice of decision on U.S. submissions to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora (CITES or Convention) regulates international trade in certain 
animals and plants. Species for which trade is controlled are listed in 
Appendices I, II, and III to CITES. The United States as a Party to the 
Convention may (1) propose amendments to the appendices for consideration by 
the other Parties at the biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties, 
(2) submit topics for inclusion in the agenda of these meetings, and (3) 
submit resolutions to improve the implementation of the Convention for 
consideration at these meetings. 



In this notice, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces 
the species proposals to amend Appendices I and II, agenda items, and 
resolutions submitted by the United States for consideration at the ninth 
regular meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (COP9) scheduled for 
November 7-18, 1994, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild 
Fauna and Flora, hereinafter referred to as CITES or the Convention, is an 
international treaty designed to control and regulate international trade in 
certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with 
extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the Convention. Currently, 122 
countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. The Convention 
calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties that review its 
implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland 
to carry out its functions, consider amendments to the list of species in 
Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make 
recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention. COP9 will 
be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, November 7-18, 1994. 

This is part of a series of notices that, together with public meetings, 
encourage the public to participate in the development of the U.S. positions 
for COP9. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38112), 
requested information and comments from the public on animal or plant species 
the United States might consider as possible amendments to the Appendices. A 


Federal Register

 notice published on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60873), 
requested public comments on possible revisions to the criteria for listing 
species in the CITES Appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on 
January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832) requested additional comments from the public on 
animal or plant species that the United States was considering submitting as 
proposed amendments to the Appendices. A 

Federal Register

 notice published on 
January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4096): (1) Published the time and place for COP9; (2) 
announced a public meeting for February 22, 1994, to discuss the 31st meeting 
of the CITES Standing Committee; (3) detailed the provisional agenda for COP9; 
and (4) requested information and comments from the public on possible COP9 
agenda items and resolutions that the United States might submit. The 
Service's regulations governing this public process are found in Title 50 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations   23.31-23.39. 

After review of public comments and all available information, the 
proposals, agenda items, and draft resolutions announced in this notice were 
submitted by the Service and received by the Convention's Secretariat on June 
10, 1994, the deadline for consideration at COP9.

Any proposed amendments to the Appendices adopted by the Parties will become effective on February 16, 1995, unless
the United States enters a 
reservation before that time. The Service will publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement such amendments.




Public Comments and Decisions on Possible Species Proposals 



Decisions about suggested U.S. proposals discussed in the previous 
notice of January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832) are as follows: 



Species Proposals Not Submitted 



1. Narwhal (

Monodon monoceros

). The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) 
proposed that the narwhal be transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I of 
CITES. The range of the narwhal is circumpolar in Arctic waters, mostly north 
of 65 degrees North Latitude, although it occurs in greater densities in 
waters north of the Atlantic than in waters north of the Pacific Ocean. There 
is some north-south seasonal movement in response to climate and ice 
development. Between Canada and Greenland, narwhals summer in high densities 
in the eastern Canadian Arctic and off northwest Greenland, with smaller 
summering groups occurring in many other locations. Narwhals also occur in 
some concentration along the east coast of Greenland. There is evidence 
suggesting that the populations on the east and west coasts of Greenland 
belong to separate stocks. 

Three populations of narwhals were reviewed in 1992 by the Small Cetacean 
Sub-Committee of the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC): (1) Hudson Bay, including northern Hudson Bay and western 
Hudson Strait; (2) Baffin Bay, including the eastern Canadian Arctic 
Archipelago and western Greenland; and (3) East Greenland and the Barents Sea. 
The Hudson Bay stock has been conservatively estimated at 1300 animals. The 
Small Cetacean Sub-Committee estimated the Baffin Bay stock at 27,580 to 
42,520. No good estimates are available for the East Greenland/Barents Sea 
population, although it is considerably smaller than the other stocks. 
Relatively small numbers of narwhals are reported from other parts of the 
species' range. Because of the difficulty in surveying narwhals, most 
abundance estimates for the species have large variances and require careful 
interpretation. 

Narwhals are hunted for maktag (blubber/skin), meat, and their tusks. 
Maktag is consumed by the Inuit, and meat is (or has been in the past) used as 
dog food, although both commodities are also sold on a limited basis. The 
tusks are utilized domestically for carving, and are sold as souvenirs, either 
as carved products or as intact tusks. (Females only occasionally develop 
tusks.) The majority of tusks taken in Canadian waters apparently remain in 
the country, while the bulk of narwhal ivory taken in Greenland is shipped to 
Denmark (perhaps as much as 90 percent annually) where much is exported to 
other countries in the European Union (EU). 

In 1976, Canada imposed quotas on the take of narwhals, which it 
regulates by issuing tags to be affixed to each animal taken. Tusks from 
these animals that enter trade must have the tag attached to show that the 
animal from which it was removed was legally taken under the quota system. 
The Greenland Home Rule Government sets no quotas for narwhals and no tracking 
except for those animals that enter international trade, and, therefore, 
require CITES permits. Since 1985 Greenland has not been a member of the EU, 
therefore a no detriment finding is necessary for the issuance of CITES export 
permits by the Greenland Home Rule Government, and for import permits by EU 
countries under EU regulations, even though the narwhal is an Appendix II 
species. However, Greenland sets restrictions on who is allowed to hunt and 
the manner in which hunts are conducted. 

Eight comments were received during the comment period, five favoring 
amending the listing of narwhal from Appendix II to Appendix I, and three 
opposed to this change. 

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation (SAPL), The Humane Society 
of the United States (HSUS), the American Humane Association (AHA), the 
Defenders of Wildlife (Defenders), and EIA all expressed support for an 
Appendix I listing of the narwhal. 

The HSUS indicated that Canada and Greenland continue to hunt narwhals 
and export tusks in large numbers (Greenland being the largest exporter), and 
that the annual net trade in tusks nearly doubled from 1985-1990. (Prior to 
1985 when Greenland began issuing its own CITES export permits, the movement 
of tusks from Greenland to Denmark was not considered international trade, 
therefore pre- and post-1985 trade figures cannot be compared equally). They 
also state that trade figures do not reflect the total numbers of narwhals 
taken because for each actual take there are three to four injured or killed 
animals lost. Even though information is limited, HSUS believe that 
reproductive rates among narwhals is low, and that in 1981 the world 
population was estimated at approximately 20,000 animals and declining. HSUS 
asserted that narwhals should be listed in Appendix I as a precautionary 
measure because status information is limited, information on reproduction and 
natural mortality is lacking, and information on actual numbers hunted is 
unavailable.

The AHA indicated that new export markets have caused narwhal ivory 
prices to increase in Canada following a price decline in the mid-1980's, 
which has returned ivory prices to about the same prices as existed in the 
early 1980's. This increase in the price of narwhal ivory prices has 
suggested that ivory rather than maktag and meat has become the basis of 
modern hunting in eastern Canada. AHA noted that take quotas have not been 
imposed by Greenland, and that there are no controls on trade in ivory. 
However, as previously mentioned, since 1985 a no detriment finding is 
necessary for the issuance of CITES export permits by Greenland and for an 
import permit by Denmark. 

Defenders also asserted that the prime motivation for the take of narwhal 
in recent years has been the ivory, stimulated by new export markets and a 
resurgence in the price of ivory since the mid-1980's, which has biased take 
to the adult males. They feel that this could jeopardize narwhal population 
structure by the removal of a larger number of males. They contended that the 
current CITES listing of the narwhal in Appendix II does not provide adequate 
monitoring of take because there is not a substantial domestic market for 
narwhal tusks in Canada, and yet export permits were issued for fewer than 
half the tusks obtained in Canadian narwhal hunts between 1975 and 1990. From 
this, Defenders concluded that a large number of tusks must have been exported 
without CITES permits, but presented no evidence for this conclusion. 
Therefore, due to the uncertainty and concern surrounding the catch levels of 
narwhals for the ivory market, Defenders supported an Appendix I listing. 

The EIA submitted comments that supported their original proposal that 
the narwhal be included in Appendix I. They provided an estimate of 28,000 
narwhal in the combined Canada-Greenland High Arctic population. They 
discussed the utilization of maktag and meat, the demand for narwhal ivory in 
Canada, and the export of Greenland ivory to Denmark and on into the EU. The 
decline in ivory prices of the early 1980's has, according to EIA, now 
returned to about those same levels. EIA pointed out the absence of quotas on 
take of narwhal in Greenland, suggested that the application of quotas in 
Canada is inadequate, and that the number of narwhal taken does not reflect 
actual take numbers because of the loss of wounded or killed animals before 
they are landed. They also pointed out the difficulty of assessing the 
relationship between the market demand for ivory and hunting intensity. EIA 
believed that additional information on life history, distribution, abundance, 
and hunting loss rates was needed to assess the stocks and the impacts of 
trade in the various parts derived from narwhal in order to properly manage 
the stocks. 

The Greenland Home Rule Government and the Fisheries Agency of Japan 
(FAJ) objected to transferring the narwhal to Appendix I. Greenland did not 
agree that narwhals should be placed in Appendix I due to unsustainable 
hunting pressures caused by the international trade in narwhal ivory. They 
argued that recent population estimates did not adequately take into account 
submerged whales, which would give corrected estimates sufficient to sustain 
hunting pressures greater than current harvest levels. They also maintained 
that low levels of ivory export reported for Greenland before 1985 are 
partially an artifact of the change in their political designation at that 
time, prior to which the shipment of ivory to Denmark was not considered as an 
export. They noted that, even though there are no catch quotas for Greenland, 
there are strict regulations on catch reporting, vessel sizes, etc., and that 
there are two reserve areas in Greenland waters where narwhal are protected. 
Generally, the FAJ felt that a listing in Appendix I should be based only on 
scientific evidence that there is a threat to extinction and that trade 
control is necessary for the protection of the species. Furthermore, the FAJ 
noted that the narwhal is already in Appendix II, providing some control of 
trade and a mechanism for collecting trade data, and that in the absence of 
new information indicating a deterioration in the status of the species there 
is no need for consideration of a change to Appendix I. 

The Government of Canada also does not agree with an Appendix I proposal 
for the narwhal. They feel that recent estimates of the Canadian High Arctic 
stocks are low by as much as 50 percent due to an underestimation of the time 
narwhals spend under water (as indicated in the 1992 Report of the Sub- 
Committee on Small Cetaceans of the International Whaling Commission), and 
that this larger population size can sustain current catch levels. They also 
feel that their catch quotas are adequate. 

The U.S. Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) does not support an Appendix I 
listing for the narwhal at this time, but noted that Canada and Greenland 
should be encouraged to obtain additional and better information on the status 
and trends of narwhal stocks, and on harvest levels (particularly regarding 
animals that are struck and lost during hunting).

In developing its position, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) took note of the continuing question about
the sustainability of the take of narwhal, particularly noting the difficulties in obtaining data, such as population
levels, catch levels and loss rates, and in obtaining trade data for narwhals. Because of this uncertainty, NMFS decided
not to recommend that the United States propose this species for Appendix I. The Service assessed all information
available and concluded that there was no sufficient information to support listing this species in Appendix I. The
United States will continue to monitor information on this species as it becomes available in order to better assess
possible recommendations at a later date. 
2. Musk deer (

Moschus 

species). The EIA requested that the Service propose including all species in the genus 

Moschus 

in Appendix I. There are at least four species in the genus, which is widely distributed across eastern and central
Asia. Currently all 

Moschus 

species are included in Appendix II except those populations in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, India, Nepal, and Pakistan,
which are included in Appendix I. Musk deer were listed in the Appendices due to the trade in musk, a substance taken
from the musk gland of the male and used in traditional medicines in Asia and in the manufacture of perfumes. 
Five comments were received in response to the January 27, 1994, 

Federal Register 

notice. Four commenters (including SAPL) favored the transfer of all Appendix II populations of musk deer to Appendix
I. TRAFFIC USA, while neither supporting nor opposing an Appendix I listing, relayed information from TRAFFIC France
that the French perfume industry is using a synthetic musk in some cases, but that France continues to import 5 to 15
kilograms of musk per year, primarily from the Russian Federation. The AHA suggested that musk deer ``farming'' operations
in China are inadequate to satisfy demands for musk, and that the existence of a legal musk trade creates a loophole
for illegal trade. Defenders and HSUS reiterated this claim. The AHA stated that current levels of exploitation of
musk deer in Russia, China and the Himalayas are reported to be unsustainable. Defenders reported that the price of
musk in Hong Kong can be as high as US$84,000 to US$119,000 per kilogram. They also indicated that there is not much information
available on population numbers of musk deer, but that it is known that illegal and undocumented trade in musk is occurring.
They state that, ``Estimates indicate that some populations have been halved during the past five years due to uncontrolled
hunting,'' but no specific information or documented reports were provided. The HSUS noted the high cost of musk,
and stated that this has led to wide-scale poaching of musk deer. They also reported that an 80 percent decline has occurred
in one population of musk deer in Russia. The HSUS claimed that in China musk deer populations are declining rapidly
due to over-exploitation. 
Comments received provided little additional or substantive information on the distribution and status of musk
deer, or on international trade in musk, aside from anecdotal reports of increased poaching and the high cost of musk.
The People's Republic of China claims that there are 500,000 to 1 million musk deer in China, and plans a comprehensive
survey. Russia indicated there are about 150,000 musk deer in Russia, and harvests are not allowed in areas where populations
are decreasing. In Russia, musk deer are protected in 18 reserves and other federal and local preserves, and the Sakhalin
musk deer is listed in the Red Data Book. Based on these protective measures, the Russian Management Authority felt
that it is premature to amend the listing of the musk deer to Appendix I. Mongolia provided conflicting remarks; they
indicated support for an Appendix I listing of the musk deer in their cover letter, but in their attached discussion
of the species they stated that the Mongolian musk deer should be kept in Appendix II. 
The Service does not believe that population or trend data are sufficient to support a proposal to transfer the Appendix
II populations of musk deer to Appendix I, and did not submit such a proposal. 
3. Copperbelly water snake (

Nerodia erythrogaster

). The Service has proposed to list the northern subspecies of the copperbelly water snake, 

N. e. neglecta

, as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, 58 FR 43860 (August 18, 1993). The species is restricted
to the lower Ohio River Valley and the lower Wabash River Valley in Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky, and in southern
Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. There have been recent population declines and it now exists in isolated pockets of suitable
habitat. 
Only the HSUS provided comments, and supported the listing of the species in Appendix II. Although the proposed rule
suggested that removal from the wild by amateur collectors posed some threat to this species, no additional information
on trade in the species was received, and existing reports of international trade are several years old. Therefore,
on the basis of this record the Service is not persuaded that the available information on trade would warrant a proposal
to include this species in Appendix II. 
4. Bluefin tuna (

Thunnus thynnus

). The Service received a draft proposal from ICCAT Watch, a coalition consisting of the National Audubon Society
(NAS), the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC), and the World Wildlife Fund- US (WWF-US), to list the bluefin tuna
throughout the Atlantic Ocean on Appendix II and additionally, the western Atlantic population on Appendix I. Later,
ICCAT Watch withdrew its request to list the western Atlantic population in Appendix I.

The January 27, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice gave current information about the Atlantic bluefin tuna including management by the International Commission
on the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), recent stock assessments for the western and eastern stocks, recent
estimates of fishing mortality rates, reductions in harvest quotas recommended at the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT
for the years 1994 and 1995, and plans for the implementation of a Bluefin Statistical Document to be required for the
import of bluefin tuna by ICCAT countries. The next Regular Meeting of ICCAT will be held in December 1994. 
It was noted in the FR notice that according to the Standing Committee on Research and Statistics of ICCAT (SCRS) and
NMFS scientists there is uncertainty about an appropriate boundary between the western and eastern populations
of bluefin tuna. At the request of the Department of Commerce, the National Academy of Sciences has conducted an independent
review on the ``Scientific Basis of Management of the Fisheries for Atlantic Bluefin Tuna,'' which evaluated information
on stock structure as well as recent population assessments. The report was presented to the Department of Commerce
on August 31, 1994. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has named a team of experts to evaluate
the findings and make recommendations about policy and management issues. 
Within the comment period, the Service received a total of 83 comments on the possible CITES listing of this species
from the general public, commercial and recreational fishers and fishing organizations, conservation organizations,
and foreign governments. Of these, 73 supported a listing of the Atlantic bluefin tuna in Appendix II, 8 opposed any
listing under CITES, and 2 did not specifically oppose or support a listing. (Comments from the Russian Government
were received after the comment period closed.) 
The Executive Secretary of ICCAT conveyed the comments of the Chairman of ICCAT. While not commenting on the appropriateness
of a CITES listing, the Chairman drew attention to steps that ICCAT had recently taken to improve the conservation
of Atlantic bluefin tuna, including: 
1. Drastically reducing the allowable catch for western Atlantic bluefin tuna; 
2. Introducing an effective measure for monitoring international trade through the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document
Program; 
3. Undertaking or developing other methods to improve data collection; 
4. Encouraging expansion of research and analysis with a goal of having the basis to develop a program at the Commission
meeting in 1995 aimed at achieving a 50 percent increase from current levels in the spawning stock biomass of the western
stock by the year 2008; and 
5. Adopting an amendment to ICCAT that would allow the European Union to be a Contracting Party to ICCAT and hence expand
the number of countries adhering to the ICCAT recommendations. 
Commenters opposed to an Appendix II listing for Atlantic bluefin tuna (including the Global Guardian Trust, the
National Fisheries Institute, Inc., and the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations) generally believed
that measures recommended by ICCAT are being implemented according to schedule, and that the steps taken by ICCAT
represent significant progress in improving reporting requirements and management measures. Therefore, they
felt that it is not necessary or appropriate to consider a CITES listing until the effectiveness of these steps can
be evaluated. 
The Japan Fisheries Association contended that international organizations for the management of living resources,
such as ICCAT, are designed to conserve and manage resources that are at higher stock levels than are resources that
would be listed under CITES, and that species listed under CITES are being protected from possible ``extinction.''
Therefore, they believe that listing species such as the Atlantic bluefin tuna under CITES would require a digression
from the objectives of CITES, and would also go against ``the principle of sustainable development.'' 
The Federation of Japan Tuna Fisheries Cooperative Associations felt that a CITES listing of Atlantic bluefin tuna
would not ensure its conservation because CITES does not have authority to limit harvest. They suggested that no conclusions
should be drawn concerning the status of the species until a peer review of information about the existence of two stocks
of Atlantic bluefin tuna is completed. The Federation also contends that the species is not currently threatened
with extinction, nor is it likely to become so, therefore it does not meet criteria for listing under CITES. 
The East Coast Tuna Association maintained that recent assessments and future projections concerning the western
stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna are ``extraordinarily controversial,'' to the extent that the NMFS has requested
the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a peer review of data and information supporting these assessments as
well as the two-stock hypothesis. They believed that a CITES listing would be redundant and would likely penalize
only those fishermen who now participate in the ICCAT program. 
The FAJ felt that it is essential that any CITES listing be based on scientific evidence that there is a threat of extinction
to a species and that trade control is necessary for the protection of the species. They contended that a species should
not be listed only for the purpose of collecting trade data, especially if an international organization is already
collecting such data. They believed that an Appendix II listing of Atlantic bluefin tuna would impose undue burdens
on the enforcement capabilities of many countries. They also state that protection of wildlife cannot be accomplished
through regulation of trade alone, but harvesting should be regulated, and that CITES is not capable of harvest regulation.
Also, they believed that the interests of range states should be considered based on consultations, and range states
have not been contacted. The First Secretary (Fisheries), Embassy of Japan, essentially supported these contentions.

As an ICCAT member, the Russian Ministry of Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources felt that ICCAT's
regulation of take by annual quota and the Statistical Documentation Program provide strict controls for use of the
Atlantic bluefin tuna. They also did not think that the species is threatened with extinction and therefore was not
eligible for a CITES listing.

TRAFFIC USA submitted a detailed analysis of international trade in all species of bluefin tuna, including species
not recommended in the proposal for listing. The data indicated that a large quantity of bluefin tuna is traded by countries
that are not parties to ICCAT, although not all the bluefin tuna analyzed by the document are caught in the Atlantic.
However, the basis for this analysis was import data from three countries that report customs data in a uniform way,
Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. Although Japan is identified in the report as importing the majority of
bluefin tuna (perhaps two-thirds), statistics for other major consuming nations, including some non-ICCAT countries,
are not available.
The NAS felt that adding Atlantic bluefin tuna to Appendix II would help provide information needed for population
assessment models and effective management, but would not alter or reduce current traffic in tuna. Although they
were encouraged by ICCAT's catch-quota recommendations, they were discouraged by the lack of data from non-ICCAT
countries, such as Italy and Mexico. They believe that a CITES listing would elicit data from non-ICCAT countries,
which would facilitate assessment of fishing by non-ICCAT countries, particularly in spawning areas. The Wisconsin
Audubon Council, the Audubon Council of New York State, the Napa-Solano Audubon Society, the Cape Arago Audubon Society,
the New York Sportfishing Federation, ICCAT Watch, the New York Zoological Society, Environment Liaison Centre
International, the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association, the HSUS, Defenders, the CMC, and the EIA all reiterated
these sentiments. The Animal Protection Institute indicated a lack of faith in ICCAT's ability to manage the Atlantic
bluefin tuna, and felt that a CITES listing would provide a better opportunity to monitor the effects of trade, especially
because it would include all non-ICCAT countries.
NMFS does not believe that Atlantic bluefin tuna should be proposed for inclusion in Appendix II of CITES at this time,
and has concluded that ICCAT members should be given adequate time to implement appropriate fishery controls, to
implement fully the Bluefin Statistical Document Program, and to develop procedures for the use of enforcement-enhancing
trade measures with respect to ICCAT's conservation program. After that time the incremental benefits of a CITES
listing could be assessed. NMFS feels that preliminary analysis of data collected through the Bluefin Tuna Statistical
Document will allow evaluation of the effectiveness of this program in calculating and monitoring trade in Atlantic
bluefin tuna.
Given the possibility of ecological extinction, and/or the vulnerability to significant population losses due
to trade or overexploitation, the Atlantic bluefin tuna would qualify biologically for listing in Appendix II of
CITES. However, based on available information on management measures to conserve the species, the Service believes
that a listing should not be proposed at this time. Significant quota reductions have occurred in 1994 and additional
reductions are planned for 1995. The eastern Atlantic population of bluefin tuna appears to be more productive than
its western counterpart. Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna mature at about age 5 while western Atlantic bluefin tuna
reach maturity at about age 8, and recruitment is relatively much higher in the eastern Atlantic. However, fishing
mortality rates on immature fish in the eastern Atlantic are exceedingly high, with 30-60 percent of the landings
in recent years comprising fish less than the minimum size of 6.4 kg. recommended by ICCAT in 1975. The most recent estimate
of a overall fishing mortality is 4-6 times the levels that would be expected to produce the maximum sustainable
yield. An assessment of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stocks is scheduled by the SCRS in preparation for
discussions at the 1994 Regular Meeting of ICCAT.
Implementation of the Statistical Document Program now required for all imports into ICCAT countries will provide
more information on Atlantic bluefin tuna harvests than would CITES certificates or export permits, although ICCAT
has not yet required the collection of such information for imports/landings in non-ICCAT countries. Harvest information
would be further enhanced if non-ICCAT countries, and the European Union, became members.
The decision of the Service to forgo proposing a CITES listing is significantly influenced by the Atlantic bluefin
tuna conservation measures adopted at the 1993 annual ICCAT meeting in Madrid. In opposing the listing of the Atlantic
bluefin tuna at the 1992 CITES meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP8) in Kyoto, Japan, representatives for
ICCAT argued that ICCAT, not CITES, was the appropriate international vehicle for implementing necessary conservation
measures for Atlantic bluefin tuna. In response to this approach, the United States delegation to the 1993 ICCAT meeting
proposed and secured significant quota reductions for the western population of Atlantic bluefin tuna.
Another factor supporting the decision of the Service is the progress made by the Permanent Working Group of ICCAT
in April 1994 in fashioning a proposal (to be discussed further at the ICCAT plenary meeting in late 1994) for trade
measures to be used as an ICCAT enforcement tool.
From the point of view of NMFS, the adoption of quota reductions for 1994 and 1995 demonstrated ICCAT's resolve to maintain
the leadership role in the conservation of the bluefin tuna. However, in the event that appropriate conservation
measures are not adopted by ICCAT or prove to be inadequate, the Service will reconsider proposing this species for
listing in a CITES Appendix, through a postal procedure if listing is thought to be necessary prior to the next Conference
of the Parties.
5. Requiem (

Carcharhinidae

) and hammerhead (

Sphyrnidae

) sharks. Requiem and hammerhead shark species occur in pelagic and/or coastal waters worldwide, mostly in tropical
to temperate regions. Sizes range from the white, mako, and great hammerhead at over 3 m, to smaller coastal species
as the sandbar and scalloped hammerhead sharks. They are predators of various types. Fertilization and development
of young is, in most species, internal, and young are born as active, fully developed, and relatively large individuals.
The number of young in a brood is usually small (about 2 to 25), but the relative maturity at birth usually results in
high survival rates. Often gestation periods are long (up to 1 year). There are no population size estimates over large
areas for sharks.

Eight responses concerning these sharks were received within the comment period; four favored their listing in Appendix
II, and four were opposed to a listing.
The CMC, NAS, and HSUS, along with other commenters, stated that because large sharks are slow to reach sexual maturity
and reproduce at long intervals, they must be managed more conservatively than other commercial fisheries. They
cite the demand for shark fins as probably the largest factor in the presumed global decline of sharks, although meat
is also in demand, and a new market for shark cartilage as a cancer treatment has developed. The NAS pointed out that
most shark experts question whether sustainable exploitation of sharks is even possible and that over 90 percent
of the shark fisheries in this century have failed.
TRAFFIC USA submitted an unpublished paper from the World Conservation Monitoring Centre on shark fin trade, entitled,
``International Trade in Shark Fins.'' The study was undertaken to quantify the volume and value of shark fins in international
trade, and to identify the main producer and consumer nations. However, due to the limited availability of trade data,
statistics from only nine countries were analyzed. The paper calls for closer attention to studies of trends in shark
populations, in order to protect sharks from overexploitation.
In opposition to a CITES listing, the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations and the National Fisheries
Institute commented that the lack of available information on population structure, distribution, abundance,
and population trends for these species limit the presentation of scientific evidence to support a proposal for listing.
They expressed concern that an Appendix II listing might encourage unilateral actions, such as the U.S. Atlantic
coast shark fishery management plan, that could provide a basis for CITES nations to determine that their shark production
was non-detrimental, rather than participating in regional cooperative management programs.
The Japan Fisheries Association and the FAJ indicated that available scientific information does not support listing
these shark species, and that a listing would impose an excessive burden on the management and scientific authorities
of concerned parties to CITES.
NMFS took note of the lack of specific information in many comments received, and based on this limitation, combined
with the lack of research cross-referencing trade statistics with population trends, NMFS decided that they would
not recommend proposing any shark species for listing in the CITES Appendices. The Service agrees with this view,
and also feels that the data available on the status of shark species worldwide are not sufficient to support the listing
of all species in these two families at this time.
6. Whale shark (

Rhincodon typus

). The whale shark is the only species in the genus 

Rhincodon,

 and occurs worldwide mainly in tropical and subtropical waters (except in the Mediterranean). It is a large (8-10
m, and up to 4.5 metric tons), slow, mainly surface dwelling, plankton-feeder. Historically it appears to have been
infrequent in occurrence; no reliable population estimates seem to exist, and they are nowhere abundant. The meat
is eaten, but it is soft and apparently brings a low price in most markets. Whale sharks are taken commercially in a few
places around the world (mostly in Asia), especially during seasons when other more valuable fish species are not
available. Although fins are removed for the shark fin soup trade, some are considered second grade.
The EIA proposed to the Service that the whale shark be considered for inclusion in Appendix II of CITES. The Service
received nine comments on the whale shark within the comment period; five supported a listing and four were opposed.
(Most comments were directed to all sharks, not specifically to the whale shark.)
TRAFFIC USA indicated that TRAFFIC Oceania has undertaken the collection and analysis of shark species in trade globally,
and enclosed a TRAFFIC USA Newsletter on sharks as well as an unpublished report entitled, ``International Trade
in Shark Fins.'' The CMC noted that commercial shark fishing is increasing worldwide as the demand for shark meat and
fins continues to expand, and invoked the slow growth rates, late maturation, and small number of young produced as
being characteristics of sharks in general that also apply to whale sharks and increase their vulnerability. They
indicated that there are commercial fisheries for whale sharks in waters off India, Pakistan, China, Senegal, and
the Philippines that appear to be expanding, and noted that the generally coastal habitat of whale sharks and their
slow movements make them vulnerable to boat collisions and harpooning. The AHA and the NAS reiterated these comments,
adding that, as a precautionary principle, the species should be listed rather than waiting until additional data
and information is accumulated. The HSUS noted that shark populations in general are considered overexploited,
at least in parts of their range, and, although data are lacking, they believed that trade in whale shark fins is probably
increasing. They supported a listing in order that data on trade and exploitation might be collected for the species.
In opposition to the listing of the whale shark, the International Coalition of Fisheries Associations and the National
Fisheries Institute, Inc. suggested that an Appendix II listing would probably not affect the limited subsistence
fisheries in parts of Asia, but that it might limit or undermine a more coordinated international approach that could
effectively control mortality. They repeated the comments from others that there is little or no information on the
whale shark's population structure, distribution, abundance, population trends, or trade. The Japan Fisheries
Association stated that available scientific information on sharks does not warrant listing these species in any
CITES Appendix. The FAJ essentially agreed with this assessment, adding that a listing would add an excessive burden
to the Management and Scientific Authorities of the CITES Parties concerned.
NMFS took note of the lack of specific information in many of the comments received, and, based on this limitation,
combined with the lack of research cross-referencing trade statistics with population trends, NMFS decided that
they would not recommend proposing the whale shark for listing in a CITES Appendix. NMFS will continue to monitor work
being done in this area in order to better assess possible recommendations at a later date.

At this time the Service feels that there is insufficient information on status and international trade to support
a proposal to list the whale shark in Appendix II of CITES. A better understanding of the possible threats to this species
is needed before such a proposal could be considered. There does not appear to be firm evidence suggesting that the
whale shark has ever been other than infrequent in occurrence, or that there has been a significant increase in the
catch of this species by the traditional fisheries in Asia.

In lieu of proposals to list the whale shark, requiem sharks, and hammerhead sharks in the Appendices of CITES, the
United States has submitted an agenda item on trade in shark products for COP9, which is discussed later in this notice.

7. Bigleaf mahogany (

Swietenia macrophylla

). American mahogany is the genus 

Swietenia, 

which is native to the neotropics. Two of the three species are in CITES Appendix II: 

Swietenia humilis 

(Pacific Coast mahogany) including its parts and derivatives, which occurs in Mexico and Central America; and 

Swietenia mahagoni 

(Caribbean mahogany) including only its logs, sawn wood and veneer, which occurs on some Caribbean islands and extends
to southern Florida. The unlisted species, Swietenia macrophylla (bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America
to Mexico; in Costa Rica it evidently forms hybrids naturally with 

S. humilis. 

The United States has become the main importer of wood from bigleaf mahogany. 

During the comment period the Service received 22 responses relating to the January 27, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice; 17 organizations or individuals favored the United States submitting a proposal to include 

Swietenia macrophylla, 

including only logs, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood, in Appendix II, and 2 organizations were opposed.

The favorable responses, sometimes in detail or with substantial enclosures, were from the company A & M Wood
Specialty (Cambridge, Ontario, Canada); on behalf of the architects of the American Institute of Architects (AIA)
from the Rainforest and Natural Resources Task Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment; the Fauna and Flora Preservation
Society (London, U.K.); Greenpeace USA; the Natural Resources Defense Council of Washington, D.C. (NRDC); the Woodworkers
Alliance for Rainforest Protection; some students and staff of Los Altos High School (Los Altos, California); and
the general public (six letters). In addition, the following persons with particular research or conservation experience
with the species individually supported the submission of a proposal: Mr. J. Beavers (Schaghticoke, New York); Sr.
L. Quevedo-H. (Santa Cruz, Bolivia); Dr. L.K. Snook (Westport, Connecticut); and Sr. A. Szwagrzak (La Paz, Bolivia).
Moreover, Dr. J.O. Browder, an Associate Professor in the Department of Urban Affairs and Planning of Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University, provided a copy of his recent study on the feasibility of small-holder mahogany-planting
in Rond&ocirc;nia, Brazil; and TRAFFIC USA advised the Service that it was collaborating with a graduate student
of public policy at Harvard University who was studying the relative importance of illegal trade in the total trade
in the species and the potential effectiveness of a CITES listing in achieving sustainable harvest and trade. Subsequently,
TRAFFIC USA advised the Service that instead the study had evolved into hypothetical policy ramifications, and consequently
they did not have such new data and information to provide.

The responses opposed to the submission of a proposal were from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and the International
Wood Products Association (IHPA). At the Service's public meeting held on February 22, 1994, the IHPA inquired concerning
the responsibilities and process used by the CITES Plants Committee (CPC) in recommending that proposals be considered,
and the intention of the Service with regard to circulating potential proposals to the range States for comments,
and whether those comments would be reflected in final positions of the United States on the species. The Service representatives
responded that the CPC had advisory and technical roles, that the Service intended to communicate with the range States,
and that the views of range States would be seriously considered. In comments submitted March 14, 1994, IHPA stated
that they share a belief that the species does not qualify for Appendix II. They provided a broad and detailed commentary
of opposition (with enclosures), which covered the three potential proposals for the several mahoganies. The Service
has noted the particular comments on the genera of African mahoganies in the section on those genera below.

At COP8, during an informal meeting on whether to include 

Swietenia macrophylla 

in Appendix II, most range States favored the Costa Rica or U.S. proposals_except Bolivia, Peru, and Honduras. Ultimately
the preferred U.S. proposal was withdrawn because of continuing disagreement. In keeping with Resolution Conf.
8.21, the Service provided a draft of the new proposal to the range States in mid-April 1994 and solicited their comments.
Prior to the June 10, 1994, deadline for submission of proposals for COP9, Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru expressed opposition
to the potential proposal, whereas Colombia and El Salvador expressed support. 

The Service has been discussing this topic with the USFS, particularly regarding concerns about ecological extinction
of the species, and with the U.S. Department of State, regarding the positions of range States and the effective role
of CITES. The Service recognizes that some have argued that the purchase of CITES-approved mahogany wood could support
sustainable use of this species, since listing requires the countries where a species is native to find that its export
would not be detrimental to the survival of the species before they issue export permits.

On June 9, 1994, the Service became aware that The Netherlands had submitted a proposal for inclusion of this species
in Appendix II. The United States decided not to submit another proposal and to address unresolved issues, in an effort
to reach a consensus on the proposal that The Netherlands had already submitted for this species. The Service is now
seeking comments on that proposal; see the September 6, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 46023).
8. African mahoganies (

Entandrophragma 

and 

Khaya

). The genera 

Entandrophragma 

(about 11 species) and 

Khaya 

(about 6 species) are native to the tropics of Africa, with 

Khaya 

extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. All the species have been declining from habitat conversion and
selectively varied commercial exploitation, and nearly all have been reported to be threatened in various countries
and significant portions of their ranges. The majority of the 17 species have some legal protection in one or more countries,
generally with respect to their export. Within the comment period the Service received six comments, with three in
favor of submitting proposals for the species and two against. 
The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (London, U.K.) supported the inclusion of all species of both genera in Appendix
II. They stated that ``Due to the nature of the mahogany trade, it is important to appreciate that equal and parallel
attention and protection must be afforded to 

Khaya 

spp. and 

Entandrophragma 

spp. as to 

Swietenia macrophylla * * *.

 There are only a few areas of Africa where * * * African mahoganies have [not] already suffered massive
decline * * *.'' The NRDC also expressed support for including both genera in Appendix II and concern
about the inter-relationships of trade in wood of the three genera. The AIA chair of its Rainforest and Natural Resources
Task Group, who is also a member of the Steering Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment, wrote, on behalf of the
architects of the AIA, in favor of the inclusion of the genera. He stated that he understood Appendix II listing would
not constitute a trade ban, and that inclusion of the species would help architects and designers to make responsible
and objective decisions concerning their use [since they could purchase from the CITES-approved exports]. 
At the Service's public meeting held on February 22, 1994, an individual representing IHPA inquired concerning the
responsibilities and process used by the CPC in recommending that proposals be considered, and the intention of the
Service with regard to circulating potential proposals to the range States for comments, and whether those comments
would be reflected in final positions of the United States on the species. Service representatives responded that
the CPC had advisory and technical roles, that Germany had the lead with African mahoganies and was communicating
with the range States, and that the views of range States would be seriously considered.
In early May 1994, the Service received copies of the replies Germany had received by April 26, from 13 of the 31 range
States; 6 supported inclusion of the genera in Appendix II, 3 were against proposals, and 4 were neutral.
In its comments submitted March 14, 1994, IHPA stated that they do not believe that these genera qualify for Appendix
II. They provided a broad and detailed commentary of opposition (with enclosures), which covered the three potential
proposals for the several mahoganies. Regarding in particular the African mahoganies, the IHPA stated that the volumes
of traded wood listed in the proposals are not clearly linked to total reductions in standing volumes of the species
across their ranges. They also stated that much is in protected areas and gave as an example that 20 percent of rainforest
in Ghana is in totally protected reserves. In addition, IHPA enclosed a letter of February 18, 1994, to them from the
Planning Branch of the Ghana Forestry Department, which stated that listing under CITES is not necessary for the protection
of these species in Ghana, and provided details on Ghana forest management and these species; see the similar statement
below, from the Ghana Timber Export Development Board.

The Trade and Investment Office of the Embassy of Ghana in the United States expressed opposition to including 

Entandrophragma 

and 

Khaya 

in Appendix II. However the basic differences in controls between Appendix II and Appendix I may not have been fully
understood by them or the Ghana Forestry Department, as the Embassy included a statement from the Ghana Timber Export
Development Board (Takoradi, Ghana), similar to the letter of the Forestry Department, both of which expressed the
view that ``A ban [sic] on exploitation of these species in the case of Ghana is rather likely to undermine current efforts
to protect them * * *'' The Embassy stated that the timber industry is a very important contributor
to foreign-exchange earnings, those two genera constitute about 50 percent of their production and exports, and
the country has made great strides (giving details) towards sustainable management of Ghana forests. They stated
that forest management in Ghana now is recognized as being the best in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The Embassy included a detailed statement from the Timber Export Development Board which stated that Ghana has made
forest-management reforms and has conservative forest-exploitation controls and protective strategies that
provide adequate regulatory measures to ensure sustainable utilization, which are being enforced. The Board provided
details about the four 

Entandrophragma 

species and three 

Khaya 

species that are native, indicating that four of the seven species are quite widely distributed and some of the species
occur nationally at very low densities, and giving thorough estimated inventories of the seven species (for the high-forest
region of southern Ghana). The Board noted that there are few remaining large trees for exploitation, but that ``* * *
this implies commercial extinction of the species only, as there is plenty of regeneration and the present management
system has been designed to protect the species.'' 
The Service was advised that Germany would submit proposals to include the two genera in Appendix II, and decided that
the United States would evaluate the German proposal objectively without being a co-proponent. 
9. Non-native Aloes (

Aloe 

spp.). All species of 

Aloe 

are in the CITES appendices, with nearly all in Appendix II, including 

Aloe vera 

(synonym 

Aloe barbadensis

). The genus is essentially African. Plants regarded as 

Aloe vera 

have been used by people for millennia and the yellow-flowered species may be extinct in its native range_it may have
been native to the southern Arabian Peninsula or northeastern Africa (e.g., Ethiopia) where similar species occur
(but perhaps instead was native to the Canary Islands). 
The parts and derivatives of artificially propagated 

Aloe vera 

are unregulated. The whole plants commonly in trade as aloe vera are of artificially propagated (or also naturalized)
origin, and they have become an enforcement burden. On January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832), the Service announced that it
was considering submission of a proposal to remove the non-native population of 

Aloe 

that is geographically distinct from the general African area. All species of 

Aloe 

where they may be native thus would have continued to be regulated by CITES, including those on the Arabian Peninsula
and the islands neighboring Africa, such as the Canary Islands, Socotra, and Madagascar. 
Although no written comments were received during the comment period, Mr. Gary W. Lyons (of Gary Lyons Garden &
Horticultural Consultant & Design), a member of the IUCN/SSC Cactus and Succulent Specialist Group and past
chair of the Conservation Committee of the Cactus and Succulent Society of America, renewed (by telephone within
the comment period) the concerns in his written commentary provided to the Service for the September 1993 CPC Meeting,
and in August 1994 provided a copy of his analysis written for consideration during the 23rd Congress of the International
Organization for Succulent Plant Study. On April 12, 1994, the United States discussed the subject at the 17th CITES
North American Region Meeting near Ottawa, Canada. That group recommended that a proposal not be submitted, because
of the risk it would create for illegal import of rare 

Aloe taxa,

 possibly including native wild 

Aloe vera. 
The Service considered whether exclusion of the plants from the non- native (non-African) population of Aloe 

would significantly increase risk to the survival in its native range of any 

Aloe 

(i.e., species, subspecies, botanical variety, or significant population). The United States decided not to submit
a proposal. The subject was discussed at the CPC meeting in May 1994; Switzerland has since submitted a proposal for
the removal of 

Aloe barbadensis 

[sic] [i.e., 

Aloe vera

] from Appendix II. 
The Service is now seeking comments on that proposal; see the September 6, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 46023). The Service is considering whether the artificially propagated whole plants of 

Aloe vera 

can be dealt with in a different way, without putting wild 

Aloe taxa

 at increased risk.

10. Port-Orford-cedar (

Chamaecyparis lawsoniana

). Port-Orford-cedar (POC) is endemic to southwestern Oregon as well as northwestern California, in an area that
is generally coastal, mostly from about Coos Bay to Arcata. The species has been significantly reduced in natural
standing volume, and is now logged almost entirely for export (primarily to Japan). An introduced pathogen (

Phytophthora lateralis

) has been spreading particularly as a side effect of soil transport by vehicles and logging equipment. Within the
comment period the Service received 28 comments, 17 in favor of submitting a proposal to include this species in CITES
Appendix II, and 11 against. 
Dr. D.B. Zobel, a plant ecologist and professor at Oregon State University, who has studied and/or observed the species
and its situation since 1972 and is senior author of the monograph Ecology, Pathology, and Management of Port-Orford-Cedar
(1985), considered that an attempt to control POC harvest through CITES would not be appropriate or effective, and
could be counterproductive. He provided a detailed review that sometimes questioned whether assertions of threat,
management, or protection were unproven belief or fact. 
Dr. T.T. Lawson, a forest pathologist of Lawson-Rasor Associates, who has spent several years monitoring research
and control efforts on the POC disease, submitted a detailed evaluation and concluded that listing POC in Appendix
II is appropriate and needed to reduce spread of the root pathogen. Dr. E.M. Hansen, Professor of Forest Pathology
at Oregon State University, has worked with POC and 

Phytophthora lateralis 

for 22 years. He submitted detailed information and data about research on the root-rot disease and assessments of
its present status and potential effects. While continuing to be seriously concerned about the impact of the disease
on POC, he opposed listing because he believed that [even] halting log exports would not slow the spread of the disease,
and might indirectly lead to a reduction in the management efforts to protect POC. 
The Oregon Natural Resources Council provided additional information on POC and its situation, including the report
(

In press

) by T.T. Lawson, Port-Orford-Cedar: A Species Under Siege. 
The Siskiyou Regional Education Project and Siskiyou Audubon Society supported proposed inclusion of the species
in Appendix II, providing a detailed analytical report. They stated that POC has been found to be a keystone species
in riparian forests, enhancing their biodiversity (including fisheries), and that this species also is sometimes
a critical riparian colonizer. They questioned various relatively recent regional and local USFS administrative
plans, decisions, and activities. They detailed concerns and evidence about spread of the disease, even into areas
designated as wilderness, wild-and-scenic rivers, and botanical areas, consequent to salvage-logging and new
logging operations as well as travel on back-country roads inadequately restricted or not closed. They included
and endorsed a statement also sent separately by Mr. J. Rogers, a professional forester of Rogers & Associates
who since 1968 has been familiar with the species and consequences of the root-rot disease from logging. He stated
that unless export is halted, most of what remains of the species will be logged and/or infected, including the largest
known individual of the species. 
The NRDC expressed support for inclusion of this species in Appendix II, and supplied detailed additional information
and data on its situation. They stated that this species is the only Pacific Northwest conifer that can still be exported
from Federal lands in log form legally since it had been designated a surplus commodity, and because of high foreign
demand for logs_almost exclusively from old-growth trees. They noted concerns about genetic erosion, and provided
details regarding the water mold and its potential and likelihood of spreading. The NRDC believes that a halt to logging
has become necessary. 
Greenpeace USA supported the proposal to include the species in Appendix II, stating among other concerns that continued
logging of the best POC stocks could further reduce the genetic reserves of the species and the possibility of finding
potential genotypes that could resist or overcome the disease. 
The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (London, U.K.) indicated that the export appeared to clearly warrant inclusion
of the species in Appendix II. The chair of the AIA Rainforest and Natural Resources Task Group, who is also a member
of the Steering Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment, wrote on behalf of the architects of the AIA, in favor
of inclusion of this species. He stated that he understood CITES Appendix II listing would not constitute a trade ban,
and that inclusion of the species could help architects and designers to make more responsible and objective decisions
concerning its use [since they could purchase from the CITES-approved supplies]. During the comment period eight
letters from the general public supported submission of a proposal to include POC in Appendix II.

Fletchcraft Mfg. and Stahl's Traditional Archery supported restriction 
or stopping of export of the species. Both companies advocate an ecologically 
sustainable supply of POC wood for arrow manufacturing. 

Other letters of opposition to the potential CITES proposal were 
received within the comment period from Arcata Redwood Company, Douglas Timber 
Operators, Reservation Ranch, Weyerhaeuser Company, Woodland Management 
Professional Foresters, and the Association of Consulting Foresters of 
America. Also, Mr. D. Brattain of Reservation Ranch coordinated and led a POC 
Alliance mostly comprised of about 20 timber, lumber, and/or exporting 
companies and also the Oregon International Port of Coos Bay, Coos Chapter of 
the Society of American Foresters, and Coos County Forestry Department, which 
submitted an extensive document including a detailed response against the 
potential proposal to list the POC in Appendix II, with supplementary 
materials on POC and its situation, including additional usually detailed 
letters of opposition from the Coos County Forestry Department, the Coos-Curry 
Electric Cooperative, the [Coos] Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, a private POC 
landowner who also is a State Director for the Oregon Small Woodlands 
Association, The Agnew Company, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Moore Mill & 
Lumber Company, Rough & Ready Lumber Company, South Coast Lumber Company, 
Spalding & Son Lumber Manufacturers and Wholesalers, Westbrook Land and 
Timber, Stuntzner Engineering & Forestry, a USFS silviculturist_acting in a 
private capacity_with 15 years of responsibility for POC management to 
minimize spread and impact of the root-rot disease in a major National Forest 
Ranger District, the Oregon Chapter of the Association of Consulting Foresters 
of America, the Oregon Society of American Foresters, and the Natural Resource 
Group (Birmingham, Alabama). 

The Oregon Department of Forestry expressed opposition to inclusion of 
this species in Appendix II. They stated that virtually all of the 
commercially valuable timber of the species is on Federal lands, that there is 
ample protection due to the extensive acreage of land set aside for various 
conservation purposes, and that there is a program in place that will limit 
damage caused by the root disease on Federal lands and it is adequate to 
protect the species. They also found that the ecosystem-based direction of 
management taken by Federal land-management agencies under the President's 
``Option 9'' plan is sufficient to protect this species in its ecosystems, and 
they expect that the volume of the type of material demanded in the export 
market will be reduced because of implementation of this plan. 

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection stated that 
they advise private landowners on precautions to be taken to prevent spread of 
the root rot, and that they generally have as a mitigation requirement of 
timber harvesting that the landowner follow the USFS policies and procedures. 
They asked that the decision for or against a proposal to list under CITES be 
made to protect or prolong the biological and ecological viability of the 
species in its natural range. 

The USFS recommended that the species not be added to Appendix II. The 
USFS provided detailed information (with detailed maps) about the species, its 
utilization, the water mold that infects POC and causes a virulent root 
disease, and the interagency program for Port-Orford-cedar conservation and 
management [through the Interregional POC Coordinating Committee], which the 
USFS chairs. The USFS stated that over 40 percent of the tree species' range 
is in reserves protected from harvesting, that harvests have substantially 
declined and growth now exceeds harvest and mortality, and that they have an 
active range-wide interagency effort underway [and the Interregional Port-Orford Cedar Action Plan] to manage
the species and the infectious fungus. 

The Service carefully evaluated whether 

Chamaecyparis lawsoniana 


qualified for CITES Appendix II, and could benefit from export regulation by means of an Appendix II listing, which
included a discussion of its situation at the CITES Plants Committee meeting held in Mexico in May 1994. The Service
recognized that a significant portion of POC is in reserves that for various reasons are protected from harvesting
(in some cases except for thinning and salvage cutting), that most of the species is on public lands under Federal management,
and that there are meaningful efforts to harvest sustainably and to curtail the 

Phytophthora 

disease. The Service concluded that Federal and State regulatory mechanisms, governmental and private conservation
actions, and endeavors particularly through the U.S. Forest Service to understand and to control the introduced
disease now affecting some populations, were able to cope with this endemic species' present circumstances without
the need for additional regulatory authority through use of this international treaty. 



Species Proposals Submitted 



1. Saiga antelope (

Saiga tatarica

). The EIA sent the Service a proposal to list both subspecies of the saiga antelope in Appendix I. The horns of the saiga
antelope have been used in Asian traditional medicines. Saiga have also been utilized as a food source at varying levels
of intensity depending on location and availability. The Mongolian Ministry of Nature and Environment provided
a rather detailed account of the status and biology of 

S. t. mongolica, 

which now exists in two small disjunct populations in Mongolia, one estimated at about 1400 individuals in 1993 and
the other estimated at 125 animals in 1983. They recommended that this subspecies be listed in Appendix I.

Saiga tatarica tatarica occurs in two major populations, one in 
Kazakhstan and a second south of the Volga River and northwest of the Caspian 
Sea in the Kalmykian Republic, Russian Federation. By the end of World War I 
this subspecies was near extinction, but began to recover in the 1920's so 
that by the late 1950's the population in Kazakhstan was reported to have 
reached nearly 2,000,000, and in Kalmykia saiga had reportedly increased to 
about 800,000. In the last two decades these numbers have been reduced again, 
fluctuating around 150,000 in Kalmykia and down to about 450,000 in Kazakhstan 
in the last few years. These reductions are reportedly the result of a 
combination of factors including weather, land-use changes, and poaching for 
horns. 

Four comments were received within the comment period. Three comments 
favored listing saiga antelope in Appendix I, while the fourth supported only 
an Appendix II listing. 

The AHA was in favor of an Appendix I listing ``until trade in the 
species can be shown to be non-detrimental to the survival of the species.'' 
They stated that researchers indicate that saiga hunting in Russia has been 
nearly out of control over the last 3-4 years, implying that this increase is 
due to poaching for horns. 

Defenders supported an Appendix I listing, suggesting that saiga, like 
the rhino, are being threatened by poaching and overhunting for the horn 
trade, and that saiga horn is the most expensive fever-reducing substance used 
in traditional medicines after rhino horn. They stated that saiga are also 
hunted for their meat, fat, and hides. They admitted that status and trade 
data are extremely limited, but that recent aerial surveys indicated a rapid 
rate of decline of saiga populations. They also pointed out the dramatic 
population reductions that can occur among saiga due to extreme weather 
conditions or food shortages. 

The HSUS favored an Appendix I listing for the saiga, also indicating 
the similarity between the use and demand for rhino and saiga horn. From an 
estimated 2 million animals in the 1960's, 

S. t. tatarica 

has plummeted to 
about 800,000 individuals according to HSUS, due apparently to uncontrolled 
hunting in Russia and Kazakhstan for the horns. The HSUS noted that the use 
of saiga horn as a substitute for rhino horn in traditional Chinese medicine 
has been and is likely to increase as pressures to control the trade in rhino 
horn intensify. 

The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Sustainable Use of Wildlife 
Programme questioned the long-term benefits to saiga to be derived from an 
Appendix I listing. Such a listing for the Russian subspecies would 
technically prohibit commercial trade in the species, thus eliminating its 
value. Local and regional authorities currently would find it nearly 
impossible to implement the controls necessary to sustain saiga populations in 
the absence of obvious and immediate value to the local economy. They 
suggested that the local rural population would probably increase livestock 
numbers in saiga habitat to supplement and replace the value lost from saiga 
as a result of an Appendix I listing, eventually resulting in extirpation of 
the saiga. An Appendix II listing would require the Governments of Russia 
(for the Kalmykia population), Kazakhstan, and Mongolia to implement 
administrative and management procedures that, if adequate, could be 
beneficial to the species. The IUCN group was concerned about the demand for 
saiga horn and possible illegal trade. 

Comments received from the Russian Ministry of Protection of the 
Environment and Natural Resources described the existence of the two major 
populations of 

S. t. tatarica, 

one in Kalmykia of about 150,000 animals and one in Kazakhstan consisting of ``several tens of thousands.'' Hunting
of saiga has been increasingly reduced since about 1984, with only limited sport-hunting now allowed in Kalmykia,
and protected reserves have been established. 
The diminished status of the saiga is due to habitat modifications, changes in 
land use, and illegal hunting. The Ministry favored a listing of saiga 
antelope in Appendix II of CITES. Also, by personal communication, the 
Chinese Ministry of Forestry indicated that they could support an Appendix II 
listing.

In addition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service funded a visit in the Spring of 1994 to Moscow and Kalmykia by Dr. James
Teer, Welder Wildlife Foundation, Sinton, Texas, and Dr. Fred Lindzey, Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research
Unit, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, to report on the status of the saiga. Teer and Lindzey opined that the
Kalmykian saiga population can no longer sustain itself when harvests for horns, meat, and hides are permitted for
export, but that it can sustain a small offtake from hunting. Even so, they were concerned about poaching and the ease
of movement of saiga parts across borders. They also felt that the Kalmykian population might rebound due to the great
fecundity of saiga, along with a reduction in livestock, habitat improvement, and the control of poaching, all factors
the Kalmykian authorities claim they are implementing. While realizing that an Appendix II listing would not prohibit
exports, Teer and Lindzey suggested that the United States might delay proposing a CITES listing to allow time for
current management measures and the population status in Kalmykia to be evaluated, and to give Kazakhstan time to
become a Party to CITES. 
 As a result of comments and information received concerning the amount of poaching of saiga antelope and the illegal
trade in saiga horns, the use of saiga horns in combination with or as a substitute for rhinoceros horns in traditional
medicines in conjunction with intensified pressures to stop the trade in rhinoceros horn, and the evidence of considerable
declines in populations of 

S. t. tatarica 

over the last two decades for various reasons, the Service has proposed that populations of 

S. t. tatarica

 be included in Appendix II of CITES. The numbers of 

S. t. mongolica

 are so low in the wild that the full protective potential of CITES seems warranted, therefore the Service has proposed
that the Mongolian population be included in Appendix I of CITES. 
2. Urial (

Ovis vignei

). The Service requested information and comments to help clarify which populations of the urial should be included
in Appendix I as a result of the 1973 listing of 

Ovis vignei 

by India. Confusion regarding the intended inclusiveness of the original listing of 1973 arose as a result of (1) actions
considered at COP2 in 1979; (2) range information presented in the CITES-adopted check list for mammals, Mammal Species
of the World, 1982, edited by Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl; and, (3) distribution and synonymy given in Mammal Species
of the World, 2nd Edition, 1993, edited by Wilson and Reeder. The issue was whether the original listing implies a conservative
application of the name, thereby restricting the listing to only populations in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir,
or there was a broader intent, as presented in Honacki, Kinman, and Koeppl, 1982? 


Five comments were received within the comment period on this problem. TRAFFIC USA passed on information from TRAFFIC
India attesting to the endangered status of the urial sheep in India, and from TRAFFIC France indicating that urial
hunting trips in central Asia are being organized by French companies. Dr. Steve Edwards, IUCN, supported the submission
of a proposal to clarify which populations of 

O. vignei 

are to be included in Appendix I. 


The three remaining comments were from Safari Club International, Dr. Richard Mitchell, and Mr. Ron Young of Expeditions
by Ron. The first two commenters argued that the intent of the original listing was to include only the population in
the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, while the latter noted that, according to his observation, the Transcaspian
urial, the Afghan urial, the Blandford urial, and the Punjab urial are all abundant in the wild. 
The Government of Pakistan indicated that the shapu (

O. orientalis vignei

 (

= O. v. vignei

)), the gad (

O. o. blanfordi

 (

= O. v. blanfordi

)), and the Punjab urial (

O. o. punjabiensis

 (

= O. v. punjabiensis

)) are in fair numbers in Pakistan and that there is no need to list them under CITES. 

Also, Mr. Earl Baysinger, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who attended the Convention's Plenipotentiary Meeting
and COP2, provided a detailed account of the discussions that took place at that meeting of the Parties concerning
the proposal and ultimate listing of the urial, and claimed that the Parties intended to include only 

O. vignei vignei

 in Appendix I. 


The Service is, therefore, proposing that only 

O. vignei vignei

 of the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir be retained in Appendix I, and that all other populations of 

O. vignei

 be included in Appendix II for biological and similarity of appearance purposes. 


3. Box turtles (

Terrapene 

spp.). Prior to COP8, the New York Zoological Society recommended listing box turtles in Appendix II. However, the
Service did not have sufficient information on trade in these species, and did not submit a proposal for consideration
at COP8. Since then the Service has accumulated data in its Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS)
on exports and imports of box turtles in an effort to obtain appropriate trade information. 
The genus 

Terrapene

 includes the four species (

T. carolina, T. coahuila, T. nelsoni, 

and 

T. ornata

), with 11 subspecies recognized among them. 

Terrapene coahuila 

is currently listed in Appendix I of CITES. 

Terrapene nelsoni

 occurs in a small fragmented range on the west coast of Mexico, while 

T. ornata

 is found over a large area of the midwestern United States. 

Terrapene carolina 

has the largest range, occurring from Canada to Mexico as far as Yucatan, and from the Atlantic coast west into approximately
the eastern edge of the prairie in the Midwest.

Box turtles are long-lived, sexual maturity is late, and annual reproduction is low. They exhibit high site fidelity,
which tends to amplify the impacts of habitat fragmentation. The removal of adult turtles from the wild can have a significant
impact on the status of populations. 

A large number of comments were received in response to the January 27, 1994, notice. Twenty-two States responded,
in 16 of which box turtles are protected by State law. None of these responses objected to a proposal to list the box turtle
in Appendix II. Comments from the States noted the continued loss of habitat, illegal collecting, negative impacts
of the pet trade in box turtles, some indications of international trade, and suggestions of declines in some populations.
Of the 298 comments received from individuals, only one did not support the proposal to list box turtles under CITES,
and this one negative comment was made pending the collection of more data. Many of these comments included anecdotal
accounts and observations of population declines, and the occurrence of box turtles for sale in pet stores in the United
States and abroad. Supporting comments were also received on behalf of 23 non-governmental organizations, although
2 of these supported the listing of box turtles conditioned on proper treatment of pet-trade turtles, and more rapid
processing of permit applications. Most of these responses focused on the impacts of the pet trade and poor shipping
conditions. 


 
Based on (1) the large number of box turtles exported from the United States since 1988; (2) an apparent increase in
the demand for box turtles in the international pet trade, particularly since 1984 when the EU banned trade in Mediterranean
land tortoises (

Testudo

 spp.); (3) the reported decline in numbers throughout the range of 

T. ornata

 and 

T. carolina

; (4) an increase in fragmentation of box turtle habitat; (5) the difficulties of implementing State protective laws,
especially when similar protection is not provided in other States; and (6) the increased negative impact of these
factors on species exhibiting low reproductive rates and high site fidelity; the Service has proposed to include
all the populations of box turtles in the genus 

Terrapene

 in Appendix II of CITES, except 

T. coahuila,

 which will remain in Appendix I. 



4. Tarantulas (

Brachypelma

 species). The Service received a proposal from Dr. Robert Wolff of Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Illinois
to list all the species in the genus 

Brachypelma

 (also known as 

Euathlus

) in Appendix II. There are about nine species in the genus, and one, 

B. smithi

 the red-kneed tarantula, is presently included in Appendix II. Members of this genus are usually colorful and among
the most sought after tarantulas for the pet trade. The taxonomy of the genus is not well known and identification of
species is often difficult. 



Four responses to the possible listing of 

Brachypelma 

species were received. Although one commenter only supported the inclusion of the genus in Appendix II by implication,
the other three commenters specifically supported this action. The HSUS noted the popularity of 

Brachypelma

 species in the pet trade and the enhanced support of enforcement efforts that this action would provide. TRAFFIC USA
claimed that there is increasing evidence for widespread trade in several species of the genus. TRAFFIC France reported
to TRAFFIC USA increased trade in tarantula species throughout western Europe involving at least four other species
in addition to 

B. smithi.

 The Mexican Government supported the addition of all species of 

Brachypelma

 in Appendix II. The Service has therefore proposed the inclusion of all taxa in the genus 

Brachypelma

 in Appendix II, including but not limited to the following species: 

B. albopilosum, B. angustum, B. auratum, B. boehmei, B. emilia, B. fossorium, B. pallidum, B. sabulosum, B. vagans.

 Any taxa discovered subsequent to this listing and included in the genus 

Brachypelma

 would also be automatically included in Appendix II under this proposed listing action. 

5. Freshwater mussels (family Unionidae). Members of this family occur in their greatest variety throughout the
Southeast and the Midwest of the United States in major river drainage systems including the upper Mississippi River.

Many species in the family have become extinct or reduced to very low numbers largely as a result of habitat destruction
and/or degradation. A few species have been collected commercially, initially as a source of raw material for the
button industry, but, since the advent of synthetic button materials and the artificial pearl industry in Japan,
as a source of spherical blanks around which nacre is deposited by living bivalves during the production of pearls.
These species, which are sought commercially, are generally characterized by their thick, white shells, and they
occur most often in large rivers and reservoirs. Most states where they are harvested regulate their collection,
usually with prohibitions on collection in waters known to contain populations of endangered or threatened unionid
species. Although endangered and threatened unionids may occasionally be taken incidentally along with the commercial
forms, there does not appear to be compelling evidence indicating any significant export of endangered mussels with
commercial shipments for the pearl industry. 
Other species are harvested, although in smaller numbers, for the natural freshwater pearls used in jewelry. Still
others, those with colorful nacre, are utilized directly in the production of jewelry. Shell collecting alone is
believed to be a threat to some species, especially those that are rare or unique. Trade in these products and/or shells
may constitute a threat to many species, especially those most endangered. 
Three comments were received during the comment period concerning a possible proposal to list unionids in the Appendices
of CITES; one from the Fisheries Agency of Japan, one from the State of Missouri, and one from the Tennessee Shell Company,
Inc. 
The FAJ voiced a general concern about listing species in the absence of sufficient scientific evidence to show that
there is a threat to extinction for an Appendix I listing, or that they may become threatened with extinction unless
such species are subject to strict regulation for an Appendix II listing. Specifically, they felt that no scientific
data have been presented demonstrating the degree of extinction and the presence of threats from trading for each
of the more than 200 species of freshwater mussels. Furthermore, they stated that listing all the species of this taxon
because some are potentially threatened by collectors could also be similarly applied to all other groups of species,
which would pose a serious obstacle to the effective use of living resources. They indicated that it would be inappropriate
to enforce such regulations without justifiable reasons. 
The Tennessee Shell Company, Inc. expressed concern for the plight of freshwater mussels in general, citing such
threats as water pollution, cold or hot water discharges into mussel habitat, sediment deposition, dredging, bridge
construction, natural die-offs, etc. They offered support of efforts directed at the protection and conservation
of freshwater mussels from habitat destruction resulting from these kinds of hazards. 
The Missouri Department of Conservation generally supported the listing of Unionid mussels in CITES Appendices,
with the exception of four species that are of commercial value. 
After considering comments received, and the level of trade information available, along with the difficulties
of species identification and the separation of look-alikes, the Service has proposed that the Appendices to CITES
be revised by: 
1. Transferring 

Epioblasma sulcata 

(=

obliquata

) 

perobliqua

, and 

Lampsilis satura 

from Appendix I to Appendix II; 
2. Labeling 

Epioblasma sampsoni 

(now in Appendix I) as pe (probably extinct); 
3. Deleting all the species now included in Appendix II, since they will be included in the following broader listing;
and 
4. Including all other North American populations of mussels in the family Unionidae in Appendix II, with the exception
of the shells and the artificial pearls presumed to contain blanks from the taxa listed below.

 



Amblema plicata, Ellipsaria lineolata, Fusconaia ebena, F. flava, Ligumia recta, Megalonaias nervosa, Obliquaria
reflexa, Pleurobema cordatum, Quadrula apiculata, Q. metanevra, Q. nodulata, Q. pustulosa, Q. quadrula, 

and 

Tritogonia verrucosa.

 

The Service believes that these species are easily distinguishable from the species listed as endangered or threatened
under the Endangered Species Act.

Public Comments and Decisions on Possible Resolutions 


In response to the November 18, 1993, and the January 28, 1994, 

Federal Register 

notices (58 FR 60973 and 56 FR 4096) comments were received from numerous organizations regarding a resolution to
amend the criteria for listing species in the CITES Appendices (see discussion of listing criteria resolution below).

In addition, several non-governmental organizations, in writing and at the public meeting on February 22, 1994,
requested that the Service submit a resolution for consideration at COP9 establishing a Law Enforcement Network.
The Service supported the establishment of a Law Enforcement Network, both at the Standing Committee meeting of March,
1994, and in writing to the CITES Secretariat. The Service remains strongly supportive of increasing the role of law
enforcement in the CITES context, both through networks among the Parties and through increased training of appropriate
enforcement officials. It is the Service's understanding that the item is already on the agenda for COP9, and that
one or more Parties may have already submitted resolutions on the subject. 
Comments on the possible resolutions that the Service may consider submitting were also received from the Center
for International Environmental Law (CIEL), the Hawthorn Corporation, and one private individual. The CIEL requested
that the United States submit a resolution that clarifies the relationship between CITES and other international
agreements related to the management of species. The CIEL's suggestions can be considered to be incorporated into
the resolution discussed below, regarding the implementation of Article XIV of the Convention, which deals with
the relationship between CITES and treaties regulating the management of marine species. The Hawthorn Corporation
provided comments on the issue of trade in tiger parts and products, and requested that trade in captive-bred tigers
for circuses and other live animal exhibitions be differentiated from concerns about trade in tiger parts and products
and related poaching of wild tigers. The Service agrees that tigers that are part of a U.S. traveling circus are not
part of the trade problem related to the poaching of wild specimens. Circus tigers, born in the United States, are certified
as captive-bred under CITES by the Service and are eligible for a certificate from the Service's Office of Management
Authority. The private individual provided comments on various issues related to trade in artificially propagated
plants, which the Service will take into consideration when reviewing resolutions pertaining to that trade, upon
their receipt from the CITES Secretariat. In addition, the Service's Office of Scientific Authority has been working
with the CITES Nomenclature Committee to consolidate and update the previous resolutions dealing with nomenclatural
issues. 
The following presents the background and sense of the three resolutions submitted by the United States for consideration
at COP9. (The Service's tentative positions on resolutions and agenda items, including those discussed in this notice
as well as on the establishment of a Law Enforcement Network, were presented in a 

Federal Register

 notice of October 4, 1994 (59 FR 50609)). 


Resolutions Submitted 


1. Article XIV Implementation. The provisions of CITES apply to all species of wild fauna and flora, including marine
species. The management of many marine species comes under the jurisdiction or competence of another international
treaty, convention, or agreement. International trade in any species of marine fauna or flora is also within the purview
and competence of CITES. Therefore, even if a marine species is subject to management under another international
treaty, convention, or agreement, and if it is listed in any CITES Appendix, then international trade and introduction
from the sea in the species is also regulated by CITES. CITES made special provisions for Appendix II marine species
that are regulated under another treaty extant when CITES came into force. 
Article XIV, paragraph 4, of the Convention provides that a State party to CITES, which is also a party to any other treaty,
convention, or international agreement which was in force at the time of the coming into force of CITES, and under the
provisions of which protection is afforded to marine species included in Appendix II, is relieved of the obligations
imposed on it under CITES with respect to trade in specimens included in Appendix II that are taken by ships registered
in that State and in accordance with the provisions of such other treaty, convention, or international agreement.

However, Article XIV, paragraph 5 requires that Parties exempted from the usual CITES obligations under Article
XIV, paragraph 4, must nevertheless issue certificates stipulating that the specimen was taken in accordance with
the provisions of the other treaty, convention, or international agreement in question. This provision of the Convention
has never been used, and standards for its implementation have not been developed. Currently no marine species whose
management is under the competence of another treaty, convention, or agreement is listed in Appendix II (this relief
from CITES obligations does not apply to specimens of species included in Appendix I). 
The Service has determined that it would be wise to plan for the need to implement Article XIV, by specifying requirements
for certificates issued pursuant to Article XIV, paragraph 5, of the Convention, even if its use is not necessary at
this time. The Service notes that Appendix II allows for international commercial trade. The draft resolution was
written in consultation with NMFS. The Service's goal in submitting this resolution is to clarify how an Appendix
II listing could be implemented expeditiously for a marine species whose management was under the competency of a
pre-CITES treaty. The draft resolution would provide for the utilization, as a valid certificate under Article XIV,
paragraph 5, of a certificate of origin or statistical document issued on the authority of the other treaty, convention,
or international agreement, with certain stipulations of minimum information and validation as required by CITES.
Such certificates would only be an option for CITES Parties that are also parties to the other treaty, convention,
or agreement, and if the specimens are taken by ships registered by the Party country. Export permits or introduction
from the sea certificates are required in all other situations.

2. Criteria for Amendments of Appendix I and II. The existing CITES listing criteria, known as the ``Berne Criteria,''
were developed at the first CITES Conference in 1976 in Berne, Switzerland. The move to revise them originated at COP8
in Japan. At COP8 the Parties agreed to start a process, coordinated by the Standing Committee, to develop a scientifically
sound revision for consideration at COP9. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) was asked to do a first draft, which
would be revised at a joint meeting of the CITES Standing
