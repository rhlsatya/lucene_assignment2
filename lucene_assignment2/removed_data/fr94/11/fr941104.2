Availability of Determination of Nonregulated Status for Genetically Engineered Canola 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public of our determination that certain Laurate canola lines are no longer considered regulated
articles under our regulations governing the introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms. Our determination
is based on our evaluation of data submitted by Calgene, Inc., in its petition for a determination of nonregulated
status, an analysis of other scientific data, and our review of comments received from the public in response to a June
1994 notice announcing our receipt of the Calgene petition. This notice also announces the availability of our written
determination document and its associated environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 31, 1994, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) received a petition from Calgene, Inc.,
of Davis, CA, seeking a determination that certain Laurate canola lines and their progeny do not present a plant pest
risk and, therefore, are not regulated articles under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340. 

On June 14, 1994, APHIS published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 
(59 FR 30569, Docket No. 94-052-1) announcing the receipt of the Calgene petition and stating that the
petition was available for public review. The notice also discussed the role of APHIS and the Food and Drug Administration
in regulating the Laurate canola lines and food products derived from them. In the notice, APHIS solicited written
comments from the public as to whether the Laurate canola lines posed a plant pest risk. The comments were to have been
received by APHIS on or before August 15, 1994. 

APHIS received a total of 17 comments on the Calgene petition. The comments were submitted by farmers, associations,
universities, a farm cooperative, State officials, a seed company, and an environmental organization. Most of the
comments were in favor of the petition; none were critical of this particular petition. APHIS has provided a discussion
of the comments in the determination document, which is available upon request from the individual listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 



Analysis 



Laurate canola has been described by Calgene as any 

Brassica napus

 cultivar or its progeny containing the 12:0 ACP thioesterase (TE) gene from California bay (

Umbellularia californica

) (referred to below as the bay TE gene) with its associated napin promoter and napin terminator regions. The bay TE
gene encodes the 12:0 ACP thioesterase enzyme. Activity of the bay TE enzyme results in the accumulation of the 12-carbon
saturated fatty acid, laurate, in the canola seed. Laurate canola may also contain a kanamycin resistance (nptII)
gene, 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus, 

tml

 3
' terminator, 

ori

 (origin of replication) pRi from 

Agrobacterium rhizogenes, 

a segment of the transposable element Tn

5

, right and left T-DNA border sequences from 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, 

and a Lac Z
' polylinker sequence. The bay TE gene is expressed only in the seed by a seed-specific napin promoter from 

Brassica rapa.



The Laurate canola lines have been considered ``regulated articles'' under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340 because
their noncoding regulatory sequences were derived from the plant pathogens 

A. tumefaciens

 and cauliflower mosaic virus. However, 22 field tests of the Laurate canola lines have been conducted at approximately
21 sites in California, Georgia, and Michigan under permits issued by APHIS, and the field reports from those tests
indicate that there were no deleterious effects on plants, nontarget organisms, or the environment as a result of
the Laurate canola lines' release into the environment.

Determination 



Based on its analysis of the data submitted by Calgene, a review of other scientific data, the comments received from
the public, and a review of field tests of the original transformant lines pCGN3828-212/86-18 and pCGN3828-212/86-23
and other lines derived from those two transformants, APHIS has determined that the subject Laurate canola lines:
(1) Exhibit no plant pathogenic properties; (2) are no more likely to become weeds than their nonengineered parental
varieties; (3) are unlikely to increase the weediness potential of any other cultivated plant or native wild species
with which the organisms can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; and (5)
are unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees or earthworms, that are beneficial to agriculture. APHIS has also
concluded that there is a reasonable certainty that new progeny varieties bred from the Laurate canola lines pCGN3828-212/86-18
and pCGN3828-212/86-23 will not exhibit new plant pest properties, i.e., properties substantially
different from any observed in the field-tested Laurate canola lines, or those observed in standard canola in traditional
breeding programs. 


The effect of this determination is that the two original transformant Laurate canola lines designated pCGN3828-212/86-18
and pCGN3828-212/86-23, and all other lines bred from those two transformants by sexual or asexual reproduction
involving Mendelian inheritance, are no longer considered regulated articles under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR
part 340. Therefore, the permit and notification requirements pertaining to regulated articles under those regulations
no longer apply to the field testing, importation, or interstate movement of the subject Laurate canola lines or their
progeny. However, the importation of the Laurate canola lines and any Laurate canola nursery stock or seeds capable
of propagation is still subject to the restrictions found in APHIS' foreign quarantine notices in 7 CFR part 319. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



An environmental assessment (EA) has been prepared to examine the potential environmental impacts associated with
this determination. The EA was prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA 
(40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR 
part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,
August 31, 1979). Based on that EA, APHIS has reached a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) with regard to its determination
that the Laurate canola lines designated as pCGN3828-212/86-18 and pCGN3828-212/86-23,
and other lines bred from those two transformants by sexual or asexual reproduction involving Mendelian inheritance,
are no longer regulated articles under its regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Copies of the EA and the FONSI are available
upon request from the individual listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

Rural Telephone Bank


Determination of the 1994 Fiscal Year Interest Rates on Rural Telephone Bank Loans



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Rural Telephone Bank, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of 1994 fiscal year interest rates determination.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with 7 CFR 1610.10, the Rural Telephone Bank fiscal year 1994 cost of money rates have been established
as follows: 6.15% and 6.40% for advances from the liquidating account and financing account, respectively (fiscal
year is the period beginning October 1 and ending September 30).



Except for loans approved from October 1, 1987 through December 21, 1987 where borrowers elected to remain at interest
rates set at loan approval, all loan advances made during fiscal year 1994 under bank loans approved prior to fiscal
year 1992 shall bear interest at the rate of 6.15% (the liquidating account rate). All loan advances made during fiscal
year 1994 under bank loans approved during or after fiscal year 1992 shall bear interest at the rate of 6.40% (the financing
account rate).

The calculation of the Bank's cost of money rates for fiscal year 1994 for the liquidating account and the financing
account are provided in Tables 1a and 1b. Since the calculated rates are greater than the minimum rate (5.00%) allowed
under 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(A), the cost of money rates for the liquidating account and financing account are set at 6.15%
and 6.40%, respectively. The methodology required to calculate the cost of money rates is established in 7 CFR 1610.10(c).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (``Credit Reform'') (2 U.S.C. 661a, 

et seq.

) implemented a system to reform the budgetary accounting and management of Federal credit programs. Bank loans approved
on or after October 1, 1991, are accounted for in a different manner than Bank loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992.
As a result, the Bank must calculate two costs of money rates: (1) The cost of money rate for advances made from the liquidating
account (advances made during fiscal year 1994 on loans approved prior to fiscal year 1992) and (2) the cost of money
rate for advances made during fiscal year 1994 on loans approved on or after October 1, 1991 (otherwise referred to
as loans from the financing account).



The cost of money rate methodology is the same for both accounts. It develops a weighted average rate for the Bank's
cost of money considering total fiscal year loan advances; the excess of fiscal year loan advances over amounts received
in the fiscal year from the issuances of Class A, B, and C stocks, debentures and other obligations; and the costs to
the Bank of obtaining funds from these sources.



Sources and Costs of Funds_Liquidating Account



During fiscal year 1994, the Bank was authorized to pay the following dividends: The dividend on Class A stock was 2.00%
as established in amended section 406(c) of the Rural Electrification Act; no dividends were payable on Class B stock
as specified in 7 CFR 1610.10(c); and the dividend on Class C stock was established by the Bank at 7.5%.

In accordance with Section 406(a) of the RE Act, the Bank did not issue Class A stock in fiscal year 1994. Total advances
for the purchase of Class B stock and cash purchases for Class B stock were $2,110,537. Rescissions of loan funds advanced
for Class B stock amounted to $1,679,067. Thus, the amount received by the Bank from the issuance of Class B stock, per
7 CFR 1610.10(c), was $431,470 ($2,110,537-1,679,067). The total amount received by the Bank in fiscal year
1994 from the issuance of Class C stock was $16,590.

The Bank did not issue debentures or any other obligations related to the liquidating account in fiscal year 1994.
Consequently, no cost was incurred related to the issuance of debentures subject to 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(D).

The excess of fiscal year 1994 loan advances from the liquidating account over amounts received from issuances of
stocks, debentures, and other obligations amounted to $54,082,837. The cost associated with this excess is the historical
cost of money rate as defined in 7 U.S.C.  948(b)(3)(D)(v). The calculation of the Bank's historical cost of
money rate for advances from the liquidating account is provided in Table 2a. The methodology required to perform
this calculation is described in 7 CFR 1610.10(c). The cost for money rates for fiscal years 1974 through 1987 are defined
in section 408(b) of the RE Act, as amended by Pub. L. 100-203, and are listed in 7 CFR 1610.10(c) and Table 2a herein.


Sources and Costs of Funds_Financing Account


During fiscal year 1994, the Bank was authorized to pay the following dividends: The dividend on Class A stock was 2.00%
as established in amended section 406(c) of the Rural Electrification Act; on dividends were payable on Class B stock
as specified in 7 CFR 1610.10(c); and the dividend on Class C stock was established by the Bank at 7.5%.
In accordance with Section 406(a) of the RE Act, the Bank did not issue Class A stock in fiscal year 1994. Total advances
for the purchase of Class B stock and cash purchases for Class B stock were $2,714,191. Since there were no rescissions
of loan funds advanced for Class B stock, the amount received by the Bank from the issuance of Class B stock, per 7 CFR
1610.10(c), was $2,714,191. No amounts were received in fiscal year 1994 from the issuance of Class C stock associated
with the financing account.
During fiscal year 1994, issuances of debentures or any other obligations related to the financing account were $17,346,446
at an interest rate of 6.65% and $34,478,473 at an interest rate of 6.77%.
The excess of fiscal year 1994 loan advances from the financing account over amounts received from issuances of stocks,
debentures, and other obligations amounted to $2,299,792. The cost associated with this excess is the historical
cost of money rate as defined in 7 U.S.C. 948(b)(3)(D)(V). The calculation of the Bank's historical cost of money rate
for advances from the financing account is provided in Table 2b. The methodology required to perform this calculation
is described in 7 CFR 1610.10(c).

National Weather Service Modernization and Restructuring




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Commerce is well underway toward completing the largest modernization and restructuring of the
National Weather Service in history. This will result in substantial improvements to weather services provided
nationwide. The Department of Commerce requests comments on service areas where it is believed that current weather
services may be degraded as existing radars are decommissioned or as field offices are closed, consolidated, automated
or relocated during the modernization of the Weather Service.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In this notice, including the Study Guidelines in Appendix 1, the following terms and acronyms have the meaning indicated:





Field office

 means any National Weather Service Office or National Weather Service Forecast Office.



MTC

 means the Modernization Transition Committee established by Section 707 of the Act.



NEXRAD

 means the Next Generation Radar also referred to as the WSR-88D radar.



NIP

 means the National Implementation Plan for the modernization of the Weather Service required by Section 703 of the
Act.



NRC

 means the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.



NWS

 means the National Weather Service.



Secretary

 means the Secretary of Commerce and, with respect to a function under the Act, an officer or employee of the Department
of Commerce authorized to perform the function.



Service Area

 means the geographical area for which an existing field office provides weather services or conducts observations.



Weather service

 means a service or product provided to a service area by a field office.



WSMA

 or 

Act

 means the Weather Service Modernization Act (Pub. L. 102-567, 15 U.S.C. 313n.)

Pursuant to the WSMA, the Secretary has established procedures to ensure that the modernization of the Weather Service
will not result in degradation of weather services currently provided. See 15 C.F.R. part 946 (58 FR 18317; 59 FR 9921).

To strengthen public confidence in these procedures, without unnecessarily delaying the modernization process,
the Department of Commerce has adopted and will apply the Study Guidelines of Appendix 1. These guidelines expand
the opportunity for public participation in the modernization process as provided in these guidelines. The Secretary
has also contracted with the NRC to develop additional independent scientific criteria to identify where weather
services could be degraded as existing radars are decommissioned. The Secretary will apply these additional criteria
as well as other criteria previously recommended by the NRC to ensure that services will not be degraded as radars are
decommissioned or as field offices are closed, consolidated, relocated or automated.

The Department of Commerce requests comments where commentors believe that current weather services may be degraded
as existing radars are decommissioned or as field offices are closed, consolidated, automated or relocated.

Commentors are requested to state the basis for their belief as fully as possible, and include a description of local
weather characteristics (including unique weather phenomena) and weather related concerns which involve a substantial
threat to public safety which they believe affect the weather services provided.

Comments received prior to the deadline will be forwarded promptly to the NRC. The full procedures the Secretary will
follow regarding reviewing the adequacy of the nation's overall NEXRAD coverage, to ensure a solid scientific and
technical basis for the decision making process, and to assure meaningful participation by the public are set forth
in the Study Guidelines in Appendix 1.

Appendix 1_Study Guidelines 


Section 1: 


(a) Modernization of the NWS is essential to public safety and should proceed without unnecessary delay. 
(b) The WSMA establishes procedures that assure that the modernization of the NWS will not result in the degradation
of weather services currently provided to the public but these procedures do not provide for the independent review
of decisions until shortly after the actual event; and 
(c) It is appropriate to review the adequacy of the nation's overall NEXRAD coverage, to ensure a solid scientific
and technical basis for the decision making process, and to assure meaningful participation by the public. 


Section 2:


The purposes of this document are to provide the fullest opportunity for public participation in the modernization
process without unduly delaying this process; and to ensure, through the application of independent scientific
criteria that weather services provided in each service area will not be degraded as obsolete radars are decommissioned
or as field offices are closed, consolidated, relocated or automated. 


Section 3:


The definitions contained in section 702 of the WSMA shall apply to the terms in this document. In addition, the term
``area of concern'' means a service area identified in a timely public comment in response to the 

Federal Register 

notice required by section 4 of this document. 


Section 4:


Within 30 days the Secretary shall publish a notice in the 

Federal Register 

requesting comments on service areas where it is believed that current weather services may be degraded as existing
radars are decommissioned or as field offices are closed, consolidated, automated or relocated. The notice shall
allow 60 days for the submission of comments. Persons submitting comments shall state the basis for their belief as
fully as possible, and shall include a description of local weather characteristics (including unique weather phenomena)
and weather related concerns which involve a substantial threat to public safety which they believe affect the weather
services provided in areas of concern. All comments received by the Secretary shall be provided promptly to the NRC.



Section 5:


(a) Within 30 days the Secretary shall contract with the NRC, or amend an existing contract as necessary, to conduct
an independent scientific assessment of proposed NEXRAD radar coverage and consolidation of Field Offices in terms
of ``no degradation of services'' and to establish criteria for identifying service areas where the decommissioning
of existing radars could degrade service to affected users. 
(b) Within 180 days, but not earlier than 60 days after the close of the comment period provided in the 

Federal Register 

notice of section 4, the NRC shall furnish to the Secretary the assessment and criteria required by subsection (a)
together with recommendations regarding the need and timing for any future independent studies by the NRC. 


Section 6:


(a) After receipt of the NRC report, the Secretary shall apply the NRC criteria and other applicable criteria previously
approved by the NRC pursuant to the WSMA to areas of concerns and, taking into account the comments received in response
to the 

Federal Register 

notice of section 4, identify those where he/she believes that actions to decommission a radar or to close, consolidate,
relocate, automate a field office noted in the current version of the NIP are not likely to satisfy the requirements
of the WSMA. The Secretary shall report the results of his/her review to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
of the Senate and the Committee on Science, Space and Technology of the House of Representatives. If the Secretary
believes that additional radars are needed to satisfy the requirements of the WSMA, he/she shall also identify the
number and location of the radars needed. 
(b) Submission of a report under this section shall not relieve the Secretary from the requirement of section 706(b)
of the WSMA to certify no degradation of service when she/he restructures a field office. If the field office is located
in an area of concern, the Secretary shall provide all comments relating to that area of concern received pursuant
to section 4 of the MTC during the certification process. 


Section 7:


(a) The Secretary shall not close, consolidate, relocate, or automate any field office or decommission any NWS radar
until the public has had an opportunity to identify areas of concern. 
(b) Regardless of the contents of the most recent NIP, the Secretary shall not decommission a radar or close, consolidate,
automate or relocate a field office in an area of concern unless_
(1) The Secretary has reported to the Congress as provided in section 6 that he/she believes that the action contemplated
would not result in a degradation of service; and 
(2) 30 days have expired from the date the report was submitted to Congress.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List commodities and 
a service to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons 
who are blind or have other severe disabilities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 5, 12 and September 16, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published
notices (59 F.R. 40010, 41434 and 47615) of proposed additions 
to the Procurement List. 


After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the 
additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee 
has determined that the commodities and service listed below are 
suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 
46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4.
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
commodities and service to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodities and service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodities and service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities and service 
proposed for addition to the Procurement List.

Notice of Intent to Award a Grant Based Upon Acceptance of an Unsolicited Application.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office through the Carlsbad Area Office, pursuant to DOE Financial
Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(F) announces its intent to award a grant to the Carlsbad Department of Development.
The purpose of the grant is to analyze and define training needs for DOE Environmental Management Staff in conjunction
with the needs of the community in southeastern New Mexico.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Carlsbad Department of Development (DOD) will lead a coalition of regional stakeholders and resource centers
to evaluate and define the human resources and training needs of the Department of Energy, other federal agencies,
and the private sector in southeast New Mexico. The DOD will develop viable training plans which will address DOE's
regional training needs as well as other federal agencies and the private sector. The training plans will also address
job retraining, technology transfer/commercialization, and regional economic development. The DOD will use business
planning and market assessments of needs and capabilities.



The unsolicited application for support of this activity has been accepted by DOE because of what was deemed to be the
project's overall merit. DOE will benefit by having its training requirements identified and integrated with available
regional resources. This activity will cause the community to properly research and plan for future business opportunities,
and to diversify the existing economic base in preparation of completion of Waste Isolation Plant operations.
The project period for the award is nine months, expected to begin 15 days after publication to allow for public comment.
DOE plans to fund the project in the amount of $300,000.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent
burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law No. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), conducts a presurvey consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity
to comment on proposed reporting forms. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be provided in the desired
format, reporting burden is minimized, reporting forms are clearly understood, and the effect of collection requirements
on respondents can be properly assessed. 


Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed Form EIA-1605, ``Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse
Gases'' and its short version Form EIA-1605EZ, ``Short Form for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases.''


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 
II. Current Actions 
III. Request for Comments 


I. Background


In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Public Law No. 93-275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Public Law 
No. 95-91), EIA is obliged to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program.
As part of this program, EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related
to energy. 


Legislative authority


The legislative authority for this voluntary program is section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law
92-486) which states: 
(b) VOLUNTARY REPORTING_
(1) ISSUANCE OF GUIDELINES. Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall,
after opportunity for public comment, issue guidelines for the voluntary collection and reporting of information
on sources of greenhouse gases. Such guidelines shall establish procedures for the accurate voluntary reporting
of information on_
(A) greenhouse gas emissions_ 
(i) for the baseline period of 1987 through 1990; and 
(ii) for subsequent calendar years on an annual basis; 
(B) annual reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon fixation achieved through any measures, including
fuel switching, forest management practices, tree planting, use of renewable energy, manufacture or use of vehicles
with reduced greenhouse gas emissions, appliance efficiency, methane recovery, cogeneration, chlorofluorocarbon
capture and replacement, and power plant heat rate improvement; 
(C) reductions in greenhouse gas emissions achieved as a result of_ 
(i) voluntary reductions; 
(ii) plant or facility closings; and 
(iii) State or Federal requirements; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941104-2-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941104-2-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(D) an aggregate calculation of greenhouse gas emissions by each reporting entity. 
Such guidelines shall also establish procedures for taking into account the differential radiative activity and
atmospheric lifetimes of each greenhouse gas. 
(2) REPORTING PROCEDURES. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration shall develop forms for voluntary
reporting under the guidelines established under paragraph (1), and shall make such forms available to entities
wishing to report such information. Persons reporting under this subsection shall certify the accuracy of the information
reported. 
(3) CONFIDENTIALITY. Trade secret and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential shall
be protected as provided in section 552 (b)(4) of title 5, United States Code. 
(4) ESTABLISHMENT OF DATABASE. Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary through
the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration shall establish a database comprised of information
voluntarily reported under this subsection. Such information may be used by the reporting entity to demonstrate
achieved reductions of greenhouse gases. 


II. Current Actions


Form EIA-1605 and its shorter version Form EIA-1605EZ are consistent with the Guidelines established
by the Secretary of Energy under Section 1605(b), entitled 

Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases under Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992: General Guidelines
and Supporting Documents. 


III. Request for Comments


Prospective reporters and other interested parties should comment on the actions discussed in Items I and II above.
The following general questions are provided to assist in the preparation of responses. 
As a potential respondent:

 
A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions require clarification?

B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions? 
C. Assuming the typical long-form reporter files only domestic data and uses Schedules I, III, IV and three sections
of Schedule II, the reporting burden for Form EIA-1605 is estimated to average 20 hours per response. The estimate
for the typical EZ reporter is 2 hours per response. How much time, including time for reviewing instructions, searching
existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of
information, do you estimate it will require you and/or the typical reporter described above to complete and submit
Form EIA-1605? Please answer this same question for the typical reporter using Form EIA-1605EZ. 
D. What is the estimated cost of completing this form, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the
data collection? Direct costs should include all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributable to
providing this information. Please provide separate cost estimates for Form EIA-1605, ``Voluntary Reporting
of Greenhouse Gases,'' and Form EIA-1605EZ, ``Short Form for Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases.'' 
E. How can the forms be improved? 
F. Do you know of any other Federal, state, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency,
the data element(s), and the means of collection. 


As a potential user:

 
A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form(s)? 
B. For what purpose would you use the data? Be specific. 
C. How could the form(s) be improved to better meet your specific needs? 
D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are their deficiencies and/or strengths? 
Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for Office of Management
and Budget approval of the form. Written comments received in response to this notice will be available for public
inspection in the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Office.





Statutory Authority:

First Revised Sheet No. 212d



In compliance with the Commission's order issued in this proceeding on September 29, 1994, Southern has revised its
new procedures regarding eligible deliveries for industrial customers behind Small Shipper delivery points and
has reinstated its previous procedure of reallocating IT volumes to a Small Shipper's one-part, firm transportation

<DOCTITLE>Southern Natural Gas Company; One-
Year Status Report</DOCTITLE>



October 31, 1994.




Take notice that on October 27, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing a one-year status
report as required by the Commission's September 3, 1993 order in Docket Nos. RS92-10, et al. Southern states
that the filing reports on (1) Southern's progress in implementing intraday nominations, and (2) the operation of
its penalty waiver provision during the first year of operations.

Southern states that it is making a transportation tariff filing today in a separate docket which will implement intra-day
nomination procedures effective December 5, 1994. Southern's report also discusses the systemwide and shipper-specific
penalty waivers granted during its first year and concludes that the waiver provision operated effectively to avoid
penalizing Shippers who were trying to take appropriate actions, but incurred penalties as a result of late or faulty
information.

Southern states that copies of the filing will be served on parties to Docket Nos. RS92-10, et al., and all shippers
and interested state commissions.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


October 31, 1994.


Take notice that on October 27, 1994 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) tendered for filing
as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing.
The proposed effective date of these revised tariff sheets is December 1, 1994.
Texas Eastern states that the tariff sheets are being filed (i) pursuant to Section 15.6, Applicable Shrinkage Adjustment
(ASA), contained in the General Terms and Conditions of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No.
1, and (ii) pursuant to Texas Eastern's Docket No. RP85-177-119, 

et al.

 Stipulation and Agreement (Settlement) filed January 31, 1994 and approved by Commission orders issued May 12, 1994
and July 13, 1994. 
Texas Eastern states that the filing constitutes Texas Eastern's second regular annual ASA filing under Section
15.6 for the purpose of reflecting changes in its requirement to retain gas in-kind in compensation for the quantities
of gas used to provide service for its customers and Texas Eastern's first annual filing pursuant to the Settlement
to (i) calculate revised reductions to its shrinkage factors to reflect projected purchases under Appendix C contracts
under the Settlement, (ii) calculate revised Spot Fuel Components as provided in Section 5.08 of the Settlement,
and (iii) report the annual reconciliation of the interruptible revenues under Rate Schedules IT-1, PTI and
ISS-1 as well as for Rate Schedule LLIT and for Rate Schedule VKIT. In addition, this filing provides information
with respect to certain elements of the Settlement which Texas Eastern believes to be of interest to its customers
and the Commission. 
Texas Eastern states that the changes proposed to become effective beginning December 1, 1994 consist of (1) revised
ASA Percentages designed to retain in-kind the projected quantities of gas required for the operation of Texas Eastern's
system in providing service to its customers for each seasonal calendar period, Winter (December 1, 1993-March
31, 1994), Spring Shoulder (April 1, 1994-May 31, 1994), Summer (June 1, 1994-September 30, 1994) and
Fall Shoulder (October 1, 1994-November 30, 1994) and (2) the ASA Surcharge designed to recover the net monetary
value recorded in the Applicable Shrinkage Deferred Account as of August 31, 1994 and (3) Spot Fuel Components designed
to recover the Spot Costs, as defined in the Settlement, projected to be incurred over the twelve month period beginning
December 1, 1994 and the balance recorded in the Spot Fuel Deferred Account as of August 31, 1994. 
Texas Eastern states that the filing reflects an overall average decrease of approximately 12.3 percent in its in-kind
retention factors and an average increase in usage rates of approximately 2 cents due to the revised ASA Surcharges
and the revised Spot Fuel Components. 
Texas Eastern states that the filing also includes, for information purposes only detailed supporting information
for the balances as of August 31, 1994 in the Non-Spot Fuel Deferred Account and the Account No. 858 Costs Deferred Account
established pursuant to the Settlement. 
Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all Firm Customers of Texas Eastern and Interested
State Commission, as well as all current interruptible shippers and all parties to the Settlement in Docket No. RP85-177-119,


et al.

 Texas Eastern states that in accordance with the Settlement, with respect to those elements of the tariff sheets pursuant
to the Settlement, Texas Eastern's filing is subject to refund or adjustment only to the extent not in compliance with
the Settlement. 
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November
7, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.

Title:

 National Survey of Radiological Laboratory Capability (EPA ICR No. 1731.01). 


Abstract:

 This ICR is a new information collection to survey the capabilities of radio-analytical laboratories in support
of EPA's responsibilities under the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan. The plan tasks EPA with providing
radio-analyses of environmental samples collected during a Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center
(FRMAC) response to a radiological accident. The information is needed to ensure that, in the event that EPA's capabilities
become overburdened during a FRMAC response, an outside laboratory can be expeditiously identified and their analytical
support voluntarily enlisted. 
EPA will distribute questionnaires and subsequently follow-up with telephonic instructions to participating
laboratories. Recipients will be asked to provide information that includes: (1) Name, address, location and point
of contact information, (2) fixed/mobile capabilities, (3) radionuclide/sample type analysis capabilities,
and (4) response time and availability. 
The EPA will store the information on a database, designed to be transported to radiological accident sites and used
by FRMAC for selecting laboratories to augment EPA's capabilities.


Burden Statement:

 Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 30 minutes per response, including
reviewing instructions, searching existing information sources, completing and reviewing the collection of information,
and submitting the information to EPA.


Respondents:

 Government and private radio-analytical laboratories. 


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 350.

ACTION:

 Notice of draft permits and permit modifications. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment 5-year sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) compliance plans which either amend previously issued Phase I Acid Rain Permits, or will, if approved, result in
the issuance of a Phase I Acid Rain Permit to sources not previously required to have one. These actions are taken in
accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the SO

1. The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned applications filed by WilTel International, Inc.
(``WilTel''), MCI Telecommunications Corporation (``MCI''), LDDS Communications, Inc. (``LDDS'') , Sprint Communications
Company L.P. (``Sprint''), and IDB WorldCom Services, Inc. (``IDB'') requesting authority pursuant to Section
214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to establish channels of communication between the United States
and Cuba for the provision of direct services. The applications were placed on the Commission's public notice. AT&T
filed petitions to deny against all of the applications. For the reasons stated below, we grant the applications.




Background 



2. WilTel requests authority to acquire by lease from Comsat and operate 120 64-kbps digital satellite voice-grade
circuits, and up to two satellite video transmission circuits on an occasional use basis, provided via the INTELSAT
Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR) satellite at 335
  E.L., for the provision of international message telephone service (``IMTS'') and other switched services
 and for international private line service between the United States and Cuba. In an amendment to its application,
WilTel also requests the flexibility to use either the INTELSAT and/or an Intersputnik satellite. WilTel states
the proposed satellite facilities will be located between an appropriately authorized U.S. international fixed-satellite
earth station and the appropriate satellite.

3. MCI requests authority to acquire by lease from Comsat and operate 150 64-kbps satellite circuits
 between the Mount Jackson, Virginia earth station and an appropriate INTELSAT-AOR satellite, together with
the necessary connecting facilities between the Mt. Jackson earth station and MCI's operating centers at Pottstown,
Pennsylvania and San Antonio, Texas, for the provision of all of MCI's authorized services, including IMTS, between
the United States and Cuba.





4. LDDS requests authority to acquire by lease from Comsat and operate 150 64-kbps satellite circuits between an appropriately
authorized east coast earth station and an appropriate INTELSAT-AOR satellite for the provision of IMTS and
private line services between the United States and Cuba. In an amendment to its application, LDDS also requests authority
to use interchangeably the 150 circuits with the Intersputnik, or Columbia Communication Corporation (``Columbia'')
satellites in addition to the INTELSAT satellites.

5. Sprint requests authority to acquire by lease from Comsat and operate 120 voice-grade satellite circuits
 between the Orion international Standard A earth station located at Shenandoah, Virginia and the INTELSAT-AOR
satellite at 335
  E.L., connecting with its operating center in New York, New York, by using its own facilities. Sprint proposes
to use these facilities to furnish all of Sprint's authorized services, including IMTS, between the United States
and Cuba.





6. IDB requests authority to acquire by lease from Comsat and operate 120 voice-grade satellite circuits
 between an appropriately authorized international earth station in the United States and either an INTELSAT-AOR
satellite or the Intersputnik satellite located at 14
  W.L. (``Statsionar 4''), together with the necessary connecting facilities between the earth station and
an operating center in New York, New York, for the provision of IMTS between the United States and Cuba.





7. All of the applicants state that they have reached an agreement with EMTELCUBA of Cuba, to provide the matching facilities
from the satellite's mid-point to an earth station in Cuba. Initially, under the terms of the agreements, EMTELCUBA
agreed with each applicant to a 50/50 split of a $1.20 per minute accounting rate for switched traffic, and a $4.85 surcharge
per call for collect calls to be paid to the originating carrier. All of the applicants state that this rate is consistent
with the U.S. Department of State's policy guidelines (``Policy Guidelines'').
 They also state that they will initiate service within one year.





8. The applicants state that that public interest would be served by a grant of their applications because it will result
in the rapid introduction of new lines of telecommunications between the United States and Cuba. They state that an
immediate and large demand exists for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba, and
their proposed services will help meet that demand within the regulatory framework established by the Cuban Democracy
Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C.  6002 et seq.).

9. AT&T filed a petition to deny against each of these applications stating that because of the $4.85 surcharge
per call for collect calls, the applicants' accounting rate agreements with EMTELCUBA conflict with the International
Settlements Policy (``ISP'') and with the directive of the Commission that U.S. carriers negotiate to achieve cost-based
accounting rates with foreign administrations.
 All of the applicants individually filed oppositions to AT&T's petition. They unanimously agreed that an ISP
waiver under  64.1001 of the Commission's Rules is not required because AT&T's operating agreement with
the Cuban administration expired nearly four years ago. Therefore, the applicants argue that because AT&T's
operating agreement is no longer in force, their proposed arrangements do not depart from any current arrangements,
and no ISP waiver is required. In addition, WilTel, MCI, and LDDS argue that the Policy Guidelines do not prohibit collect
surcharges, and that the $4.85 surcharge per call is appropriate and not excessive for collect calls.

10. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed us of the Executive Branch's general policy
guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides
that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.''
 Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) the proposals must have the potential to be operational
within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute
accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4)
proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the United States and Cuba; and (5) carriers
shall report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year
anniversary of the notification by the Commission in the 

Federal Register.




11. In accordance with the Policy Guidelines, we forwarded copies of the above-captioned applications to the Department
of State and requested that it advise us as to its views. Pursuant to our request, the Department of State issued a follow-up
letter dated May 23, 1994.
 The Department of State found the IMTS portions of the applications to be fully consistent with the Policy Guidelines
except for the $4.85 surcharge per call for collect calls. The Department found that the proposed surcharge was unreasonable
and unjustified. It observed that the proposed surcharge far exceeded the approximately $.60 average rate for all
countries in the region and the prevalent $1.00 rate for those countries having a surcharge. Therefore, the Department
of State had no objection to our approval of the IMTS applications without the $4.85 surcharge provision. The Department
of State, however, did state that it would favorably consider a surcharge provision that is determined by us to be based
on costs, other international norms and practices, relevant ITU Recommendations, and our ISP.




12. In light of the Department of State's letter, and our own review of the applications, we concluded that we would
not process the applications as filed because of the agreements with EMTELCUBA for the $4.85 surcharge. Rather than
dismiss the applications, we gave the applicants the opportunity to amend their applications to reflect a new agreement
renegotiated with EMTELCUBA that provides for either no surcharge for collect calls, or a surcharge that was reasonable
and justified.





13. On September 6, 1994, LDDS amended its application to include a new operating agreement with EMTELCUBA that reflected
a reduction in the proposed surcharge of $4.85 per call for collect calls to $1.00 per call. A week later, the other four
applicants similarly amended their applications to reflect a $1.00 per call surcharge. We sent copies of these amendments
to the Department of State, and requested their advice as to whether these new surcharges were in compliance with the
Policy Guidelines.
 On October 3, 1994, we received a letter from the Department of State expressing its view that the new $1.00 per call
surcharge was in compliance with the Policy Guidelines.
 The Department of State stated that the new proposed surcharge of $1.00 per call appears consistent with international
norms and practices, relevant ITU Recommendations, and current surcharge rates in the region. The Department of
State notes, however, that it hopes that this and other surcharge rates will generally be reduced or eliminated in
the future.





14. Upon our own review of the applications, we agree with the Department of State that the five applicants' amended
operating agreements with EMTELCUBA are in compliance with the Policy Guidelines. The $1.00 per call surcharge for
collect calls is within the range of surcharges that other countries in the Caribbean region have for these types of
calls, and reflects the cost to the originating country of providing the service. Accordingly, we find that this new
surcharge is reasonable and justified. It is our desire, however, as it is the Department of States's, that this surcharge
eventually be reduced or eliminated in the future.

15. In addition, we find AT&T's arguments that the $4.85 per call surcharge is in violation of the ISP to be inapposite.
AT&T's arguments were based on the original $4.85 per call surcharge, not the amended $1.00 per call surcharge.
Further, we note that AT&T's petition stated that a $1.00 surcharge would be consistent with industry practices.
Finally, we have not received any additional pleadings from AT&T arguing that the amended operating agreements
are in violation of our ISP. 
 
16. We find that a grant of the above-captioned five applications will serve the public interest subject to the conditions
set forth below. These applications are consistent with the Executive Branch's Policy Guidelines. The applicants
state that they will initiate service within one year, and expect to initiate service shortly after all requisite
regulatory approvals have been obtained. To the extent the applicants propose to use the INTELSAT, Intersputnick,
and Columbia satellite facilities and appropriately authorized existing earth station facilities, we find these
proposals satisfy the requirement that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services
necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba. 
 
17. Accordingly, it is ordered that application File No. I-T-C-94-227 is granted and WilTel
is authorized to: 
 
a. Lease from Comsat and operate up to 120 64-kbps satellite circuits, and up to two satellite video transmission circuits
on an occasional use basis, between an appropriately authorized U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station
and the INTELSAT-AOR satellite at 335
  E.L., together with the necessary domestic connecting facilities between the earth station and WilTel's operating
center, connecting with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA;
or 
 
b. In lieu of the INTELSAT circuits, establish up to 120 64-kbps satellite circuits between an appropriately authorized
U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station and an appropriate Intersputnik satellite, together with the
necessary domestic connecting facilities between the earth station and WilTel's operating center, connecting
with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; and 
 
c. Use the facilities in either (a) or (b) above to provide IMTS and other switched services (including facsimile,
data and video transmission services), and international private line services, between the United States and Cuba.

 
18. It is further ordered that application File No. I-T-C-94-228 is granted and MCI is authorized
to: 
 
a. Lease from Comsat and operate 150 64-kbps satellite circuits between the Mount Jackson, Virginia earth station
and an appropriate INTELSAT-AOR satellite, together with the necessary connecting facilities between the
Mt. Jackson earth station and MCI's operating centers at Pottstown, Pennsylvania and San Antonio, Texas, connecting
with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; and 
 
b. Use the above facilities to provide all of MCI's authorized services, including IMTS, between the United States
and Cuba. 
 
19. It is further ordered that application File No. I-T-C-94-299 is granted and LDDS is authorized
to: 
 
a. Lease from Comsat and operate 150 64-kbps satellite circuits between an appropriately authorized U.S. international
fixed-satellite earth station and an appropriate INTELSAT-AOR satellite, together with the necessary domestic
connecting facilities between the earth station and LDDS's operating center, connecting with similar circuits
between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; or 
 
b. In lieu of the INTELSAT circuits, establish up to 150 64-kbps satellite circuits, between an appropriately authorized
U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station and an appropriate Intersputnik or Columbia satellite, together
with the necessary domestic connecting facilities between the earth station and LDDS's operating center, connecting
with similar circuits between the satellite and an earth station in Cuba, furnished by EMTELCUBA; and 
 
c. Use the facilities in either (a) or (b) above to provide IMTS and private line services between the United States
and Cuba.

Agency Forms Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Clearance



Each Friday the Public Health Service (PHS) publishes a list of information collection requests it has submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance in compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.

 Notice of public meeting. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, this notice announces a meeting of the 1994 Advisory Council
on Social Security (the Council). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Purpose 



Under section 706 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary)
appoints the Council every 4 years. The Council examines issues affecting the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs, as well as the Medicare program and impacts on the Medicaid program, which
were created under the Act. 

In addition, the Secretary has asked the Council specifically to address the following: 

 Social Security financing issues, including developing recommendations for improving the long-range financial
status of the OASDI programs; and

 General program issues such as the relative equity and adequacy of Social Security benefits for persons at
various income levels, in various family situations, and various age cohorts, taking into account such factors as
the increased labor force participation of women, lower marriage rates, increased likelihood of divorce, and higher
poverty rates of aged women. 

In addressing these topics, the Secretary suggested that the Council may wish to analyze the relative roles of the
public and private sectors in providing retirement income, how policies in both sectors affect retirement decisions
and the economic status of the elderly, and how the disability insurance program provisions and the availability
of health insurance and health care costs affect such matters. 

The Council is composed of 12 members in addition to the chairman: Robert Ball, Joan Bok, Ann Combs, Edith Fierst, Gloria
Johnson, Thomas Jones, George Kourpias, Sylvester Schieber, Gerald Shea, Marc Twinney, Fidel Vargas, and Carolyn
Weaver. The chairman is Edward Gramlich. 

The Council met previously on June 24-25 (59 FR 30367), July 29, 1994 (59 FR 35942), September 29-30 (59
FR 47146) and October 21-22 (59 FR 51451). 



II. Agenda 



The following topics will be presented and discussed: 

 Household equivalency scales and a comparison of relative well-being of the elderly; 

 Analysis of the Consumer Price Index and its effect on Social Security benefit adjustments; 

 Adequacy and equity of Social Security benefits, particularly as they affect women; 

 Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statements; and 

 Disability insurance benefits. 

The agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate. 

The meeting is open to the public to the extent that space is available. Interpreter services for persons with hearing
impairments will be provided. A transcript of the meeting will be available to the public on an at-cost-of-duplication
basis. The transcript can be ordered from the Executive Director of the Council.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless 

v.

 Veterans Administration

, No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).




Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to William
Molster at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.

Restoration of Nearshore Breeding Seabird Colonies on the Central California Coast


Executive Summary


Between January 28 and February 4, 1986 the transportation barge 

Apex Houston

 discharged an undetermined amount of San Joaquin Valley crude oil while in transit from San Francisco Bay to the Long
Beach Harbor. The oil spill caused damage to natural resources from San Francisco to the Big Sur coast. Approximately
9,000 seabirds were killed, including 6,000 common murres (

Uria aalge

), in addition to other aquatic life in and around the coastal waters of central California. State and Federal personnel
responded to the spill and assessed damages as a result of the spill.
The State and Federal natural resource trustees commenced litigation in this matter against potentially responsible
parties in January 1989. The complaints alleged claims for natural resource damages, costs, and penalties pursuant
to the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.  1251 et seq., Title III of the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, 16 U.S.C.  1431
et seq. (formerly the National Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, ``MPRSA''), the California Harbors
& Navigation Code   293 and 294, and other State Law.
In August, 1994 the parties settled this matter in a Consent Decree entered by the Federal District Court for the Northern
District of California for $6.4 million. As part of this natural resources damage settlement, approximately $4.92
million has been allocated for the restoration of common murres. An additional $500,000 has been allocated for the
acquisition of habitat for the Federally endangered marbled murrelet (

Brachyramphus marmoratus

), another species impacted by the spill. The marbled murrelet project will be the subject of future restoration planning
efforts in this case and is not included in this plan. The remainder of the $6.4 million collected in the settlement
is for penalties and costs incurred as a result of the spill. A Trustee Council, comprised of representatives of each
Trustee (California Department of Fish and Game, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service) was established to review and select restoration actions. This Trustee Council will meet regularly
during the duration of the project to review progress and make necessary changes.
The goal of this effort is to restore common murres in areas where colonies were extirpated or severely depleted by
the 

Apex Houston

 oil spill. Social attractants (decoys and recorded vocalizations of common murres) will be used to attract common
murres to nest at historic nearshore colonies in the vicinity of San Francisco and Monterey. Behavior and phenology
of common murres will be monitored at these sites and at reference sites at Point Reyes and the Farallon Islands to determine
when the goal has been met. This project may take approximately 10 years to achieve success because common murres have
inherently low reproductive rates and do not breed until they are several years old
.

Restoration of Nearshore Breeding Seabird Colonies on the Central California Coast



Introduction



Nearshore breeding colonies of common murres (

Uria aalge

) throughout central coastal California decreased by 60% between 1980 and 1986 (Takekawa et al. 1990). This population
decline was attributed to high mortality from gill-net fishing, oil spills (including the Apex Houston spill), and
a severe El Nino-Southern Oscillation event in 1982-1983 (Takekawa et al. 1990, Swartzman and Carter 1991).
The 

Apex Houston

 oil spill, which occurred principally between San Francisco and the Monterey Peninsula, killed nearly 9,000 seabirds
in February 1986 (Siskin et al. 1993). These mortalities included approximately 1,293 rhinoceros auklets (

Cerorhinca monocerata

), 180 small alcids, 12 marbled murrelets (

Brachyramphus marmoratus

), and 1,206 other birds (including loons, grebes, scoters, cormorants, shorebirds, and gulls) killed as a result
of the spill (Siskin et al. 1993). In addition, approximately 6,000 common murres were killed (Siskin et al. 1993).
The common murre colony at Devil's Slide Rock was found to be abandoned, subcolonies at Castle Rocks disappeared,
and other central coastal breeding sites (e.g., Hurricane Point Rocks, Point Reyes) were greatly reduced after the
spill (Takekawa et al. 1990, Swartzman and Carter 1991)(Figure 1).

In the early 1900's, common murres bred at Prince Island in southern California (Carter et al. 1992), However, the
central coastal California population currently represents the southernmost range for breeding common murres
in the Pacific. Future oil spills and other catastrophic events (e.g., disease, predation, climate change) could
result in the extirpation of this population as well as a reduction in the species' geographic range. The restoration
of former common murre colonies would aid in securing the central coastal California common murre population and
would spread the risk of future disasters among colony sites over a wider range of the California coast.

The goal of this project is to recolonize common murres at historic breeding colonies in central California. The project
will be conducted over approximately 10 years. A total of $4.92 million is available for this project.



Purpose



The restoration funds were recovered under the Clean Water Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the California
Harbors & Navigation Code   293 and 294, and other State law. A Trustee Council, comprised of representatives
of each Trustee, was established to review and select restoration actions. As part of the settlement in the 

Apex Houston

 litigation, approximately $4.92 million has been allocated for the restoration of common murre colonies that suffered
damage from the 

Apex Houston

 oil spill. This project should protect the central California common murre populaton. This will be achieved by restoring
this population to a larger part of its historic range and spreading the risk of future catastrophic events (e.g. oil
spills, disease, storms) between more colony sites and over a broader section of the California coast.

Proposed Restoration Alternatives



Alternatives Considered



Numerous studies have shown that oil spills impact coastal marine ecosystems by decreasing the species diversity,
reducing genetic variability, disrupting food chains, and modifying community structure. However, human intervention
in the form of restoration projects can promote the recovery of resources impacted by oil spills. Therefore, the Trustees
concentrated their damage assessment and restoration efforts on the recovery of seabird populations, especially
alcids, impacted by the 

Apex Houston

 oil spill.

Alternatives considered for seabird restoration included active recolonization/restoration projects and habitat
acquisition projects. Alternatives were compared based on their monetary costs, benefits to local populations
of the impacted species, and location relative to impacted areas.

Recolonization/restoration efforts were considered for common murres and rhinoceros auklets, two seabird species
that suffered high mortality as a result of the spill. The rhinoceros auklet project involved use of artificial nest
sites to enhance breeding populations along the central California coast. The common murre recolonization project
(described herein for public comment) was given higher priority because its potential benefits were linked more
closely to the injuries caused by the spill. Most of the impacted common murres came from local colonies, whereas many
of the dead auklets were wintering birds that nest north of the impacted area. A third restoration project involving
construction of a seabird breeding and rehabilitation facility was rejected because its cost was prohibitive relative
to settlement funds.

Four habitat acquisition projects were considered: purchase of Cape Vizcaino in northern Mendocino County to protect
nesting seabirds, purchase of coastal land near Castle Rock to protect a mainland colony of common murres, purchase
of lands within San Francisco Bay, and purchase of marbled murrelet nesting habitat along the central California
coast. The first three projects were given lower priorities because they were outside of the area impacted by the spill
(Cape Vizcaino), were too costly (mainland site near Castle Rock), or were beneficial primarily to species that were
not affected by the spill (sites in San Francisco Bay). A restoration plan describing the marbled murrelet habitat
acquisition project will be made public at a later date.



Preferred Alternative: Recolonization of Impacted Common Murre Colonies



The project the Trustee's prefer and on which public comment is invited is the recolonization of common murre colonies
at Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks in San Mateo County and Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks in Monterey County.



A. Devil's Slide and San Pedro Rocks Common Murre Recolonization: Recolonize Common Murres at Devil's Slide and San
Pedro Rocks (San Mateo County, California) Using Social Attraction Methods (Decoys and Recorded Vocalizations)
and Develop Reference Information Needed To Evaluate and Refine Restoration Efforts





Location(s):

 Devil's Slide and San Pedro Rocks, San Mateo County, California; Point Reyes area (Point Reyes, Point Resistance,
Double Point, and Miller Point rocks), Marin County, California; Farallon Islands, San Francisco County, California



Justification:

 The recolonization of abandoned common murre colonies in central California will contribute to the restoration
of this seabird's historic geographic range. This population sustained severe losses from commercial and subsistence
egging in the 1800's and early 1900's, from chronic oil pollution and spills in the early to mid 1900's, and from chronic
oil spills and gill-netting in the 1980's and 1990's. Common murres were last recorded breeding at San Pedro Rock in
1909, when the colony was in the process of being extirpated by egg collectors (Ray 1909). The 

Apex Houston

 spill in 1986 contributed significantly to the loss of the Devil's Slide Rock colony near San Francisco. The San Pedro
and Devil's Slide Rocks colonies are in close proximity and constitute the only common murre colonies between San
Francisco and Monterey. This is a large portion of the range of the central California common murre population.

Given the current depleted condition of the common murre population, extirpated colonies are not likely to be reestablished
in the foreseeable future without human assistance. The San Pedro Rock colony has not recolonized over the past 85
years and the Devil's Slide Rock colony has not been recolonized in the 8 years following the 

Apex Houston

 spill. Similarly, the Prince Island colony in southern California has not been recolonized since extirpation in
the early 1900's (Carter et al. 1992). Furthermore, all six nearshore colonies in central California have remained
severely depleted since the mid-1980's. The reduction of the geographic range and small numbers of common murres
in central California increases the risk for extinction for the central California population.

Studies of seabird colony formation in Maine demonstrated that recolonization can be achieved using social attractants
(Kress 1978, Kress and Nettleship 1988, and Kress et al. 1991). The use of decoys and tape recordings has attracted
prospecting seabirds, which have bred once a threshold has been reached. These techniques have assisted in the recolonization
by several species of colonial nesting seabirds (Podolsky 1985; Podolsky and Kress 1989, 1991). Preliminary efforts
at recolonizing common murres in Maine in 1992-1994 have attracted common murres during the breeding season
(S. Kress, pers. comm.). However, social attraction techniques must be applied for many years before breeding begins
and a self-sustaining breeding colony can be attained.

In order to refine recolonization methods and evaluate their success, reference information will be needed on the
reproductive biology, behavior, and phenology of common murres at an unmanipulated near-shore site in the local
area. However, little information is available from near-shore colonies in central California. Monitoring attendance
patterns, arrival dates, reproductive success, and behavior of breeding and nonbreeding common murres at accessible
colonies in the Point Reyes area will provide a comparison to evaluate recolonization of Devil's Slide and San Pedro
rocks. The Point Reyes colonies (i.e., Point Reyes, Point Resistance, Double Point, and Miller Point rocks) are the
closest to the recolonization sites, are the most ecological similar, and should provide a reference for what would
normally be expected in a near-shore common murre colony as well as a good comparison with the recolonization site.
The monitoring conducted at these unmanipulated colonies will be used to assess recolonization responses and common
murre activity patterns at recolonization sites, as well as support refinement of recolonization methods.

In addition, unique information will be needed from the common murre colony at the South Farallon Islands at Farallon
National Wildlife Refuge in order to evaluate recolonization responses and refine techniques. Common murre reproductive
success, diet, and breeding biology have been studied for over 20 years at the South Farallon Islands as part of long-term
monitoring of seabird populations required for the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge and other research conducted
by the Point Reyes Bird Observatory (Ainley and Boekelheide 1990, Ainley et al. 1994). As a result of these studies,
a small number of individually marked birds of known age and sex exist at the Farallon Islands. Little information
is available concerning the attendance of breeding and nonbreeding common murres at breeding sites, especially
during winter. Information obtained on individually-marked birds, where age and sex are known, would give a better
understanding of expected time-in-attendance and behavior at breeding sites for adult and subadult common murres
during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Detailed information on common murre attendance and prospecting in
the winter will make it possible to evaluate the significance of winter attendance at the recolonization sites. If
winter attendance is crucial to successful breeding, social attraction methods may have to be deployed for a longer
period. In addition, all accessible subcolonies of common murres at the South Farallon Islands would be examined
for more general attendance patterns throughout the year.

Attendance, breeding biology, and behavior will be monitored during the breeding season in marked and unmarked birds
in plots at the South Farallon Islands so that recolonization responses at recolonization sites can be more effectively
evaluated. Certain colonies with potential for future intensive monitoring efforts may be examined in greater detail,
including reproductive success. This information will be important in evaluating and modifying the social attraction
methods used at the restoration sites. Information that is only available at this larger, more accessible, and closely
monitored common murre colony, including known-aged common murre information, will be used to refine and assess
recolonization efforts.


Proposed Actions: 

Social attraction techniques will be used to recolonize common murres at Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks. The use
of decoys and tape-recordings, similar to those used elsewhere to encourage recolonization by several seabird species,
is proposed (Podolsky and Kress 1989, Kress 1990, Podolsky 1985). Preliminary work will consist of selecting observation
points to view recolonization sites, constructing and installing observation blinds, obtaining access permits,
and purchasing needed equipment. Periodic observations of winter attendance of colonies will also be conducted
in fall and winter 1994-1995. Aerial surveys of central California breeding seabird colonies and periodic
observations of breeding colonies from vantage points will be conducted in the spring and summer of 1995. Additional
aerial reconnaissance of Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks will be conducted to obtain photographs for mapping the
restoration sites. Reconnaissance trips to Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks will take place to determine equipment
and procedures needed to deploy social attraction equipment. Ladders may be installed to allow safe access onto the
colonies for project personnel.
Decoys and audio equipment will be placed on the rocks in fall 1995 before common murres begin to frequent nesting islands.
Recordings of common murre breeding vocalizations will be made at the Farallon NWR. Life-size common murre decoys
will be positioned on suitable nesting habitat. The decoys will be secured to the rock in a fashion that simulates occupied
common murre colonies. Several omnidirectional weather resistant loudspeakers will be positioned at the recolonization
sites. Endless tape loops or compact disks of California common murre vocalizations will be played throughout the
breeding season from December to August. Daily observations of the recolonization sites will begin once decoys have
been deployed and will continue through July. Devil's Slide Rock will be observed from the mainland using a portable
blind and telescope. San Pedro Rock observations will occur from a blind located on the rock, from a boat, and/or from
the mainland.
Data collected will include common murre arrival date, number of common murres present, behavior of common murres,
interaction with other species (e.g., Brandt's Cormorants (

Phalacrocorax penicillatus

)), location on rock, attendance patterns, and presence of predators. Prospecting common murres will be plotted
by location on maps of the recolonization site. One or more aerial photographic censuses of the central California
common murre colonies will be conducted annually between May and June. The censuses will be used to calculate annual
breeding population sizes at the recolonization sites and nearby reference colonies in central California, compare
trends between years, and assist in determining numbers of common murres not visible from the mainland or boats. Social
attractants will be displayed through the breeding season until after common murres normally leave the breeding
sites, usually in August. The decoys and audio equipment will be collected after all bird breeding on the rock has been
completed. Equipment will be checked, cleaned, and replaced as necessary. The equipment will be redeployed during
the following fall before common murres begin to frequent nesting islands. Monitoring of recolonization sites will
continue annually after the first social attractants are deployed. The restoration efforts will be evaluated annually
and revised as necessary.
The breeding behavior and colony attendance of common murres will be monitored at four nearby colonies in the Point
Reyes National Seashore and/or the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary: Point Reyes, Point Resistance,
Double Point Rocks, and Miller Point Rocks. Several variables will be monitored to allow comparison to recolonization
sites, including population size and status, attendance patterns, timing, breeding phenology and success, behavior,
interaction with other species, impacts of predators, and human and other disturbances. The population size and
status would be determined using similar methods employed by Birkhead and Nettleship (1980), Gaston et al. (1983),
Mudge (1988), and Hatch and Hatch (1989). Only subcolonies that can be viewed from a safe location will be selected.
Reconnaissance work and preliminary observations and logistics would begin in spring-summer 1995. This work would
consist of obtaining access permits to conduct work, selecting subcolonies to be studied, selecting plots within
subcolonies, and conducting aerial surveys of the colony. The monitoring period would parallel that followed at
Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks.

Winter and summer attendance, and selected aspects of breeding biology of banded and unbanded common murres will
be monitored at breeding sites at the South Farallon Islands at Farallon NWR. Established and new study plots, individually-banded
birds, blinds, and other facilities will allow for the study of summer and winter attendance in more detail than at
nearshore locations. Monitoring would include determining arrival dates, winter attendance patterns (breeding
versus nonbreeding common murres), winter behavior of nonbreeding and breeding common murres, site fidelity of
breeding common murres, reproductive success, population size, and impacts of predation. Monitoring at the South
Farallon Islands will continue for at least two years and may be extended beyond two years if needed to support refinement
of recolonization methods or to facilitate interpretation of data at other colonies.


Schedule:

 Fall and winter 1994-1995: Begin preliminary work, including contracting, planning, logistics, permits,
and purchasing.
Spring-summer 1995: Conduct aerial surveys of seabird colonies in central California to obtain baseline data, conduct
aerial flights of Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks to obtain aerial photos for mapping purposes, and record breeding
common murre vocalizations at the Farallon NWR for use in the recolonization project. Select colonies and study plots
to be monitored in the Point Reyes area. Conduct safety training for personnel as required.
Fall and winter 1995-1996: In fall 1995, conduct reconnaissance trips to recolonization sites in preparation
for deployment of social attractants. Before December 1995, deploy social attractants and initiate daily observations
of recolonization sites. Initiate daily observations of study plots in December 1995. Complete field season in August
when common murres generally leave breeding colonies. Observations of study plots will continue from December through
August for a minimum of 5 years to 10 years in order to provide necessary information to adequately evaluate the recolonization
project. Work at the South Farallon Islands will begin the winter of 1995-1996 and will continue for a minimum
of two years. Regular progress reports and an annual report will be submitted by the contractor performing the work
at the South Farallon Islands.


B. Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks Restoration: Restore Common Murres at Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks Using
Social Attraction Methods (Decoys and Recorded Vocalizations)




Location:

 Castle and Hurricane Point rocks, Monterey County, California.


Justification:

 As described above, the recolonization of historic common murre colonies in central California will contribute
to the reversal of the dramatic reduction of this seabird's historic geographic range. The 1986 

Apex Houston

 spill severely affected the breeding colonies that make up the southern half of the central California breeding range.
Two breeding colonies near Monterey, Castle and Hurricane Point rocks, were hard hit by the 

Apex Houston

 spill and are in serious danger of perishing entirely. The remaining subcolonies on these rocks are very small and
disjunct. These colonies are particularly important because they are at the current southern end of the central California
population as well as the southern extreme of the species' range in the Pacific Ocean. These colonies are in close proximity
to each other and constitute the only active common murre colonies south of San Francisco, a large portion of the range
of the central California common murre population. Given the current fragile condition of the overall common murre
population and the lack of recovery over time, colonies once lost are not likely to be reestablished in the foreseeable
future without human assistance. If the colonies at Castle and Hurricane Point rocks are lost, the resulting reductions
in the geographical range, numbers, and productivity of common murres further increase the risk of extinction of
the entire central California population.


Proposed Action:

 The common murre colonies at the Castle and Hurricane Point rock complexes will be evaluated to determine the best
means of employing social attractants at these locations. A minimum of two years would be required to determine appropriate
methods. Both of these colonies are composed of several subcolonies on different rocks. Subcolonies will be examined
to obtain a comprehensive understanding of colony dynamics in a severely depleted condition. Breeding population
levels, reproductive success, attendance patterns, behavioral observations, and nesting locations will be determined
at as many subcolonies as possible. Particular attention will be paid to prospecting birds within established subcolonies
and at unoccupied rocks. In addition, all unoccupied rocks and potential mainland breeding habitats will be assessed
for the use of social attractants to encourage common murre breeding. Habitat will be assessed for suitability to
support a common murre subcolony, including such factors as slope, size, protection from human and other disturbance,
surf conditions, and predation threats. The unoccupied rocks will be regularly monitored to detect prospecting
common murres.

A phased approach to employing social attractants may be used to refine the use of social attractants on the colony.
Criteria to be used to determine the use of social attractants include: loss of subcolonies or colonies, below normal
reproductive success, lack of colony growth, limited availability of breeding sites in existing subcolonies, high
numbers of prospecting common murres in existing subcolonies, presence of prospecting common murres in areas with
no breeding, and population status at each colony. The use of social attractants would be employed at sites where it
was deemed necessary to encourage common murres to recolonize lost subcolonies or prospect and nest on unoccupied
rocks. The goal would be to prevent colony loss and/or restore the breeding colony to historic numbers without negatively
impacting existing subcolonies. If, for any reason, social attractants are not deemed advisable after two years,
the colonies at these sites will be monitored for three more years to insure adequate reproductive success, activity,
colony survival, and recovery and, if necessary, to develop alternative restoration techniques.



Schedule: 

Fall and winter 1994-1995: Preliminary work will begin, including selection of observation points, obtaining
access permits, planning, and purchasing. In December 1994, observations of breeding colonies will begin in order
to obtain necessary baseline information.

Spring and summer 1995: Aerial surveys of breeding common murre colonies will be conducted in May-June to obtain baseline
data. These surveys will be conducted in conjunction with aerial common murre surveys for central California. Observations
of breeding colonies will continue each year from December 1994 until August 1997, at a minimum. In August 1997, the
use of social attractants will be assessed to restore these common murre colonies. In fall 1997, social attractants
will be deployed where suitable.



Goals



The 

Apex Houston 

oil spill killed an estimated 6,000 common murres, eradicated the Devil's Slide Rock colony, and damaged colonies
at Castle and Hurricane Point Rocks. If the latter two colonies are lost, over 75% of the recent range of the central
California common murre population will have been lost. The Trustee Council has selected restoration alternatives
designed to restore common murres to colonies in the areas most severely affected by the spill. An important goal is
to make significant progress toward the establishment of 100 breeding pairs of common murres at Devil's Slide Rock
and San Pedro Rock colonies. The time frame needed for common murres to become established at extirpated colonies
is unknown but is suspected to be many years. If possible, the project will attempt to restore the colonies to pre-spill
population levels. The time frame needed for common murres to reach pre-spill population levels is unknown but is
suspected to take several generations. Ultimately, the long-term goal is to restore the common murre colonies to
historic breeding levels, although this would probably require funds in addition to those currently budgeted.

The Trustee Council plans to review the common murre restoration project at least annually at which time the effectiveness
of the project and possible improvements will be considered. The annual review process may result in revisions to
the plan. Revisions will be reviewed by the Trustee Council. Revisions to the plan will be guided by documented evidence,
scientific literature, and best professional judgement.



Environmental Compliance



The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the project is categorically excluded from the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq, according to the Department of Interior's Departmental Manual, 516 DM 6,
Appendix I, 516 DM 2, Appendix I. Resource management activities such as the type described for this project, which
include research, reintroduction of established species into their historic range, and small structures or improvements,
are categorically excluded from NEPA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has prepared an Environmental Action Memorandum
setting forth the basis for the categorical exclusion of this project.

The State of California has determined that the project is categorically exempt from the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), Cal. Pub. Resources Code 21000 et seq., and has filed a Notice of Exemption with the State Clearinghouse.

The Trustee Council is submitting a Consistency Determination pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C.
 1456(c) with the California Coastal Commission. The Trustee Council has concluded that the proposed project
will have no impact on California's coastal zone.

Notice inviting applications for competitive cooperative agreement awards for fiscal year 1995.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The purpose of the FGDC National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program
is to facilitate and foster partnerships and alliances within and among various public and private entities to assist
in building the NSDI. The NSDI consists of policies, standards, agreements, and partnerships among a variety of sectors
and disciplines that will promote more cost-effective production, ready availability, and greater use of high quality
geospatial data. The NSDI Competitive Cooperative Agreements Program is intended to encourage resource-sharing
projects, between and among the public and private sector through the use of technology, networking, and enhanced
interagency coordination efforts. Proposals must involve two or more organizations and participants are expected
to cost share in the project. Activities initiated under this program will promote access to data sets that are needed
for national, regional, state, and local analyses. Authority for this program is contained in the Department of the
Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1995.



Applications may be submitted by State and local government agencies, educational institutions, private firms,
private foundations, and Federally acknowledged or state-recognized Native American tribes or groups.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Under this FY 1995 program announcement, proposals are to be directed towards two components of the NSDI. The first
component deals with creation of a distributed clearinghouse for finding and accessing geospatial data. The second
component involves development and promulgation of the use of standards in data collection, documentation, transfer,
and search and query. The following list of efforts is considered within the scope of the two aforementioned activities.
Development and implementation of the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse: Create (inventory, evaluate, catalog
data, and establish Internet access) and manage a node on the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse that provides
users with a means for finding, accessing, and sharing data; establish, develop, or expand programs or projects,
through development of training programs, information guides and other explanatory materials, that increase the
contributions of local, regional, or national data sets to the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse; and, design,
develop, or implement tools to assist in the inventory, evaluation, documentation, cataloging, serving, maintaining,
and sharing of geospatial data. Develop and further the implementation of FGDC-endorsed standards: Conduct programs
to increase user comprehension and adoption of the FGDC Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata and the
Spatial Data Transfer Standard; and, stimulate the development of applicable geospatial data standards in partnership
with the FGDC Subcommittees and Working Groups. Develop software tools or techniques to aid the evaluation of geospatial
metadata or data through the National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse; develop means of displaying the quality of
geospatial data; and, develop means of speeding comparison and evaluating data for using metadata.

<DOCTITLE>Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration, Olympic National Park, WA </DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability on the draft environmental impact statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the restoration of the
Elwha River Ecosystem in Olympic National Park, Washington. This notice also announces public meetings for the purpose
of receiving comments on the draft document.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration, Olympic National Park, Washington
describes and analyzes a proposed action and four alternatives for restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and its
native anadromous fish runs. Under the DEIS's proposed action, the Secretary of the Interior would remove both the
Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams to accomplish the above restoration objectives. The other alternatives are no action_continuing
to operate the dams without anadromous fish mitigation; dam retention_operating the dams with the addition of mitigation;
remove only Elwha Dam; and remove only Glines Canyon Dam. 


This document and analysis have resulted from the passage of Public Law 102-495, the Elwha River Ecosystem and
Fisheries Restoration Act of 1992. The DEIS has been completed by the National Park Service in cooperation with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Lower Elwha S'Klallam Tribe.
Impacts are analyzed on the following topics: sediment, anadromous fish, marine resources, vegetation, wildlife,
threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, recreation, socioeconomics, dam safety, flooding, and
hazardous materials.

<DOCTITLE>Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Southeast Kansas Railroad Company, and South Kansas and Oklahoma Railroad Company_Joint
Relocation Project Exemption_in Kansas and Oklahoma </DOCTITLE>


Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP), Southeast Kansas Railroad Company (SEKR), and South Kansas and Oklahoma
Railroad Company (SKOL) jointly filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate lines of railroad.
The joint project involves 68.1 miles of SKOL's line and involves: (1) SKOL's granting trackage rights to MP and SEKR
over SKOL's line (a) between milepost 155.8 at Cherryvale, KS, to milepost 165.7 at Independence, KS, and between
milepost 0.0 at Independence, KS, to milepost 37.6 at D.Y. Junction (Dewey), OK, a total distance of 47.5 miles (the
Tulsa Subdivision); and (b) between milepost 16.9 at Coffeyville, KS, and milepost 0.0 at Cherryvale, KS, in Montgomery
County, KS, a total distance of 16.9 miles (the Coffeyville Subdivision); (2) SKOL's granting MP trackage rights
over SKOL's line between milepost 37.6 at D.Y. Junction, OK, to milepost 41.3 at Bartlesville, OK, a distance of 3.7
miles (SEKR holds rights over this trackage based on an assignment from MP at the time SEKR leased the Bartlesville
Subdivision); and (3) MP's incidental abandonment and discontinuance of operations and SEKR's incidental discontinuance
of lease operations over the line beginning at milepost 171.0 near South Coffeyville, OK, and ending at milepost 191.15
near Dewey, a distance of approximately 20.15 miles in Nowata and Washington Counties, OK. The transaction was to
have been consummated on, or soon as possible after, October 12, 1994. 
MP is a class I rail carrier. SEKR and SKOL are class III carriers. 
SEKR operates a line of railroad known as the Bartlesville Subdivision from milepost 171.0 at South Coffeyville,
OK, to milepost 200.0 near Bartlesville, OK. SEKR has not conducted train service over the segment of line between
mileposts 171.0 and 191.15 (near Dewey, OK) for more than two years. SEKR uses haulage via SKOL to move its cars from
Coffeyville to Dewey or Bartlesville and the cars are then interchanged to an SEKR crew for placement to SEKR customers
in Dewey or Bartlesville. SKOL will grant trackage rights to SEKR and MP between Coffeyville, KS, and Dewey so that
SEKR and MP can provide service to Dewey. SKOL's grant of these trackage rights will permit SEKR to discontinue its
lease operation and MP to abandon and discontinue its operation on the out of service trackage from mileposts 171.0
to 191.15. 
The joint relocation project involving MP's and SEKR'S rail operations will result in an alternate and satisfactory
continuation of rail service to customers. There will be no new traffic generated by the proposed transaction, there
will be no extension of rail service into new territory, and there will be no adverse effect on shippers. In addition,
there will be no change in the competitive situation of the rail carriers in the area. 
The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment and/or discontinuance component of a relocation
project only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion into new territory,
or a change in existing competitive situations. 

See, generally, Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation over BN,

 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). Under these standards, the abandonment and discontinuance under consideration here is not
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission has determined that line relocations embrace trackage
rights transactions such as the ones proposed here. 

See D.T. & I.R._Trackage Rights,

 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). 
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions set forth in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN,

 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate,

 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Jeanna L. Regier, Missouri
Pacific Railroad Company, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179, and Karl Morell, Ball, Janik & Novack,
1101 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20004.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Modified System of Records</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Department
of Justice, proposes to modify the following system of records_previously published October 5, 1993 (58 FR 51853):



The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Alien File (A-File) and Central Index System (CIS), Justice/INS-001A



Specifically, INS has clarified and combined routine uses D. and H. into one routine use, now identified as D., which
relates to law enforcement disclosure. It has removed routine use E. which had proposed disclosure during discovery
proceedings, and has added a routine use, also designated as E., which permits disclosure to a court during litigation.
Finally, INS has revised routine uses G. and L. Revised routine use G. clarifies the users and uses by adding language
which had been inadvertently omitted. Revised routine use L., redesignated as K., clarifies that information may
be disclosed not only to assist the United States in collecting its debts but also to assist foreign governments in
collecting their debts. Affected routine uses have been italicized for public convenience.
Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4) and (11) provide that the public be given a 30-day period in which to comment on any new routine
use of a system of records. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has oversight responsibilities under
the Act, requires a 40-day period in which to conclude its review of the proposed changes.
Therefore, please submit any comments by December 5, 1994. The public, OMB, and the Congress are invited to send written
comments to Patricia E. Neely, Systems Policy Staff, Justice Management Division, Department of Justice, Washington,
DC 20530 (Room 850, WCTR Building).
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), the Department has provided a report to OMB and the Congress on the proposed modification.



Dated: October 6, 1994.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions





General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.




The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.


Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.




General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.




Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Lafarge Corporation, P.O. Box 160, Paulding, Ohio 45879 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.14130(e)(2)
(roll-over protective structures (ROPS) and seat belts) to its Cement Plant (I.D. No. 33-00069) located in
Paulding County, Ohio. Due to the 69 inch clearance from the concrete to the shell; the 63 inch clearance from the concrete
floor to the rib on the mill; the 61 inch clearance to the door; and given the weight of the steel balls and magnitude of
the task, the petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory safety standard to allow the use of a 310 Bobcat that
has been modified so that the height of the machine is 66.5 inches that would perform the necessary task of screening
the mill safely and efficiently. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least
the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 



10. Specialty Minerals, Inc. 



[Docket No. M-94-42-M] 



Specialty Minerals, Inc., P.O. Box 558, Lucerne Valley, California 92356 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 56.13020 (use of compressed air) to its Marble Canyon Mine (I.D. No. 04-00219) located in San Bernardino
County, California. The petitioner proposes to establish blow-off stations at various locations in the plant where
employees can clean their clothes with forced or compressed air that has an OSHA approved nozzle with pressure not
greater than 2 to 6 psi at normal average line pressure. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method
would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

Information Meeting on the Remediation of Babcock and Wilcox's Parks Township Shallow Land Disposal Area in Armstrong
County, PA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is to inform the public of a meeting to share information concerning the decommissioning of Babcock and
Wilcox's Shallow Land Disposal Area (SLDA) located on the Parks Township Facility in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania.
The SLDA is an area which was used by B&W in the 1960's and 1970's to dispose of radioactively contaminated materials
in accordance with the regulations found in the now rescinded 10 CFR Section 20.304. On September 28, 1994, B&W
submitted to the NRC a remediation proposal for the remediation of the SLDA. Interested individuals are invited to
observe a meeting between the NRC, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER), B&W, Atlantic
Richfield Company (ARCO), local officials, and citizen groups to share information concerning the remediation
proposal and future actions related to the remediation of the SLDA.



Background



The Parks Township site is located in Armstrong county, approximately 20 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
along the Kiskiminetas River and Route 66. The former owners of the Parks Township site (NUMEC) disposed of radioactive
(primarily uranium and thorium) and non-radioactive waste in the SLDA during the 1960's and early 1970's. In 1967,
the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) purchased stock in NUMEC and sold the stock to B&W in 1971.

The materials placed in the trenches by NUMEC, consisted of process wastes, scrap, and trash from the nearby Apollo
nuclear fuel fabrication facility. This material contained enriched, depleted and natural uranium and lesser quantities
of thorium. At the time, disposals were authorized under 10 CFR 20.304. This provision has since been rescinded and
at least some of the waste is known to exceed NRC's existing radiological criteria for decommissioning. Therefore,
NRC is requiring the licensee to remediate the SLDA to met the NRC's decommissioning criteria, as described in the
Site Decommissioning Management Plan Action Plan (April 16, 1994, 57 FR 3389).

The current owners, B&W and ARCO have performed characterization activities for the SLDA and submitted a Site
Characterization Report (SCR) for the SLDA, dated October 1993. The NRC reviewed and commented on the SCR by letter
dated March 24, 1994 and received a response to those comments from B&W by letter dated September 28, 1994.

B&W also submitted for NRC review a proposed method for remediating the SLDA which involves capping and stabilizing
the waste disposal area. The NRC is currently reviewing this proposal.



Conduct of Meeting



The NRC will conduct the first in a series of meetings on November 10, 1994 in the Leechburg Area High School Cafeteria,
215 First Street, Leechburg, PA. The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. and will end at 10 p.m. The meeting will be facilitated
by F. X. Cameron, Special Counsel for Public Liaison at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The purpose of this meeting
is to share, with representative stakeholders and the public, information concerning the status of current actions
at the Parks Township Shallow Land Disposal Area, projected schedules and plans for the remediation of the site, and
the responsibilities of the NRC and other regulatory Agencies in the remediation of the site. The meeting will involve
invited representatives from the following groups: NRC, PADER, the Licensee, state and local officials, and local
citizen groups.

These representatives will participate in a facilitated round-table discussion and will present information and
views on upcoming actions concerning the remediation of the SLDA. An agenda for each meeting will be prepared and distributed
to all invited representatives, as well as placed in the local public document room in advance of the meeting. The public
will be present during the meeting, and time will be provided for public comment at the end of the meetings. Comments
and questions will be limited to the remediation of the SLDA. An agenda for the meeting follows. Future Information
Meetings will be held periodically concerning other issues of the remediation of the SLDA.

<DOCTITLE>Draft NUREG; Issuance, Availability </DOCTITLE>



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a draft report entitled ``Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for
the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station'' (NUREG/CR-6174). This draft report, prepared for the
NRC by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories (PNL), is available for review and comment. 

The draft report presents the results of a review and reevaluation of the original boiling water reactor (BWR) decommissioning
study (NUREG/CR-0672), and subsequent addenda which addressed technology, safety and cost issues associated
with decommissioning a large nuclear power plant. This reevaluation was performed to update the current cost estimates
to decommission the reference BWR from NUREG/CR-0672, which was Washington Public Power Supply System's Washington
Nuclear Plant Two (WNP-2). 

This report and the recently released draft NUREG/CR-5884, entitled ``Revised Analyses of Decommissioning
for the Reference Pressurized Water Reactor Power Station'' should be viewed as a first step in developing a more parametric
approach to estimating decommissioning costs. The results of these studies, including input from the public, will
be utilized by the NRC staff as part of its effort to determine if revisions of the decommissioning regulations are
warranted. 

A separate draft report, NUREG/CR-6270, entitled ``Estimating Boiling Water Reactor Decommissioning Costs''
will be issued shortly for public comment and it will be noticed in the 

Federal Register

 when it becomes available. It is a user's manual for a computer program developed by PNL that was used to calculate the
decommissioning cost estimates presented in NUREG/CR-6174. 

Comments and suggestions on the Draft NUREG/CR-6174 should be sent to the Rules Review and Directives Branch,
Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room
at 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Comments and suggestions will be most helpful if they are received by December
23, 1994. 

Copies of NUREG/CR-6174 may be purchased from the Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington,
DC 20013-7082, telephone (202) 512-2249 or (202) 512-2171. Copies are also available from the National

<DOCTITLE>Toll-Free Number</DOCTITLE>



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is establishing a toll-free number to be used by the public for general inquiries.
The system will be available for a 6-month trial period, during which public comments will be sought.

The toll-free number will be answered by an operator at the main Switchboard and then forwarded to appropriate internal
offices. Callers may also contact individual employees when their telephone numbers are known.

The NRC also maintains various other toll-free numbers for a variety of specific information purposes, such as electronic
bulletin boards and meeting notifications. These numbers will remain unchanged.

The new toll-free number, 1-800-368-5642, will become effective on November 1, 1994. A small sample
of the callers may be asked to evaluate the trial program, and to provide their area code and business association with
the NRC.

Written comments on the toll-free service may be addressed to the Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock
Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Off-Site Storage of Customer Options Account Information</DOCTITLE>



October 28, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on September 12, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposal to amend paragraph (b), ``Maintenance of Customer
Records,'' of Amex Rule 922, ``Supervision of Accounts,'' to provide that the customer information and account statements
currently maintained at the principal supervisor office may be maintained at a location other than the principal
supervisory office if the documents and information are readily accessible and promptly retrievable.








The proposal was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34811 (October 7, 1994), 59 FR 52323 (October 17, 1994). No comments were received
on the proposal.

Currently, Amex Rule 922(b) requires that background and financial information of customers who have been approved
for options transactions be maintained at both the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the principal
supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office. Amex Rule 922(b) also requires that copies of account
statements be maintained at both the branch office supervising the accounts and at the principal supervisory office
with jurisdiction over the branch for the most recent six-month period. The Amex proposes to amend Exchange Rule 922(b)
to provide that the customer information and account statements currently maintained at the principal supervisory
office may be maintained at a location other than the principal supervisory office if the documents and information
are readily accessible and promptly retrievable.



The Amex states that the rules of all the options exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(``NASD'') uniformly require that both the branch office servicing an options customer's account and the principal
supervisory office having jurisdiction over the branch office retain account statements and other financial and
background information for the account for supervisory purposes. With the advances in data storage and retrieval
capability available through optical disks, fax machines, microfiche and computers, coupled with the escalating
costs of storing records on-site, many Amex member organizations prefer to store documents away from their principal
supervisory offices. In this connection, an increasing number of member organizations have asked and received permission
from the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') to store the required customer option account documents off-site
so long as they are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. In view of the number of requests received by the SROs
to store customer options information off-site, the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'')
 has asked each of the options exchanges and the NASD to consider amending their rules to permit the principal supervisory
office to store customer account information off-site.






The Exchange believes that these off-site storage arrangements are consistent with the record retention requirement
rules, provided the documents are readily accessible and promptly retrievable. In this regard, the Amex states that
the proposed rule will not compromise the supervisory obligations of a member firm since the firm will still be required
to maintain customer option account documents and information at the branch office servicing the customer's account.
To ensure compliance with the provisions of the rule, the Amex states that it will periodically examine the document
retrieval capabilities of member firms using off-site document storage arrangements.


The Amex believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.


The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate
transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.






Specifically, by allowing off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices,
the Commission believes that the proposal should provide the Amex's members with a cost-effective means to utilize
computers, facsimile machines, optical disks, and other technology to store the required customer account information
off-site while ensuring that member firms will continue to have easy access to all of the customer account information
necessary to discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In this regard, the proposal provides that options
customer account information stored off-site must be ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable,''
 thereby preserving the Exchange's ability to access and investigate customer account records. The Commission notes
that the Amex plans to periodically examine the document retrieval capabilities of member firms using off-site storage
arrangements. Thus, the Commission believes that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Amex's interest
in allowing member organizations to reduce the cost of storing customer account information and ensuring that the
information continues to be available for supervisory purposes.





In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the Amex to allow off-site storage of customer account
information maintained at supervisory offices, but not of account information stored at branch offices, because
branch offices are responsible for the day-to-day administration of customer accounts and require immediate access
to account information. For example, by continuing to require branch offices to store customer account information
on-site, the proposal facilitates broker compliance with the suitability requirements applicable to options customers.


The Commission finds good cause for approving the Amex's proposal prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register 

because the proposal is identical to proposals submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'')
and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., which were subject to the full notice and comment period. The Commission
received no comments on those proposals, and the Commission has approved the CBOE's proposal.
 Therefore, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the Amex's
proposal on an accelerated basis.







It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-94-37) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
Relating To Exercise Price Intervals on Government Security Yield Options</DOCTITLE>


October 28, 1994.


I. Introduction


On June 30, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend CBOE Rule 23.5(a) to reduce from $2.50 to $1.00 the fixed interval between strike prices.
The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register 

on July 20, 1994.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the proposal.






II. Description of Proposal


Currently, the CBOE lists government security yield options at strike price intervals of $2.50.
 The CBOE proposes to amend its rules to reduce the interval between exercise prices on such contracts from $2.50 to
$1.00,
 which will establish a minimum spread of $100 ($1.00 times the multiplier of 100) between series. The Exchange believes
that its proposal will improve the value and utility of government security yield options by, among other things,
enabling investors to construct hedges that correlate closely with interest rates and changes in interest rate measures
underlying government security yield options. According to the CBOE, the $2.50 minimum strike price interval is
wider than the typical increments of change in interest rates, even during periods of high interest rate volatility.







III. Findings and Conclusions


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that reducing from $2.50 to $1.00 the interval between exercise prices on
government security yield option contracts will further the public interest by providing investors with more flexibility
in the trading of such options, and allowing investors to establish government security yield option positions that
are better tailored to meet their investment objectives.






The Commission also believes that the CBOE's proposal sets a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need to accommodate
the needs of investors and the need to avoid the excessive proliferation of options series. In this regard, we note
the specialized nature of the trading of government security yield options. For example, the CBOE indicates that
the current relationship between yield changes in securities underlying government security yield options and
the applicable $2.50 strike price interval requirement allows for instances where significant market yield movement
would not result in the trading of government security yield options through existing strikes, thus preventing the
availability of additional ``at-the-money'' strikes, which are necessary for the effective implementation of
certain hedging trading strategies.
 The Commission accordingly believes that a $1.00 strike price interval will allow for at-the-money strikes to be
more readily available, without causing an excessive proliferation of strikes in such options.






Finally, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') has stated that the additional traffic that will be generated
by changing the strike price interval for government security yield options to $1.00 is within OPRA's capacity.






IV. Conclusion





It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-21) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Excess Spread Parameters for CQS Securities</DOCTITLE>



October 28, 1994.



On September 9, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b4-4 thereunder.
 The rule change amends Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws to provide that the calculation methodology used to determine
the excess spread parameters for CQS securities shall include quotations from national securities exchanges. In
addition, to avoid confusion concerning the application of the excess spread parameters to CQS securities, the NASD
is moving the excess spread parameters for CQS securities, as amended by this filing, to Section 2 of Part VI of Schedule
D to the NASD By-Laws
 from Section 2 of Part V of Schedule D.









Notice of the proposed rule change together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release
and by publication in the 

Federal Register

.
 No comments were received in response to the Commission release. This order approves the proposed rule change.





Currently, Section 2(d) of Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws provides that registered market makers in CQS securities
may not enter quotations in CQS securities that exceed the NASD's parameters for maximum allowable spreads. The maximum
allowable spread presently is 125 percent of the average of the three narrowest market maker spreads in each security,
with the limitation that the maximum allowable spread can never be less than 1/4 of a point.






The calculation of ``average dealer spreads'' in CQS securities, however, does not include quotations (

i.e.

, spreads) from national securities exchanges trading those securities. Accordingly, to have the excess spread
parameters for CQS securities be more reflective of and related to the quotations disseminated by all market centers
trading CQS securities, the NASD proposed to include quotations from the exchanges into its ``average dealers spread''
calculation. As a result, to the extent that the spread reflected in the best bid and offer disseminated by an exchange(s)
is narrower than any of the three narrowest spreads quoted by CQS market makers, the proposed rule change may contribute
narrower spreads by CQS market makers. Narrower spreads by CQS market makers, in turn, will enhance the continuity
and quality of the markets provided by CQS market makers, to the ultimate benefit of investors.

In addition, to avoid confusion concerning the application of the excess spread parameters to CQS securities, the
NASD is proposing to move the excess spread parameters for CQS securities, as amended, to Section 2 of Part VI of Schedule
D to the NASD By-Laws from Section 2 of Part V of Schedule D. Part V of Schedule D imposes obligations on all Nasdaq market
makers and Part VI pertains to trading of CQS securities on Nasdaq. By placing the excess spread parameters for CQS
securities in Part VI of Schedule D instead of Part V. CQS market makers will be less likely to overlook the parameters.

The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11)
of the Act and, therefore, has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other
things, that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principle of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(11) requires, among other things,
that the rules of a national securities association must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations.

By including exchange quotations in the calculation for determining maximum allowable spreads in CQS securities,
the excess spread parameter may contribute to narrower spreads in CQS securities, which, in turn, will promote the
efficiency, continuity, and quality of Nasdaq's market in CQS securities. In addition, more stringent excess spread
parameters will compel market makers to maintain quotes that are reasonably related to the prevailing market, reinforcing
their obligations to make continuous markets.

For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act. In the instances where the spread reflected in the best bid and offer disseminated by an exchange(s) is narrower
than any of the three narrowest spreads quoted by CQS market makers, this rule change may contribute narrower spreads
by CQS market makers.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR-NASD-94-50 be, and hereby
is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Incorporated, Relating to a One Year Extension of Municipal Bond Trading Pilot Program</DOCTITLE>



October 28, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 26, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I
and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons, and is simultaneously granting accelerated approval of the
proposed rule change.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The PSE proposes to extend the municipal bond trading pilot program for an additional year until November 2, 1995.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On March 7, 1994, the Commission approved an Exchange proposal to establish new rules for the listing and trading of
municipal securities on the Exchange.
 The Commission approved the pilot for an interim period of 120 days through July 5, 1994.
 On July 5, 1994, the Commission granted an additional 120 day extension of the pilot through November 2, 1994.
 The Exchange has not yet begun to trade any municipal securities. The Exchange is now requesting a one year extension
of the pilot in order to allow for proper evaluation of the program in the event that it lists any municipal securities
during that period.








The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it will promote just and equitable principles of trade,
foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling and processing information
with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and, in general will contribute to the protection
of investors and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The Exchange requests that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register

. PSE believes it appropriate to approve the proposed rule change so that its authority to list municipal securities
does not lapse. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change extending the PSE pilot program is consistent with
the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the PSE and, in particular, the
requirements of Section 6, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing thereof in that the pilot program will expire on November 2,
1994, without reauthorization. The Commission believes that extension of the pilot is desirable in that it will permit
the exchange to evaluate its program prior to filing a request for permanent approval.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-PSE-94-32
and should be submitted by November 25.


It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved through November
2, 1995.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12)

National Fuel Gas Company (70-7674)


National Fuel Gas Company (``National''), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, a registered holding company,
has filed a declaration under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act.

By Commission order dated November 21, 1989 (HCAR No. 24988), National was authorized, among other things, to issue
and deliver from time-to-time up to one million shares of its authorized but unissued common stock, $1.00 par value
(``Additional Common Stock''), to the trustee of its two qualified 401(k) plans, in lieu of the required matching
cash contributions. The two plans are the National Fuel Gas Company Tax-Deferred Savings Plan (``TDSP'') and the
National Fuel Gas Company Tax-Deferred Savings Plan for Non-union Employees (``Non-union TDSP'') (together, ``Plans'').
As of September 30, 1994, 508,000 shares had been issued to the Plans.

National now proposes to increase the total number of shares of Additional Common Stock that it may issue and deliver
to Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company (``Vanguard''), trustee for the Plans, to two million shares including the previously
issued shares, but no more than one million shares to the TDSP and Non-union TDSP, respectively. National further
proposes to extend the time in which it may issue and deliver the Additional Common Stock through December 31, 1999.

National states that any Additional Common Stock delivered to Vanguard will be valued at fair market value. Fair market
value, as defined in the Plans, is the average of the high and low market price for National's Common Stock on the date
on which the Additional Common Stock is issued.



Tri-County Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., et al. (70-8108)



Tri-County Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. (``Tri-County''), a member-owned rural electric cooperative not
currently subject to the Act, and Wilderness Area Utilities (``Wilderness''), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tri-County,
both of 22 North Main Street, Mansfield, Pennsylvania 16933-0448, have filed an application requesting an
order: (1) approving the indirect acquisition by Tri-County through Wilderness, under Sections 9(a)(2) and 10 of
the Act, of 92.6% of the common stock (``Common Stock'') of Wellsborough Electric Company (``WECo''); and (2) granting
Tri-County and its subsidiary companies, upon consummation of the proposed transaction, an exemption under Section
3(a)(1) of the Act from all of the provisions of the Act, except Section 9(a)(2).

WECo, a public-utility company, is principally engaged in the acquisition and distribution of electricity to approximately
5,200 customers in and around the Borough of Wellsboro, Tioga County, Pennsylvania. For the fiscal year ended December
31, 1993, WECo's operating revenues, net income and total assets were $5,630,440, $93,455 and $4,786,896, respectively.

Tri-County is a member-owned rural electric cooperative incorporated under the Pennsylvania Electric Cooperative
Corporation Act of 1937. Tri-County purchases electric energy at wholesale and distributes and sells it to approximately
16,400 customers in north-central Pennsylvania. Tri-County's service territory encircles WECo's service territory.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993, Tri-County's operating revenues, net margins and total assets were $14,726,428,
$977,580 and $34,328,648, respectively.

Wilderness is a business corporation incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Tri-County. Wilderness was incorporated specifically for the purpose of acquiring and holding
shares of WECo.

On June 28, 1994, Wilderness, WECo, and Robert B. McCarthy and Nina M. McCarthy (the two McCarthys collectively, ``McCarthy'')
entered into a share purchase agreement (``Agreement''). The Agreement provides for the sale by McCarthy and purchase
by Wilderness of 986-3/4 shares (92.6%) of the Common Stock of WECo for a total consideration of $7,150,000 ($7,246
per share). Wilderness also agreed to purchase, under certain conditions, the remaining 78-3/4 shares (7.4%)
of the Common Stock from the remaining shareholders. If any remaining shareholder offers, during the two-year period
after the date of the closing on the proposed acquisition, to sell to Wilderness any or all of such shareholder's Common
Stock, Wilderness is required to purchase such shares at a price not less than $7,246 per share. Following the proposed
transaction, Tri-County will own 100% of Wilderness, which will own 92.6% of the Common Stock of WECo.

Applicants state that there are three reasons for the proposed corporate structure (i.e., whereby Wilderness, instead
of Tri-County, will acquire WECo). First, Applicants state that, under Pennsylvania law, Tri-County could not directly
own and operate WECo because a cooperative can ``transmit, distribute, sell, furnish, and dispose of electric energy
to its 

members only.

''
 In addition, only ``persons in rural areas
 * * * who are not receiving central station service''
 can be members. Many of WECo's customers are not located in rural areas; consequently, Tri-County is prohibited by
law from directly supplying WECo's consumers. Therefore, under Pennsylvania law, Tri-County could not own and operate
WECo; however, Tri-County can, through a subsidiary, serve WECo's consumers.







Second, all of Tri-County's assets are currently pledged to the Rural Electrification Administration of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (``REA'') as collateral for outstanding long term debt. This lien also applies to after-acquired
assets. If Tri-County were to acquire the WECo Common Stock directly, it would automatically be subject to REA lien
and would not be available to secure the acquisition financing. However, by interposing Wilderness, the WECo Common
Stock is not directly owned by Tri-County and is, therefore, not included in the lien. Wilderness obtained the acquisition
loan only by pledging the WECo Common Stock as security.

Third, the REA loan documents limit Tri-County's investments in certain assets without REA approval, including
securities such as WECo Common Stock, to an aggregate of 15% of its total utility plant. Because Tri-County's total
utility plant is approximately $37 million, Tri-County could not invest more than approximately $5.5 million in
WECo Common Stock. This limitation could prevent Tri-County from directly purchasing the WECo Common Stock. However,
Wilderness could make the acquisition without such limitation since it is a separate corporation.



Southwestern Electric Power Company (70-8123)



Southwestern Electric Power Company (``SWEPCO''), 428 Travis Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71101, a wholly owned
electric utility subsidiary company of Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company,
has filed a post-effective amendment to its application-declaration filed under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act.

By order dated March 31, 1993 (HCAR No. 25776) (``March 1993 Order''), SWEPCO was authorized to sell environmental
laboratory services, including analysis of water, oils, soil and waste characterization, to nonaffiliates.

SWEPCO now requests an extension, through December 31, 1997, of the authority previously granted in the March 1993
Order.

Connecticut Light and Power Co., et al. (70-8451)



Connecticut Light and Power Company (``CL&P''), Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, and Western Massachusetts
Electric Company (``WMECO''), 174 Brush Hill Avenue, West Springfield, Massachusetts 01089, both public-utility
subsidiary companies of Northeast Utilities (``NU''), a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration
under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45, 53, and 54 thereunder.
Each company proposes to organize a special-purpose limited partnership (``Issuing Partnership'') to issue limited
partnership interests. Each company will act as the general partner of its Issuing Partnership, and either Northeast
Utilities Service Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NU, will act as the initial limited partner of the Issuing
Partnerships, or each company will organize a special-purpose, wholly-owned corporation to act as the initial limited
partner. The initial limited partners will withdraw from the Issuing Partnerships upon issuance of preferred limited
partnership interests.
Each company will make an equity contribution to its Issuing Partnership when first formed and thereby acquire all
of the general partnership interest therein. The equity contributions of each general partner to its Issuing Partnership
will at all times constitute at least 3% of the equity contributions by all partners. In addition, each company will,
indirectly through the initial limited partner, make an equity contribution to its Issuing Partnership when first
formed and thereby acquire all of the initial limited partnership interest in its Issuing Partnership. Upon the withdrawal
of the initial limited partner from each of the Issuing Partnerships, each initial limited partner will be entitled
to withdraw its equity contribution.
The Issuing Partnerships will issue and sell through August 31, 1996, preferred limited partnership interests (``Preferred
Partnership Interests''), $25 per share stated liquidation preference, in an aggregate amount of, in the case of
CL&P, up to $150 million, and, in the case of WMECO, up to $100 million. The holders of the Preferred Partnership
Interests will be the limited partners of the Issuing Partnerships, and the amounts paid for the Preferred Partnership
Interests will be treated as capital contributions.
Each company will issue and sell subordinated debentures (``Subordinated Debentures'') to its Issuing Partnership.
Each Issuing Partnership will use the proceeds from the sale of its Preferred Partnership Interests, plus the equity
contributions made to it by its general partner, to purchase the CL&P Subordinated Debentures or the WMECO Subordinated
Debentures.
Each series of the Subordinated Debentures will mature within 50 years. Prior to maturity, the companies will pay
interest only, at a fixed rate set forth in the Indentures, on the Subordinated Debentures. The distribution rates,
payment dates, redemption, and other similar provisions of each series of Preferred Partnership Interests will
be substantially identical to the interest rates, payment dates, redemption, and other provisions of the related
Subordinated Debentures. The interest paid by the companies on their respective Subordinated Debentures will constitute
the only income of the Issuing Partnerships and will be used by the Issuing Partnerships to pay monthly distributions
on the Preferred Partnership Interests.
Each company may also enter into a guaranty (``Guaranty'') pursuant to which it will unconditionally guarantee (i)
payment of distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests, (ii) payments to the holders of Preferred Partnership
Interests of amounts due upon liquidation of its Issuing Partnership or redemption of the Preferred Partnership
Interests, and (iii) certain additional ``gross up'' amounts that may be payable in respect of the Preferred Partnership
Interests.
Each company's Subordinated Debentures and related Guaranty will be subordinate to all other existing and future
indebtedness for borrowed money of the company. Each company will have the right to defer payment of interest on its
Subordinated Debentures for up to 60 months. However, neither company will be permitted to declare and pay dividends
on any class of its equity securities unless all payments due under its Subordinated Debentures and Guaranty have
been made.

Distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests will be made monthly, will be cumulative, and will be mandatory
to the extent that the Issuing Partnership has legally available funds and sufficient cash for such purposes. The
availability of such funds will depend on the Issuing Partnership's receipt of the amounts due under the related Subordinated
Debentures. The Issuing Partnerships will have the right to defer distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests
for up to 60 months to the extent that the related company defers the interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures.
If distributions on the Preferred Partnership Interests are deferred for 18 consecutive months, then the holders
of Preferred Partnership Interests will have the right to appoint a special representative to enforce the Issuing
Partnership's rights under the related Subordinated Debentures and Guaranty.

It is expected that the interest payments by each company on its Subordinated Debentures will be deductible for federal
income tax purposes and that its Issuing Partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
Consequently, the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests and the general partners will be deemed to have received
partnership distributions, not dividends, from the Issuing Partnerships and will not be entitled to any ``dividend
received deduction'' under the Internal Revenue Code.

The Preferred Partnership Interests will be subject to redemption in whole or part on and after a specified date (``Earliest
Redemption Date'') at the option of the Issuing Partnership, with the consent of its related company, at a price equal
to their stated liquidation preference plus any accrued and unpaid distributions. The Earliest Redemption Date
will be not later than 10 years after the date of issuance. The Preferred Partnership Interests may also be subject
to other optional and mandatory redemption provisions. The companies also expect that, upon the occurrence of certain
events, each company may also have the right to exchange its Subordinated Debentures for the Preferred Partnership
Interests or to otherwise distribute the Subordinated Debentures to the holders of Preferred Partnership Interests.

If, as a result of the Subordinated Debentures not being treated as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes or
the Issuing Partnership not being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the Issuing Partnership
is required by applicable tax laws to withhold or deduct from payments on the Preferred Partnership Interests amounts
which would not otherwise be required to be withheld or deducted, the Issuing Partnership may also have the obligation,
if the Preferred Partnership Interests are not redeemed or replaced, to ``gross up'' such payments so that the holders
of Preferred Partnership Interests will receive the same payment after such withholding or deduction as they would
have received if no such withholding or deduction were required.

In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Issuing Partnership,
holders of Preferred Partnership Interests will be entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Issuing Partnerships
available for distribution to its limited partners, before any distribution of assets to the general partner, an
amount equal to the stated liquidation preference of the Preferred Partnership Interests plus any accrued and unpaid
distributions.

Each of the companies proposes to use substantially all of the proceeds of the proposed transactions to lower their
after-tax cost of capital and/or improve the quality of their respective capital structures by redeeming or otherwise
reacquiring a portion of their outstanding fixed-rate preferred stock and/or Dutch Auction Rate Transferable Securities.

The Preferred Partnership Interests will initially be marketed and sold pursuant to underwriting agreements (``Underwriting
Agreements'') to be entered into by each company, its Issuing Partnership, and an underwriter or underwriters to
be selected by each company. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreements, each underwriter will purchase the Preferred
Partnership Interests directly from the Issuing Partnership and then sell the Preferred Partnership Interests
to the public. Each company will pay an underwriting fee of up to 3.50% of the principal amount of its Issuing Partnership's
Preferred Partnership Interests to be purchased by such underwriter.

Based on market conditions, tax laws, and the views of the rating agencies, the companies may conclude that they can
substantially obtain the benefits of the proposed transactions by directly issuing their Subordinated Debentures
in a public offering. In such event, the companies may elect to undertake such public offerings directly without organizing
the Issuing Partnerships and causing the issuance of the Preferred Partnership Interests.

Central and South West Corp., et al. (70-8469)



Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and CSW Energy, Inc. (``CSW Energy''),
a wholly owned nonutility subsidiary company of CSW, have filed an application-declaration under sections 6, 7,
9(a), 10, and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45 and 51 thereunder. 

CSW and CSW Energy seek to invest in a qualifying cogeneration facility and form related project entities, in connection
with their program to develop sources of energy and capacity from qualifying cogeneration facilities, qualifying
small power production facilities, and independent power facilities, including exempt wholesale generators.


By orders dated September 28, 1990 (HCAR No. 25162), November 22, 1991 (HCAR No. 25414), and December 31, 1992 (HCAR
No. 25728) (``Orders''), CSW and CSW Energy obtained authorization to spend $150 million to conduct preliminary
studies of, to investigate, to research, to develop, to consult with respect to, and to agree to construct qualifying
cogeneration facilities, qualifying small power production facilities, and independent power facilities, and
to finance such activities through capital contributions, open account advances, and loans in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $150 million. 

CSW and CSW Energy, in accordance with the Orders, seek authorization to invest in and develop, construct, own, and
operate a qualifying cogeneration facility_the Sweeny Cogeneration Project (``Project''), which consists of
an approximately 320 megawatt (net) gas-fired cogeneration facility to be located in or near Sweeny, Texas. The requested
time limit of the authorization is one year from the date of receipt of the order. CSW and CSW Energy presently anticipate
closing this transaction on or before December 31, 1996. 

It is proposed that CSW Energy invest in and develop the Project through a special purpose limited partnership, the
Sweeny Cogeneration Limited Partnership (``Partnership''). CSW Energy proposes to organize and invest in a special-purpose,
wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny GP, Inc. (``Energy GP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special-purpose,
wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny GP II, Inc. (``Sweeney GP''), a general partnership interest in the Partnership,
as well as a special-purpose, wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny LP, Inc. (``Energy LP''), which will hold, either
directly or through a special-purpose, wholly owned corporation, CSW Sweeny LP II, Inc. (``Sweeny LP''), a limited
partnership interest in the Partnership. 

Energy GP and Energy LP, and Sweeny GP and Sweeny LP, each will be incorporated with authorized capital of up to 1,000
shares of common stock (no par value). CSW Energy will subscribe to all of the common stock of Energy GP and Energy LP,
Energy GP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Sweeny GP, and Energy LP will subscribe to all of the common stock
of Sweeny LP, each for $1.00 per share. 

Energy GP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of CSW Energy, and Sweeny GP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy GP.
Energy GP will hold, directly or through Sweeny GP, a 20% general partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy
GP, or Sweeny GP, will be initially the sole general partner of the Partnership. Energy LP will be a wholly owned subsidiary
of CSW Energy, and Sweeny LP will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy LP. Energy LP will initially hold, directly
or through Sweeny LP, an 80% limited-partnership interest in the Partnership. Energy LP, or Sweeny LP, will be initially
the sole limited partner of the Partnership. 

After formation of the Partnership but before operation of the Project, between 50% and 75% of the interest in the Partnership
will be acquired by nonaffiliated nonutility entities (``Equity Partner''). After the acquisition of an interest
in the Partnership by the Equity Partner, Energy GP, directly or through Sweeny GP, will hold a 1% to 10% general partnership
interest in the Partnership, Energy LP, directly or through Sweeny LP, will hold the remainder of the aggregate indirect
25% to 50% interest of CSW Energy in the Partnership as a limited partner, and the Equity Partner will hold between 50%
and 75% interest in the Partnership as a general partner, limited partner, or combination thereof.

CSW Energy and the Partnership might incur certain expenses in connection with the development of the Project (``Development
Expenses''), the total amount of which will not exceed $20 million. CSW and CSW Energy propose to fund the Development
Expenses by capital contributions, loans, or open account advances from CSW to CSW Energy, from CSW Energy to Energy
GP and Energy LP, and from Energy GP, directly or through Sweeny GP, and Energy LP, directly or through Sweeny LP, to
the Partnership. All loans to the Partnership would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years and would bear interest
at a rate per annum not in excess either of the weighted cost of capital for CSW while CSW Energy indirectly holds all
of the interests in the Partnership or the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time to time at Mellon Bank
plus 4%.
The prime rate plus 4% approximates the current market rate that the Partnership would be able to secure from nonassociate
third-party lenders for loans of this type. CSW and CSW Energy state that to make loans or open account advances through
Energy GP, Energy LP, Sweeny GP and Sweeny LP to the Partnership in the manner and on the terms described herein, they
will avoid granting the nonassociate third party partners to the Partnership the windfall that would otherwise accompany
an interest rate to such third parties set artificially low instead of an interest rate tied to the market.


Central and South West Corporation, et al. (70-8483)


Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and its nonutility subsidiary, CSW
Energy, Inc. (``Energy''), both located at 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, P.O. Box 660164, Dallas, Texas 75202 (``Applicants''),
have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 32 of the Act and Rules 45 and 53 thereunder.
CSW and Energy propose to invest in, develop, construct, own and operate, jointly with KVA Resources, Inc., a nonassociate
company engaged in the business of independent power development (``KVA''), a facility that will qualify as an eligible
facility under Section 32(a) of the Act and be known as the Northwest Regional Power Facility (``Project'') and to
form various Project entities. The Project will consist of an approximately 838 megawatt (net) generation facility
to be located in or near Creston, Washington. It will be certified as an exempt wholesale generator (``EWG''), as defined
in Section 32(e) of the Act by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'').
The Applicants propose that Energy, indirectly, make investments in and develop the Project through a special purpose
limited partnership anticipated to be known as Northwest Regional Power Limited Partnership (``Partnership'').
To acquire and hold a general and limited partnership interest in the Partnership, respectively, Energy will organize
and invest in: (1) a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated to be known as CSW Northwest GP, Inc. (``Energy
Sub GP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated to
be known as CSW Northwest GP II, Inc. (``Northwest GP''); and (2) a special purpose, wholly owned corporation anticipated
to be known as CSW Northwest LP, Inc. (``Energy Sub LP''), which will hold, either directly or through a special purpose,
wholly owned corporation anticipated to be known as CSW Northwest LP II, Inc. (``Northwest LP'').
Energy Sub GP and Energy Sub LP, and Northwest GP and Northwest LP, if formed, each will have authorized capital of up
to 1,000 shares of common stock, without par value. Energy will subscribe to all of the common stock of Energy Sub GP
and Energy Sub LP, and, if formed, Energy Sub GP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Northwest GP and Energy Sub
LP will subscribe to all of the common stock of Northwest LP at a subscription price of $1.00 per share.
Energy Sub GP will hold, either directly or through Northwest GP, a 1% general partnership interest in the Partnership.
Energy Sub GP or Northwest GP and KVA will be initially the sole general partners of the Partnership. Energy Sub LP will
initially hold, either directly or through Northwest LP, a 74% limited partnership interest in the Partnership and
KVA will initially hold a 1% general partnership interest and a 24% limited partnership interest in the Partnership.
Energy Sub LP, or Northwest LP, and KVA will be initially the sole limited partners of the Partnership.

CSW and Energy are not seeking Commission authority to finance the construction of the Project at this time. However,
the Partnership may incur certain expenses in connection with the development of the Project (``Development Expenses'').
The total amount of the Development Expenses will not exceed $12 million. CSW and Energy propose to fund the Development
Expenses by capital contributions, loans or open account advances through the various subsidiaries to the Partnership.
Loans or open account advances would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years and would bear interest at a rate per
annum not in excess of the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time-to-time at Mellon Bank plus 4%. The Applicants
believe that this rate approximates the current market rate that the Partnership would be able to secure from nonassociate
third party lenders for loans of this type.



Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (70-8493)



Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (``Maine Yankee''), 329 Bath Road, Brunswick, Maine 04011, an indirect subsidiary
of New England Electric System and Northeast Utilities, both registered holding companies, has filed an application
under Sections 9(a) and 10 of the Act.

Maine Yankee proposes to acquire nuclear fuel in amounts of up to $90 million, through December 31, 1998, in connection
with the operation of its pressurized water nuclear powered electric generating plant in Wiscasset, Maine. Maine
Yankee will use the proceeds from certain previously authorized short-term debt lines and bank revolving credit
facilities to finance the acquisitions (HCAR No. 25973, January 25, 1994). The nuclear fuel would be acquired through
long-term contracts and by purchases on the spot market, in either case on terms that are commercially reasonable
at the time of such contract or spot market purchase.



Jersey Central Power & Light Company (70-8495)



Jersey Central Power & Light Company, 300 Madison Avenue, Morristown, New Jersey 07962 (``JCP&L''), a subsidiary
of General Public Utilities Corporation, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered holding company, has filed
an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 54 thereunder.

JCP&L proposes to organize a limited partnership (``JCP&L Capital'') and a special purpose wholly-owned
subsidiary (``Investment Sub'') for the sole purpose of acting as the general partner of JCP&L Capital. JCP&L
will acquire all of the common stock of Investment Sub for a nominal consideration and will capitalize Investment
Sub with: (1) A capital contribution in the amount of approximately 3% of the total capitalization of JCP&L Capital,
or up to $4 million; and (2) a demand promissory note in the principal amount of approximately 10% of the total capitalization
of JCP&L Capital, or up to $13 million, such note to accrue interest, compounded semi-annually, at a rate equal
to the Citibank, N.A. base rate as in effect from time-to-time. JCP&L Capital would then issue and sell from time-to-time,
in one or more series through December 31, 1996, up to $125 million aggregate stated value of preferred limited partner
interests, in the form of monthly income preferred securities, $25 per security stated value (``Preferred Securities'').

Investment Sub will acquire all of the general partner interests of JCP&L Capital for up to $4 million, representing
up to a 3% interest in JCP&L Capital (``Equity Contribution''). JCP&L Capital will apply the proceeds from
the sale of the Preferred Securities, together with the Equity Contribution, to purchase JCP&L's deferrable
interest subordinated debentures (``Subordinated Debentures'').

JCP&L will also guarantee (``Guarantees''), on a limited basis to the extent set forth in the Payment and Guarantee
Agreement: (1) Payment of distributions on the Preferred Securities to the extent JCP&L Capital has sufficient
cash on hand to permit such payments and legally available funds; (2) payments to the holders of the Preferred Securities
of amounts due upon redemption of the Preferred Securities to the extent JCP&L Capital has sufficient cash on
hand to permit such payments and legally available funds; (3) payment of the lesser of (a) the liquidation preference
of the Preferred Securities or (b) the amount of assets available for distribution to the holders of the Preferred
Securities in liquidation, upon a liquidation of JCP&L Capital other than in connection with a distribution
of Subordinated Debentures, as discussed below; and (4) certain additional amounts that may be payable in respect
of the Preferred Securities. JCP&L will also covenant in the Guarantees to cause Investment Sub to perform timely
all of its duties as general partner of JCP&L Capital, including the general partner's duty to pay all of the costs
and expenses of JCP&L Capital.

<DOCNO> FR941104-2-00115 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941104-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each Subordinated Debenture will be issued under an indenture to be entered with United States Trust Company of New
York, as trustee, and will have an initial term of up to 50 years. Prior to maturity, JCP&L will pay only interest
on the Subordinated Debentures at a rate equal to the distribution rate on the related series of Preferred Securities.
Such interest payments will constitute JCP&L Capital's only income and will be used by it to pay monthly distributions
on the Preferred Securities and distributions on the general partner interests of JCP&L Capital held by Investment
Sub. Distributions on the Preferred Securities will be made monthly, will be cumulative and must be made to the extent
that JCP&L Capital has legally available funds and cash sufficient for such purposes. However, JCP&L will
have the right to defer payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures for up to five years, in which event JCP&L
Capital may similarly defer payment of distributions on the Preferred Securities. If distributions on the Preferred
Securities are not paid for eighteen consecutive months, then the holders of the Preferred Securities will have the
right to appoint a special representative to enforce JCP&L Capital's rights under the Subordinated Debentures
and the rights of the holders of the Preferred Securities under the Guarantees. JCP&L and JCP&L Capital,
as the case may be, may be required to pay interest on any deferred interest or distributions, to the extent permitted
by applicable law. The interest rates, payment dates, redemption and other similar provisions of each series of Subordinated
Debentures will be identical to the distribution rates, payment dates, redemption and other similar provisions
of the related series of Preferred Securities.
Each Subordinated Debenture and related Guarantee will be subordinate to all other existing and future indebtedness
of JCP&L and will have no cross-default provisions with respect to other JCP&L indebtedness. However, JCP&L
may not declare or pay dividends on its outstanding Cumulative Preferred Stock or Common Stock unless all payments
then due under the Subordinated Debentures and the Guarantees have been made.
It is expected that JCP&L interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures will be deductible for income tax
purposes and that JCP&L Capital will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Consequently,
it is represented that the holders of the Preferred Securities and Investment Sub will receive partnership distributions
in respect of their distributions from JCP&L Capital and will not be entitled to any ``dividend received deduction''
under the Internal Revenue Code.
The Preferred Securities may be redeemable at the option of JCP&L Capital at a price equal to their stated value
plus any accrued and unpaid distributions: (1) at any time after five years from their date of issuance; or (2) in the
following events: (a) JCP&L Capital is required by applicable tax laws to withhold or deduct certain amounts
in connection with distributions or other payments, (b) JCP&L Capital is subject to federal income tax with respect
to interest received on the Subordinated Debentures or is otherwise not treated as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes, (c) it is determined that the interest payments by JCP&L on the Subordinated Debentures are not
deductible for federal income tax purposes, (d) JCP&L Capital is subject to more than a 

de minimis 

amount of other taxes, duties or other governmental charges, or (e) JCP&L Capital becomes subject to regulation
as an ``investment company'' under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Upon occurrence of any of the events
set forth in clause (2), above, JCP&L Capital may also have the right to dissolve and distribute the Subordinated
Debentures to the holders of the Preferred Securities in liquidation of their interests in JCP&L Capital.

In the event that JCP&L Capital is required by applicable tax laws to withhold or deduct certain amounts in connection
with distributions or other payments, JCP&L Capital may also have the obligation, if the Preferred Securities
are not redeemed or Subordinated Debentures are not distributed to the holders, to ``gross up'' such payments so that
the holders of the Preferred Securities will receive the same payment after such withholding or deduction as they
would have received if no such withholding or deduction were required. In the latter event, JCP&L's obligations
under the Subordinated Debentures and the Guarantees would also cover any such ``gross up'' obligations.

JCP&L expects to apply the net proceeds from the sale of Subordinated Debentures to JCP&L Capital, to the
repayment of outstanding short-term debt, for construction purposes, and for other general corporate purposes,
including the redemption of outstanding senior securities pursuant to their optional redemption provisions. JCP&L
represents that it will not so redeem such outstanding securities unless the estimated present value savings derived
from the difference between interest or dividend payments on a new issue of comparable securities and those securities
refunded is on an after-tax basis greater than the estimated present value of all redemption, tendering and issuing
costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate. Such discount rate will be based on meeting JCP&L's long-term
capital structure goals, with appropriate adjustments for income taxes. JCP&L will not use any of the net proceeds
from the sale of Subordinated Debentures to acquire, either directly or indirectly, any interest in any exempt wholesale
generators (``EWG'') or foreign utility companies (``FUCO''), as those terms are defined in Sections 32 and 33 of
the Act, respectively.



New England Electric System (70-8497)



New England Electric System (``NEES''), 25 Research Drive, Westborough, Massachusetts 01582, a registered holding
company, has filed a declaration under Section 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder.

By orders dated December 11, 1992 and June 18, 1993 (HCAR Nos. 25701 and 25832, respectively), NEES was granted the
authority to make capital contributions to its wholly owned electric-utility subsidiaries through December 31,
1994.

NEES now proposes to make, from time to time from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, one or more capital contributions
to New England Power Company (``NEP''), Massachusetts Electric Company (``Mass. Electric''), The Narragansett
Electric Company (``Narragansett''), and Granite State Electric Company (``Granite''), each a wholly owned electric-utility
subsidiary of NEES. Such capital contributions shall not exceed an aggregate of $50 million each for NEP, Mass. Electric
and Narragansett, and $3 million for Granite. NEP, Mass. Electric, Narragansett and Granite will credit their capital
contributions to ``Other Paid-In Capital,'' and NEES will record such capital contributions as ``Investments in
Subsidiaries, Consolidated.'' NEES will obtain the funds for such capital contributions from dividends paid to
it by its subsidiaries, repayment of notes from subsidiaries or through short-term borrowings.

NEP, Mass, Electric, Narragansett and Granite will apply the funds received from the capital contributions toward
the cost of, or the reimbursement of the treasury for, or the payment of short-term borrowings incurred for, retirement
of outstanding general and refunding and first mortgage bonds and preferred stock, capitalizable additions and
improvements to plant and property or other corporate purposes.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement; Santa Fe and San Miguel Counties, NM</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
transportation improvement project in Santa Fe and San Miguel Counties, New Mexico.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) on three alternative alignments for connecting NM 50 to I-25 in the vicinity of the Glorieta
Unit of the Pecos National Historical Park.


Alternatives under consideration are: 1. No build, including, a. Do nothing, b. Resurfacing of NM 50 through the Glorieta
Unit and c. Widening within the existing right-of-way through the Glorieta Unit; 2. West Ridge Alignment. This would
be a new alignment beginning approximately 12,500 feet east of the Glorieta Unit east boundary on NM 50, bending southwest
to old US 85, then extending west along the interstate to tie in to the existing Glorieta interchange, and 3. La Joya
Underpass Alignment. This alignment would begin approximately 1500 feet east of the Glorieta Unit east boundary
on NM 50. It would proceed south to I-25, utilizing the existing La Joya underpass location. A new interchange
with I-25 would be required.
Public involvement to date has included two ``open house'' public meetings. The first was held August 12, 1993 in Pecos,
NM, and the second was held October 28, 1993, also in Pecos, NM Comments received at those public meetings were incorporated
into the planning process.
The draft EIS will be made available for Native American, public and agency review and comment. A public hearing will
be advertised and held after document distribution and review. To ensure that a full range of issues related to this
project are addressed and all significant issues and impacts identified, comments and suggestions are invited from
all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning the alternatives and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA
at the address provided above.

Distribution of Fiscal Year 1995 Contract Support Funds

ACTION: 

Notice. 
 



 
 


 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to provide information to Indian tribes and tribal organizations contracting under
the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, about the distribution and use of Contract
Support Funds (CSF) Fiscal Year (FY) 1995. 
 
  



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The information detailed herein has been developed to comply with the following language in the Appropriations Act
for the Department of the Interior and related agencies for FY 1995, Public Law 103-332: 
 
 


 
 

``* * * and of which not to exceed $95,823,000 shall be for payments to tribes and tribal organizations
for contract support costs associated with ongoing contracts or grants or compacts authorized by the Indian Self-Determination
Act of 1975, as amended: 

Provided, 

That tribes and tribal contractors may use their tribal priority allocations for unmet contract support costs of
ongoing contracts, grants or compact agreements * * *

``* * * 

Provided further, 

That of the funds provided, $7,500,000 shall remain available until expended, for the Indian Self-Determination
Fund, which shall be available for the transitional cost of initial or expanded tribal contracts, grants or cooperative
agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act.''



In addition, the Conference Report accompanying the FY 1995 Interior Appropriations Act states:
``Modified language proposed by the Senate to place a cap on the amount of funding to be made available for fiscal year
1995 and to separate the amount of contract support for ongoing self-determination agreements entered into prior
to fiscal year 1995 from that provided for new awards first entered into during fiscal year 1995. The purpose of separating
the amount available for ongoing agreements from that for new and expanded agreements is to stabilize the fund for
ongoing awards and still provide contract support funding for new and expanded contracts. The Bureau is expected
to implement procedures for administering the new Indian Self-Determination Fund, for which $7,500,000 is provided,
consistent with those of the Indian Health Service. The Bureau should fund new contracts at the 100 percent level.

``The Bureau is expected to begin developing procedures for eventual transfer of contract support into each tribe's
tribal priority allocation. Once this has been accomplished, the tribes will be able to manage their total program
costs within their overall funding allocation.

``The cap is not intended to limit the flexibility of tribes to reprogram within tribal priority allocations to obtain
full recovery of indirect costs if a shortfall in contract support were to occur. Accordingly, the managers anticipate
that tribes, individually or in agreement with other tribes may reprogram within tribal priority allocations without
regard to the contract support ceiling. Reprogramming on a Bureau-wide basis is not authorized for this purpose.''




Summary Statement 





A total of $103,125,653 is available for contract support requirements (excluding construction contracts) during
FY 1995. Of this amount $95,639,978 is available for contract support requirements associated with the FY 1995 costs
of ongoing self-determination and self-governance awards for programs under contract prior to FY 1995. The balance
of $7,485,675 is provided to establish an Indian Self-Determination (ISD) Fund to provide contract support for new
and expanded contracts first entered into in FY 1995. These amounts include the general reduction of 0.191 percent,
in accordance with the Title III General Provisions  313, Public Law 103-332. Each BIA Area Office and
the Office of Self-Governance (hereinafter office) has the responsibility for tribes located within their respective
area to work with the tribes in identifying existing and new and expanded contracts and reporting this information
to the Division of Self-Determination Services as specified in this announcement. CSF shall be added to awards made
under  102 and Title III of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended. Awards
made under the authority of  103 of this Act shall not receive CSF to meet indirect costs, as contract support
provisions do not apply to  103 grants. 





Basis for Payment of CSF 





The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will utilize tribal indirect cost rates to determine the amount of CSF to be paid
to eligible contracting tribes and tribal organizations. In determining legitimate FY 1995 indirect cost requireme
