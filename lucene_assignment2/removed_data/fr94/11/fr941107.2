Proposed Redefinition of the BEA Economic Areas



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed changes and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In a previous notice in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 13049, March 9, 1993), BEA announced its ``Intent to Revise the Boundaries of the BEA Economic Areas'' and presented
the procedures used to define the current economic areas. This notice presents for public comment a proposed redefinition
of the economic areas, which reduces their number from 183 to 174. Any additional changes to the proposed economic
areas will be based largely on the comments received. The resulting new economic areas, along with a summary of the
comments received, will be presented in a later notice. At that time, the new economic areas will supersede the current
183 BEA economic areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Part I: Background



Under authority granted in 15 U.S.C. 175 

et seq.

, BEA develops and presents geographically detailed economic data and facilitates regional economic analysis.
As part of this obligation, BEA defined the 183 current economic areas in 1977. The economic areas cover the entire
nation. The redefinition now underway is necessary to maintain the analytical usefulness of the areas in light of
the substantial changes in area commuting patterns shown by the 1990 Census of Population.

Each economic area consists of one or more economic nodes_metropolitan areas or similar areas that serve as centers
of economic activity_and the surrounding counties that are economically related to the nodes. (Metropolitan areas
include metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's), primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSA's), and New England
county metropolitan areas (NECMA's).) Commuting patterns are the main factor used in determining the economic relationships
among counties. The economic-area definition procedure requires that, as far as possible, each area include both
the place-of-work and the place-of-residence of its labor force.

For some analyses, government agencies and businesses need data that are more geographically detailed than economic-area
data. Government agencies often use relatively small areas for design of their program regulations or implementation
of their licensing programs. Businesses need such detail for determining plant locations and for defining sales
and marketing territories. BEA is responding to these needs as part of the economic-area redefinition by first defining
a set of 348 ``Component Economic Areas'' (CEA's) and then using these as building blocks for redefining the larger
economic areas.


Each CEA consists of a single economic node and the surrounding counties that are economically related to the node.
Of the nodes, 90 percent are metropolitan, and 10 percent are nonmetropolitan. Each metropolitan area is the node
of a different CEA; with minor exceptions, the nonmetropolitan nodes are nonmetropolitan counties where newspapers
widely read in these areas are published.

In general, the procedure to redefine the economic areas is similar to that used to define the current economic areas.
First, nodes are identified. Then, non-nodal counties are assigned to nodes, mainly based on commuting patterns
and on newspaper circulation. A procedural difference is that now node identification and the assignment to nodes
of non-nodal counties are done in a more systematic way and at a more geographically detailed level. The procedure
results in the definition of 348 CEA's; these are then aggregated to form 174 BEA economic areas.



Part II: Detailed Procedures



I. Identification of Nodes



With the exception of New England MSA's, each metropoltan area in the nation is identified as a node of a CEA. Metropolitan
areas consist of 240 MSA's, 59 PMSA's, and 11 NECMA's. Thus, metropolitan areas serve as nodes for 310 of the 348 CEA's.

Each of 38 nonmetropolitan counties is identified as a node of a CEA in parts of the nation remote from metropolitan
areas. Identification of most of the nonmetropolitan nodes follows a four-part process. First, analysis of commuting
patterns for the nation's 2,305 nonmetropolitan counties shows that 1,112 of these are not closely related to metropolitan
areas. Second, analysis of newspaper publication data for the 1,112 counties shows that 130 of these are locations
of newspapers whose circulations are recorded by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, an organization whose membership
includes approximately 98% of U.S. newspaper circulation. Third, further analysis of newspaper circulation and
of population for the 130 counties shows that 68 of these have populations of more than 50,000, or are locations of newspapers
widely read in at least five counties, or both. Fourth, a preliminary test attempting to use all 68 of these counties
as CEA nodes shows that only 35 of these qualify as nodes of CEA's that contain at least five counties. These 35 counties
are identified as nonmetropolitan nodes.

The CEA associated with each of the 35 nonmetropolitan nodal counties selected by the four-step process is named for
the city in which the county's major newspaper is published. The cities are: Flagstaff, AZ; Jonesboro, AR; Idaho Falls,
ID; Twin Falls, ID; Quincy, IL; Manhattan, KS; Paducah, KY; Bowling Green, KY; Salisbury, MD; Traverse City, MI; Marquette,
MI; Mankato, MN; Worthington, MN; Hattiesburg, MS (identified by the Office of Management and Budget as a new MSA as
of July 1, 1994); Meridian, MS; Tupelo, MS; Greenville, MS; Missoula, MT; Butte, MT; Grand Island, NE; North Platte,
NE; Norfolk, NE; Scottsbluff, NE; Lebanon, NH; Hobbs, NM; Farmington, NM; Minot, ND; Pendleton, OR; Aberdeen SD;
Watertown, SD; Cookeville, TN; Lufkin, TX; Staunton, VA; Clarksburg, WV; and Bluefield, WV.

Three CEA's, each of which consists of a group of closely related nonmetropolitan counties in very remote parts of
the country, do not have newspaper-based nodes. These CEA's are named by their locations and include a 7-county group
defined by the Alaskan panhandle, a 13-county group in northern Michigan, and an 11-county group in western Oklahoma.
The county containing the largest city in each of these areas is the node for the CEA.

2. Assignment of Non-Nodal Counties to Nodes 


Of the nation's 3,141 counties, 836 counties are in metropolitan nodes and 38 counties are nonmetropolitan nodes.
Each of the remaining 2,267 non-nodal counties is analyzed to determine the node to which it is most closely related.
The initial assignment of about 75 percent of the non-nodal counties is based on journey-to-work data from the 1990
Census of Population. These counties are assigned to nodes based on their largest county-to-county commuting flows.
In many instances, the association between a county and a particular node is based, not on direct commuting ties to
a nodal county, but on commuting ties to a non-nodal county that is tied to the node. The initial assignment of most of
the other non-nodal counties is based on newspaper circulation data. These counties are assigned to nodes based on
the locations of the regional newspapers that are most widely read in these counties. In all cases, contiguity of a
non-nodal county to a node or to another non-nodal county already assigned to the node is required before the initial
assignment is made. The initial assignment of a few of the non-nodal counties requires special procedures. These
usually apply in counties with very small populations or unusual contiguity problems. 
The initial assignments of non-nodal counties are based on the strongest county-to-county relationships; these
need not reflect the strongest county-to-CEA relationships. Following the initial definitions of the CEA's, 373
counties are reassigned to ensure that, to the extent possible, each county is assigned to the CEA with which it has
the strongest commuting ties. (Six counties do not meet this objective because they are not contiguous with the CEA's
to which they have the most commuting.) 


3. Aggregation to Economic Areas 


The 348 CEA's are used as building blocks for the proposed 174 BEA economic areas. CEA's are aggregated so that (1) as
far as possible, the labor force of each resulting economic area works and resides in that area and (2) each resulting
economic area is large enough economically to be part of BEA's local-area economic projections program. In general,
aggregation to economic areas has two parts. In the first part, the 59 CEA's with PMSA's as nodes are combined into 17
economic areas corresponding to the 17 consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSA's) that comprise the
PMSA's. (A CMSA is an MSA that has more than 1 million residents and is subdivided into two or more PMSA's.) In the second
part of the aggregation, each of 141 CEA's that do not meet size and commuting criteria is combined with the CEA to which
it has the most commuting. 


Part III: Map and List of the Proposed 174 BEA Economic Areas 


Codes from 1 to 174 are assigned to the proposed economic areas in approximate geographic order, beginning with 1 in
northern Maine, continuing south to Florida, then north to the Great Lakes, and continuing in a serpentine pattern
to the West Coast. With the exception of three special-node areas (Alaskan Panhandle, Western Oklahoma, and Northern
Michigan), each economic area is named for the node of its largest CEA. The following list provides economic-area
codes and names. Economic-area boundaries and codes are shown on the map following the list.

Part IV: Availability of Additional Information



The text for this Notice and a detailed data file with county, CEA, and economic-area codes is available, for downloading
only, from the New England Electronic Economic Data Center. Connect to the Data Center's Internet node at neeedc.umesbs.maine.edu
using the anonymous FTP (username=``anonymous'' with no password) and ``get'' the binary file EADATA.EXE from the
node's root directory. (Do not use GOPHER or MOSAIC Internet technologies at this node.) This file decompresses into
self-explanatory text files when the DOS command EADATA is used. Counts of the number of counties in each CEA and economic
area and of the number of CEA's in each economic area are included to assist in understanding and evaluating the proposed
economic areas. The file EADATA.EXE also is available through the Commerce Department's Economic Bulletin Board
(EBB). First-time users of the EBB may access it with their personal computer and modem by dialing (202) 482-3870
and following instructions. The user's cost is an annual fee of $45 and per-minute connect charges, which vary by time
of day; users will be billed by the Department of Commerce. (The EBB is also available through the Internet.) A hard-copy
listing of the records in the detailed data file is available for public review at the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Public Information Office, Room 1026, 1441 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The hours
of availability are 8:30 a.m. to noon and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.



Part V: Summary of Comments and Responses



In the previous 

Federal Register

 Notice (56 FR, 13049, March 9, 1993) interested persons were invited to provide comments regarding methodology for
the economic area definitions. Two formal comments were received. One suggested that greater clarity in the explanation
of the means by which nodes for the economic areas are selected would be useful; a description of the selection process
is included above. The second comment specifically requested that the two-county region defined by Nassau and Suffolk
counties in New York be treated as separate from the New York MSA in the redefinition procedures. Nassau-Suffolk is
a separate PMSA in the larger CMSA surrounding New York, so it is treated separately in defining the CEA's. However,
no counties other than Nassau and Suffolk are in the Nassau-Suffolk CEA, and it was grouped with other CEA's to form
its economic area.



Public Review Procedure



All comments received in response to this notice will be available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Public Information Office, Room 1026, 1441 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.
Hours of availability are 8:30 a.m. to noon and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. A summary of the comments
and the set of final BEA economic areas will appear in a 

Federal Register

 notice in early 1995.

On August 10, 1994, the Department provided interested parties with the opportunity to submit published, publicly-available
information for consideration in valuing factor inputs. Petitioners submitted information on September 7, 1994;
respondents submitted information on September 22, 1994.


Respondent Selection


In addition to sending the Ukrainian Embassy the questionnaire, the Department independently attempted to identify
other possible exporters of Ukrainian pure magnesium to the United States during the POI based on information obtained
from petitioners, and through examination of PIERS data and other sources of information. Our efforts consisted
of issuing an August 8, 1994, survey requesting information on exports to the United States of the subject merchandise;
issuing the antidumping questionnaires (limited to Sections A and C) to trading companies operating in various European
countries (on August 19, September 7, and September 13, 1994); and a September 15, 1994, follow-up letter to unresponsive
questionnaire recipients.
We sent either the survey, the questionnaire, or both documents to 56 companies, with the following results.
 Two companies, Gerald Metals and MG Metals, provided responses to Sections A and C of the questionnaire.
 Twenty-five other companies, meanwhile, indicated that they did not export the subject merchandise to the
United States during the POI. The companies that did not export were Intreid; Kemokomplex; Nobel Trading; Raba Company;
Alamet; Compagnie de Mines et Metals; Expromptorg; Fred Lonner & Co., Inc.; Metal Exchange Corporation; Minmeta
S.A., Minmetals Canada, Inc.; Scandinavian Steel AB; Stena Metall Atervinning AB; Sinex AG; Maks Trade Kft.; Sassoon
Metals and Chemicals; Seleb; Weko Food Trading; IMEX Consulting Sprl; W&O Bergmann; Steinweg Handelsveem;
A. Hartrodt; C. Steinweg Handelsveem B.V.; J. Oosterom & Zoom; and Siegfried Kahn AG.
 Seven companies indicated that they were related to companies who had provided information as to whether or
not they had made U.S. sales.
 Eighteen companies provided either no response or an inadequate response. The Department received no response
from the following 16 contacted companies: Derek Raphael & Co. Ltd.; Marco Trading; Wogen Group Ltd.; Alex; Mages;
and 11 other companies whose names cannot be disclosed in this notice because their identities has been deemed business
proprietary information. We have designated these 11 companies as companies ``A'' through ``K'' in the ``Suspension
of Liquidation'' section of this notice, below. We will, however, identify them to the Customs Service for enforcement
of this determination. Additionally, F&S and Alusuisse-Lonza indicated that they made POI sales to the United
States, but provided inadequate responses to our requests for information.
 Finally, surveys or questionnaires sent to four companies were returned as undeliverable.

From July to October 1994, the Department received responses to sections A and D from Concern Chlorvinyl, which indicated
that it had made no sales of the subject merchandise directly to the United States during the POI. Zaporozhye responded
to section A but did not reply to subsequent deficiency letters.
During September and October 1994, the Department also requested clarifications of the information submitted by
Concern Chlorvinyl, Gerald Metals, MG Metals, and Alusuisse-Lonza. Alusuisse-Lonza did not respond to the supplemental
request. Because of the deadlines established for responses to these supplemental requests, certain information
submitted by Gerald Metals and MG Metals was not considered for this preliminary determination.


Postponement of Final Determination


Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on October 24, 1994, Gerald Metals, a reseller accounting for a significant
proportion of the merchandise in this proceeding, requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination
in this investigation, the Department postpone the final determination to 135 days after the date of publication
of the affirmative preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. Concern Chlorvinyl, a producer accounting for a significant proportion of merchandise in this proceeding, made
a similar request on October 26, 1994. Therefore, we are postponing the final determination until the 135th day after
the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Scope of Investigation


The product covered by this investigation is pure primary magnesium, regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless
expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight
primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal. 
Pure primary magnesium encompasses all products that contain at least 99.95% primary magnesium, by weight (generally
referred to as ``ultra-pure'' magnesium), as well as products containing less than 99.95% but not less than 99.8%
primary magnesium, by weight (generally referred to as ``pure'' magnesium). Products that have the aforementioned
primary magnesium content, but that do not conform to ASTM specifications or other industry or customer-specific
specifications, are included in the scope of this investigation.
Pure primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets
and other shapes.
Excluded from the scope of this investigation are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium.
Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are currently classifiable under 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States

 (HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding
and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible
to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in coarse shapes
and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly
shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2 mm in diameter or smaller.
Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary
magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV,
the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will
pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1 mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals,
Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope includes products
having a maximum physical dimension (

i.e.,

 length or diameter) of 1 inch or less.

Nonmarket Economy Status


Ukraine has been treated as a nonmarket economy (``NME'') country in all past antidumping proceedings (

see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Uranium from Ukraine

 (58 FR 36640, July 8, 1993)). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn this
designation. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated Ukraine as an NME for purposes
of this investigation.


Period of Investigation


The POI is October 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994.


Fair Value Comparisons


A. Participating Respondents


To determine whether sales by Gerald Metals and MG Metals of pure magnesium from Ukraine to the United States were made
at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified
in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.


B. Non-Participating Respondents


All companies to which a questionnaire was issued are considered mandatory respondents in this proceeding. We consider
those mandatory respondents that did not respond to the questionnaire to be uncooperative respondents and have based
the less-than-fair-value margin for those companies on the best information available (``BIA''). We consider the
following companies to be uncooperative respondents: Alusuisse-Lonza; Derek Raphael & Co. Ltd.; Marco Trading;
Wogen Group Ltd.; Alex; Mages; F&S; and the 11 companies whose names cannot be disclosed because their identities
are deemed business proprietary information. Accordingly, we have based these companies' LTFV margin on an uncooperative
BIA rate.
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse
assumptions for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium,

 58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise
significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company
the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in
the investigation. Here, since these companies failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are deeming them uncooperative
and are assigning them a BIA margin of 53.99 percent. This margin represents the highest margin in the petition, as
recalculated by the Department at the time of the initiation to account for errors in arithmetic and/or methodology.


C. All Other Companies


We are basing the LTFV margins for all other companies, including those companies which reported that they did not
sell the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, on a simple average of the rates calculated for the
mandatory respondents, including rates based on BIA but excluding zero and 

de minimis

 margins, if any.


United States Price


We based USP on purchase price sales, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise
was sold directly by the exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States
and because exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances.
For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire, we calculated purchase price based on packed,
CIF or FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. In addition, for CIF prices, we made the
following deductions (where appropriate): for MG Metals, we deducted foreign brokerage, ocean freight, marine
insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, U.S. inland insurance and U.S. brokerage and repacking cost; for Gerald
Metals, we deducted foreign brokerage, ocean freight, U.S. Duty, U.S. inland freight, U.S. insurance and U.S. brokerage.
From each exporter's U.S. price, we calculated and then deducted foreign inland freight between the factory and the
reported intermediate destination. We based our calculation on the per-ton foreign inland freight amount reported
in the petition as best information available because the exporters failed to report information on this area in their
questionnaire responses.

Foreign Market Value


A. Surrogate Country Selection


In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in
one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market
economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. There are no countries economically
comparable to Ukraine that are significant producers of magnesium. Accordingly, we considered as potential surrogates
countries that are economically comparable that produce comparable merchandise. In these investigations, we have
determined that aluminum should be considered comparable merchandise. Although the material inputs used to produce
magnesium and aluminum are different, according to both U.S. Bureau of Mines and Department of Commerce experts,
aluminum is comparable to magnesium in that both (1) are light metals in terms of molecular weight; (2) are electricity-intensive
products; (3) are produced using an electrolytic process, and (4) share some common end uses (

e.g.,

 dye casting).
We have determined that Indonesia and Egypt are both economically comparable to Ukraine (

see

 October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the File.) In addition, both countries are significant producers
of aluminum. Because we were able to obtain more information from Indonesia than from Egypt, we have used Indonesia
as our primary surrogate. However, we have resorted to Egypt for certain surrogate values where values in Indonesia
were either unavailable or out of date. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information,
wherever possible.



B. Factors of Production



In accordance with section 773(c)(1), we used factors of production as the fair value benchmark for the U.S. price
of sales of Concern Chlorvinyl-produced merchandise by Gerald Metals and MG Metals. In the case of U.S. sales of Zaporozhye-produced
merchandise for which we did not receive factors of production data, a BIA margin was assigned using the higher of (a)
the highest adjusted alleged margin cited in our initiation notice or (b) the highest margin calculated for a sale
of Concern Chlorvinyl-produced merchandise. The factors used to produce pure magnesium include materials, labor,
and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the
different inputs. (For a complete analysis of surrogate values, 

see

 our calculation memorandum.) We then added amounts for factor overhead, general expenses and profit, the cost of
containers and coverings, and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed and ready for
shipment to the United States.

To value the raw materials, we used publicly available information from Indonesia in the 

UN Trade Commodity Statistics (``UN Trade Statistics

'') for January through December 1993 and the 1992 

Indonesia Foreign Trade Statistics.

 No adjustment for inflation was necessary since the 1993 

UN Trade Statistics

 for Indonesia reported data for a portion of the POI. For values taken from 

Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistics,

 we made appropriate adjustments to account for inflation. For one energy input, we used data from the 1992 

UN Trade Statistics

 for Egypt since the unit value from the 1993 

UN Trade Statistics

 for Indonesia was based on an extremely small quantity and appeared to be aberrational. The 1992 Egyptian value for
this input was inflated to the POI. For one raw material, we used information from the petition as best available information
because we were unable to find a value in either Indonesia or Egypt.

To adjust material input values to account for source-to-factory freight, we used Indonesia freight rates from a
1991 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. (

See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from the People's
Republic of China

 (57 FR 21058, May 18, 1992).

To value labor amounts for production and packing, we used labor data for Egypt, as reported in the International Labor
Office's 

1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics

 because the labor value available for Egypt was more up-to-date (1987) than was the labor value available for Indonesia
(1986). We adjusted labor wage rates to account for inflation using world price indices for Egypt as reported in the
International Monetary Funds' 

International Financial Statistics (IFS).
To value heavy oil and diesel fuel, we used 1993 data for Indonesia from the Energy Information Administration's International
Energy Annual.

 Although we are unable to adjust these values for taxes included in the published prices, they are the only data found
for heavy oil and diesel fuel in Indonesia.
To value electricity, we used information for Indonesia from the Asian Development Bank's 1993 

Electric Utilities Data Book for Asian and Pacific Region.


Because we were unable to find surrogate values for factory overhead from either Indonesia or Egypt, we used factory
overhead rates from the petition.
We used the statutory minima of ten percent for selling, general and administrative expenses and eight percent for
profit because no surrogate country information reflected percentages for those amounts that were above the statutory
minima.

To value packing materials, we used data from the 1993 

UN Trade Statistics

 for Indonesia. Because information for certain packing materials was incompletely reported, we were unable to calculate
a unit factor value for these materials. Therefore, we included data from the petition to account for the cost of these
packing materials.

Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all information determined to be acceptable for use in making
our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
imports of the subject merchandise that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, from consumption on or after the
date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
exceeds the USP as shown below. We will also inform Customs of the identities of those companies, identified below
by a code letter, whose names we are unable to disclose. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain
in effect until further notice.

The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:






ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry.



Public Comment



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than February 10, 1995, and rebuttal briefs, no later than
February 17, 1995. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested
parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be
held on February 21, 1995, at 10:00 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48
hours before the scheduled time.

Interested parties who wish to request a hearing, or to participate if one is requested, must submit a written request
to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten
days of the publication of this notice. Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number;
(2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral
presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs. If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make
our final determination by the 135th day after the date of publication of the affirmative preliminary determination
in the 

Federal Register

.

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Scope of Investigations



A. Pure Magnesium




The product covered by this investigation is pure primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless
expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight
primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal.


Pure primary magnesium encompasses all products that contain at least 99.95% primary magnesium, by weight (generally
referred to as ``ultra-pure'' magnesium), as well as products containing less than 99.95% but not less than 99.8%
primary magnesium, by weight (generally referred to as ``pure'' magnesium). Products that have the aforementioned
primary magnesium content, but that do not conform to ASTM specifications or other industry or customer-specific
specifications, are included in the scope of this investigation.


Excluded from the scope of this investigation are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium.


Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding
and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible
to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in coarse shapes
and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly
shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller.


Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary
magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV,
the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will
pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals,
Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products
having a maximum physical dimension (

i.e.

, length or diameter) of 1 inch or less.


The product subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 8104.11.00 and 8104.20.00
of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope is dispositive.



B. Alloy Magnesium




The product covered by this investigation is alloy primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless
expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight
primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal.


This investigation covers alloy primary magnesium products which contain 50% or greater, but less than 99.8%, primary
magnesium, by weight. Products with the aforementioned primary magnesium content that do not conform to ASTM specifications
or other industry or customer-specific specifications are included in the scope of this investigation. In addition
to primary magnesium, ``alloy'' magnesium generally contains one or more of the following items in amounts less than
the primary magnesium itself: (1) Other elements deliberately added to the primary magnesium; (2) magnesium scrap
or secondary magnesium; (3) oxidized magnesium; and (4) other elements present as impurities.


Alloy primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets
and other shapes.

Excluded from the scope of this investigation are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium.
Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium
granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced by grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and
thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not susceptible to precise measurement because of their
irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced in coarse shapes and have a maximum length of less than
1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules are more regularly shaped than turnings or chips, and
have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller.
Powders are produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary magnesium,
but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV, the section
of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will pass through
a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals, Note 6(b).) Accordingly,
the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products having a maximum physical
dimension (

i.e.

, length or diameter) of 1 inch or less.
The product subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 8104.19.00 and 8104.20.00
of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope is dispositive.


Period of Investigation


The period of investigation is April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994 for pure magnesium, and September 1, 1992, through
March 31, 1994, for alloy magnesium.


Nonmarket Economy Country Status


The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (see, 

e.g.,

 Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the PRC, 59 FR 28053, May 31, 1994). No information
has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn this designation. Therefore, in accordance with
section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of these investigations.


Surrogate Country


In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in
one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market
economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. Accordingly, we considered potential
surrogates that produce comparable merchandise. Although the material inputs used to produce magnesium and aluminum
are different, according to both U.S. Bureau of Mines and Department of Commerce experts, both (1) are light metals
in terms of molecular weight; (2) are electricity-intensive products; (3) are produced using an electrolytic process,
and (4) share some common end uses (

e.g.

, dye casting). Therefore, in these investigations, we have determined that aluminum constitutes comparable merchandise
in the context of surrogate selection.
The Department has determined that India and Indonesia are the countries most comparable to the PRC in terms of being
significant producers of comparable merchandise (aluminum) and of overall economic development. (See October
21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the File.) However, our research indicates that electricity rates
in India are relatively high as compared to other countries which produce electricity-intensive products. Because
high industrial electricity rates normally are inconsistent with significant production of electricity-intensive
products such as aluminum, we do not believe that India is an appropriate surrogate country for valuing the factors
of production for these products.
Accordingly, we have based foreign market value (FMV) on the values of the appropriate factors of production in Indonesia.
We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible.


Fair Value Comparisons


In cases involving the PRC, the Department assigns a single rate to all PRC exporters unless a company establishes
that it is entitled to a separate rate (see, for example, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon
Carbide from the PRC (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994)). In these investigations, we have assigned a single rate to all PRC exporters
in each investigation.
To determine whether sales of pure magnesium and alloy magnesium from the PRC to the United States were made at less
than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and
``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.

United States Price



For both pure magnesium and alloy magnesium, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the
Act, because the subject merchandise was sold directly by the Chinese exporter to unrelated parties in the United
States prior to importation into the United States.

We calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States.
We made deductions for foreign inland freight, loading, and port handling expenses, valued in a surrogate country.
To value freight, we used Indonesian freight rates from a 1991 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta (see, Preliminary
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from the PRC 56 FR 66831,
December 26, 1991). We were unable to obtain loading and port handling expenses valued in Indonesia. For purposes
of the preliminary determinations, we valued these expenses based on Indian port charges quoted by an international
shipping company.



Foreign Market Value



In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV for both pure magnesium and alloy magnesium based on
factors of production reported by the factory in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise. The factors used
to produce pure magnesium and alloy magnesium include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported
factor quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values from Indonesia for the different inputs.
In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production, we used, where possible, publicly
available, published information.

We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the
magnesium factories, and between factories and exporters/ports. Where the producer failed to provide the information
on transportation distances for a raw material input, we applied the average of the distances reported for other raw
materials.

To value raw materials, we used public information from United Nations Trade Commodity Statistics and Indonesia
Foreign Trade Statistics.

To value electricity, we used public information on Indonesia from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian
and Pacific Region (January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. As the data dated from 1990, we adjusted
the electricity values to the appropriate POI using wholesale price indices published in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) by the International Monetary Fund. Min He did not report the consumption factor for water and coal.
For purposes of these determinations, we estimated these factors based on the ratio of non-electricity energy inputs
to the total of material, labor, and energy inputs stated in the petition.

To value hourly labor rates in Indonesia, we used data obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics
on hourly compensation costs in Indonesia's manufacturing sector for 1986, and adjusted the labor rates to the appropriate
POI using consumer price indices published in the IFS by the International Monetary Fund, and adjusted for inflation
in the same manner identified for electricity.

We were unable to obtain an appropriate factory overhead percentage based on Indonesian experience. Accordingly,
for purposes of these determinations, we calculated factory overhead based on information in the petition concerning
the experience of a U.S. magnesium producer. For selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, we used
the statutory minimum of ten percent of material, labor, energy, and factory overhead because we could not obtain
information based on Indonesian industry experience. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of
materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&A expenses because we could not obtain information on Indonesian
industry experience. We added packing based on the surrogate values obtained for the raw materials and labor in Indonesia.

Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all information determined to be acceptable for use in making
our final determinations.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of pure magnesium and alloy magnesium from the PRC, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption
on the date of this notice for publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by which the FMV
exceeds the USP, as shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further
notice.

The dumping margins are as follows:







ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determinations. If one or both of our final
determinations is affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of these preliminary
determinations or 45 days after our final determinations whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry.



Public Comment

In each of the two proceedings, seven companies indicated that they were related to companies that had provided information
as to whether or not they had made U.S. sales. 

Fifteen companies in the pure magnesium proceeding and 14 companies in the alloy magnesium proceeding provided either
no response or an inadequate response. The Department received no response from the following 13 companies in both
proceedings: Derek Raphael & Co., Ltd.; Marco Trading; Wogen Group Ltd.; Alex; Mages; and 8 companies that cannot
be named in this notice because their identities are deemed business proprietary information. We have designated
these 8 companies as companies ``A'' through ``H'' in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice, below.
We will, however, identify them to the Customs Service for enforcement of these determinations. Additionally, both
F&S (pure only) and W&O Bergmann (both pure and alloy) indicated that they had made POI sales of subject merchandise
to the United States, but otherwise ignored our requests for information. 

Finally, surveys sent to six companies were returned as undeliverable. 

On August 8, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determinations until October 27, 1994 (59 FR 42200, August
17, 1994). 

On August 10, 1994, the Department provided interested parties with the opportunity to submit published, publicly-available
information for the Department to consider when valuing the factor inputs. Petitioners and respondents submitted
information on September 7, 1994. 

From July through October 1994, the Department received responses to questionnaire sections A and C for pure magnesium
from AIOC, Gerald Metals, HDM, Interlink, MG Metals, Razno and SMW. (Note that SMW's trial sale of pure magnesium were
not considered by the Department because these sales represent an insignificant portion of the total volume of U.S.
sales. Therefore, for the preliminary determination, the Department has not considered SMW to be an exporter of pure
magnesium and did not calculate a margin for SMW's trial sales of pure magnesium.) 

For alloy magnesium the Department received responses to Sections A and C from Gerald Metals and SMW. 

The Department received responses to sections A and D from the following manufacturers: Berezniki Titanium and Magnesium
Works (Avisma) and SMW. 

On September 12, 1994, Avisma and SMW requested that the Russian Federation be reclassified as a market economy country.
They also contended that, if the Department did not revoke the Russian Federation's non-market economy (NME) designation,
the Department should determine that the magnesium industry in the Russian Federation is a market-oriented industry
(MOI). (See the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice, below.) 

During September and October 1994, the Department requested clarifications of the submitted questionnaire responses
from AIOC, Avisma, Gerald Metals, HDM, Interlink, MG, Razno, and 
SMW. Avisma, Interlink, MG, Razno, and SMW submitted additional response information. Gerald Metals' and HDM's
responses to this supplemental information request are not due until after the deadline for these preliminary determinations.


On October 10, 1994, petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of alloy magnesium
from the Russian Federation. The Department accepted this allegation and requested that Gerald Metals and SMW provide
historical information on shipments of alloy magnesium. 



Postponement of Final Determinations 



Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on October 24, 1994, Gerald Metals, a reseller accounting for a significant
proportion of the merchandise in these proceedings, requested that, in the event of affirmative preliminary determinations
in these investigations, the Department postpone the final determinations to 135 days after the date of publication
of the affirmative preliminary determinations. Avisma and SMW, producers accounting for a significant proportion
of merchandise in these proceedings, made a similar request on October 27, 1994. Therefore, we are postponing the
final determinations until the 135th day after the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

.

Scopes of Investigation 



A. Pure Magnesium 



The product covered by this investigation is pure primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless
expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight
primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal. 

Pure primary magnesium encompasses all products that contain at least 99.95% primary magnesium, by weight (generally
referred to as ``ultra-pure'' magnesium), as well as products containing less than 99.95% but not less than 99.8%
primary magnesium, by weight (generally referred to as ``pure'' magnesium). Products that have the aforementioned
primary magnesium content, but that do not conform to ASTM specifications or other industry or customer-specific
specifications, are included in the scope of this investigation. 

Pure primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets
and other shapes. 

Excluded from the scope of this investigation are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium. 

Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced
by grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not
susceptible to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced
in coarse shapes and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules
are more regularly shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller. 

Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary
magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV,
the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will
pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals,
Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products
having a maximum physical dimension (

i.e.

, length or diameter) of 1 inch or less. 

The products subject to these investigations are currently classifiable under subheadings 8104.11.00 and 8104.20.00
of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope is dispositive. 



B. Alloy Magnesium 



The product covered by this investigation is alloy primary magnesium regardless of chemistry, form or size, unless
expressly excluded from the scope of this investigation. Primary magnesium is a metal or alloy containing by weight
primarily the element magnesium and produced by decomposing raw materials into magnesium metal. 

This investigation covers alloy primary magnesium products which contain 50% or greater, but less than 99.8%, primary
magnesium, by weight. Products with the aforementioned primary magnesium content that do not conform to ASTM specifications
or other industry or customer-specific specifications are included in the scope of this investigation. In addition
to primary magnesium, ``alloy'' magnesium generally contains one or more of the following items in amounts less than
the primary magnesium itself: (1) Other elements deliberately added to the primary magnesium; (2) magnesium scrap
or secondary magnesium; (3) oxidized magnesium; and (4) other elements present as impurities. 

Alloy primary magnesium is cast and sold in various physical forms and sizes, including ingots, slabs, rounds, billets
and other shapes. 

Excluded from the scope of this investigation are primary magnesium anodes, granular primary magnesium (including
turnings and powder), and secondary magnesium. 

Granular magnesium, turnings, and powder are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS) subheading 8104.30.00. Magnesium granules and turnings (also referred to as chips) are produced
by grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and thus have the same chemistry as primary magnesium. Although not
susceptible to precise measurement because of their irregular shapes, turnings or chips are typically produced
in coarse shapes and have maximum length of less than 1 inch. Although sometimes produced in larger sizes, granules
are more regularly shaped than turnings or chips, and have a typical size of 2mm in diameter or smaller. 

Powders are also produced from grinding and/or crushing primary magnesium and have the same chemistry as primary
magnesium, but are even smaller than granules or turnings. Powders are defined by the Section Notes to Section XV,
the section of the HTSUS in which subheading 8104.30.00 appears, as products of which 90 percent or more by weight will
pass through a sieve having a mesh aperture of 1mm. (See HTSUS, Section XV, Base Metals and Articles of Base Metals,
Note 6(b).) Accordingly, the exclusion of magnesium turnings, granules and powder from the scope include products
having a maximum physical dimension (

i.e.

, length or diameter) of 1 inch or less. 

The products subject to these investigations are currently classifiable under subheadings 8104.19.00 and 8104.20.00
of the HTSUS. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope is dispositive. 



Period of Investigation 



The POI in both proceedings is October 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994.

Fair Value Comparisons 



A. Participating Respondents 



To determine whether sales to the United States of pure magnesium by AIOC, Gerald Metals, HDM, Interlink, MG Metals,
and Razno, and sales to the United States of alloy magnesium by Gerald Metals and SMW, were made at less than fair value,
we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United
States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. 



B. Non-participating Respondents 



All companies to which a questionnaire was issued are considered mandatory respondents in these proceedings. We
consider those mandatory respondents that did not respond to the questionnaire to be uncooperative respondents,
and we have based the less-than-fair-value margin for those companies on the best information available (``BIA'').
For these preliminary determinations, we consider F&S (pure magnesium only) and W&O Bergmann (both pure
and alloy magnesium) to be uncooperative respondents, as well as: Derek Raphael & Co., Ltd.; Marco Trading; Wogen
Group Ltd.; Alex; Mages; and the eight companies whose names cannot be disclosed because their identities are deemed
business proprietary information. Accordingly, we have based these companies' LTFV margins on an uncooperative
BIA rate. 

F&S's responses to our inquiries indicated sales of pure magnesium but not sales of alloy magnesium. Therefore,
only F&S's sales of pure magnesium are subject to a BIA deposit rate. 

In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse
assumptions for those respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel
Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium, 58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), when a company
refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's
investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin
alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. Here, since these
companies failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning as BIA to uncooperative exporters a margin of 64.12
percent for pure magnesium and 107.89 percent for alloy magnesium. These margins represent the highest margin in
each petition for each product, as recalculated by the Department for the initiation. 



C. All Other Companies 



We are basing the LTFV margins for all other companies, including those companies which reported that they did not
sell the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, on a simple average of the rates calculated for the
mandatory respondents, including rates based on BIA but excluding zero and 

de minimis

 margins, if any. 



United States Price 



We based USP for AIOC, Interlink, Gerald Metals, MG Metals (where appropriate), Razno, and SMW on purchase price,
in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold directly by the exporters to
unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States and because exporter's sales price
(``ESP'') methodology was not indicated by other circumstances. 

For Interlink, Gerald Metals, MG Metals, Razno and SMW, we calculated purchase price based on packed, CIF, delivered,
or FOT warehouse prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made the following deductions (where appropriate):
for Razno and SMW, ocean freight and marine insurance; for AIOC, Interlink, Gerald Metals, and MG Metals, ocean freight,
marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling charges, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. inland insurance.


We based USP for HDM and, where appropriate, MG Metals, on ESP, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, because
the subject merchandise was sold to the first unrelated purchaser after importation into the United States. 

We calculated exporter's sale price based on packed delivered prices, where appropriate. For HDM, we made deductions,
where appropriate, for ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. inland freight, U.S. duties, and U.S. brokerage and
handling. For MG Metals, we made deductions for foreign brokerage, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. duties,
inland freight, inland insurance, and U.S. brokerage and handling. 

From each exporter's U.S. price, we deducted foreign inland freight between the factory and the reported intermediate
destination (

e.g.

, Rotterdam) as follows: For AIOC, SMW, and Razno, we used reported distances and transport modes to calculate an appropriate
surrogate factory-to-border freight amount on the basis of surrogate freight rates in Brazil; for Interlink, Gerald
Metals, HDM and MG Metals, we deducted the per-ton foreign inland freight amount reported in the petition as best information
available because those exporters failed to report in their questionnaire responses information with respect to
such charges. We made no deduction from USP to account for either export taxes paid by Russian companies to the Russian
government or commissions paid by Russian companies to other Russian companies because (a) the actual amounts paid
are an internal expense within an NME country and (b) there is no quantifiable good or service factor for which a surrogate
value can be determined. Finally, we adjusted reported marine insurance and ocean freight charges for Razno as follows:
a reported figure that appeared to be an extended value (

i.e.

, an amount applicable to the entire transaction) was adjusted to reflect a per-unit amount; for transactions where
no figure was reported, we used as the highest reported non-aberrational per-unit amount.

Foreign Market Value 



A. Market Reforms in the Russian Federation 



In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, the Department normally uses a factor valuation methodology to calculate
foreign market value when the country involved is an NME country and the Department determines that it cannot determine
foreign market value based on the respondent's prices or costs. An NME-country respondent may argue that market-driven
prices characterize its particular industry and, therefore, despite NME status, that foreign market value should
be calculated by using actual home market prices or costs. 

In these investigations, the Russian manufacturers, Avisma and SMW, make such a market-oriented-industry (``MOI'')
claim. Alternatively, the two companies claim that economic conditions now prevalent throughout Russia warrant
revocation of Russia's NME-country status, effective January 1, 1994. 

The Department's analysis with respect to such claims centers around a government's role in economic activity. Consistent
with the factors described in section 771(18), the Department considers the extent to which resources are allocated
by the market or government, taking into account government involvement in currency and labor markets, pricing,
and production and investment decisions. Where resources are not allocated by the market, it would be difficult to
conclude that home market prices or costs should be used to calculate fair value. 

Evidence provided in these proceedings indicates that Russia is in the process of implementing extensive reforms
to achieve its goal of becoming a market economy. The freeing of most prices in December 1991 and the privatization
of most enterprises formerly within the state-planning system are important steps in moving Russia towards a market
economy. 

We cannot conclude, however, based on the information in this record that Russia should be treated as a market economy
for purposes of the antidumping duty law. The Russian economy, having emerged from a centrally-planned system, is
in a state of transition. Many of the state controls have been abandoned, but that does not mean that functioning markets
have replaced controls. Because the evidence does not demonstrate that prices and costs in Russia adequately reflect
market considerations, we cannot at this time alter Russia's designation as a nonmarket economy. 

Information on the record also suggests that the government continues to be involved in the Russian magnesium sector.
For example, the Russian Federal Committee on Metallurgy, a successor to the Ministry of Industry (Metallurgy Department),
indicated in an official statement that it controls activity in the magnesium industry in Russia, noting particularly
that it coordinates production, exports, and prices. Also, although the two producers under investigation have
been privatized, this same statement indicates that the Committee may be using the remaining government interest
in these companies to carry out its intentions with respect to pricing and production. For these reasons, we have determined
that the prices or costs of producing magnesium in Russia should not be used to calculate fair value. 



B. Surrogate Country Selection 



In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in
one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market
economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. Thus, we have considered as possible
surrogates those countries that are economically comparable to Russia and that produce identical or comparable
merchandise. Of those countries that we have determined to be economically comparable, Brazil is the only country
that is a significant producer of the identical merchandise, magnesium. (See October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the
Office of Policy to the file.) Accordingly, we have based FMV on the values of the appropriate factors of production
as valued in Brazil. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible.




C. Factors of Production 



We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise
for the above-mentioned exporters. The factors used to produce pure and alloy magnesium include materials, labor,
and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the
different inputs. (For a complete analysis of surrogate values, 

see 

our calculation memorandum.) We then added amounts for general expenses and profit, the cost of containers and coverings,
and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed and ready for shipment to the United States.


To value the raw materials, we used publicly available information for Brazil from the United Nations Trade Commodity
Statistics (

UN Trade Statistics

) for January-December 1992. We did not attempt to adjust raw material factor values to account for inflation
between 1992 and the POI because the figures were reported in dollars, and we had no indication as to how exchange rates,
currency reforms, and hyperinflation could properly be taken into account. For those raw materials for which we were
unable to obtain publicly available information from Brazil, we used data provided in the petition. 

To value heavy oil, we used 1993 data for Brazil from the Energy Information Administration's International Energy
Annual. Although this value for heavy oil is tax-inclusive, it is the only data found for heavy oil in Brazil. 

Natural gas was valued using information from the petition on prices in Brazil because we could find no other source
for prices of this product. 

To value electricity for industrial use, labor, and freight rates for both truck and rail, we used information reported
by the U.S. Consulate in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on elements of constructed value data reported in the
Antidumping Investigation of Silicomanganese from Brazil (see public version of respondents' June 17, 1994, submission
in that proceeding). We adjusted the figure to reflect an energy-exclusive overhead percentage. 

For selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense and profit percentages, we used statutory minimum of
10 percent, of materials, labor, and factory overhead. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of
materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&A expenses. No surrogate country information reflected percentages
for SG&A and profit that were above the statutory minima. 

To value packing materials, we also used information provided in the UN Trade Statistics for Brazil for January through
December 1992. We added surrogate freight costs for the delivery of inputs and packing materials to the factories
producing pure and alloy magnesium. For SMW, we used the actual cost for one factor, plastic, because it had been imported
from a market economy country and paid for in convertible currency. 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information determined to be acceptable for use in making our
final determinations. 



Critical Circumstances 



Petitioners allege that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of alloy magnesium from the Russian
Federation. Under 19 CFR 353.16(a), critical circumstances exist if (1) there is a history of dumping in the United
States or elsewhere of the same class or kind of merchandise as the merchandise subject to the investigation; 

or

 the importer knew or should have known that the producer or reseller was selling the merchandise at less than its fair
value; and (2) there have been massive imports of the merchandise over a relatively short period of time. 

In determining whether imports were massive, 19 CFR 353.16(f)(1) instructs consideration of: 




(i) The volume and value of the imports; 

(ii) Seasonal trends; and 

(iii) The share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports.




Further, 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2) states that imports will not generally be considered massive unless they have increased
by at least 15 percent over the imports during an immediately preceding period of comparable duration. 

With respect to the question of whether there is a history of dumping, we consider whether there has been an antidumping
order covering the imports of the investigated product into the United States or another country. To determine whether
the importers of alloy magnesium from Russia knew, or should have known, that the products were being sold at less than
fair value, we considered the company-specific preliminary margins in these investigations. We consider margins
of 25 percent or more (when USP is purchase price) and 15 percent (when USP is ESP) sufficient to impute knowledge. See,


e.g.

, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina
(58 FR 37062, 37078, July 9, 1993). 

For all exporters except Gerald Metals and SMW, the margin calculated with respect to alloy magnesium exceeds 25 percent.
However, for Gerald Metals and SMW, the company-specific margins do not exceed 25 percent. Accordingly, we must also
consider whether there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere with respect to alloy magnesium from
Russia in order to determine whether critical circumstances exist with respect to those companies. We are aware of
no outstanding antidumping duty orders with respect to alloy magnesium from the Russian Federation. For those companies
with estimated margins that exceed 25 percent, we determine that importers knew or should have known that sales were
at LTFV prices.

The Department's official import statistics show that the volume of Russian alloy magnesium entries during the post-petition
period of April through June 1994 (79.0 metric tons) exceeds that of the January through March 1994 pre-petition period
(31.1 metric tons) by 154 percent. Nothing on the record indicates that this increase observed was the result of seasonal
trends. With respect to share of domestic consumption, the information available to us at this time does not allow
us to evaluate whether the increase can be accounted for by a change in domestic consumption 
Therefore, we find that imports were massive over a relatively short period. 
Accordingly, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of alloy magnesium
from the Russian Federation except with respect to imports of alloy magnesium sold by Gerald Metals and SMW. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of pure magnesium from the Russian Federation (except those that represent sales by AIOC, Gerald Metals,
Hunter Douglas, Interlink, or MG Metals) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date
of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. We are also directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of alloy magnesium from the Russian
Federation (except those that represent sales by Gerald Metals or SMW) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after either (a) the date that is 90 days prior to the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or (b) the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, as appropriate. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount
by which the FMV exceeds the USP as shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect
until further notice. 
Consistent with our practice in investigations involving imports from NME countries, we have, in each of the two proceedings,
calculated a single rate applicable to all exporters in the Russian Federation. The record in these investigations
indicates that all Russian exporters of magnesium responded to our questionnaire. Although SMW requested a separate
rate, we have not addressed the request because, in each proceeding, the rate for SMW and all other exporters in Russia
is the same irrespective of whether or not SMW warrants a separate rate. 
The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:

ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determinations. If one or both of our final
determinations are affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of these preliminary
determinations or 45 days after our final determinations whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry. 


Public Comment 


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than February 17, 1995, and rebuttal briefs, no later than
February 24, 1995. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested
parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be
held on February 28, 1995, at 10:00 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 1412, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours
before the scheduled time. 
Interested parties who wish to request a hearing, or to participate if one is requested, must submit a written request
to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten
days of the publication of this notice. Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number;
(2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral
presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make
our final determinations by the 135th day after the date of publication of the affirmative preliminary determinations
in the 

Federal Register

. 

These determinations is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Best Information Available (BIA)


As noted in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, Paulista withdrew from the investigation after completion
of the COP/CV verification and requested that all of its proprietary data be removed from the record. Section 776(c)
of the Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and
in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department shall use BIA as a basis
for its determination. Consequently, we have based this determination on BIA.
In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions
to those respondents found to be uncooperative in an investigation. The Department's two-tiered methodology for
assigning BIA has been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (

See Allied Signal v. United States

, 996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (June 22, 1993)).
When a company refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department normally
uses as BIA the highest of: (1) the highest margin in the petition; (2) the highest margin calculated for any other respondent
within the same country for the same class or kind of merchandise; or (3) the estimated margin found for the affected
firm in the preliminary determination. (

See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings)
and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 

54 FR 18992, 19033 (1989)).
As detailed in the DOC position in Comment 1 below, we consider Paulista to have been uncooperative. Under our standard
practice, we would have selected as the most adverse BIA for this investigation the estimated margin found for Paulista
in the preliminary determination. However, because Paulista withdrew all of its proprietary data from the record,
we cannot rely on the preliminary determination. 

Smith Corona Corp. v. United States,

 796 F.Supp. 1532 (CIT 1992) (

Smith Corona

). It would be inappropriate to allow Paulista to thwart proper administration of the law and reward its uncooperative
behavior by selecting as BIA the highest rate in the amended petition, which is less adverse than the preliminary rate.
Therefore, we assigned to Paulista a BIA margin by comparing United States price (USP) to CV, based on information
in the record. (For a discussion of this BIA calculation see the ``Fair Value Comparisons'' section of this notice
and Comment 2 below).
In calculating the ``All Others'' rate, the Department normally weight averages all positive margins found in the
investigation, including BIA rates. As discussed above, as an uncooperative respondent, Paulista will receive
an adverse BIA margin. Because Paulista's margin is the only margin found in the investigation, under our normal practice,
its margin would become the ``All Others'' rate. The Department notes, however, that in 

Smith Corona, 

the Court of International Trade (CIT) held that the Department may assign a rate lower than the highest available
rate to nonparticipants in an investigation, when those parties (1) had no control over the sole respondent's withdrawal
of documentation, (2) had no reason to believe that an adverse rate would be selected for the respondent as a result
of the withdrawal of information, and (3) had no opportunity to offer their own data.

In the present case, as in 

Smith Corona, 

producers/exporters who were not respondents had no control over Paulista's withdrawal of its information, had
no reason to believe that Paulista would receive an adverse rate as a result of withdrawing information, and by virtue
of the point at which Paulista withdrew its information from the record, had no opportunity to submit their own data
for analysis and verification. We have concluded that, under these circumstances, assigning an adverse BIA rate
to all other producers/exporters would be inappropriately punitive. Therefore, the Department has based the ``All
Others'' rate in this investigation on the dumping margin which formed the basis for the initiation of this investigation.




Fair Value Comparisons 



As BIA, we have calculated a margin for Paulista based on a comparison of USP and foreign market value (FMV). USP was
based on information contained in the petition, as fully described in the notice of initiation of this investigation
(58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993). FMV was based on CV, using data submitted by petitioners and relied upon by the Department
in its initiation of the COP investigation (

See, 

Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford, May 13, 1994, on file in Room B-099 of the Main Commerce
Building), adjusted for interest expense and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii), we added the
statutory minimum of eight percent for profit and recalculated interest expense based on the consolidated results
of the operations of Paulista for the year ending December 31, 1993, as reflected in its public financial statements.
Since FMV is based on a CV, which is exclusive of any value added taxes (VAT), we have adjusted USP to exclude the VAT adjustment
that was made for purposes of this initiation. 



Interested Party Comments





Comment 1: 

Petitioners argue that the Department should find Paulista uncooperative because it withdrew its participation
from the investigation and removed all of its proprietary information from the record. 

Paulista states that the company devoted significant time and resources to provide the information requested by
the Department during the course of the investigation, allowed verification of its cost response and provided additional
information to the Department after the cost verification. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with petitioners. By withdrawing from the investigation, Paulista significantly impeded the completion
of the Department's investigation. Moreover, in light of Paulista's removal of all of its proprietary information
from the record, the Department has no choice but to treat Paulista as an uncooperative respondent. This action has
the consequence of expunging from the administrative record the basis for showing, either now or on appeal, that Paulista
had been cooperative during this investigation. (

See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products and
Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Italy, 

58 FR 37153 (July 9, 1993); 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products from
France, 

58 FR 6205 (January 27, 1993)). 



Comment 2: 

Petitioners argue that Paulista withdrew from the investigation only after recognizing that the results of the investigation
would be more favorable if based on the petition or initiation rate. Consequently, petitioners argue that the Department
must look beyond the pool of rates identified in its two-tier BIA policy, since none of those rates was sufficiently
adverse to compel Paulista's cooperation. Petitioners contend that, as BIA, the Department should use data in petitioners'
COP allegation and Paulista's financial statements to calculate FMV, and data provided in Paulista's own ranged
public submissions of its questionnaire response to calculate USP. In addition, the petitioners contend that because
Paulista was uncooperative, the Department should ``de-range'' USP information provided in the public version
of Paulista's response by reducing gross prices by 10 percent and increasing the foreign movement charges and U.S.
selling expenses by 10 percent.

Paulista agrees that BIA is warranted in this investigation. However, Paulista contends that the company's ranged
public data should not be used to calculate USP. Paulista argues that the use of its ranged public data as BIA would be
unprecedented and contrary to the intent of the Department's public summary requirements, which is to provide meaningful
summaries of data for the public. Additionally, Paulista asserts that there is sufficient information on the record
in this investigation to establish a BIA dumping rate without resorting to the use of ranged data.



DOC Position:

 We agree with the petitioners that Paulista should not be rewarded for withdrawing from the investigation. In order
to assign Paulista an adverse BIA rate, the Department cannot rely on the margin calculated in the preliminary determination
because the use of such a rate would not comport with the CIT's decision in 

Smith Corona.

 While the Department might otherwise rely on the amended petition for purposes of BIA, given the circumstances of
this case and the intent of the statute, we do not find that the rates contained in that petition provide an adequate
basis for BIA. Section 776(c) of the Act provides for the use of BIA to compel participation. Further, a more adverse
BIA is required where a respondent fails to cooperate or significantly impedes the investigation, as in this case.
The preliminary margin was substantially higher than the rate found in the amended petition for purposes of initiation.
To use the petition rate would, in effect, reward the respondent for refusing to cooperate. Moreover, a precedent
could be set which would encourage a respondent to withdraw from a proceeding and remove its proprietary information
from the record whenever the margin found in the preliminary determination exceeded that which formed the basis of
the initiation (

e.g., Krupp Stahl A.G. v. United States,

 Slip Op. 93-84, May 26, 1993).

We disagree, however, with petitioners' proposed selection of BIA. Although the Department has used such ranged
data as a basis for BIA in the past, the use of such information is a last resort. In this instance, we are not compelled
to use the ranged data in order to calculate an adverse final determination rate. There is sufficient data available
in petitioners' COP allegation and Paulista's public financial statement to calculate a FMV based on CV. This methodology
is consistent with both past practice (

see, e.g., Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products,
Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium,

 58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), and with the CIT's holding that respondents should not realize a benefit from noncooperation.



Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with Section 735(c)(4) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation
of all entries of silicomanganese from Brazil that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after June 17, 1994, the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 of our preliminary determination. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the
estimated amount by which the FMV of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the U.S. price, as shown
below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The dumping margins are as follows:

International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification



In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. The ITC will now determine
whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 45 days.
If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist with respect to the subject
merchandise, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities posted will be refunded or canceled. If the ITC
determines that such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officials
to assess antidumping duties on all imports of the subject merchandise from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after the effective date of the suspension of liquidation.



Notification to Interested Parties


This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.34(d), concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information
disclosed under APO. Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. 

This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

Best Information Available




As detailed in our preliminary determination, the Department sent antidumping questionnaires to 18 producers and
exporters that may have sold silicomanganese to the United States during the POI. Further, we sent an antidumping
questionnaire to the PRC Ministry of Foreign Economic Trade and Cooperation (MOFTEC) and requested that MOFTEC:
(1) Furnish the questionnaire to any silicomanganese producers and exporters with U.S. sales during the POI that
were not on our list of 18 companies, and (2) provide a comprehensive list of those additional companies that received
the questionnaire from MOFTEC. Two companies, a PRC producer of silicomanganese and a Hong Kong export company that
purchased silicomanganese from that company and sold it to the United States, were found by the Department not to have
had any sales during the POI. Further, we did not receive responses from MOFTEC and the remaining potential respondents.
Accordingly, given that no information was submitted by potential respondents with respect to sales during the POI,
we have based our final determination on best information available (BIA), in accordance with section 776(c) of the
Act.


The BIA methodology is described in the notice of preliminary determination. In this case, BIA is the information
contained in the petition, as amended on November 24, 1993 (

See Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China,
Ukraine and Venezuela

, 58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993). The amended petition provides only one margin, listed below, for all PRC producers
and exporters of silicomanganese.



Critical Circumstances




Petitioner alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from the PRC. In
our preliminary determination, pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we analyzed the allegations
using the Department's standard methodology. Because no additional information was submitted since the preliminary
determination, the Department is using the same analysis as explained in its preliminary finding and determines
that critical circumstances exist for imports of silicomanganese from the PRC.



Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation




Pursuant to section 735(c)(4) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation
of all entries of silicomanganese from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after March 18, 1994 (

i.e.

, 90 days prior to the date of publication of our preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

). The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to 150.00 percent 

ad valorem

 on all entries of silicomanganese from the PRC. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further
notice.



International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification




In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. The ITC will now determine,
within 45 days, whether these imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to the U.S. industry.
If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated
and all securities posted will be refunded or canceled. If the ITC determines that such injury does exist, the Department
will issue an antidumping order directing Customs officials to assess antidumping duties on all imports of the subject
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the effective date of the suspension
of liquidation.



Notification to Interested Parties




This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section

United States Price 


We calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination. 


Foreign Market Value 


As noted in our preliminary determination, we initiated a COP investigation on May 9, 1994, based on an allegation
by the petitioners (

see

 decision memorandum from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford, dated May 9, 1994). On the basis of petitioners' allegations,
we gathered and verified data on production costs. Because Hevensa's COP response was not due until after the date
of the preliminary determination, this information was not considered for the preliminary determination. 


A. 

Calculation of COP 


In order to determine whether prices were above the COP, we calculated the COP in accordance with 353.51(c) of the Department's
regulations. Our calculations of COP were based on the sum of Hevensa's submitted costs of materials, fabrication,
general expenses, and packing, except in the following instances where we determined that the costs were not appropriately
quantified or valued. Specifically, we: 
1. Recalculated depreciation expense based on the restated value of Hevensa's fixed assets; 
2. Disallowed Hevensa's claimed foreign exchange gains on client accounts receivable; 
3. Reclassified foreign exchange gains and losses on the purchase of input materials from financing expense to cost
of manufacturing; 
4. Recomputed general and administrative expense and interest expense using a cost of sales figure adjusted for depreciation
expense and exchange losses on material purchases as noted in 1 and 3 above; 
5. Included the same amount of value-added tax (VAT) in home market COP as is included in the domestic sales prices;
and 
6. Added the additional charge incurred by Hevensa for the production of the Grade C product, as negotiated with its
contractor. 




B. 

Test of Home Market and Third Country Sale Prices 


After calculating COP, we tested whether home market and third country sales of silicomanganese were made at prices
below COP. 
We compared product-specific COP to reported prices that were net of movement charges, discounts, rebates, direct
and indirect selling expenses, and inclusive of VAT. If over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were
at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost
sales were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product
were at prices above the COP, we discarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we
found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP and were sold over
an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that product and calculated FMV based on constructed value
(CV). 
In order to determine that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis
on a product-specific basis: 1) if a respondent sold a product in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that
month below the COP, or 2) if a respondent sold a product during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below
the COP during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended
period of time. 




C.

 Results of COP Test 


We found that more than 90 percent of Hevensa's third country sales of Grade C fines were sold at below-COP prices over
an extended period of time. Hevensa provided no indication that these below-COP sales were at prices that would permit
recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. Therefore, we disregarded
all third country sales of Grade C fines. For U.S. sales left without a match as a result of disregarding these below-COP
sales, we based FMV on CV. 
We found that more than ten percent but less than 90 percent of Hevensa's sales of Grade B silicomanganese lump, size
5
'
' x 1
'
', were sold at below-COP prices over an extended period of time. Therefore, we excluded from the calculation
of FMV those home market sales which were priced below the merchandise's cost of production.

Price-to-Price Comparisons 


We calculated FMV using the methodology described in our notice of preliminary determination, with the following
exceptions: 
1. We matched the 5
'
' x 2
'
' material sold in the United States to the 5
'
' x 1
'
' material sold in the home market instead of to the 4
'
' x 2
'
' material sold in the home market. 
2. We matched 30mm x 6mm Grade C lump material to CV (see

 concurrence memorandum, dated October 31, 1994). 
3. We matched the 6mm x 1mm Grade C fines sold in the United States to CV because more than 90 percent of respondent's sales
of this product were at prices below the COP and were sold over an extended period of time. 


Price to CV Comparisons 


In the instances noted above and where there was otherwise no matching home market or third country sale, we based FMV
on CV. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, and U.S. packing cost.
We made all adjustments described in the COP section (except for the inclusion of VAT) in calculating CV. In accordance
with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, we included in CV the greater of the company's reported general expenses
or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture. For profit, we used the actual profit earned by Hevensa
where the actual figure was greater than the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses,
in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. 


Currency Conversion 


We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified information provided by Hevensa by using standard verification
procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records, and selection of original source
documentation containing relevant information. 


Interested Party Comments 




Comment 1: 

Hevensa asserts that its home market sale of Grade C lump silicomanganese during the POI was outside the ordinary course
of trade and, therefore, should not be used to calculate FMV for the 30mm x 6mm Grade C merchandise. Hevensa asserts
that the home market sale was the only such sale made during the POI, that the amount of the sale was smaller than those
made in Hevensa's ordinary home market sales, and that the sale was made on a trial basis to a trader who had requested
a different product that was not available at the time. 
Petitioners assert that the sale was a legitimate one and the fact that it was for a smaller than usual amount is not enough
to indicate that it was outside the ordinary course of trade. 


DOC Position:

 We agree with Hevensa. During verification, we satisfied ourselves that the home market sale of 30mm x 6mm Grade C material
was a trial amount sold outside the ordinary course of trade. This was the only sale of a trial amount during the 16 months
examined at verification. Moreover, Hevensa did not make any other sales to this customer during that period of time.



Comment 2: 

Hevensa contends that the Department should use monthly or bi-monthly weighted-average FMVs, rather than the normal
six-month average FMV, to calculate whether there is a margin of dumping in this investigation. Hevensa argues that,
during the POI, the interplay among the Venezuelan rate of inflation, the U.S. dollar-based prices of the subject
merchandise, and the changes in the exchange rate for U.S. dollars and Venezuelan bolivars, could create a margin
of dumping if a weight-averaged FMV were used for the entire POI. 
Petitioners argue that Hevensa is requesting that the Department adopt a methodology that is inconsistent with its
practice in hyperinflationary economy cases. Additionally, the petitioners assert that, if Hevensa's monthly
FMVs were adopted, any comparison between the FMV and the U.S. price would be distorted. Specifically, the petitioners
argue that Hevensa is requesting that the Department apply, in effect, only that part of its methodology for hyperinflationary
economies calling for the use of monthly FMVs, not the part of the methodology calling for the submission of costs on
a replacement basis.

<TEXT>
 



DOC Position:

 We disagree with respondent's argument that the Department should use monthly or bi-monthly weighted-average FMVs
because of the high rate of inflation in Venezuela during the POI. However, it should be noted that the Department has
calculated two weighted-average FMVs to accommodate the introduction of VAT in Venezuela during the last two months
of the POI. Because Hevensa's U.S. sales were only invoiced during the last two months of the POI, it happens that Hevensa's
U.S. sales of the merchandise in question were compared only to a two-month VAT-inclusive weighted-average FMV.

We agree with the petitioners that it would be inappropriate to apply only the averaging portion, and not the replacement
cost portion, of our hyperinflationary economy methodology. Although information on the record of this investigation
would permit the Department to calculate the FMV on a monthly or bi-monthly basis, if we were to find the Venezuelan
economy to be hyperinflationary during the POI, our methodology for hyperinflationary economies also requires
us to calculate the cost of production on a replacement cost basis. It is not possible for us to calculate Hevensa's
replacement costs because Hevensa has insisted, and we have accepted, that the Venezuelan economy during the POI
was not hyperinflationary. Accordingly, Hevensa has not supplied the Department with its replacement costs, and
we have applied our standard non-hyperinflationary methodology in this final determination. 


Comment 3

: Hevensa argues that the Department should revise its level-of-trade analysis from the preliminary determination.
During the POI, all of Hevensa's U.S. sales were made to Mannesmann, who resold the silicomanganese. Hevensa contends
that, in the preliminary determination, it was inappropriate for the Department to compare Hevensa's sales to Mannesmann
to Hevensa's home market sales to a home market trader because its home market trader does not perform the same role
as Mannesmann. Rather, Hevensa claims that Mannesmann functions as a commission agent, while the home market trader
functions as a wholesaler. 
Petitioners assert that the Department focuses on the customer's function in the distribution chain to classify
sales by level of trade and that Mannesmann functions as any trader does, 

i.e.

, it takes title to the material and then resells it. Accordingly, the petitioners argue that both Mannesmann and Hevensa's
home market trader ``have the same place in the chain of distribution_to sell to end-users and, therefore, they are
at the same level of trade.'' 


DOC Position

: We agree with the petitioners. We view the level of trade of the sales between Hevensa and its home market trader as
being functionally equivalent to the level of trade of Hevensa's sales to Mannesmann. Both Mannesmann and the home
market trader are wholesalers, and both are taking title to the merchandise prior to reselling it (

see 

Concurrence Memo for this final determination). 


Comment 4

: The petitioners argue that the Department should compare Hevensa's U.S. sales of 5
'
' x 2
'
' Grade B lump silicomanganese with home market sales of 5
'
' x 1
'
' Grade B lump silicomanganese to Hevensa's home market trader/wholesaler (

i.e

., at the same level of trade). 
Hevensa argues that, if the Department decides that its U.S. sales to Mannesmann are at the same level of trade as its
home market sales to the trader (

see

 Comment 3, above), the Department should not take level of trade into account when making comparisons. Hevensa contests
comparisons based on level of trade because there was no correlation between its prices and selling expenses on the
one hand, and levels of trade on the other. Hevensa asserts both that its average prices for 5
'
' x 1
'
' Grade B lump material were higher to its home market trader than to its home market end users, and that its selling
expenses were roughly equivalent for both traders and end users. Moreover, Hevensa asserts that its sales to both
categories of customers were made by the same sales department, within the same sales process, and that no additional
technical support or additional services were provided to either category of customer. 


DOC Position

: We agree with Hevensa. Level of trade can be an important distinction where respondents charge different prices
and incur different selling expenses at the different levels of trade. Here, where the home market trader operates
at an intermediate level between Hevensa and the end users, Hevensa's prices to the trader logically would be lower
than its prices to end users if there were a relationship between Hevensa's prices and level of trade. Instead, Hevensa
has demonstrated that its average prices to the trader were marginally higher than its prices to end users. 
The Department also verified that direct selling expenses, with the exception of certain differences in the average
credit days for the home market trader and some home market end users, were similar. During verification, we did not
note any differences between home market and end-user sales processes or sales services. Furthermore, there is no
other information on the record that indicates differences existed for indirect selling expenses. Accordingly,
the Department has not taken the level of trade into account but, rather, has compared Hevensa's U.S. sales of 5
'

Comment 5

: Hevensa argues that the Department should include the amount that the customer was required to pay for VAT when calculating
Hevensa's imputed credit expenses on its home market sales. It contends that when it extends credit to its home market
customers, it necessarily agrees to a delay in the payment of the full amount owed by the customer, including the VAT.
Therefore, the Department must calculate an imputed cost for the full amount of the delayed payment. 
The petitioners argue that the Department should not consider VAT in calculating imputed credit. The petitioners
assert that Hevensa does not necessarily owe VAT at the time it ships to the purchaser and, in some instances, it may
not owe the tax until after it has received payment from the purchaser. The petitioners also state that if the Department
were to allow an imputed credit adjustment for the VAT tax, the date of invoice would not be the proper date for calculation.
Moreover, the petitioners argue that in cases where the purchaser had paid Hevensa the purchase price, including
VAT, prior to the date on which Hevensa owed VAT to the government, the Department would have to calculate a credit revenue
for Hevensa.

DOC Position

: The Department's practice is to calculate credit expenses exclusive of VAT. (See the discussion of our VAT methodology
in the preliminary determination (59 FR 31204, 31205, June, 17, 1994.) Theoretically, there is an opportunity cost
associated with any post-service payment. Accordingly, to calculate the VAT adjustment argued by Hevensa would
require the Department to calculate the opportunity costs involved with freight charges, rebates, and selling expenses
for each reported sale. It would be an impossible task for the Department to attempt to determine the opportunity cost
of every such charge and expense.



Comment 6

: Hevensa argues that the VAT methodology employed by the Department in its preliminary determination distorted
the Department's calculations by inflating_and possibly creating_the dumping margins found on Hevensa's sales.

The petitioners argue that the VAT methodology employed in the preliminary determination is consistent with the
Department's practice.



DOC Position

: We agree with petitioners. As we explained in our preliminary determination, we multiplied the foreign VAT rate
by the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market VAT was applied
to foreign market sales, and we added this product to the U.S. price. The Department also deducted from the USP and FMV
those portions of the respective home market tax and the USP tax adjustments attributable to expenses. This methodology
was adopted by the Department to comply with 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States

, 834 F. Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993) and has been the Department's practice since this ruling. See also, 

Avesta Sheffield, Inc. 

v. 

United States

, 838 F. Supp. 608 (CIT 1993).



Comment 7

: The petitioners argue that the Department should calculate duty drawback on only those export shipments of silicomanganese
that correspond to valid ``Admission Temporal par Perfectionsmiento Activo (ATPA)'' permits of the Venezuelan
government.

Hevensa concedes that its ATPA had lapsed for the period from June 29, 1993, through November 2, 1993. However, it argues
that it is eligible for duty drawback on all exports after November 2, 1993, and that it has the right to request the Venezuelan
authorities to modify its documents to apply other shipments against the ATPA.



DOC Position

: We agree with the petitioners. The record demonstrates that Hevensa was only authorized duty drawback on the particular
export sales for which an ACTA was in effect at the time the silicomanganese was exported. Accordingly, we have calculated
duty drawback adjustments for only such sales.



Comment 8

: The petitioners argue that the Department should base the adjustment of FMV for royalties on the amount of the fee
for services that had been established between Hevensa and the provider of the technical services and which Hevensa
had accrued during the POI.

Hevensa argues that the fee it had agreed to with the provider of the technical services and which it had been accruing
during the POI was not approved by the Venezuelan Superintendent of Foreign Investments (SIGHTS) and that the accrued
rate had been adjusted subsequently because the original amount had not been authorized by SIGHTS. Hevensa asserts
that the adjustment must be based on the amount that SIGHTS approved. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with Hevensa. We have adjusted the royalty expense to reflect the amount that the Venezuelan government permitted
Hevensa to pay for the POI. 



Comment 9: 

Petitioners assert that the silicomanganese slag further processed into Grade C silicomanganese by Hevensa is a
co-product of Grade B silicomanganese. The petitioners also state that because the silicomanganese slag should
be considered a co-product to the Grade B silicomanganese, the Department should allocate Hevensa's production
costs equally between Grade B silicomanganese and silicomanganese slag. The petitioners support the argument that
the slag should be classified as a co-product by noting that both the Grade B silicomanganese and the slag share a single
common production process. The petitioners also argue that inasmuch as only minor processing is necessary to process
the slag into Grade C silicomanganese, the value of the Grade C silicomanganese is representative of the value of the
slag, and that this value is significant because of the percentage of total sales that Grade C silicomanganese accounted
for during the POI. 

Hevensa argues that the silicomanganese slag generated in the production of its Grade B silicomanganese is a waste
product and, therefore, should not be treated as a co-product. Hevensa cites to the petition in this investigation
in which silicomanganese slag was classified as a waste product that received no assignment of costs as support for
its treatment of the silicomanganese slag. Hevensa also argues that the silicomanganese slag is not a finished product
and cannot be sold without substantial further processing. 



DOC Position: 

We disagree with the petitioners. In determining how to allocate costs among various products manufactured during
the course of producing the merchandise subject to the investigation, the Department, pursuant to Section 773(e)
of the Act, looks to the value of the other products relative to the value of all products produced during, or as a result
of, the process of manufacturing the product under investigation. 

See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value (SLTFV): Sebacic Acid From the People's Republic of
China,

 59 FR 28053, 28056 (May 31, 1994). 

See also IPSCO, Inc. v. U-Stat,

 965 F.2d 1056 (Fed Cir. 1992). If the value of the joint product is significant, the Department will treat such product
as a co-product, with the result that all costs incurred in the production process are allocated based on the relative
quantity of output of the joint products. 

Id., 

965 F.2d at 1060. 

In this case, the silicomanganese slag further processed into Grade C silicomanganese is not a co-product of the Grade
B silicomanganese, because its value is not significant in relation to the Grade B product. The petitioners' conclusion
that the total value of Grade C silicomanganese sales revenue during the POI was significant compared to the total
value of Grade B silicomanganese sales revenue during the POI is not accurate. The petitioners fail to take into account
that the sales revenue data used in their analysis reflects the disproportionate production and sales quantities
of Grade B silicomanganese and silicomanganese slag during the POI. That is, a significant amount of silicomanganese
slag which was used to produce the Grade C product sold during the POI was generated from slag produced in prior years.
Petitioners' analysis also fails to take into account the additional costs incurred to recover the Grade C material
from the slag. These additional costs should be deducted from the gross revenues received for the sales of Grade C silicomanganese
to perform a net realizable value comparison. After these adjustments, the net realizable value of silicomanganese
slag produced during the POI is insignificant when compared to the net realizable value of all products produced during
the POI. 

See, e.g., Final Determination of SLTFV Polythylene Terephthalate Film, Sheet and Strip From the Republic of Korea,


56 FR 16305, 16316 (April 22, 1991), concerning the accounting of recycled scrap film. Accordingly, no allocation
of costs is appropriate. 



Comment 10: 

The petitioners assert that the Department should calculate depreciation expense on the restated value of Hevensa's
fixed assets. The petitioners state that although Hevensa's use of historical cost based depreciation in its submissions
to the Department is consistent with Venezuelan Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the resulting
depreciation expense is distorted by the high level of inflation in Venezuela during the POI. 

Although Hevensa revalued its assets in its financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 1993, Hevensa
argues that Venezuelan GAAP did not permit this revaluation of assets. Hevensa further states that because its calculation
of depreciation expense on the basis of the historical value of its fixed assets for its submissions to the Department
is in accordance with the home-market country's GAAP, it should be accepted by the Department. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with the petitioners that the depreciation expense should be based on the restated value of Hevensa's fixed
assets. Normally, the Department does calculate costs in accordance with the GAAP of the home market country (

see NTN Bearing Corp. of America v. V-State, 

826 F. Supp. 1435, 144-42 (CIT 1993). However, the Department will not use a country's GAAP if it does not accurately
recognize a company's actual costs or distorts those costs (

see Id.

). This case is unusual because the accounting authorities in the home market country itself changed their position
on the restatement of fixed assets, allowing it for fiscal years beginning after October 31, 1993, after having not
approved it in prior years. This decision to revise Venezuelan GAAP was made on the basis of an on-going analysis of
the impact of economic conditions on the reporting of financial data.

Depreciation enables companies to spread large expenditures on purchases of machinery and equipment over the expected
useful lives of these assets. Not adjusting for the devaluation of currency due to high inflation results in the depreciation
deferred to future years being understated in constant currency terms, and, therefore, distorts the Department's
COP and CV calculations. 

For these reasons, we have adjusted Hevensa's depreciation expense to reflect amounts based on the restated value
of Hevensa's fixed assets. 



Comment 11: 

The petitioners assert that the Department should not deduct Hevensa's net exchange gain on financial assets and
liabilities nor its net exchange gain on client accounts in its calculation of Hevensa's interest expense. The petitioners
argue that because the net exchange gains on financial assets and liabilities are not related to the production of
silicomanganese, the Department should not offset Hevensa's interest expense with these gains. With respect to
exchange gains and losses on accounts receivable, the petitioners argue that Department policy does not permit such
items to be used as an offset to interest expense. 

Hevensa argues that its net exchange gain on financial assets and liabilities should be treated in a manner similar
to interest income on short-term financial assets. The respondent also states that the exchange gain or loss relates
to a foreign deposit in which the total return is equal to the sum of the interest to be paid and the exchange gains and
losses. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with the petitioners, in part. It is Department practice not to include exchange gains and losses on client
accounts receivable because the exchange rate we use to convert third-country sales to U.S. dollars is that in effect
on the date of the U.S. sale. (

See 

19 CFR 353.60.) Accordingly, we have disallowed Hevensa's claimed foreign exchange gains on client accounts receivable.


It is Department practice to include foreign exchange gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities in our
COP and CV calculations where they are related to the company's production of the subject merchandise. Financial
assets and liabilities are directly related to a company's need to borrow money, and we include the cost of borrowing
in our COP and CV calculations. Therefore, we disagree with the petitioners and have included foreign exchange gains
and losses on financial assets and liabilities in COP and CV. 



Comment 12: 

The petitioners assert that late payment penalties paid to suppliers and net exchange losses on purchases from suppliers
should be reclassified as costs of manufacturing. The petitioners cite prior Department policy in which all costs
directly associated with the purchasing of materials were included in material costs. 

Hevensa argues that because money is fungible, late payment penalties and net exchange losses on purchases from suppliers
should be classified as a general expense, not as a cost of manufacturing. Hevensa notes that by borrowing working
capital from its suppliers (by delaying its payments), it freed up its remaining cash to be used in other operations,
and thus borrowing from these suppliers helped finance Hevensa's overall operations. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with the petitioners, in part. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the purchase of raw materials used in production
of subject merchandise relate directly to the acquisition of the input materials and should be included in the cost
of manufacture. Late payment penalties, which represent interest charges for late payment to suppliers, are directly
related to management's decision on the usage of capital. Because the Department considers the cost of acquiring
capital to be fungible, we believe these late payment penalties are classified appropriately as interest expense.




Comment 13: 

The petitioners assert that Hevensa misallocated the cost of silicomanganese fines and manganese ore used in the
production of Grade B lump silicomanganese. Hevensa divided the total costs of fines and manganese ore for the month
by the total volume of Grade B lump and fines produced during the same month to obtain a monthly cost of fines and ore per
unit of silicomanganese produced. Petitioners also assert that because Hevensa reported no sales of Grade B fines
during the POI, Hevensa should have allocated the fines and ore cost only over the volume of Grade B lump and silicomanganese
slag produced. 

Hevensa contends that it properly allocated cost to the Grade B silicomanganese fines produced, even though none
were sold during the POI. The costs assigned to the fines are included in the inventory value of the fines, and then included
in the submitted costs of manufacture when the fines are used in production. If no cost is assigned to fines generated
during production, then no cost for fines used in production should be included in the submitted cost of manufacturing.




DOC Position: 

We disagree with the petitioners. Hevensa did not misallocate the cost of silicomanganese fines and manganese ore.
The costs assigned to the silicomanganese Grade B fines generated in the production process are the same costs assigned
to silicomanganese Grade B fines reintroduced into the furnace. In our view, this methodology does not distort costs.
Accordingly, no adjustment is necessary. 



Comment 14: 

The petitioners argue that Hevensa should include VAT on raw materials as part of its production costs for months that
were subject to VAT. To exclude VAT on cost of materials from COP and CV would be contrary to Department practice. 

Hevensa argues that if the Department includes the value added taxes paid on inputs in the cost of production, it must
also include the VAT received from its customers in the price for purposes of the sales below cost test. 



DOC Position: 

We agree with the respondent. The amount of VAT included in the home market COP should be the same as the amount that is
included in the home market sales prices. For CV and third-country sales, no VAT on raw materials should be included.
If the VAT is rebated by the government upon export, no VAT is added to CV on third country sales price in any event, pursuant
to Section 773(e)(1)(a).

Comment 15: 

Hevensa argues that the Department should perform the sales below cost test by comparing the sales price to a monthly
weighted-average COP. It asserts that comparing sales prices at the beginning of the POI to a weighted-average COP
for the POI would be distortive, given the high rate of inflation experienced in Venezuela during the POI. 

The petitioners argue that Hevensa's proposed comparison of monthly COPs, calculated on a historical cost basis,
to monthly selling prices would be contrary to Department practice and highly distorted. Petitioners assert that
as a consequence of the erosion of the value of the Venezuelan currency between the date the inputs were purchased and
the date of shipment of the silicomanganese produced using inventoried inputs, Hevensa's proposed methodology
understates Hevensa's production costs. 



DOC Position: 

Department practice is to compute a single POI weighted-average cost of production for each different model or product
of subject merchandise. Monthly COPs are computed in situations where the country under investigation is experiencing
``hyperinflation.'' When a country is experiencing hyperinflation, we require respondents to report monthly COPs
using the replacement cost methodology. In this investigation, the Department determined that the Venezuelan economy
was not experiencing hyperinflation during the POI. Indeed, this was the position taken by Hevensa during the investigation.
As a consequence, Hevensa submitted its historical costs rather than the replacement costs required by the Department's
hyperinflation methodology. Accordingly, monthly weighted average COPs were not used in the calculations for the
final determination. 



Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation 




We are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of silicomanganese from Venezuela
that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after June 17, 1993, the date of publication of
our preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the U.S. price, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation
will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: 






ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) of our
determination. The ITC will now determine, within 45 days, whether these imports are materially injuring, or threatening
material injury to the U.S. industry. If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does
not exist, the proceeding will be terminated and all securities posted will be refunded or cancelled. If the ITC determines
that such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping order directing Customs officials to assess
antidumping duties on all imports of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption
on or after the effective date of the suspension of liquidation. 



Notification to Interested Parties 



This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. This determination is published pursuant to section
735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

ACTION:

 Notice of termination of Administrative Review and Revocation of Antidumping Finding. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the decision of the United States Court of International Trade (the Court), in 

Kemira Fibres Oy

 v. 

United States

, 18 CIT

XXXX

, Slip Op. 94-139 (September 8, 1994), the Department of Commerce (the Department) is now revoking the antidumping
finding on viscose rayon staple fiber (the fiber) from Finland, terminating the 1993-94 antidumping duty administrative
review of the finding, and ending the suspension of liquidation of entries of all imports of the fiber. 
The Department is taking these actions, rather than suspend liquidation of the subject merchandise during the pendency
of appeal, because the instant decision was issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1581(i), the Court's residual jurisdictional
authority, rather than pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a, the Court's general jurisdictional authority. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 21, 1979, the United States Treasury Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the antidumping finding on the fiber from Finland (44 FR 17156). The Department conducted administrative reviews
of the fiber until 1988. However, no reviews of the fiber were conducted for the next five consecutive years (

i.e

., for the period March 1988 through February 1993) because no interested party requested an administrative review.


On June 3, 1993, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of intent to revoke the finding. See Rayon Staple Fiber from Finland; Intent to Revoke Antidumping Finding
(58 FR 31504). On June 28, 1993, two U.S. domestic producers of the fiber objected to the proposed revocation within
the time specified in the foregoing 

Federal Register

 notice. 

On March 4, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' for the period March 1, 1993 through February 28, 1994
(59 FR 10368). On March 29, 1994, two domestic producers requested that the Department conduct an administrative
review of Kemira Fibres Oy (Kemira). 

On July 13, 1994, Kemira filed an action to enjoin the Department from conducting the review, claiming that the Department
was required to revoke the finding as of April 1, 1993, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii), because 
the Department did not publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Intent to Revoke Finding'' by March 1, 1993, the first day of the fifth consecutive anniversary month
in which no administrative reviews were requested and no interested party objected to revocation or requested an
administrative review by the last day of the fifth consecutive anniversary month.

On September 8, 1994, in the case of 

Kemira Fibres Oy

 v. 

United States

, the Court ruled that the Department was required to revoke the antidumping finding on April 1, 1993. The Court, citing
``the language and character'' of 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4), concluded that ``as no interested party requested an administrative
review of the fiber by the last day of the Finding's fifth anniversary month although Commerce solicited requests
for administrative review, it was incumbent upon Commerce to conclude that the domestic industry was not interested
and to revoke the Order on April 1, 1993. Commerce is now required to: (a) Revoke the Order on the fiber, (b) terminate
the administrative review of the fiber for 1993-94, and (c) end the suspension of liquidation of entries of Kemira's
imports.'' 

Kemira Fibres Oy

 v. 

United States

, 18 CIT at

XXXX

, Slip Op. 94-139 at 16. 



Scope of the Order 



Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of viscose rayon staple fiber, except solution dyed, in noncontinuous
form, not carded, not combed and not otherwise processed, wholly of filaments (except laminated filaments and plexiform
filaments). This product is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 5504.10.00
and 5504.90.00. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description of the
scope of the finding remains dispositive. 



Actions Pursuant to Court's Judgment 



The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to end the suspension of liquidation of entries of Kemira's
imports. The Department will take no further action with respect to any administrative review under section 751(a)
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1675(a), relating to the fiber from Finland. Finally, the Department
hereby revokes the antidumping finding on the fiber from Finland (44 FR 17156, March 21, 1979), revocation being effective
April 1, 1993. 

This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of the fiber from Finland entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after April 1, 1993. The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to proceed with liquidation
of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
April 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties with respect to those entries. 

This notice is in accordance with Section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1675(c), and 19 CFR
353.25(d) (1993).

b. Preferential Export Financing Under CIC-OPCRE 6-2-6



We verified that on May 10, 1990, the functions of CACEX of the Bank of Brazil, which administered these export financing
loans, were absorbed by the Secretariat of Foreign Trade (SECEX). SECEX was not empowered to perform banking operations
and the export financing was discontinued. See, also, Certain Round-Shaped Agricultural Tillage Tools from Brazil;
Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review, March 31, 1992 (57 FR 10885) (Tillage Tools).



c. Reduction of Industrial Products Tax (IPI) and Import Duties Under Decreto No. 77.065 Through BEFIEX (Comissao
par a Concessao de Beneficios a Programas Especials de Exportacao) and CIEX (Comissao para Incentivos a Exportacao)



We verified that on April 12, 1990, Decree Law 8,032 limited this program exclusively to imports made by the federal,
state, and municipal governments, territories, and other political entities, and scientific institutions, thereby
eliminating the benefit to commerical enterprises. See, also, Tillage Tools.



d. Preferential Financing for National Trading Companies Under Resolution 883 of the Banco Central do Brasil



We verified that Banco Central do Brasil Resolution 1,744 revoked Resolution 883 on August 30, 1990, thereby terminating
this program. See, also, Tillage Tools.



e. Preferential Financing Under Resolution 68 Through FINEX



We verified that this program was terminated on April 5, 1988, by Article 4 of Brazil's new constitution, which provided
that all programs requiring funding from the national treasury had to be reenacted within a two-year period or cease
to exist. Legislation to reenact preferential financing through FINEX was not passed and the program ceased to exist.



f. Preferential Financing Under Resolution 579/83 Through PROEX and PROSIM



We verified that preferential financing through PROSIM was terminated on February 4, 1985, by BNDES Resolution 607,
and that preferential financing through PROEX was terminated in 1991 by BNDES Resolution 762.



g. Preferential Financing for the Storage of Merchandise Destined for Export Under Resolution 330/Portaria 130
of the Banco Central do Brasil



We verified that this program was terminated on August 21, 1984, by Central Bank Resolution 950.



Programs Preliminarily Found To Be Not Used



We also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine that the respondents did not use them during
the review period:



a. Preferential Financing for Industrial Enterprises by the Bank of Brazil 

b. Preferential Financing Under Resolution 578/83 Through FUNPAR

c. Accelerated Depreciation for Brazilian Made Capital Goods 

d. Green Yellow Drawback (Portaria 68/83)



Preliminary Results of Review



As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.03 percent, which is de minimis, for the
period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992.

If the final results of this review remain the same as these preliminary results, the Department intends to instruct
the Customs Service not to assess countervailing duties on shipments of the subject merchandise from all companies,
exported on or after January 1, 1992 and on or before December 31, 1992. Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of
the Act, the Department will instruct Customs not to collect cash deposits on shipments of this merchandise from all
companies entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results
of this administrative review. 

Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of the calculation methodology and interested parties may request
a hearing not later than ten days after the date of publication of this notice. Interested parties may submit written
arguments in case briefs on these preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs,
limited to agruments raised in case briefs, may be submitted seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief.
Requests for a hearing should be made within ten days of the publication of these preliminary results. Any hearing,
if requested, will be held within seven days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies of
case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested parties in accordance with 19 CFR 355.38(e) of the Department's
regulations. The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results
of its analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.

<USDEPT>CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Product Identification; Notice of Inquiry; Request for Comments and Information</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Consumer Product Safety Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of inquiry.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission frequently warns the public about unsafe products or works with industry to conduct recalls or other
corrective actions on such products that are in the hands of consumers. However, these products can be difficult for
the Commission and consumers to identify because they often lack markings that specify the name and address of the
manufacturer or importer.


To address this problem, the Commission is considering requiring firms to put identifying information on their products.
The Commission will also consider alternative ways to address the problem. Therefore, the Commission is issuing
this notice of inquiry to solicit comments from industry, consumers and all other interested parties. The Commission
is particularly interested in receiving specific information on the expected economic effects of this proposal.
After evaluating all comments received and all information available, the Commission will decide whether to propose
for additional public comment a product identification rule.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


The Commission has the authority to order firms to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of unsafe consumer
products, 

see 

15 U.S.C. 1274(b) and 2064(d), and to give public notice of the hazards. 15 U.S.C. 1274(a) and 2064(c). In addition,
the Commission frequently reaches agreements with firms to give public notice and take corrective actions voluntarily
to remove unsafe products from the marketplace. In this notice we will refer to the corrective actions of notice and
repair, replacement and refund generally as ``recalls.''
The Commission consistently works to improve the effectiveness of recalls of unsafe consumer products by making
more consumers aware of recalls and by encouraging more consumers to respond when they have a recalled product. The
most effective recalls occur when consumers can be told that a recall applies to a particular brand and model of a product
that was manufactured at a particular time, and when all of this information is displayed on the product.
Sometimes, however, the Commission cannot even seek a recall of an unsafe product because the Commission does not
know what firm manufactured, imported or distributed the product to consumers. For example, since 1984 the Commission
knows of more than 20 children who choked to death on toys that could not be identified. These toys had no identifying
information on them_except perhaps the country of manufacture_and the place of purchase was unknown.
In other cases, the Commission is able to identify the firm that made or imported the product and is able to negotiate
a recall. However, the absence of identifying information on the product makes it extremely difficult for consumers
to know whether they have the recalled product.

<PARENT> FR941107-2-00020 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A recent example of this situation is a pacifier that failed to comply with the Commission's safety requirements.
The Commission and firm negotiated a recall and attempted to describe the pacifier in a joint press release. However,
this pacifier was virtually indistinguishable from many other pacifiers unaffected by the recall, and therefore
was difficult to describe meaningfully to consumers. The press release described the affected pacifier as ``consist[ing]
of a pink, yellow, or blue guard or shield and ring with a rubber nipple.''

A similar situation arises when nearly identical products are distributed by different firms, and many brands are
recalled. For example, numerous brands of metal tubular bunk beds were recalled earlier this year, but the beds had
no identifying marks. Many consumers did not know whether their beds were involved in the recall. And, even if consumers
knew that their beds were recalled, they could not easily determine what firm was responsible for manufacturing particular
beds. This problem occurs frequently with a variety of products. The problem of describing recalled products to consumers
is compounded because the media often shorten, and may reword, the description contained in the press release announcing
a recall.

Even when recalled products are still in the hands of retailers, it can be difficult to identify the products. The manufacturer
or importer of a recalled product may not notify its retail customers because it is no longer in business, is unwilling
to do a recall or lacks complete records of its customers. In such situations, the Commission publicizes the recall,
usually by issuing a press release. When the identifying information provided in the release is on the packaging of
the recalled product, retailers can quickly remove the affected product from their shelves.

Finally, the Commission knows from experience that recalls sometimes have to include products that do not present
a safety problem because the products are not marked in a way that allows those that present the risk to be distinguished
from the same model of products that do not. For example, a quality control problem during a particular week may have
caused a defect in only a few thousand toys. If those toys cannot be distinguished from the same toys manufactured during
different weeks, they would all require recall. On the other hand, if the defective toys are marked with a code that
pinpoints the problem week, the scope of the recall can be limited and its expense reduced. This result may be helpful
to industry, consumers and the Commission.



B. Scope



The Commission enforces safety rules for thousands of different consumer products, and products that fail to comply
are generally recalled. Even if no specific rule applies to a product, all consumer products are subject to recall
if they present a substantial hazard.

Many of the Commission's safety rules and recalls involve children's and fireworks products. Moreover, these products
often place at risk children who are less able to protect themselves from unsafe products than are adults. Accordingly,
at this time the Commission is considering a product identification rule only for children's and fireworks products.



C. A Possible Product Identification Proposal



This section discusses the specific provisions of a possible product identification proposal. The provisions are
all subject to change, particularly if information received from the public during the comment period supports different
provisions that would accomplish the Commission's objectives while imposing smaller economic burdens on industry.

1. Marking Provisions


Different types of permanent marking would be acceptable. Industry members would be able to choose the type that is
most suitable for the product, and least expensive, so long as the appropriate information is communicated and will
remain on the product permanently.
The retail packaging of consumer products already contains a great deal of information and the amount of required
information has been kept to a minimum. The name and location of a manufacturing, importing or private labeling firm
located in the United States are the most important pieces of identifying information to help the Commission trace
a product. (As discussed in section 2(a) below, a code on file with the Commission may be sufficient.) If there is a recall,
it is also important to have products identified according to their model and their production run, or according to
similar categories that will help pinpoint the particular products that are unsafe. (As discussed in section 2(b)
below, this information could also be in code.) This helps limit recalls to just the products that are unsafe.
The size and conspicuousness of the marking are less significant in this type of proposal than they would be in one designed
to provide information to consumers at the time of purchase. Here, it would be sufficient if the information can be
read without disassembly of the product or magnification.


2. Exceptions


The proposal could include various exceptions to minimize its economic impact:
(a) Firms might prefer to mark products with a code such as a registered trademark or a corporate symbol or logo in place
of its name and address. The proposal could permit this if the firm notifies the Commission and waits ten working days
after receipt of the notification for the Commission to object. An objection would be made, for example, if some other
firm was already using the same or a too similar code.
(b) The model and date of production information could be provided in code, as well. If the Commission needed to know
that information, it would obtain the code or the information from the firm.
(c) Because consumer products vary greatly in size and material, the Commission recognizes that it may be impracticable
to permanently mark some limited number of products. The proposal would therefore give firms some leeway in complying.
As examples, it is impracticable to mark modeling clay because of its texture, and it is probably impracticable to
mark small glass marbles. However, the containers of any products that qualify for an exception might have to be permanently
marked or printed with the same identifying information. While containers may be discarded or lost, this provision
is intended to afford a reasonable alternative for products which cannot practicably be permanently marked.
(d) Products consisting of more than one piece, such as a set or collection, may not have to be permanently marked on
every piece. The largest piece might have to be so marked_as well as any container that comes with the product. For example,
the board in a board game (assuming it is the largest piece) and the box would be marked, but not the dice, markers or other
pieces in the game. If all pieces in a set or collection are essentially the same size, they might all have to be permanently
marked. In addition, if many pieces would fall into the category of ``the largest,'' all of those pieces might have
to be marked. While requiring every piece in a set or collection to be permanently marked would be preferable from a
safety standpoint, such a broad provision might be unduly burdensome.


3. 

Effective Date


The Commission solicits all available relevant information on an appropriate effective date, including industry
cycling schedules for replacing capital equipment.


4. Text of Possible Provisions


To obtain specific public comments and specific information, the Commission is providing the text of the possible
product identification provisions that it is considering. Again, the Commission emphasizes its willingness to
consider alternative approaches for accomplishing its objectives.

The text of the possible provisions is:



Purpose



If an unsafe product is found with no identifying information on it, the Commission may be unable to determine its manufacturer,
private labeler or importer. Corrective action may therefore not occur, and consumers will remain at risk. One purpose
of this proposal is to assure that the Commission will be able to identify the firms responsible for all unsafe products,
and be able to pursue corrective actions.
When firms do take corrective actions, such as warning the public and recalling unsafe products, the lack of inadequacy
of identifying information may prevent consumers from knowing whether they have the product in question. Many products
look the same or similar, and their markings may be the only practicable way to identify them. A second purpose of this
proposal is to assure that consumers will be able to identify products that are the subject of warnings and recalls.
If a product has been coded by date and/or production run, the scope of any recall of that product can be limited and its
cost reduced. A third purpose of this proposal is to achieve this result.


Scope


This proposal applies to every children's product and fireworks product that is first introduced into interstate
commerce on or after its effective date.


Definitions


``Children's product'' means ``any toy or other article intended for use by children,'' as the phrase is used in the
Federal Hazardous Substances Act at 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1)(D) and (q)(1)(A).
``Fireworks product'' means all fireworks products that are subject to the requirements at 16 CFR 1500.14(b)(7);
1500.17(a) (3), (8) and (9); or Part 1507.

``Manufacturer'' means any person who manufactures, produces, assembles or imports a children's product.
``Private labeler'' means an owner of a brand or trademark on the label of a children's product which bears a private
label, as the term ``bears a private label'' is defined in the Consumer Product Safety Act at 15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(7)(B).
``U.S. firm'' means a business entity that is incorporated in a state or territory of the United States or that has officers
or employees who work full-time in a state or territory within the United States and who have authority to speak for
the firm on matters related to product recalls.

``Permanently marked'' means paint-stenciled, die-stamped, molded, indelibly stamped or otherwise permanently
affixed, fastened or attached to a product by means of a tag, token or other suitable method, including securely sewn
on, so that the marking cannot be readily removed or obliterated during normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage,
abuse or misuse of the product.

``Set or collection'' means a product that consists of varied items which are intrinsically complementary to its
function, purpose or use. Examples of sets or collections include jigsaw puzzles, bags of marbles, boxes of crayons
or colored pencils, building sets and board games.



Marking Provisions



Every children's product and fireworks product shall be permanently marked to indicate: the name of the U.S. firm
that is the manufacturer or private labeler of the product; the location or business address in the United States,
including the city, state and zip code, of the U.S. firm; a number (such as a model number or stock number) or symbol that
identifies the product and distinguishes it from all other products which are not of identical construction, composition
and dimensions; and a date or number or symbol that identifies the production run or date of manufacture of the product.
The packaging of every product shall also be marked or printed with the same information. 
The information described above must be in letters and numbers that are at least one-sixteenth inch high and must be
able to be read without any disassembly of the product.


Exceptions



A U.S. firm that would be identified on a product may notify the Commission's Office of the Secretary that it intends
to use a registered trademark, a corporate symbol or some other unique code instead of the firm's name and address.
If the Commission does not object within ten working days after receiving such notification on grounds that the chosen
code would not adequately distinguished the firm from another company, the firm nay use that code.
The model and production run information may also be coded if the code and/or the uncoded information is available
to any Consumer Product Safety Commission representative immediately upon request at the specified address.

If it is physically or technologically impracticable to permanently mark a children's product or fireworks product,
the required information shall be permanently marked or printed on (1) the immediate container of the product, (2)
any container sold with and intended to be used with the product, and (3) any container sold with and intended to be used
for storage of the product after purchase.

If a children's product or fireworks product is as set or collection, only the largest component must be permanently
marked. If all of the components are the same size, or if multiple components are ``the largest,'' all such components
must be marked. Unless every component of a set or collection is marked, the containers of the product must also be marked.

All comments on this notice of inquiry should be mailed to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission,
Washington, D.C. 20207-0001, or delivered to that office at Room 502, 4330 East West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland
20814, and received no later than January 6, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Construction of a Subregional Long-Term
Wastewater Project by the City of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, California</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the proposed Santa
Rosa Subregional Long-Term Wastewater Project (Project). The purpose of the Project is to provide for effluent disposal
from the Subregional Sewerage System wastewater treatment facilities operated by the City of Santa Rosa. The Project
would implement a program to dispose of tertiary treated wastewater from system members and customers through the
year 2010. The City of Santa Rosa has applied for a Department of Army (DA) permit for authorization to discharge dredged
and fill material, and to work in navigable waters of the United States in association with construction of the Project.
The DA permit application process, scoping process, and preparation of the Draft EIS will be conducted by the Regulatory
Branch of the San Francisco District.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


1. Proposed Action







The Corps of Engineers has received an application for a Department of the Army permit from the City of Santa Rosa to
discharge dredged and fill material, and to work in navigable waters of the United States in association with construction
of a Subregional Long-Term Wastewater Project. Project implementation could include construction of embankments
to create a wastewater storage reservoir; construction of a groundwater infiltration basin; construction of pipelines
to distribute reclaimed water; construction of irrigation drainage facilities; and construction of berms of create
or restore wetlands.




The Laguna Wastewater Treatment Plant operated by the City of Santa Rosa provides tertiary treatment for approximately
16 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) average dry weather flow (ADWF) from the Subregional Sewerage System.
This results in an average annual flow of 7,000 million gallons (mg). Wastewater flows are projected to increase to
approximately 22.5 mgd ADWF by the year 2010, including consideration for lower flows due to water conservation.
This results in an average annual flow of 9,800 mg.



Disposal of treated wastewater from the Laguna plant is through agricultural irrigation, created wetlands, urban
irrigation, and discharge to the Russian River through the Laguna de Santa Rosa. Ordinarily, discharge to the Russian
River is limited to a maximum of 1 percent of river flow (5 percent with the permission of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board), and storage is provided to hold treated wastewater so that maximum legal discharge is not
exceeded. However, due to a combination of conditions which may occur during the October 1-May 14 discharge
season, discharge to the Russian River may exceed the legal maximum.

<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00063 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These conditions can occur during winters characterized by periodic light rain but overall drier-than-normal conditions.
As a result, the current Subregional System is weather-dependent, leaving it without a reliable, legally sanctioned
wastewater disposal option. By 1999 the City of Santa Rosa must put in place a disposal solution to meet future capacity
needs, no matter what weather conditions occur. The purpose of the Santa Rosa Subregional Long-Term Wastewater Project
is to provide this solution.
The DA permit application will be processed by the Regulatory Branch of the San Francisco District, Corps of Engineers,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) and Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344).
In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

) the Corps of Engineers has determined that the proposed action may have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment and therefore requires the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. A combined EIS/EIR
(Environmental Impact Report) will be prepared with the Corps of Engineers as the Federal lead agency and the City
of Santa Rosa as the lead agency for the EIR.


2. Alternatives


The Project alternatives under consideration are:



a. No Project/No Action
b. South County Reclamation
c. Community Separator/South County Reclamation
d. West County Reclamation
e. Geysers Recharge
f. 20% Maximum Russian River Discharge
g. Other project proposals that are identified as feasible during the public scoping process



Components of the alternatives to be analyzed for the Project may include: water conservation through compliance
with state regulations and an expanded subregional retrofit program; expanded agricultural irrigation; flow augmentation
of existing streams during periods of low flow; increased storage capacity, including new reservoir sites or use
of below ground aquifers; expanded urban irrigation reuse; injection and reuse of treated wastewater at the Sonoma
Geysers; and increased discharge to the Russian River (up to a maximum of 20 percent of river flow) either directly,
through rapid infiltration in the river plain, or through the Laguna de Santa Rosa.


3. Scoping Process


Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, agency planning for Federal or Federally permitted
projects must include a ``scoping'' process. Scoping primarily involves determining the scope of issues to be addressed,
and identifying the significant issues for in-depth analysis in the Draft EIS. The scoping process includes public
participation to integrate information regarding public needs and concerns into the environmental document.
The Corps of Engineers and the City of Santa Rosa will hold public scoping meetings on November 17, 1994 at 3 pm and 7 pm
at the Steele Lane Recreation Center, 415 Steele Lane, Santa Rosa, California 95403. A formal presentation will precede
the request for public comment. Representatives from the Corps of Engineers, the City of Santa Rosa, and Harland Bartholomew
& Associates (the consultant preparing the EIS/EIR) will be available at these meetings to receive comments
from the public regarding issues of concern that should be addressed in the environmental document. Further public
participation is planned, but not currently scheduled.
Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments in addition to, or in lieu of, oral
comments at the scoping meetings. To be most helpful, the scoping comments should clearly describe specific environmental
issues or topics which the commentator believes the document should address. Written comments should be mailed no
later than December 1, 1994 to the District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District, 211 Main
Street, San Francisco, California, 94105 ATTN: Wade Eakle.


a. Significant Issues


The following issues have been identified as potentially significant and will be evaluated in the Draft EIS/EIR.

<DOCTITLE>Problems in Tender Filing_New Policy</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Military Traffic Management Command, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) is proposing a policy governing carrier's responsibility for tender
filings. This policy gives MTMC authority to reject and correct mistakes in rate tender filings, and provides carriers
with rate filing procedures for correcting mistakes in rate.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed policy will be included as an enclosure to all future MTMC Guaranteed and Non-Guaranteed Traffic solicitations.




Problems in Tender Filings



1. Authority.



As indicated in the solicitation, the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations-Transportation Services retains
the authority to reject and correct mistakes in rate tender filings.



2. Procedures for Filing Tenders



a. General



(1) Carriers are solely responsible to ensure tender submissions are legible and typed. Handwritten or illegibly
typed submissions or submissions having typed strikeovers will be returned as being nonresponsive.

(2) If a rate(s), if applicable, is omitted, the tender submission will be returned as being nonresponsive.

(3) If a minimum charge(s), if applicable, is omitted, the tender submission will be returned as being nonresponsive.
If a carrier does not want to make a minimum charge, if applicable, that carrier must insert a ``0''. Tender submission
will be returned as being nonresponsive for failure of carrier to insert a ``0''.

(4) Tender submission may be returned as being nonresponsive for failure of the carrier to submit a properly signed
and executed Certificate of Independent Pricing with tender submission.

(5) Tender formats cannot be altered by carriers in any manner. If altered, the tender submission may be returned as
being nonresponsive.



b. Carrier Responsibility for Tender Filings



Carriers are solely responsible for the proper preparation, accuracy, and timely submission of their tenders. Carriers
are responsible for establishing quality control procedures that will include review of tenders prior to their submission
to Headquarters, Military Traffic Management Command. Tenders found to contain errors such as typographical may
be granted relief based on justification in support of alleged errors.



c. Administrative Errors



Administrative errors which can be corrected include, but are not limited to, mistakes in the following:

(1) Carrier street address and Standard Carrier Alpha Code.

(2) Carrier telephone number.

(3) Mode, if applicable.
(4) Tender number or series.
(5) Interstate Commerce Commission, and/or intrastate operating authority certificate number.
(6) Typed name of company official authorized to submit rates, address, and telephone number. Tender submission
will be returned as being nonresponsive for failure of a carrier to sign its tender.
(7) Tender and rate sheet not corresponding that can be evaluated on an equal basis with other carriers. If a rate sheet
varies the material terms (e.g., change in rate qualifier, mileage groups, or minimum weights) of the solicitation
so that the rates cannot be evaluated on an equal basis with other carriers, the tender submission will be returned
as being nonresponsive.

(8) Failure to submit the required number of original signature copies of the rate tender.

3. Mistakes in Rate Filing Procedures (MIRF) 



a. 

General.

 (1) Carriers discovering a mistake(s) before bid closing time can correct such mistake(s) by submission of a new tender
prior to closing. The last tender received before closing governs. Identification of a rate error(s) in a bid submission
after opening may be initiated by either HQMTMC or in writing by the carrier. After opening, carriers may either withdraw
or seek to correct rate error(s). 

(2) Correction is allowed for clerical error(s) where the intended rate is obvious from the bid submission itself,
as in the case of misplaced decimal. 

(3) Correction is allow in other cases (except in the case of a downward correction which would displace a low bidder)
only if the carrier proves the mistake and the rate actually intended by providing HQMTMC (MTOP-T-N) clear and convincing
written evidence. If the evidence supports the existence of the mistake, but not the rate actually intended, the carrier
will be permitted to withdraw its tender (or MTMC will reject it). Carriers must submit evidence to arrive HQMTMC (MTOP-T-N)
within a reasonable time after notification by MTMC of a suspected mistake. 

(4) Where a downward correction would displace a low bidder, it is permitted only if the mistake and the intended rate
can be determined from the solicitation and the tender itself. 

(b) 

Evidence.

 The following evidence must, at a minimum, be submitted by the carrier when the carrier seeks to correct a mistake in
rate other than a clerical error(s): 

(1) Original source documents pertinent to the error, including, but not limited to, working papers, spread sheets,
transcription sheets, adding machine tapes, tariffs, cost data sheets, memorandum for records, written procedural
guidance on determining rate levels, internal rate printouts, and other such papers which will provide a clear audit
trail for tracing the mistake. 

(2) Other documents deemed by the carrier to be relevant to error validation can also be used as evidence. 

(3) To protect their interests, carriers are encouraged to retain original source data until it is certain that no
further use for it exists. 

4. 

Rate Errors



Rate regression mistakes may be considered for relief under the MIRF procedure. Correction of rate regression mistakes
cannot affect other rates already in normal regression. Two examples of correctable rate regression mistakes are
shown below: 














The error in the above example is the underlined rate which is not in proper rate regression for the higher minimum weight.
It can be corrected without affecting the regression for the mileage groups. If the carrier intended a different rate,
the carrier may seek correction under the MIRF procedure, provided that the intended rate itself falls within normal
regression. 



 











The error in the above example is the underlined rate which is not in proper rate regression for the distance. It can
be correct without affecting the regression for the minimum weight groups.

5 U.S.C. App. 3 (Pub. L. 95-452, as amended (Inspector General Act of 1978)); and E.O. 9397. 



Purpose(s):


The purpose of the system of records is to provide a single central facility within the Department of Defense to assess
manpower trends, support personnel functions, to perform longitudinal statistical analyses, identify current
and former DOD civilian and military personnel for purposes of detecting fraud and abuse of pay and benefit programs,
to register current and former DoD civilian and military personnel and their authorized dependents for purposes
of obtaining medical examination, treatment or other benefits to which they are qualified, and to collect debts owed
to the United States Government and state and local governments.
All records in this record system are subject to use in authorized computer matching programs within the Department
of Defense and with other Federal agencies or non-Federal agencies as regulated by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended,
(5 U.S.C. 552a).



Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and the purposes of such uses:


In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information
contained therein may specifically be disclosed outside the DoD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as
follows:
To the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to provide military personnel and pay data for present and former military
personnel for the purpose of evaluating use of veterans benefits, validating benefit eligibility and maintaining
the health and well being of veterans.
To the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA) to provide identifying military personnel data to the DVA and its contractor,
the Prudential Insurance Company, for the purpose of notifying members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) of their
right to apply for Veteran's Group Life Insurance coverage.
To the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to register eligible veterans and their dependents for DVA programs.
To the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to conduct computer matching programs regulated by the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), for the purpose of:
1. Providing full identification of active duty military personnel, including full-time National Guard/Reserve
support personnel, for use in the administration of DVA's Compensation and Pension benefit program (38 U.S.C. 3104(c),
3006-3008). The information is used to determine continued eligibility for DVA disability compensation to
recipients who have returned to active duty so that benefits can be adjusted or terminated as required and steps taken
by DVA to collect any resulting over payment.
2. Providing military personnel and financial data to the Veterans Benefits Administration, DVA for the purpose
of determining initial eligibility and any changes in eligibility status to insure proper payment of benefits for
GI Bill education and training benefits by the DVA under the Montgomery GI Bill (Title 10 U.S.C., Chapter 106 -
Selected Reserve and Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30 - Active Duty). The administrative responsibilities designated
to both agencies by the law require that data be exchanged in administering the programs.
3. Providing identification of reserve duty, including full-time support National Guard/Reserve military personnel,
to the DVA, for the purpose of deducting reserve time served from any DVA disability compensation paid or waiver of
VA benefit. The law (10 U.S.C. 684) prohibits receipt of reserve pay and DVA compensation for the same time period,
however, it does permit waiver of DVA compensation to draw reserve pay.
4. Providing identification of former active duty military personnel who received separation payments to the DVA
for the purpose of deducting such repayment from any DVA disability compensation paid. The law (38 U.S.C. 3104(c))
requires recoupment of severance payments before DVA disability compensation can be paid.
5. Providing identification of former military personnel and survivor's financial benefit data to DVA for the purpose
of identifying military retired pay and survivor benefit payments for use in the administration of the DVA's Compensation
and Pension program (38 U.S.C. 3104(c), 3006-3008). The information is to be used to process all DVA award actions
more efficiently, reduce subsequent overpayment collection actions, and minimize erroneous payments.
To the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) consisting of personnel/employment/financial data for the purpose
of carrying out OPM's management functions. Records disclosed concern pay, benefits, retirement deductions and
any other information necessary for those management functions required by law (Pub. L. 83-598, 84-356,
86-724, 94-455 and 5 U.S.C. 1302, 2951, 3301, 3372, 4118, 8347).
To the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct computer matching programs regulated by the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a) for the purpose of:
1. Exchanging personnel and financial information on certain military retirees, who are also civilian employees
of the Federal government, for the purpose of identifying those individuals subject to a limitation on the amount
of military retired pay they can receive under the Dual Compensation Act (5 U.S.C. 5532), and to permit adjustments
of military retired pay by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and to take steps to recoup excess of that permitted
under the dual compensation and pay cap restrictions.
2. Exchanging personnel and financial data on civil service annuitants (including disability annuitants under

3. Exchanging personnel and financial data to identify individuals who are improperly receiving military retired
pay and credit for military service in their civil service annuities, or annuities based on the `guaranteed minimum'
disability formula. The match will identify and/or prevent erroneous payments under the Civil Service Retirement
Act (CSRA) 5 U.S.C. 8331 and the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (FERSA) 5 U.S.C. 8411. DOD's legal authority
for monitoring retired pay is 10 U.S.C. 1401.
4. Exchanging civil service and Reserve military personnel data to identify those individuals of the Reserve forces
who are employed by the Federal government in a civilian position. The purpose of the match is to identify those particular
individuals occupying critical positions as civilians and cannot be released for extended active duty in the event
of mobilization. Employing Federal agencies are informed of the reserve status of those affected personnel so that
a choice of terminating the position or the reserve assignment can be made by the individual concerned. The authority
for conducting the computer match is contained in E.O. 11190, Providing for the Screening of the Ready Reserve of the
Armed Services.
To the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the purpose of obtaining home addresses to contact Reserve component members

by the SSI applicant from independent or collateral sources and obtain additional information as necessary before
making SSI determinations of eligibility, payment amounts or adjustments thereto. 
6. To HHS for the purpose of conducting studies concerned with the health and well being of the active duty and veteran
population.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Computer Matching Program Between the Department of Labor and the Defense Manpower Data Center
of the Department of Defense</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Manpower Data Center, Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Defense.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a computer matching program between the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Department of Defense (DoD) for
public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between DOL and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are DOL delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by DOL so as to permit DOL to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset
procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DMDC and DOL have concluded an
agreement to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal
data between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within
the Federal government so that DOL can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or salary
offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement. 


A copy of the computer matching agreement between DOL and DMDC is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Debt Collection Officer, Department of Labor, Office of the Secretary,
Office of Financial Management MS 7258 MIB, Washington, DC 20240. Telephone (202) 208-4703.
Set forth below is the notice of the establishment of a computer matching program required by paragraph 6.c. of the
Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on computer matching published in the 

Federal Register

 at 54 FR 25818 on June 19, 1989.
The matching agreement, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of this notice was submitted
on October 21, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, `Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals,' dated July 15, 1994 (59 FR 37906, July 25, 1994). The matching program
is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.

Notice of a Computer Matching Program Between the Department of Labor and the Department of Defense for Debt Collection




A. 

Participating agencies: 

Participants in this computer matching program are the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Defense Manpower Data Center
(DMDC) of the Department of Defense (DoD). The DOL is the source agency, i.e., the activity disclosing the records
for the purpose of the match. The DMDC is the specific recipient activity or matching agency, i.e., the agency that
actually performs the computer matching.




B. 

Purpose of the match: 

Upon the execution of an agreement, the DOL will provide and disclose debtor records to DMDC to identify and locate
any matched Federal personnel, employed or retired, who may owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government under
certain programs administered by the DOD. The DOL will use this information to initiate independent collection of
those debts under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 when voluntary payment is not forthcoming. These
collection efforts will include requests by the DOL of any employing Federal agency to apply administrative and/or
salary offset procedures until such time as the obligation is paid in full. 




C. 

Authority for conducting the match: 

The legal authority for conducting the matching program is contained in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365),
31 U.S.C. Chapter 37, Subchapter I (General) and Subchapter II (Claims of the United States Government), 31 U.S.C.
3711 Collection and Compromise, 31 U.S.C. 3716 Administrative Offset, 5 U.S.C. 5514 Installment Deduction for Indebtedness
(Salary Offset); 10 U.S.C. 136, Assistant Secretaries of Defense, Appointment Powers and Duties; section 206 of
Executive Order 11222; 4 CFR Ch. II, Federal Claims Collection Standards (General Accounting Office - Department
of Justice); 5 CFR 550.1101 - 550.1108 Collection by Offset from Indebted Government Employees (OPM); 29 CFR 20.74
- 20.90 Salary Offset (Department of Labor).






D. 

Records to be matched: 

The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows:

OWCP will use personal data from the record system identified as DOL/GOVT-1, entitled `Office of Workers' Compensation
Programs, Federal Employees' Compensation File,' published in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 49548 on September 23, 1993 with amendments published at 59 FR 47361 on September 15, 1994. 


DMDC will use personal data from the record systems identified as S322.11 DMDC, entitled `Federal Creditor Agency
Debt Collection Data Base,' last published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 22, 1993, at 58 FR 10875. 

Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection Act authorize agencies to disclose information about debtors in order to effect
salary or administrative offsets. Agencies must publish routine uses pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of the Privacy
Act for those systems of records from which they intend to disclose this information. Sections 5 and 10 of the Debt Collection
Act will comprise the necessary authority to meet the Privacy Act's `compatibility' condition. The systems of records
described above contain an appropriate routine use disclosure between the agencies of the information proposed
in the match. The routine use provisions are compatible with the purpose for which the information was collected.





E. 

Description of computer matching program: 

The DOL, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a magnetic computer tape which contains the names of delinquent
debtors in programs the DOL administers. Upon receipt of the magnetic computer tape file of debtor accounts, DMDC
will perform a computer match using all nine digits of the SSN of the DOL file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC
database, established under an interagency agreement between DOD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury,
consists of employment records of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Matching records
(`hits'), based on the SSN, will produce the member's name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work
or home address. The hits or matches will be furnished to the DOL. The DOL is responsible for verifying and determining
that the data on the DMDC reply tape file are consistent with the DOL source file and for resolving any discrepancies
or inconsistencies on an individual basis. The DOL will also be responsible for making final determinations as to
positive identification, amount of indebtedness and recovery efforts as a result of the match.

The magnetic computer tape provided by DOL will contain data elements of the debtor's name, Social Security Number,
debtor status and debt balance, internal account numbers and the total amount owed on approximately 1,000 delinquent
debtors.

The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 10 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees.

DMDC will match the SSN on the DOL magnetic computer tape by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records,
hits based on SSN, will produce data elements of the member's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home
address.





F. 

Inclusive dates of the matching program: 

This computer matching program is subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. If no objections
are raised by either, and the mandatory 30 day public notice period for comment has expired for this 

Federal Register

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between DOL and DMDC, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.




G. 

Address for receipt of public comments or inquiries: 

Director, Defense Privacy Office, Crystal Mall 4, Room 920, 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202-4502.
Telephone (703) 607-2943.

for Waiver regarding blower time delay in calculation of Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) for its GRA upflow,
and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 430.27(g), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order as set out below.
In the Decision and Order, Rheem has been granted a Waiver for its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces,

Background



The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776,
which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer
products, including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption
that will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart
B. 

The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 to create a waiver process. 45 FR 64108,
September 26, 1980. Thereafter, DOE further amended its appliance test procedure waiver process to allow the Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver from test
procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 

The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 

The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Assistant Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver
when it is determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver
is denied, if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines
that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary.

FR 47317. Rheem also filed an ``Application for Interim Waiver'' under section 430.27(g) which DOE granted on September
7, 1994. 59 FR 47317, September 15, 1994. 

No comments were received concerning either the ``Petition for Waiver'' or the ``Interim Waiver.'' The Department
consulted with The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the Rheem Petition. The FTC did not have any objections
to the issuance of the waiver to Rheem. 



Assertions and Determinations



Rheem's Petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition
of the burner and the starting of the circulating air blower. Rheem requests the allowance to test using a 20-second
blower time delay when testing its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces. Rheem states that since the
20-second delay is indicative of how these models actually operate, and since such a delay results in an average of
approximately 3.0 percent improvement in energy efficiency, the petition should be granted. 

Under specific circumstances, the DOE test procedure contains exceptions which allow testing with blower delay
times of less than the prescribed 1.5 minute delay. Rheem indicates that it is unable to take advantage of any of these
exceptions for its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces. 

Since the blower controls incorporated on the Rheem furnaces are designed to impose a 20-second blower delay in every
instance of start up, and since the current provisions do not specifically address this type of control, DOE agrees
that a waiver should be granted to allow the 20-second blower time delay when testing the Rheem GRA upflow, and GSA downflow
condensing gas furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces,
today's Decision and Order exempts Rheem from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allows testing
with the 20-second delay. 

It is, therefore, ordered that: 

(1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Rheem Manufacturing Company. (Case No. F-075) is hereby granted as
set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5). 

(2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Rheem Manufacturing Company,
shall be permitted to test its GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces on the basis of the test procedure
specified in 10 CFR Part 430, with modifications set forth below: 

(i) Section 3.0 of Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82
with the exception of sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:


(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 to Appendix N as follows: 

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. The following paragraph is in lieu of the requirement specified
in section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 103-82. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the
cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature,
using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner
start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t-), unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the
power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together;
or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case
the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature
safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the
latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control
is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t-), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures.
During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. 

(iii) With the exception of the modifications set forth above, Rheem Manufacturing Company shall comply in all respects
with the test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B. 

(3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures
appropriate to the GRA upflow, and GSA downflow condensing gas furnaces manufactured by Rheem Manufacturing Company.


(4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted
by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying
the petition is incorrect. 

(5) Effective November 1, 1994, this Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted the Rheem Manufacturing Company
on September 7, 1994. 59 FR 47317, September 15, 1994 (Case No. F-075).

<DOCTITLE>Cavallo Pipeline Co.; Notice of Petition for Declaratory Order</DOCTITLE>


November 1, 1994.


Take notice that on October 26,1994, Cavallo Pipeline Company (Cavello), 1700 First City Tower, 1001 Fannin Street,
Houston, Texas 77002, filed a petition for a declaratory order in Docket No. CP95-39-000, requesting
that the Commission declare that its facilities are production and gathering facilities exempt from regulation
by the Commission under Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in the petition which is
on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
Cavello states that it is an intrastate pipeline company performing transportation in interstate commerce under
Section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Cavello claims that it owns and operates a natural gas
pipeline located in offshore Texas state waters to a point onshore. Cavallo seeks a declaratory order holding that
the facilities meet the physical criteria for determining gathering and would thereby be exempt from the Commission's
jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the NGA.
In support of its claim that the primary function of the proposed facility is gathering, Cavallo points out the following:
(1) the length and diameter (16.4 miles of 20-inch and 21.3 miles of 16-inch) are comparable to other offshore lines
previously determined to be gathering, (2) the system lacks compression because it relies on wellhead pressure to
move the gas, (3) there is no central point in the field given the nature of the offshore operations, (4) location of
the wells are in the producing area and the lines are designed to gather gas from the platforms to the nearest pipeline,
and (5) the geographic configuration of the line is an inverted ``Y''. Finally, Cavello states that its facilities
are very similar to other facilities that the Commission has found to be gathering facilities.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make a protest with reference to said petition should, on or before December 1,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, D.C. 20426)
a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure
(18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become
a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance
with the Commission's Rules.

Title:

 Application for Reference or Equivalent Method Determination (OMB Control No. 2080-0005; EPA ICR No. 0559.05).



Abstract:

 This ICR is an extension of an existing information collection to support the establishment of, or modification to,
reference or equivalent method determinations for candidate air monitoring methods. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA),
as set forth at 40 CFR part 53, entities seeking to have an ambient air pollutant monitoring method designated by the
EPA as a reference or equivalent method must conduct required tests of the candidate method and must apply to EPA by
submitting test results and other information. The information is necessary to determine whether specific methods
intended for air pollution monitoring are adequate for determining attainment or non-attainment with the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards established under the CAA, as set forth at 40 CFR part 50.
Applicants must provide EPA with information that includes: (1) Identification and detailed method description;
(2) comprehensive operation or instruction manuals that include procedures for field use of method; (3) test data,
records and calculations to support performance specifications; (4) a statement that the method has been evaluated
in accordance with required procedures; (5) a description of their quality assurance program; and (6) identification
of confidential or proprietary information. Applicants must maintain records for seven years on the names and ultimate

Title:

 Application for Construction Permit for Noncommercial Educational Broadcast Station.


Form Number:

 FCC Form 340.


Action:

 Revision of a currently approved collection.


Respondents:

 Non-profit institutions.


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 269 responses; 89.38 hours average burden per response; 24,043 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 FCC Form 340 is used to apply for authority to construct a new noncommercial educational AM, FM and TV broadcast station,
or to make changes in the existing facilities of such a station. On 9/18/92, the Commission adopted a Memorandum Opinion
and Order (MO&O) in the matter of Policy Regarding Character Qualifications in Broadcast Licensing which eliminated
the requirement that broadcast applicants report pending litigation. The form is being revised to reflect the new
policy. The form is also being revised to add a column to the terrain and coverage data for applicants who apply for a
noncommercial educational station on a commercial channel. Additionally, a paragraph has been added to the environmental
question in the engineering sections of the form to clarify the information needed by the Commission. The data is used
by FCC staff to determine whether the applicant meets basic statutory requirements to become a Commission licensee.

<DOCTITLE>Comments Invited On Florida Public Safety Plan Amendment</DOCTITLE>


October 28, 1994.


On May 10, 1990, the Commission accepted the Public Safety Plan for Florida (Region 9). On August 3, 1994, Region 9 submitted
a proposed amendment to its plan that would, in part, revise the current channel allotments and extend the current
application benchmark date. Because the proposed amendment is a major change to the Region 9 plan, the Commission
is soliciting comments from the public before taking action. (See Report and Order, General Docket No. 87-112,
3 FCC Rcd 905 (1987), at paragraph 57.)
Interested parties may file comments to the proposed amendment on or before December 7, 1994 and reply comments on
or before December 22, 1994. Commenters should send an original and five copies of comments to the Secretary, Federal
Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554 and should clearly identify them as submissions to Gen. Docket
90-119 Florida-Public Safety Region 9. 
Questions regarding this public notice may be directed to Betty Woolford, Private Radio Bureau, (202) 632-6497
or Ray LaForge, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653-8112.

<DOCTITLE>Renovation of the U.S. Plaza at the Rainbow Bridge, Niagara Falls, New York; Notice of Draft Environmental Impact
Statement Availability and Public Hearing</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

General Services Administration (GSA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) Availability and Public Hearing.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A DEIS concerning the proposed renovation of the U.S. plaza at the Rainbow Bridge has been prepared by the GSA under
Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The DEIS has been released for public review and
comment, and a public hearing is scheduled.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) has been prepared to evaluate the potential impacts of the proposed
renovation of the U.S. plaza at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, New York. The GSA is acting as NEPA lead agency in
this project, which will be funded and constructed by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC). The construction
of new inspection and toll booths, new office spaces, and a widened bridge approach at the existing site are proposed.
Existing plaza facilities, which do not provide sufficient space for tenant agencies, will be demolished. Upon its
completion, the new plaza would provide approximately 49,800 net square feet (nsf) of interior and exterior space,
which will be leased to GSA for the essential functions of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and
the U.S. Customs Service.



The DEIS for this project contains detailed background information, an overview of the alternatives considered,
a description of the affected environment, and a discussion of the project's potential environmental impacts. Potential
impacts identified include visual impacts to the Niagara Reservation_a National Historic Landmark, the demolition
of National Register-eligible plaza buildings, and higher peak hour traffic volumes on streets within the City of
Niagara Falls. Mitigation measures have been proposed for these potential impacts. Impacts to the Reservation will
be mitigated through adherence to review procedures outlined in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 and Section 6(f) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (L&WCF) Act. The demolition of National Register
eligible plaza buildings will be mitigated by recording the buildings to Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS)
standards prior to demolition, as documented in the National Park Service's ``Schedule of Documentation for Recording
of Rainbow Toll Plaza.'' Increasing the maximum green time at two intersections near the bridge has been recommended
to accommodate traffic volumes associated with the renovated plaza. More importantly, the elimination of bridge
queues from city streets will significantly improve traffic operations at intersections adjacent to the bridge.


The DEIS for the project was released on November 2, 1994, to Federal, state, and local agencies, interested persons,
and community groups. The DEIS and supporting documents are available for public review at the locations listed below:






Niagara Falls Public Library, Earl W. Brydges Library Building, 1425 Main Street, Niagara Falls, NY 

General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1609, New York, NY 10278 






Written comments are invited and may be submitted to GSA at the informational contact listed in this notice December
19, 1994. A public hearing will be held to formally present the DEIS to the public and to provide an additional opportunity
for public comment. 



Public Hearing



Date: November 29, 1994.

Time: 7:00 p.m. 

Place: Orin Lehman Visitor's Center, Niagara Reservation, Niagara Falls, NY.

Purpose: To receive comments concerning the potential environmental impacts of the proposed plaza renovation.


Instructions: Those interested in commenting orally at the public hearing may register at the desk outside the auditorium
on the night of the hearing. Speakers will be heard in the order they register. Each speaker will be allotted a maximum
of five (5) minutes to allow all who are interested the opportunity to speak. Oral comments may be accompanied by written
statements or by an additional oral presentation after the list of registered speakers is complete. A verbatim transcript
will be prepared and will be summarized in the Final Environmental Impact Statement.

<AGENCY>

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces an administrative hearing on November 30, 1994, in Room 111, New Federal Office Building, 601
East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106-2808, to reconsider our decision to disapprove Kansas SPA 93-25.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



This notice announces an administrative hearing to reconsider our decision to disapprove Kansas State plan amendment
(SPA) number 93-25. 

Section 1116 of the Social Security Act (the Act) and 42 CFR, Part 430 establish Department procedures that provide
an administrative hearing for reconsideration of a disapproval of a State plan or plan amendment. The Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) is required to publish a copy of the notice to a State Medicaid agency that informs
the agency of the time and place of the hearing and the issues to be considered. If we subsequently notify the agency
of additional issues that will be considered at the hearing, we will also publish that notice. 

Any individual or group that wants to participate in the hearing as a party must petition the presiding officer within
15 days after publication of this notice, in accordance with the requirements contained at 42 CFR 430.76(b)(2). Any
interested person or organization that wants to participate as amicus curiae must petition the presiding officer
before the hearing begins in accordance with the requirements contained at 42 CFR 430.76(c). If the hearing is later
rescheduled, the presiding officer will notify all participants.

The State of Kansas submitted SPA 93-25 to increase the copayment amount for general hospital inpatient services
and inpatient free standing psychiatric facility services from $25 to $325 per admission. 

The issues are whether Kansas SPA 93-25 adheres to the Federal law at section 1902(a)(14) of the Act (referencing
section 1916 of the Act), as implemented in the regulations at 42 CFR section 447.54(c) and section 1902(a)(19) of
the Act. 

Section 1902(a)(14) of the Act requires a Medicaid State plan to provide that premiums, deductions, cost sharing
or similar charges be imposed only as provided in section 1916 of the Act. Pursuant to section 1916 of the Act, a State
may impose nominal cost-sharing payments, such as deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or similar cost-sharing
charges on certain Medicaid recipients for some services. Current Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR section 447.54(c)
define ``nominal'' for institutional services, as the maximum deductible, coinsurance, or copayment charge for
each admission that does not exceed 50 percent of the payment the State makes for the first day of care in the institution.


HCFA believes the State's proposed copayment does not conform to the regulation because the copayment is not institution
and admission specific. Furthermore, the proposed $325 copayment amount is a fixed Statewide amount. The regulation
limits the State plan to the maximum copayment amount per admission. Kansas believes that the regulations do not require
institution and admission specific copayments. In addition, Kansas indicates that Federal regulations at 42 CFR
447.55(a) specifically allow the State to set a standard, or fixed, copayment amount for any service. 

Section 1902(a)(19) of the Act provides that the State plan must include safeguards to assure that services will be
provided in a manner consistent with the best interests of the recipients. HCFA believes the State has neglected to
include any analysis or data which determines whether any Medicaid recipients were dissuaded from even seeking the
services because of the proposed copayment. Further, if recipients are deterred from seeking necessary medical
services because they are unable to pay the copayment amount, regardless of the fact that such services could not be
denied, a copayment amount such as Kansas proposed cannot be in the best interests of the Medicaid recipients. Kansas
believes there is no regulatory requirement that a State undertake studies or surveys of the recipient population
before it implements a copayment.

prescribed at 42 CFR, Part 430. 
I am designating Mr. Stanley Katz as the presiding officer. If these arrangements present any problems, please contact
the presiding officer. In order to facilitate any communication which may be necessary between the parties to the

<DOCTITLE>National Toxicology Program; Chemicals (6) Nominated for Toxicological Studies; Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>


<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is soliciting public comments on six chemicals nominated for toxicological
studies. These comments will assist the NTP in making informed decisions about whether to perform toxicological
testing on these chemicals.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The NTP was established in 1978 as a cooperative effort within the Public Health Service of the Department of Health
and Human Services to coordinate toxicology research and testing activities within the Department to provide information
about potentially toxic chemicals to regulatory and research agencies and the public, and to strengthen the science
base in toxicology. The chemical nomination and selection process remains integral to the effective operation and
success of the NTP with respect to the testing of chemicals using current methodologies, the validation of new testing
methodologies, and the evaluation of mechanisms of toxicity.


As part of the nomination and selection process, the NTP Interagency Committee for Chemical Evaluation and Coordination
(ICCEC) (formerly the Chemical Evaluation Committee [CEC]), composed of representatives from Federal agencies
participating in the NTP, evaluates chemicals nominated to the Program and makes recommendations for study. Nominated
chemicals which have been reviewed by the ICCEC are published in the 

Federal Register

 with request for comment. The purpose is to encourage active participation in the NTP chemical evaluation process,
thereby helping the NTP to make more informed decisions as to whether to select, defer or reject chemicals for toxicology
study. Comments and data submitted in response to this announcement will be reviewed by NTP technical staff for use
in the further evaluation of the nominated chemicals. The NTP chemical nomination and selection process is summarized
in the NTP FY 1993 Annual Report, pages 17-19.
On September 22, 1994, the ICCEC met to evaluate six chemicals nominated to the NTP for toxicological studies. The
following table lists the chemicals, their Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, and the types of toxicological
studies recommended by the ICCEC.

The ICCEC also recommended that two chemicals, ecdysterone and 2,3-dichloropropylene, be removed from consideration
for testing at this time based on lack of evidence of human exposure with the understanding that these chemicals may
be reconsidered at a later date if actual human exposure is demonstrated. 

Interested parties are requested to submit pertinent information on all of the nominated chemicals. The following
types of data are of particular relevance: 

(1) Modes of production, present production levels, and occupational exposure potential; 

(2) Uses and resulting exposure levels, where known; 

(3) Completed, ongoing and/or planned toxicological testing in the public or private sector including detailed
experimental protocols and results; and 

(4) Results of toxicological studies of structurally related compounds. 

Please submit all information in writing (by 30 days after date of publication) to Dr. Zeigler by mail or by FAX, (919)
541-4704. Any submissions received after the above date will be accepted and utilized if possible.

Southern Electric Railroad Company_Construction Exemption_Effingham County, Georgia 


The Southern Electric Railroad Company (SER) has petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (Commission) for
authority to construct and operate a 2.5 mile rail line in Effingham County, Georgia. The Commission's Section of
Environmental Analysis (SEA) has prepared its Environmental Assessment (EA) which concludes that this proposal
would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment if the recommended mitigation measures set forth
in the EA are implemented. Accordingly, SEA preliminarily recommends that the Commission impose on any decision
approving the proposed construction and operation conditions requiring Southern Electric Railroad Company to
implement the mitigation contained in the EA. The EA will be served on all parties of record as well as all appropriate
Federal, state and local officials and will be made available to the public upon request. SEA will consider any comments
received in response to the EA in making its final recommendation to the Commission. 
Comments (an original and 10 copies) and any questions regarding this Environmental Assessment should be filed with

Brown Shoe Company (Trenton Warehouse) Trenton, TN; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for
Reconsideration 



By applications dated September 27 and 28, 1994 and October 3, 1994, the petitioners and others requested administrative
reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The denial notice was signed on September
15, 1994 and will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

.

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or 

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.

The petitioners state that the workers should be certified because all of Brown Shoe company's facilities which have
been closed are certified for TAA.

The worker adjustment assistance program is based on increased imports of articles that are like or directly competitive
with those produced by the petitioning workers. The Department's denial of TAA for workers was based on the fact that
they do not produce an article within the meaning of the Trade Act of 1974 and as such are out of scope from the worker adjustment
assistance program.



Service workers (warehouse workers) are rarely certified for TAA when the company's manufacturing plants' certifications
are based on company imports. The condition that must be met is that over half of the warehouse's activity must come
from certified facilities. The findings, however, show that the major portion of Trenton's activity did not come
from certified facilities but instead originated from company imports. Accordingly, increased company imports
would have a positive employment effect on the subject workers, not an adverse one.
Other findings show that Trenton's warehousing was transferred to another domestic facility.
The worker adjustment assistance program was not intended to provide TAA to workers who are in some way related to import
competition but only for those workers who produce an article and are adversely affected by increased imports of like
or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to sales or production and employment declines
at the workers' firm.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 27th day of October 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Dana Corporation; Pueblo, CO; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On October 24, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of
Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on October 11, 1994 and will soon be published in the 

Federal Register.

The company submitted additional information showing a worker separations and increased imports in 1994.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.




Signed at Washington, D.C., this 27th day of October 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Fuelco; Denver, CO; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On September 19, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the Federal Register

.

The workers were previously certified eligible to apply for trade adjustment assistance under petition TA-W-27,295
which expired on July 22, 1994.

Findings on reconsideration show decreased sales in the first 10 months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993.
Substantial worker separations occurred in 1994. A further finding shows that the subject firm is expected to close
in the first quarter of 1995 when all workers will be laid off. 

U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in the twelve month
period beginning in April 1993 and ending in March 1994. 

On reconsideration, the Department surveyed other customers of Fuelco and found that they reduced their purchases
from Fuelco and increased their import purchases. 



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the Fuelco workers
in Denver, Colorado were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with natural
gas or crude oil produced by Fuelco in Denver, Colorado.






All workers of Fuelco in Denver, Colorado who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after July
22, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Branch Technical Position on When to Remediate Inadvertent Contamination of the Terrestrial Environment</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is announcing the availability of a Branch Technical Position on ``When
To Remediate Inadvertent Contamination of the Terrestrial Environment.''

Copies of this document may be obtained free of charge upon written request to Janette Copeland, Low-Level Waste and
Decommissioning Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, MS T-7F27,
Washington, DC 20555. Further information can be obtained from Jack D. Parrott, Hydrogeologist, Low-Level Waste
and Decommissioning Projects Branch, Division of Waste Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, MS T-7F27,
Washington, DC 20555. Telephone 301/415-6700. Internet JDP1@NRC.GOV.

The purposes of this Branch Technical Position (BTP) are: (a) to provide licensees with the NRC staff's expectations
for operational good practices and remediation methods and procedures following inadvertent contamination of
the terrestrial environment by radioactive materials; (b) to inform licensees of the nature of an NRC response to
an inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment; and, (c) to help insure consistency in NRC responses
to instances of inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment. This guidance is also intended to address
the timing of remediation (immediate or delayed) of inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment.
This BTP does not supplant NRC's emergency (contingency) planning. The need for this BTP stems from the Division of
Waste Management staff's concern with instances of inadvertent contamination of the terrestrial environment at
NRC licensed facilities, and the delay that sometimes occurs in remediating this contamination.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 31st day of October 1994.

<DOCTITLE>GPU Nuclear Corp.; Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station; License No. DPR-16; Receipt of Petition for Director's
Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 </DOCTITLE>

 

Notice is hereby given that by a ``PETITION FOR EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER PROVISIONS OF 10 CFR 2.206 WITH
REGARD TO OYSTER CREEK NUCLEAR POWER STATION'', dated September 19, 1994, Oyster Creek Nuclear Watch and Nuclear
Information and Resource Service, request that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission take action with regard to the
Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station of the GPU Nuclear Corporation. 

 The Petition requests that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission: (1) immediately suspend the Oyster Creek operating
license until the licensee inspects and repairs or replaces all safety-class reactor internal component parts subject
to embrittlement and cracking; (2) immediately suspend the Oyster Creek operating license until the licensee provides
an analysis regarding the synergistic effects of through wall cracking of multiple safety-class components; (3)
immediately suspend the Oyster Creek operating license until the licensee has analyzed and mitigated any areas of
noncompliance with regard to irradiated fuel pool cooling as a single unit Boiling Water Reactor (BWR); and (4) issue
a Generic Letter requiring other licensees of single unit BWRs to provide information regarding fuel pool boiling
in order to verify compliance with regulatory requirements, and to promptly take appropriate mitigative action
if the units are not in compliance. 

 As the bases for their requests concerning safety-class reactor internal components, Petitioners state that: the
core shroud in General Electric BWRs is vulnerable to age-related deterioration; 12 domestic and overseas, BWRs
have found extensive cracking on welds of the core shroud; only 10 of 36 U.S. BWRs have inspected their core shrouds
and 9 were found to have cracks; 19 of 25 selected BWR internal components are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking
and 6 of 19 are susceptible to irradiation assisted stress corrosion cracking; Oyster Creek is the oldest operating
General Electric Mark I BWR and the third oldest operating reactor in the United Stats, and has been subjected to the
longest period of operational conditions that cause embrittlement and cracking; the BWR Owners Group stated that
cracking of the core shroud is a warning signal that additional safety-class reactor internals are increasingly
susceptible to age-related deterioration; cracking of any single part or multiple components jeopardizes safe
operation of the nuclear station; Oyster Creek did not inspect for core shroud cracking prior to the current refueling
outage and other safety-class reactor internals have not been adequately inspected for cracking; and a safety analysis
has not been performed on the potential synergistic effects of multiple component cracking. 

 As the bases for their requests concerning fuel pool cooling design deficiencies, Petitioners state that: various
design defects in BWR fuel pool cooling systems pose a significant increase in risk to the public safety and are violations
or 10 CFR 50.49; 10 CFR Part 50, App. A, Criterion 63; 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion III; and Reg. Guides 1.13,
1.89 and 1.97; Oyster Creek is a single unit facility with no adjacent units to rely upon in the event that a design basis
were to disable the fuel pool cooling system; and Oyster Creek has not docketed any material with regard to BWR design
deficiencies identified in the 10 CFR Part 21 Report of Substantial Safety Hazard (November 27, 1992) of Messrs. Lochbaum
and Prevatte, and thus Oyster Creek may be in violation of NRC regulatory requirements. 

 The Petition is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The Petition has been referred
to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this
Petition within a reasonable time. By letter dated October 27, 1994, the Director denied Petitioners' requests for
an immediate suspension of the operating license. 

 A copy of the Petition and the Director's letter are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document
Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public Document Room for the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating
Station located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington Street, Toms River, NJ 08753.

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
no Significant Hazards Consideration, Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-44 and DPR-56, issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, located in York County, Pennsylvania. 

The proposed amendment would clarify the minimum reactor steam pressure required for Surveillance Requirement
4.5C.1(e). The revised Surveillance Requirement will require the licensee to verify that the High Pressure Coolant
Injection pump, with reactor pressure less than or equal to 175 psig. develop a flow rate of greater than or equal to
5000 gpm against a system head corresponding to reactor pressure. The current Surveillance Requirement specifies
that the test be performed at 150 psig but does not provide a range of acceptable pressures. 

This Technical Specifications (TS) change request (CR) is requested to be processed as an exigent TS change in accordance
with 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6). Exigent processing is being requested because the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS)
TS low pressure HPCI system testing requirements are ambiguous, and the licensee desires to accelerate the resolution
of this ambiguity. The low pressure surveillance requirement (TS 4.5.C.1.e) requires that the test be performed
at 150 psig. Prior to October 21, 1994, this 150 psig value was interpreted as a nominal value. During recent inspection
activities surrounding the startup of PBAPS Unit 2 from refueling outage 2R010, the NRC revised a previous position
and determined that this value could not be interpreted as a nominal value. The licensee could not have foreseen this
event because they were conducting station activities in accordance with NRC guidance. 

During the 1990 Safety System Functional Inspection (SSFI, Combined Inspection Report 90-200), the issue
of the HPCI low pressure surveillance testing being performed at a nominal value was reviewed (Open item 90-200-12).
In response to the SSFI open item, the licensee revised an existing Plant Operations Review Committee position, to
document that the 150 psig was a nominal value, and committed to revising the TS to clarify the low pressure requirement.
This commitment was incorporated into the licensee's September 29, 1994 improved Technical Specifications (ITS)
submittal. The NRC accepted this position and closed the SSFI open item (Combined Inspection Report 50-277/90-80,
50-278/90-80, dated November 9, 1990). The anticipated effective date of the ITS is the fourth quarter
of 1995. Because of the recently revised NRC position regarding TS 4.5.C.1(e), the licensee is pursuing the attached
TSCR in advance of the overall conversion to the ITS, and requests that it be processed on an exigent basis. 


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

These changes increase the maximum pressure for performing the low pressure test on the HPCI pump from approximately
150 psig to [less than or equal to] 175 psig. For reason stated above, HPCI pump testing must be performed when the [electro-hydraulic
control] EHC System for the main turbine is available and capable of regulating reactor pressure. Operating experience
has demonstrated that reactor pressures as high as 175 psig may be required before the EHC system is capable of maintaining
stable pressure during the performance of the HPCI test. The probability of an accident is not increased because the
proposed changes will not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the
manner in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, or inspected. In addition, the pressure at which the
HPCI System is tested is not assumed to be an initiator of any analyzed event. The role of the HPCI System is in the mitigation
of accident consequences. The consequences of an accident are not increased because a small increase in the pressure
at which the HPCI pump performance to design specifications is verified will not significantly delay or otherwise
affect the validity of the test to determine that the pump and turbine are still operating at the design specifications.
In addition, it is overly conservative to assume a component is inoperable when a surveillance has not been performed.
In fact, in most cases, it is a matter of component operability not yet being demonstrated since the usual outcome of
the performance of a surveillance is the validation of conformance with surveillance requirements. Therefore,
these changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
These changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the manner
in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, or inspected. These changes increase the pressure for performing
the low pressure test on the HPCI pump from approximately 150 psig to [less than or equal to] 175 psig. Therefore, these
changes will not create the possibility or a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
The margin of safety is not reduced. These changes increase the pressure for performing the low pressure test on the
HPCI pump from approximately 150 psig to [less than or equal to] 175 psig. For reasons stated above, the ability of the
HPCI pump to perform at the lowest required pressure of 150 psig has already been demonstrated. A small increase in
the pressure at which the performance to design specifications is verified will not significantly delay or affect
the validity of the test to determine that the pump and turbine are still operating at the design specifications. These
changes effectively extend[s] the initial entry into the applicable condition prior to performing the surveillance.
However, this is considered acceptable since the most common outcome of the performance of a surveillance is the successful
demonstration that the acceptance criteria are satisfied. In addition, the change provides the benefit of allowing
the surveillance to be postponed until plant conditions exist where performance of the surveillance is unlikely
to result in a pressure transient. These changes do not affect the current analysis assumptions. Therefore, these
changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By December 7, 1994, the license may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC and at the local public document room located at the Government Publications Section, state Library of Pennsylvania,
(REGIONAL DEPOSITORY) Education Building, Walnut Street and Commonwealth Avenue, Box 1601, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
17105. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate
as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.

Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed,
plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to J.W. Durham, Sr., Esquire, Sr. V.P. and General Counsel, Philadelphia Electric Company,
2301 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19101, attorney for the licensee. 

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(l) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated October 25, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW.,
Washington, DC, and at the local public document room, located at the Government Publications Section, State Library

<DOCTITLE>The Toledo Edison Co., Centerior Service Company, and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.; Exemption </DOCTITLE>



I 



The Toledo Edison Company, Centerior Service Company, and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (the licensees)
hold Facility Operating License No. NPF-3, which authorizes operation of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station,
Unit No. 1. The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and Orders
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. 

The facility is a pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site in Ottawa County Ohio. 



II



Section III.D.2(b)(ii) of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J requires that a full pressure air lock leakage test be performed
whenever air locks are opened during periods when containment integrity is not required. 



III 



By letter dated October 21, 1994, the licensee requested an Exemption from the requirement of 10 CFR 50, Appendix J,
Section III.D.2(b)(ii) identified in Section II above. If an air lock is opened during Modes 5 and 6, Section III.D.2(b)(ii)
of Appendix J requires that an overall air lock leakage test at not-less-than the calculated peak containment pressure
from a design-basis loss of coolant accident (Pa) be conducted before plant heatup and startup (i.e., before entering
Mode 4). Instead, if no maintenance has been performed on the air locks that affects air lock sealing capabilities,
the licensee would conduct an air lock seal leakage test (Section III.D.2(b)(iii) of 10 CFR 50, Appendix J), for the
full pressure air lock test required by Section III.D.2(b)(ii). 

If the periodic six-month test of Section III.D.2(b)(i) of Appendix J and the test required by Section III.D.2(b)(iii)
of Appendix J are current, and no maintenance has been performed on the air lock that affects air lock sealing capabilities,
there should be no reason to expect the air lock to leak excessively, just because it has been opened in Mode 5 or 6. If
maintenance has been performed, which could affect air lock sealing capability, then a full-pressure air lock test
will be performed following such maintenance. 

The licensee's letter dated October 21, 1994, submitted information to identify the special circumstances for granting
this exemption to Davis-Besse, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12. The purpose of Appendix J to 10 CFR 50, is to assure that containment
leak-tight integrity can be verified periodically, throughout service lifetime to maintain containment leakage,
within the limits specified in the facility Technical Specifications. The purposed alternative test method, along
with the six-month test requirement of Section III.D.2(b)(i) of Appendix J, and the testing requirements when maintenance
is performed on the air lock that affects sealing capability, is sufficient to achieve this underlying purpose, in
that it provides adequate assurance of continued leak-tight integrity of the air lock. 

Based on the above discussion, the licensee's proposed substitution of an air lock seal leakage test described in
III.D.2(b)(iii) for a full-pressure test, as discussed above, is acceptable. 



IV



Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption is authorized by law, and
will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security.
The Commission further determines that special circumstances described by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) exist, in that
application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose
of the rule, since the licensees have proposed an acceptable alternative method that accomplishes the intent of the
regulation. 

Accordingly, the Commission hereby grants the Exemption as described in Section III above from the requirements
of 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.2(b)(ii). 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 54222). 

This Exemption is effective upon issuance.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is initiating a study on the feasibility of establishing a mandatory interagency
placement program for Federal employees separated by reduction in force. This advance notice invites written comments
from all interested parties.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 103-337, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, was signed into law by the President
of the United States on October 5, 1994. Section 1066 of this law requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) to conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing a mandatory interagency placement program for Federal
employees affected by a reduction in force and report the findings to Congress no later than April 5, 1995. This program
would supplement the existing Interagency Placement Program and internal placement efforts conducted by individual
agencies. For purposes of this study, the law defines an interagency placement program as one that requires an agency
to offer a position to an employee of another agency affected by reduction in force if the position cannot be filled
through a placement program of the agency in which the position is located, the employee to whom the offer is made is
qualified for the offered position, and the geographic location of the offered position is within the commuting area
of the residence of the employee or the employee's present or last-held position. Such a program would not affect internal
agency placement programs including, but not limited to, merit promotion, upward mobility, and reassignments.




Under the law, the term ``agency'' means an Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code,
except that such term does not include the General Accounting Office. The term ``Federal employees affected by reductions
in force'' means Federal employees who are separated, or are scheduled to be separated, from service under reduction
in force pursuant to regulations prescribed under section 3502 of title 5, United States Code, or procedures established
under section 3595 of such title. The law provides that OPM conduct this study in consultation with the Secretary of
Defense and seek comments from the heads of all appropriate Federal agencies.

This notice is to request input from all interested parties on this issue and any other options to assist Federal employees
affected by downsizing. Information gained during this study will be used to submit a report of findings to Congress
and may result in proposals for regulatory or statutory changes.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to New Organizational Structures for Member Organizations.


October 31, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on October 14, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On October 31, 1994, the
Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of the
original filing.
 The Amex has requested accelerated approval of the proposal. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange is proposing to expand the categories of organizations which are eligible to become member organizations
to include entities with new organizational structures. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office
of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The Exchange is proposing to amend its Rules relating to the admission of entities with new organizational structures
as member organizations. Specifically, the proposed amendment would permit the Exchange, in its discretion, and
on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, to approve limited liability companies (``LLCs''), business
trusts or other organizational structures as member organizations so long as the characteristics of the entity in
question are essentially similar to those of corporations or partnerships.
An LLC is a hybrid business entity, combining the limited liability characteristics of a corporation with the pass-through
taxation attributes of a partnership. Currently, approximately 45 States and the District of Columbia have adopted
LLC statutes. New York State recently adopted legislation, effective October 24, 1994, authorizing LLCs. The Exchange
has been advised that a number of existing member organizations are considering altering their business structure
to that of an LLC. Both the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') and the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX'') already
permit membership by an LLC, and the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') recently received SEC approval to amend its
rules to do so.





The term ``business trust'' is generally used to describe a trust in which the managers are principals, and the shareholders
are cestuis que trust. As stated in 

Black's Law Dictionary,

 ``[t]he essential attribute [of a business trust] is that property is placed in the hands of trustees who manage and
deal with it for use and benefit of beneficiaries.''





Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to adopt new Commentary .01 to Definition 2 of the Exchange Rules to provide that
entities may be accepted as member organizations by the Exchange if they have characteristics essentially similar
to partnerships, corporations or both. At the present time, the Exchange intends to consider both LLCs and business
trusts as eligible to become member organizations. These entities would be subject to all rules applicable to member
organizations, and existing references to member firm or member corporation, as appropriate, and member organization
would be deemed to include any such entity which is approved as a member organization. Of course, in order to be a member
organization, an entity must be able to qualify as a broker or dealer registered with the SEC pursuant to the Act. In
addition, the Exchange staff would review applications on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization
applicants. Prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1)
the Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's
capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(2) in particular in that it is designed to ensure that the rules of the Exchange provide that any broker or dealer
or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become a member of the Exchange.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-43
and should be submitted by [insert date 21 days from date of publication].



IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 Specifically, the Commission believes the Amex proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(2) of the Act,
 which requires that the rules of an exchange, subject to the provisions of Section 6(c) of the Act,
 ensure that any registered broker or dealer or natural person associated with a registered broker or dealer may become
a member of the exchange and any person may become associated with a member thereof.







The Amex currently allows individuals, partnerships, and corporations to become members of the Exchange.
 The proposed rule change will enable entities with new organizational structures similar to corporations and partnerships
to become Exchange members and be included in the Exchange's definition of a member organization. As in the case of
a partnership or corporation applying for membership, the new entity will be subject to all other requirements for
membership approval.





The Commission believes that the amendment to the Amex Rules reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in having
the flexibility to approve entities with new organizational structures for Exchange membership, with the regulatory
interests in protecting the financial and structural integrity of a member organization. For example, although
the proposal will permit the Exchange to approve business trusts, LLCs, or other organizational structures with
characteristics of corporations or partnerships as member organizations, the Amex staff will review each Exchange
member organization application on a case-by-case basis, and, prior to approving any such organization for membership,
the Exchange must be satisfied that: (1) the Exchange legally would have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity;
and (2) the permanency of the entity's capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof. This will permit the benefits of the proposed rule change to be realized as
soon as possible. In addition, the Exchange's proposal is substantially identical to CHX and NYSE proposals that
were published in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.






It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-43) is hereby approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Temporary Accelerated Approval to Proposed
Rule Change by the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Procedures for the Handling of Market-on-Close Orders
on Expiration Fridays and Quarterly Index Expiration Days</DOCTITLE>


October 31, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 12, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On October 14, 1994, the Exchange submitted
to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to correct certain typographical errors and
to specify the duration of the pilot extension.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the pilot program which provides a set of procedures for the handling
of Market-on-Close (``MOC'') orders
 on Expiration Fridays
 and Quarterly Index Expiration Days.
 These procedures mirror the procedures in place on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')
 in order to ensure equal treatment of orders in both markets.







II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to extend the pilot program under which the BSE has adopted certain procedures
to mirror those of the primary market for the handling of MOC orders on Expiration Fridays and Quarterly Index Expiration
Days so that the BSE does not become a haven for MOC orders that are prohibited on the NYSE.
 In this way, all orders sent to the Exchange will receive equal treatment with orders sent to the NYSE. The proposed
procedures include (a) prohibiting the cancellation or reduction of any MOC order in any NYSE stock after 3:40 p.m.
on Expiration Fridays and Quarterly Index Expiration Days, (b) providing a 3:40 p.m. deadline for the entry of MOC
orders, in all NYSE stocks, related to a strategy involving any stock index future, stock index option or option on
stock index futures in expiring contracts, (c) publication of MOC order imbalances of 50,000 shares or more in the
pilot stocks as soon as practicable after 3:40 p.m. and (d) providing for the entry of MOC orders after 3:40 p.m. in the
pilot stocks only to offset published imbalances. With respect to item (a) above, the Exchange will permit cancellations
of MOC orders after 3:40 p.m. in those instances where a legitimate error has been made. The term ``pilot stocks'' refers
to the list of stocks designated by the NYSE as pilot stocks for purposes of its auxiliary closing procedures.
 The Exchange is seeking a one-year extension of the current pilot program to expire on October 31, 1995.





2. Statutory Basis


The statutory basis for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest; and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination between customers, issuers, brokers,
or dealers. The BSE believes that, if investors, whose orders are banned on the NYSE because of current market conditions,
are able to reroute those orders to the Exchange for execution on the BSE without regard to current market conditions,
there could be a negative impact on the overall market as a result of the execution of those orders.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


The Exchange has neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule change.


III. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the BSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-BSE-94-13
and should be submitted by November 28, 1994.

IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Temporary Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change 



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b). In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements
that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 


In recent years, the self-regulatory organizations, with the support of the Commission, have instituted certain
safeguards to minimize excess market volatility that may arise from the liquidation of stock positions related to
trading strategies involving expiring index derivative products. For instance, on expiration days, the NYSE utilizes
auxiliary closing procedures
 designed to help the specialist attract any contraside interest necessary to alleviate MOC order imbalances and
dampen their effect on the closing price. Based on the NYSE's experience,
 the Commission believes that these procedures work relatively well and may result in more orderly markets at the close
on expiration days. 






In today's highly competitive market environment, however, it is possible that a regional exchange, which trades
NYSE-listed stocks but does not have comparable closing procedures, could be utilized by market participants to
enter MOC orders prohibited on the NYSE. Although the Commission has no reason to believe that the BSE market has become
a significant alternative market to enter otherwise prohibited MOC orders, the Commission agrees with the BSE that,
if this possibility were realized, it could have a negative impact on the fairness and orderliness of the national
market system.
 Accordingly, in its order initially approving the Exchange's pilot program,
 the Commission concluded that it is reasonable for the BSE to adopt procedures for the handling of MOC orders that mirror
the NYSE's, thereby ensuring the equal treatment of orders in both markets and, in the event of unusual market conditions,
offering the BSE the same benefits in terms of potentially reducing volatility.

In its approval order, the Commission asked the BSE to study the effectiveness of its MOC order procedures. Specifically,
the Commission requested the following information: (1) For all pilot stocks, the size of the MOC order imbalance
on the BSE at 3:40 p.m. and at 4:00 p.m.; (2) for all pilot stocks, the price and time of the last regular-way trade on the
BSE and the closing price; and (3) for each pilot stock with a MOC order imbalance of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40 p.m.,
an appropriate measure of volatility at the close on the BSE.
On October 5, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission its first monitoring report on its MOC order pilot program.
The Commission finds that, although this monitoring report provides certain useful information concerning the
operation of the pilot program, the BSE must provide further data before the Commission can fairly and comprehensively
evaluate the BSE's use of its auxiliary closing procedures. To allow such additional information to be gathered and
reviewed, without compromising the benefits that market participants might receive, the Commission finds that
it is reasonable to extend the pilot program until October 31, 1995.
In this regard, the Commission continues to believe that the pilot procedures should allow the BSE to obtain an accurate
view of the buying and selling interest in MOC orders at expiration and, if there is a substantial imbalance on one side
of the market, to provide the investing public with timely and reliable notice thereof. The BSE pilot program establishes
a simultaneous 3:40 p.m. deadline for the entry of expiration-related MOC orders and for the cancellation or reduction
of any MOC order. Substantial MOC order imbalances in the pilot stocks are required to be disseminated promptly thereafter.
 Based on the Exchange's monitoring report, the pilot procedures, specifically the requirement that MOC orders included
in imbalances be irrevocable and the restrictions on further MOC order entry, appear to have operated effectively
on all expiration days covered by the report. Accordingly, the Commission is satisfied that any BSE imbalance publications
should reflect actual investor interest.




In addition, although the BSE's monitoring report does not reveal any unusual market conditions, the Commission
continues to believe that, in the event of such conditions, the BSE should have sufficient time to attract contra-side
interest to help alleviate imbalances created by the unwinding of index derivative related positions. As noted above,
the pilot procedures require both the early submission of expiration-related MOC orders and, for the pilot stocks,
prompt dissemination of substantial MOC order imbalances. While the Commission recognizes that 3:40 p.m. is relatively
near the close, the Commission believes that deadline strikes a reasonable balance between the need to provide the
investing public with timely and reliable notice of expiration-related order flow and the need to avoid unduly infringing
upon legitimate trading strategies.
The Commission is approving the proposed rule change on a pilot basis until October 31, 1995. As long as some index derivative
products continue to expire based on the closing stock prices on expiration days, the Commission agrees with those
self-regulatory organizations that argue that such procedures are necessary to provide a mechanism to handle the
potentially large stock imbalances engendered by the unwinding of index derivative related positions. During this
pilot program, the Commission expects the BSE to monitor the effectiveness of its MOC order procedures.
The Commission therefore requests that the BSE submit a report to the Commission, by August 31, 1995, describing its
experience with the pilot program. At a minimum, this report should contain, for each Expiration Friday and Quarterly
Index Expiration Day, the following data: (1) for each pilot stock that had a MOC order imbalance on the BSE, the size
of that imbalance at 3:40 p.m. and at 4:00 p.m.; (2) for each pilot stock listed in (1) above, the consolidated closing
price and the number of shares of MOC orders printed on the BSE; and (3) for each pilot stock that had a MOC order imbalance
of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40 p.m., an appropriate measure of volatility at the close for the BSE (for example, the
change in price of the closing transaction, measured as a percentage, from the last trade and/or the change in the specialist's
position) and a description of how the pilot procedures influenced market conditions. Any request to modify this
pilot program, to extend its effectiveness or to seek permanent approval of the pilot procedures also should be submitted
to the Commission, by August 31, 1995, as a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of the notice of filing thereof. This will permit the pilot program to continue without interruption.
In addition, the procedures the Exchange proposes to continue using are identical to the procedures that were published
in the 

Federal Register

 for the full comment period and were approved by the Commission.







It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-94-13) is hereby approved on a pilot basis until October 31,
1995.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organization; the Midwest Clearing Corporation; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed
Rule Change Enabling Midwest Clearing Corporation To Enter Into Contracts With Participants To Provide Custodial,
Transactional, and Related Services on Behalf of Participants</DOCTITLE>


October 31, 1994.


On October 11, 1994, The Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MCC-94-12) pursuant to Section 19(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on October 19, 1994.
 No comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
change on an accelerated basis.





I. Description of the Proposal


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit MCC to enter into contracts with any of its participants whereby
MCC will provide transactional processing and data-entry services for a participant with respect to the participant's
certificated securities which are not depository eligible. MCC will not be obligated to enter into such contracts
with any participant, and if it chooses to enter into such a contract, it will not be obligated to do so on similar terms
available to any other participant.



II. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F).
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding of
funds and securities in the custody and control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. The Commission
believes that MCC's service is consistent with this obligation.




The service provides custodian, transaction processing, and related data-entry services with respect to certificated
securities not eligible for book-entry processing. Participants have been experiencing a continual decline in
their activity associated with the processing of physical securities primarily due to the increase in book-entry
eligibility of securities at the clearing agency level. These participants no longer find it desirable to maintain
their own custodial operations and have requested MCC provide such custodial and processing services as part of MCC's
operations.
The Commission believes that MCC's proposed rule change should help to minimize inefficient procedures employed
by individual participants by concentrating these operations in one centralized facility. As a result, the individual
participants will be able to eliminate their own operations and the high fixed costs associated with them while maintaining
the required safeguarding of these securities.
MCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because accelerated approval will allow MCC to implement the service more expediently and thereby should
provide saving and efficiency to those participants that enter into such service contracts with MCC.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that MCC's proposal is consistent with the Act,
 and the rules and regulations thereunder.






It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MCC-94-12) be, and hereby is, approved on an accelerated
basis.





For the Commission of the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to a One-Year Extension of the Pilot for Auxiliary Closing Procedures
for Expiration Days</DOCTITLE>


October 31, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on September 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the purposed rule change as described in
Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. While the NYSE has not requested
accelerated approval of the proposal, the auxiliary closing procedures are scheduled to expire on October 31, 1994.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 


The Exchange proposes to extend the pilot for auxiliary closing procedures for market-at-the-close (``MOC'') orders
utilized on expiration Fridays and quarterly expiration days until October 31, 1995.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


Special procedures regarding the entry of market-at-the-close (``MOC'') orders on expiration Fridays were originally
adopted in 1986 for quarterly triple expiration of derivative instrument products.
 Since November 1988, these procedures have been used for each monthly expiration and apply to the so-called ``pilot
stocks'' (the 50 most highly capitalized S&P 500 stocks and any component stocks of the Major Market Index that
are not included in this group of 50).
 In April 1992, the Exchange modified the pilot procedures and included additional special procedures for handling
MOC orders in all stocks on expiration Fridays. In March 1993, the Exchange extended the expiration Friday auxiliary
closing procedures to days on which quarterly index expiration (``QIX'') options expire.
 In September 1993, the Exchange again modified the pilot procedures to change the cut-off time for entry, cancellation
or reduction of MOC orders to 3:40 p.m.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00153 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The current procedures require that MOC orders in any stock related to a strategy involving derivative index products
be entered for execution by 3:40 p.m. and that no cancellation or reduction of any MOC order in any stock take place after
3:40 p.m. In addition, Floor brokers representing orders related to a strategy involving derivative index products
must indicate their MOC interest to the specialist by 3:40 p.m. However, a Floor broker who is handling a working order
that is not derivative-related, may continue to work that order until just before the close, and if so instructed by
his or her customer, may turn the unfilled balance over to the specialist for execution at the market at the close.

For the pilot stocks, a single publication of imbalances of 50,000 shares or more is made as soon as practicable after
3:40 p.m. After the imbalance publication, MOC orders in the pilot stocks may be entered only to offset a published
imbalance. The entry of MOC orders after 3:40 p.m. to establish or liquidate positions related to a strategy involving
derivative instruments is not permitted even if such orders might offset published imbalances.

The auxiliary procedures utilized for expiration days have been approved as a pilot on a yearly basis and are due to
expire on October 31, 1994. These procedures have been effective in minimizing excess volatility on the close on expiration
days. The Exchange recommends that the procedures described above be extended to October 31, 1995.

The Exchange continues to believe, however, that concerns about excess market volatility that may be associated
with the expiration or settlement of derivative index products would be most appropriately addressed if the expiration
or settlement value of all such products were based on the NYSE opening rather than the closing price on the last business
day prior to the expiration or settlement of the product. 



2. Statutory Basis



The basis under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') for the proposed rule change is the requirement under
section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange have rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to
remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and, in general, to protect investors and
the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-32
and should be submitted by November 28, 1994.

IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Temporary Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change



The Commission finds that the NYSE's proposal to extend the pilot for auxiliary closing procedures on expiration
days through October 1995, is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission finds that an extension of the pilot
for auxiliary closing procedures on expiration days is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) requires, among the other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and to protect investors
and the public interest. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposal furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






The NYSE's auxiliary closing procedures were initially adopted in September 1986 to apply to triple expirations.
 The Commission has extended these procedures to all monthly expiration Fridays on a yearly pilot basis since 1988.
 These procedures resulted from efforts by the Commission and the self-regulatory organizations to address stock
market volatility associated with the expiration of index derivative products traded in conjunction with the underlying
component stocks as part of index derivative related trading strategies.






In our 1993 Approval Order, the Commission extended the NYSE's MOC pilot program procedures through October 31, 1994,
and requested that the NYSE provide the Commission with specific data by July 31, 1994, detailing the NYSE's experience
with the pilot program and containing an analysis of the effectiveness of the expiration Friday procedures in reducing
volatility. Specifically, the Commission requested data covering expiration Fridays from October 1993 through
June 1994. The Commission requested that the report include: (1) The names of the pilot stocks and the imbalance (if
any) at 3:40 and at the close for those stocks that had an imbalance of MOC orders of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40; (2)
for those stocks with an imbalance of 50,000 shares or more at 3:40, the names of the stocks where the imbalance changed
from one side of the market (sell or buy) to the other side (buy or sell) due to cancellations of MOC orders; (3) for all
pilot stocks, all MOC order imbalances (of any size) as of 4:00 p.m.; (4) the change in price of the closing transactions
from the previous trade for all pilot stocks; (5) the change in price of the closing transactions from the price of transactions
at 4:00 p.m. (if there were no transactions precisely at 4:00 p.m., the NYSE was to use the price from the transaction
effected closet in time to 4:00 p.m.) for all pilot stocks; and (6) for each pilot stock, the number of shares in MOC orders
submitted by 3:40 p.m. that were canceled for any reason prior to the close. The Commission also stated that the report
should include: (1) The change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``DJIA'') at the close on each expiration Friday;
(2) opening prices and daily trading ranges of the pilot stocks on expiration Fridays, as well as the following Mondays;
and (3) price volatility as measured by the change in price from the last regular way trade to the closing price, including
historical data analyzing price volatility at the close prior to the implementation of the prohibition on canceling
MOC orders after 3:45 p.m. and the other MOC procedures. Finally, in our approval order regarding QIX auxiliary closing
procedures, the Commission requested that the Exchange also include in its report all of the above requested data
for QIX expiration days which expire at the en of the calendar quarter. The Commission requested that the NYSE provide
the Commission with a report by July 31, 1994 covering expirations through June 1994.


The NYSE submitted a report to the Commission on July 26, 1994. The report covers expiration Fridays for the period
November 1993 through June 1994 and the December 31, 1993 and March 31, 1994 quarterly expirations. For that period,
the NYSE reports that there were 117 (out of 413 total) stocks with buy imbalances greater than 50,000 shares at 3:40
p.m. Of these, 84 still had MOC buy imbalances greater than 50,000 at the close and three had reversed to sell imbalances
under 50,000. In contrast, there were only 10 stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 at 3:40 p.m., of which five still
had sell balances over 50,000 shares at the close. In general, both the number of stocks with imbalances over 50,000
shares and the average number of shares in the imbalance declined between 3:40 p.m. and the close.
The report also discusses MOC prices and price changes at 4:00 p.m. and at the close. The data show very little volatility
at the close. Over half the stocks had no change at the close, 89.3% changed one-eighth point or less, and j96.1% changed
one-quarter point or less. The stocks with large imbalances also did not exhibit much volatility at the close. The
stocks with buy imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close averaged an increase of slightly more than one-eighth;
the stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close averaged less than one-eighth point decline.
With respect to QIX expiration procedures, the Exchange states that there were only 4 stocks with buy imbalances greater
than 50,000 shares at 3:40 p.m., only one of which still had an MOC buy imbalance greater than 50,000 shares at the close.
In contrast, there were 26 stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 at 3:40 p.m., 17 of which still had sell balances
over 50,000 shares at the close.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00155 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The report also discusses quarterly expiration prices and price changes at 4:00 p.m. and the close. The data show very
little volatility at the close. Nearly half the stocks had no change at the close, 79% changed one-eighth point or less,
and 92% changed one-quarter point or less. The stocks with sell imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close on average
declined more than one-eighth; the stocks with buy imbalances over 50,000 shares at the close increased 0.3125 points
on average.
As noted above, pursuant to the NYSE pilot program, the auxiliary closing procedures for expiration Fridays and QIX
expiration days (cumulatively, ``expiration days'') place limitations on MOC order-entry with regard to orders
related to any strategy involving an expiring derivative index product. The auxiliary closing procedures also restrict
the cancellation of MOC orders and provide for the dissemination of MOC order imbalances of 50,000 shares or more in
certain pilot securities. The present proposal would extend the existing pilot procedures for a one year pilot period
through October 1995. MOC order cancellations for bona fide errors would continue to be accepted. Once a publication
of an imbalance in a pilot stock has been made, any MOC orders subsequently entered in such pilot stock will be accepted
only to trade on the opposite side of the market in relation to such published imbalance. The entry of a MOC order to establish
or liquidate positions related to a strategy involving derivative instruments, however, would not be permitted
even if such orders might offset published imbalances.
The Commission believes that the auxiliary closing procedures should enable market participants to gain a more accurate
picture of the buying and selling interest in MOC orders at expiration. The Commission continues to believe that,
by requiring early submission of MOC orders and disseminating significant imbalances (50,000 shares or more) in
certain specified stocks, the NYSE should be able to attract contra-side interest to help alleviate imbalances caused
by the liquidation of stock positions related to index derivative product trading strategies. In this regard, the
NYSE's most recent report concerning expiration Friday volatility and the expiration Friday closing procedures
indicates that the procedures have worked relatively well and may have resulted in more orderly markets at the close
on expiration Fridays.
The Commission is approving an extension of the pilot program through October 1995. As long as some index derivative
products continue to expire based on closing stock prices on expiration Fridays, the Commission agrees with the NYSE
that such procedures are necessary to provide a mechanism to handle the potential large imbalances that can be engendered
by firms unwinding index derivative related positions. During the pilot extension, the Commission expects the NYSE
to continue to monitor closely the effectiveness of the procedures, and to submit a report with all of the same data
previously requested for prior periods. The report should cover all expirations through June 1995, and must be submitted
to the Commission no later than July 31, 1995
 along with a proposed rule change which should either request an additional extension of the pilot program or permanent
approval of the pilot procedures.




The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 This will permit the procedures to continue on an uninterrupted basis. Further, on September 9, 1994, the NYSE issued
an Information Memo to its members notifying them of the auxiliary closing procedures. Finally, special auxiliary
closing procedures have been utilized by the NYSE since 1986, and the procedures are intended to reduce excessive
market volatility at the close.


It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
 that the proposed rule change is hereby approved on a pilot basis through October 31, 1995.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Automatic Execution of Index Option Orders</DOCTITLE>



October 31, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx proposes to codify the eligibility of index options for its Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'') System
and its automatic execution feature (``Auto-X'').



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Autom is the Exchange's electronic order routing, delivery, execution, and reporting system for options. Orders
are routed from member firms directly to the appropriate specialist post on the Exchange's trading floor. Certain
market and marketable limit orders are eligible for AUTOM's automatic execution feature, AUTO-X. These AUTO-X
designated orders are automatically executed at the disseminated quotation price on the Exchange and reported to
the originating firm. Those orders not eligible for AUTO-X are manually handled by the specialist.

The AUTOM system has operated on a pilot basis since 1988, when it first was approved by the Commission for market orders
of up to five contracts for twelve Phlx near-month equity options.
 AUTOM has been extended and amended several times since.
 Most recently, the pilot program was approved to operate until December 31, 1994.
 In 1991, the Commission approved the use of AUTO-X as part of the AUTOM pilot program.
 Orders for up to 100 contracts are eligible for AUTOM and orders for up to 25 contracts are eligible for AUTOM-X.










At this time, the Phlx proposes to codify its existing practice of accepting index option orders for execution through
AUTOM and AUTO-X. Currently, AUTOM and AUTO-X are available for all Phlx options, including both equity
options and index options. Although the term ``index options'' was not specifically employed by the Phlx throughout
the AUTOM pilot program, Exchange research indicates that index options became AUTOM-eligible in June 1990, and
AUTO-X-eligible in March 1991. Since then, the Exchange has included index options trading when it reports
volume information and makes capacity representations to the Commission as part of the AUTOM pilot. Accordingly,
codifying index options into the AUTOM pilot does not raise new systems capacity concerns, as AUTOM has operated without
problems since index options have been included in AUTOM; specifically, the Exchange has not experienced systems
problems or received formal customer complaints related to index options trading on AUTOM.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00089 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Moreover, the Exchange frequently uses the term ``options'' to include both equity and index options. For example,
the ``Options Committee'' governs both equity options and index options trading, and ``options trading volume''
includes index options as well. In addition, the use of the phrase ``equity options'' to include index options is not
limited to AUTOM. For instance, ``equity options floor''
 and ``equity options examination''
 are common terms. Furthermore, the date when AUTO-X was extended to index options corresponds to Commission
approval of the use of AUTO-X for ``all Phlx equity options.''
 Accordingly, it appears that index options were added to AUTOM as part of the extension of both AUTOM and AUTO-X
to ``all Phlx equity options.''







Although Commission orders approving various amendments to and extensions of the AUTOM pilot refer to ``equity options,''
the proposed rule changes filed by the Exchange generally describe AUTOM as an order routing and delivery system for
``options.'' In addition, the Phlx has issued memoranda to the trading floor regarding the use of AUTOM/AUTO-X
for index options on many occasions, including periodic lists of the maximum size eligibility for AUTO-X. The
Phlx also notes that other exchanges permit the use of automatic order delivery and executions systems for index options.






The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and Section
6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and protect investors
and the public interest by codifying index options into the AUTOM pilot program. The Exchange believes that index
option orders benefit from the advantages of AUTOM, including efficient and prompt order delivery and execution.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Because the proposed rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning,
administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange, it has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)
of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to codify
the eligibility of index options, an existing Exchange practice, for an existing Commission-approved system. At
any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-40 and should be submitted by November 28, 1994.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or the ``Commission''). 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act''). 


 



APPLICANTS: 

DFA Investment Dimensions Group Inc. (the ``Fund''), Dimensional Fund Advisors Inc. (``DFA''), and certain life
insurance companies (``Participating Insurance Companies'') and their separate accounts (``Separate Accounts'')_the
Fund, DFA, the Participating Insurance Companies, and the Separate Accounts are referred to herein collectively
as the ``Applicants.'' 


 


RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTION: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the
1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold to variable annuity
and variable life insurance separate accounts issued by both affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies.



 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the Commission. 



Applicants' Representations 



1. DFA is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, and is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. DFA serves as investment adviser for the Fund. 

2. The Fund is a Maryland corporation registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified management investment
company. The Fund currently consists of, and offers shares of common stock (``shares'') in, nineteen separate investment
portfolios, each of which has its own investment objectives and policies. Shares of two of those portfolios presently
are offered only to a separate account of National Home Life Assurance Company which, in connection with its issuance
of variable annuity contracts, is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. 

3. The Fund intends to offer shares of its portfolios to Separate Accounts of additional insurance companies_including
insurance companies that are not affiliated with National Home Life Assurance Company_and to serve as the investment
vehicle for various types of insurance products, including variable annuity contracts, single premium variable
life insurance contracts, scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts, and flexible premium variable
life insurance contracts (collectively referred to herein as ``variable contracts''). Such Participating Insurance
Companies will establish their own separate accounts and design their own variable annuity or variable life insurance
contracts. It is anticipated that Participating Insurance Companies will rely on Rules 6e-2 or 6e-3(T)
under the 1940 Act, as appropriate, with respect to their scheduled premium and flexible premium variable life insurance
contracts; some Participating Insurance Companies may rely on individual exemptive orders as well. 

4. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity
and variable life insurance separate accounts is referred to herein as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management
company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred
to herein as ``shared funding.'' 

5. Applicants submit that making the Fund available for ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding will encourage more insurance
companies to offer variable contracts, and that this should result in increased competition with respect to both
variable contract design and pricing, which, in turn, can be expected to result in more product variation and lower
charges. Applicants submit that ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding should provide several benefits to variable contract
owners, including, among other things: elimination of a sufficient portion of the costs of establishing and administering
separate funds; and making a greater amount of assets available for investment, thereby promoting economies of scale,
permitting increased safety through greater diversification, and making the addition of new portfolios more feasible.

6. Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding. Nor do Applicants
believe that ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding will have any adverse federal income tax consequences. Applicants
represent that separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts historically have been employed to accumulate
shares of mutual funds which have not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. Accordingly,
Applicants request an order of the Commission exempting the Participating Insurance Companies and their Separate
Accounts (and, as necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of each such Separate Account) from Sections
9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to
the extent necessary to permit ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding.

1. Applicants request relief under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for the class of insurers and Separate Accounts investing
in the Fund (and principal underwriters and depositors of such Separate Accounts). Applicants represent that there
is ample precedent, in a variety of contexts, for granting exemptive relief not only to applicants in a given case,
but also to members of the class not currently identified that may be similarly situated in the future. Applicants
further represent that such class relief has been granted from a number of the provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants
note that the Commission staff will have an opportunity to review the compliance by Participating Insurance Companies
with the conditions of the requested order at the time each Separate Account files its registration statement.

2. Rule 6e-2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act,
only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all of the assets of which consist of the shares
of one or more registered investment companies (``underlying fund(s)'') which offer their shares ``

exclusively

 to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company'' (emphasis
supplied). The exemptions are not available to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that
owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same insurance
company or any unaffiliated insurance company. Nor is the relief granted by Rule 6e-2(b)(15) available if the
underlying fund also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts of unaffiliated life insurance
companies. In short, Rule 6e-2 permits neither ``mixed'' nor ``shared'' funding.

3. Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) provides exemptions similar to those provided by Rule 6e-2(b)(15), only if the
separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all of the assets of which consist of shares of underlying
funds which offer their shares ``

exclusively

 to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled contracts
or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life
insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company, or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company
in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account''
(emphasis supplied). In short, Rule 6e-3(T) permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable
life insurance separate account, but it does not permit shared funding.


4. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal
underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject
to a disqualification enumerated in Section 9(a) (1) or (2) of the 1940 Act.

5. Rules 6e-2(b)(15) (i) and (ii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions
from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding imposed
by the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions
to affiliated individuals or companies that participate directly in the management of the underlying registered
management investment company.

6. Applicants state that the partial relief from the requirements of Section 9 of the 1940 Act granted in Rules 6e-2(b)(15)
and 6e-3(T)(B)(15), in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section
9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Applicants state that Rules 6e-2(b)(15)
and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) recognize that neither the protection of investors nor the purposes fairly intended by
the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act requires the application of the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals
in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies
in that organization. Applicants further state that Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) recognize
that it is unnecessary to apply Section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated
companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize the Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts.

7. Applicants assert that no regulatory purpose is served by extending the Section 9(a) monitoring requirements
in the event of ``mixed'' or ``shared'' funding. In this regard, Applicants note that the Participating Insurance
Companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the Fund; those individuals who
currently participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same regardless of which Separate
Accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. For these reasons, Applicants submit that applying the monitoring
requirements of Section 9(a) because of investment by separate accounts of other insurers would be unjustified and
would not serve any regulatory purpose. Applicants further submit that increased monitoring costs would reduce
the net rates of return realized by contract owners.

8. Rules 6e-2(b)(15) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15) give the Participating Insurance Companies the right to disregard
voting instructions of contract holders. More specifically, Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)
provide partial exemption from Sections 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent those sections have been
deemed by the Commission to require ``pass-through'' voting with respect to an underlying fund's shares. 
9. Rules 6e-2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(

1

) provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of it owners with respect to the investments
of an underlying fund, or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance
regulatory authority (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rules 6e-2 and
6e-3(T)). 
10. Rules 6e2(b)(15)(iii)(B) and 6e3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A)(

2

)
 provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of contract owners if the contract owners initiate
any change in such insurance company's investment policies, principal underwriter, or any investment adviser (provided
that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(ii),
(b)(7)(ii)(B) or (b)(7)(ii)(C) of Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T)). 




11. Applicants represent that in the case of a change in the insurance company's investment policies, the insurance
company, in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions, must make a good-faith determination that such
a change would violate state law, or would result in investments that either would be inconsistent with the investment
objectives of the separate account or would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment
techniques used by other separate accounts of the company or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar
investment objectives. Applicants represent that in the case of a change of an investment adviser, the insurance
company, in order to disregard contract owners' voting instructions, must make a good-faith determination that
either: (a) The adviser's fees would exceed the maximum rate that may be charged against the separate account's assets;
or (b) the proposed adviser may be expected to employ investment techniques that either (i) would vary from the general
techniques used by the current adviser, or be used to manage the investments in a manner inconsistent with the investment
objectives of the Separate Account, or (ii) would result in investments that vary from certain standards. 
12. Applicants submit that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments
as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies, principal underwriter, or investment adviser
initiated by contract owners. Applicants also state that the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements
in Rule 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) that the Participating Insurance Company's disregard of voting instructions
be reasonable and based on specific good-faith determinations. 


Applicants' Conditions 


If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions: 
1. A majority of the directors of the Fund shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund (as
defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, the rules promulgated thereunder, and as modified by any applicable orders
of the Commission). If this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification, or bona-fide resignation
of any director(s), then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a) For a period of 45 days, if the vacancy
or vacancies may be filled by the directors; (b) for a period of 60 days, if a vote of shareholders is required to fill
the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application.

2. The board of directors of the Fund will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict
between the interests of the contract owners of all Separate Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable
conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority;
(b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling,
private letter ruling, no-action or interpretive letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities
regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in
which the investments of any Fund portfolio are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable
annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard
the voting instructions of contract owners. 
3. Participating Insurance Companies and DFA will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board of directors.
Participating Insurance Companies and DFA will provide the directors with all information reasonably necessary
for them to consider any issues raised by such conflicts and, more generally, will be responsible for assisting the
directors in carrying out their responsibilities under these conditions. In addition, each Participating Insurance
Company will inform the directors whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility
to report such information and conflicts to, and to assist, the directors will be a contractual obligation of all insurers
investing in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. These responsibilities will be
carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract owners.

<PARENT> FR941107-2-00090 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. If a majority of the board of directors, or a majority of the disinterested directors, determines that a material
irreconcilable conflict exists, then the relevant insurance companies, at their expense and to the extent reasonably
practicable (as determined by a majority of the disinterested directors), shall take whatever steps are necessary
to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict. Such steps may include: (a) Establishing a new registered
management investment company or managed separate account; or (b) withdrawing from the Fund or any of its portfolios
the assets allocable to some or all of the Separate Accounts, and reinvesting such assets in a different investment
medium (including another portfolio of the Fund), or submitting the question as to whether such segregation should
be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate
group 

i.e., 

annuity contract owners or life insurance contract owners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that
votes in favor of such segregation, or offering the affected contract owners the option of making such a change.

5. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard
contract owner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority
vote, then the insurer may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw the investment in the Fund by that insurer's
Separate Account; no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial
action in the event of the directors' determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such
remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements
governing participating in the Fund. These responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests
of contract owners.

6. For purposes of the condition set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, a majority of the disinterested directors shall
determine whether the proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict. In no event will
the Fund or DFA be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. The condition (paragraphs
4 and 5) will not be construed to require a Participating Insurance Company to establish a new funding medium for any
variable contract if an offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners adversely affected
in a material way by the material irreconcilable conflict.

7. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurer's decision to disregard contract owner voting
instructions and that decision represents a majority position or would preclude a majority vote, then the Participating
Insurance Company may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw the investment in the Fund by the insurer's
Separate Account; no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial
action in the event of the determination (by the directors of the Fund) of a material irreconcilable conflict, and
to bear the costs of such remedial action, shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies
under their agreements governing participation in the Fund. These responsibilities will be carried out with a view
only to the interest of contract owners.

8. For purposes of the condition set forth in paragraph 7 above, a majority of the disinterested directors shall determine
whether any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict. The Fund and the Fund's investment
adviser will not be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. Moreover, no Participating
Insurance Company shall be required by that condition (paragraph 7) to establish a new funding medium for any variable
contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners adversely affected in a material
way by the material irreconcilable conflict.

9. The determination by the directors of the Fund of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and the implications
of that conflict shall be made known promptly, in writing, to all Participating Insurance Companies.

10. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all variable contract owners
as long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable
contract owners. Accordingly, Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their respective
Separate Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely-received from contract owners. Each Participating
Insurance Company will vote shares of the Fund held in its respective Separate Accounts for which no voting instructions
from contract owners are timely-received, as well as shares of the Fund which the Participating Insurance Company
owns, in the same proportion as those shares of the Fund for which voting instructions from contract owners are timely-received.
Each Participating Insurance Company shall be responsible for assuring that its Separate Accounts participating
in the Fund calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating Insurance Companies. The
obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Separate Accounts investing in the
Fund shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing
participation in the Fund.

11. The Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders. More specifically,
the Fund will either: (a) Provide for annual meetings (except insofar as the Commission may interpret Section 16 of
the 1940 Act not to require such meetings); or (b) comply with Sections 16(a) and 16(c) of the 1940 Act and, if and when
applicable, Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, the Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation
of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic election of directors, and with whatever rules the Commission
may promulgate with respect thereto.

12. The Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that: (a) It is intended as a funding vehicle for all types of variable
annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by various insurance companies; (b) material irreconcilable
conflicts between the interests of contract owners of all Separate Accounts investing in the Fund may arise; and (c)
the directors of the Fund will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts
and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to any such conflict. The Fund will notify all Participating
Insurance Companies that Separate Account prospectus disclosure regarding potential risks of ``mixed'' and ``shared''
funding may be appropriate.

13. If and to the extent that Rules 6e-2 and Rule 6e-3(T) under the 1940 Act are amended, or Rule 6e-3
under the 1940 Act is adopted, to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules promulgated
thereunder with respect to ``mixed'' or ``shared'' funding on terms and conditions materially different from any
exemptions granted in the order requested in this application, the Fund and/or Participating Insurance Companies,
as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e-2, 6e-3(T), or Rule 6e-3,
as such rules are applicable.

14. At least annually, the Participating Insurance Companies and/or DFA shall submit to the directors of the Fund
such reports, materials, or data as the directors reasonably may request so that the directors may fully carry out
the obligations imposed upon the board of directors by the conditions contained in this application; said reports,
materials, and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the directors. The obligations of
the Participating Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the directors of the Fund
upon reasonable request shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their
agreements governing participation in the Fund.

15. All reports of potential or existing conflicts received by the directors of the Fund, and all actions by the directors
with regard to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict,
and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes
of the directors or other appropriate records. Such minutes and other records shall be made available to the Commission
upon request.



Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, Applicants submit that the requested exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and
15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e-2 and 6e-3(T) thereunder are appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940
Act. Accordingly, Applicants submit that the requested exemptions meet the applicable statutory standards of Section
6(c) of the 1940 Act.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. FILI is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Utah. FILI is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of FMR Corp., the parent company for the group of financial services companies known as Fidelity Investments.
2. The Variable Account was established by FILI as a separate account under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania on
July 22, 1987 for the purpose of funding certain variable annuity contracts issued by FILI. FILI may, in the future
issue other contracts funded by the Variable Account or other FILI Accounts and deduct mortality and expense risk
charges under those contracts in reliance upon the requested exemptive order, if granted. Applicants undertake
that such future contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts.
3. FBSI is the principal underwriter for the Contracts. In 1988, FILI, the Variable Account and Fidelity Distributors
Corp. (``FDC''), which at that time served as principal underwriter for the Contracts, obtained an exemptive order
(the ``1988 Order'') permitting the deduction of mortality and expense risk charges under the Contracts.
 On January 1, 1990, as part of an internal consolidation, the activities of FDC and FBSI were combined and FBSI became
principal underwriter for the Contracts. All aspects of the Contracts have remained precisely the same as was represented
in the application pursuant to which the 1988 Order was granted and Contract owners have continued to pay precisely
the same fees as they paid (or would have paid) when FDC served as principal underwriter.




4. The Contracts are flexible premium deferred variable annuities. Annuity payments can be on a fixed basis, a variable
basis, or a combination of both. If the Annuitant dies prior to the annuity date and prior to age 70, FILI will pay a death
benefit equal to the greater of (1) the purchase payments made, less any withdrawals and charges thereon and (2) the
Contract value as of the end of the valuation period in which proof of death is received at the service center.
5. On each Contract anniversary before the annuity date, FILI imposes an annual maintenance charge of $30. FILI currently
waives this charge for any Contract under which total payments, less withdrawals, equals at least $25,000 and for
contracts purchased after May 1, 1990 in exchange for a Fidelity Variable Annuity contract (another contract formerly
issued by FILI). FILI reserves the right to increase this annual charge to not more than $50, if warranted by expenses,
and to assess the charge against all contracts other than those issued in exchange for a Fidelity Variable Annuity.
The charge assessed after the annuity date for a particular contract will never be greater than the charge in effect
just before the annuity date. FILI also deducts a daily charge from the assets of the subaccounts of the Variable Account
equivalent to an effective annual rate of .25%. Applicants state that the administrative charges contain no element
of anticipated profit and their deduction meets the standard specified in Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.
6. FILI deducts an asset charge, computed daily, for its assumption of mortality and expense risks. This charge is
made by deducting daily from the assets of each subaccount attributable to the Contracts a percentage of those assets
equal to an effective annual rate of .75%. Of this .75% charge, .65% is estimated to be for assuming mortality risks
and .10% is estimated to be for assuming expense risks. The mortality risk FILI bears is that of making annuity payments
for the life of an annuitant no matter how long that may be. FILI also bears a mortality risk by guaranteeing the death
benefit if the annuitant dies prior to the annuity date. The expense risk is the risk that the costs of issuing and administering
the Contracts will be greater than expected when setting the administrative charge. FILI will realize a gain from
the charge for these risks to the extent that such charge is not needed to provide for benefits and expenses under the
Contracts.

7. A surrender charge is assessed on purchase payments withdrawn from the Contract within the first five Contract
years and may be assessed on annuitizations within the first three Contract years. The surrender charge is 5% during
the first Contract year and declines one percent per year thereafter. No surrender charge is imposed on total withdrawals
in each Contract year of up to 10% of purchase payments (less amounts previously withdrawn that were subject to a surrender
charge). Applicants expect that the surrender charge will not be sufficient to cover the expenses incurred in selling
the Contracts. To the extent that the surrender charge is not sufficient, FILI will pay these expenses from its general
assets which may include proceeds from the mortality and expense risk charge.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request exemptive relief on a prospective basis from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charges under the Contracts and any future
contracts offered through the Variable Account or through similar separate accounts established and maintained
by FILI, whether currently existing or created in the future. Applicants also request that such exemptive relief
extend to any other National Association of Securities member broker-dealer controlling, controlled by or under
common control with FILI, whether existing or created in the future, that may serve in the future as principal underwriter
of the Contracts or of future contracts offered through the Variable Account or other FILI Accounts.
2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor
or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificate unless proceeds of payments
on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions.
Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality
and expense risk charges.
3. Applicants submit that their request for an order that applies to (1) contracts offered in the future by the Variable
Account or other FILI Separate Accounts that are substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts
described in the application, and (2) other FILI Broker-Dealers which may serve in the future as principal underwriter
in respect of the Contracts or of future contracts offered by the Variable Account or other FILI Separate Accounts,
is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity contract
market by eliminating the need for FILI to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing its administrative
expenses and maximizing its use of its resources. The delay and expense involved in having to repeatedly seek exemptive
relief would impair FILI's ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Applicants
further submit that the requested relief is consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors
for the same reasons. If FILI were required to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed
in the application, investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby.
4. Applicants submit that FILI is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense
risks and that the change in principal underwriter in no way affects the findings the SEC made in granting the 1988 Order.
Applicants represent that the charge of .75% made under the Contracts for mortality and expense risks is consistent
with the protection of investors because it is a proper insurance charge.
5. FILI further represents that the charge of .75% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry practice
with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon FILI's analysis of publicly available
information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels,
the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. FILI will maintain at its executive office,
and make available to the SEC upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course
of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey.
6. Applicants represent that prior to making available any future contracts, they will make a determination that
the mortality and expense risks under any such contract will be within the range of industry practice for comparable
contracts. Applicants will also maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum outlining
the methodology underlying such determination. Further, such mortaility and expense risk charge would not exceed
1.25% of the daily assets of the Variable Account or other FILI Separate Account.

7. Applicants acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charges, all or a portion
of such profit may be viewed as being used to cover distribution expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FILI has
concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit
the Variable Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by FILI at its executive office and which will be made available to the Commission upon request. 

8. FILI represents that the Variable Account and other FILI Separate Accounts will invest only in a management investment
company which has undertaken, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance
distribution expenses, to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of
such open-end management investment company, formulate and approve any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution
expenses. 



Conclusion 



Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested in the application is appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940
Act.

2. The Trust will be registered under the Act as a unit investment trust and will offer units in series (``Trust Series''),
each of which will contain shares of one Fund that is normally offered with a sales load, and U.S. Government zero coupon
obligations. The Trust's objective is to provide protection of capital while providing for capital appreciation
through investments in zero coupon obligations and shares of the Funds. Each Trust Series will be organized pursuant
to a reference trust agreement that will incorporate a trust indenture and agreement relating to the entire Trust
(collectively, the ``Trust Agreement'') and that will name a qualified bank as trustee (``Trustee'').
3. Each Trust Series will be sponsored by the Sponsor, which will perform the functions typical of unit investment
trust sponsors. These functions will include depositing Fund shares in the Trust; acquiring zero coupon obligations
and depositing them in the Trust; arranging for the evaluation of the zero coupon obligations; offering units to the
public; and maintaining a secondary market in units. The Sponsor expects to deposit in the Trust substantially more
than $100,000 aggregate value of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares.
4. Trust units will be offered for sale to the public through the final prospectus by the Sponsor. Trust Series are intended
to be offered to the public initially at prices based on the net asset value of the Fund shares selected for deposit in
that Trust Series, plus the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations contained therein, plus a sales charge.
The Trust will redeem units at prices based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations and
the net asset value of the Fund shares.
5. With the deposit of the securities in the Trust Series on the initial date of deposit, the Sponsor will have established
a proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in the Trust
Series. The Sponsor will be permitted under the Trust Agreement to deposit additional securities, which may result
in a corresponding increase in the number of units outstanding. Such units may be continuously offered for sale to
the public by means of the prospectus.
6. The Trust will be structured so that each Trust Series will contain a sufficient amount of zero coupon obligations
to assure that, at the specified maturity date for such Trust Series, the purchaser of a unit would receive back the
approximate total amount of the original investment in the Trust, including the sales charge. Such investor would
receive more than the original investment to the extent that the underlying Fund made any distributions during the
life of the Trust and/or had any value at the maturity of the Trust Series.
7. The Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for Trust units, but is not obligated to do so. The existence of
such a secondary market will reduce the number of units tendered to the Trustee for redemption and thus alleviate the
necessity of selling portfolio securities to raise the cash necessary to meet such redemptions. In the event that
the Sponsor does not maintain a secondary market, the Trust Agreement will provide that the Sponsor will not instruct
the Trustee to sell zero coupon obligations from any Trust Series until shares of the Fund have been liquidated in order
not to impair the protection provided by the zero coupon obligations, unless the Trustee is able to sell such zero coupon
obligations and still maintain at least the original proportionate relationship to unit value. The Trust Agreement
also provides that zero coupon obligations cannot be sold to meet Trust expenses.
8. The Trust has taken certain steps to reduce the impact of the termination of a Trust Series on the Fund deposited therein.
First, the Trust will, with respect to all unitholders still holding units at scheduled termination and to the extent
desired by such unitholders, transfer the registration of their proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust
to a registration in the investor's name in lieu of redeeming such shares. Second, the Fund will offer all such unitholders
the option of investing the proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in Fund shares at net asset value (

i.e.

, without the imposition of the normal sales load). The Fund also will offer unitholders the option of investing all
distributions from the Trust during the life of the Trust Series in Fund shares at net asset value. Thus, it is anticipated
that many of the unitholders will become and remain direct shareholders of the Fund and that many will elect to invest
their proceeds of the Trust Series in an account of the Fund.

9. The sales load that normally would be applicable on sales of underlying Fund shares will be waived, whether an upfront
or deferred sales charge. In accordance with the CDSC Order, applicants will waive any otherwise applicable CDSC
where: (a) the Sponsor has purchased such shares in connection with the sale of units; (b) the proceeds of zero-coupon
obligations upon termination of a Trust, and distributions from a Trust made during the existence of the Trust, have
been reinvested by a unitholder in additional Fund shares; and (c) a Trust at maturity has transferred a unitholder's
proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust to a registration in the unitholder's name in lieu of redeeming
such shares. Any waiver will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d-1 of the Act.
Moreover, the Sponsor will rebate to the Trustee any payments it receives in respect of units under any rule 12b-1
plans adopted by the Funds.



Applicants' Legal Analysis:



1. Section 14(a) of the Act requires that investment companies have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering.
The Trust will have an initial net worth in excess of $100,000 invested in zero coupon obligations and Fund shares.
Applicants recognize, however, that by withdrawing certificates representing the entire beneficial ownership
of the Trust, the Sponsor may be deemed to be reducing the Trust's net worth below the requirements of section 14(a).
Applicants believe that an exemption is appropriate. Applicants also intend to comply in all respects with the requirements
of rule 14a-3, which provides an exemption from section 14(a), except that the Trust would not restrict its portfolio
to ``eligible trust securities.''

2. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b-1 thereunder provide that, except under limited circumstances, no registered
investment company may distribute long-term capital gains more than once every twelve months. Applicants request
an exemption from section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection
with the redemption of Fund shares to be distributed to unitholders along with the Trust's regular distributions.
Applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of section 19(b) and rule 19b-1
because the dangers of manipulation of capital gains and confusion between capital gains and regular income distributions
does not exist in the Trust. The Trust and its Sponsor have substantially no control over events, other than the selection
of the portfolio, which might trigger capital gains (

i.e., 

the tendering of units for redemption). Moreover, because principal distributions are clearly indicated in accompanying
reports to unitholders as a return of principal, applicants believe that the danger of confusion is not present in
the operations of the Trust.

3. Section 11(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any registered open-end investment company or principal underwriter
for such company to make certain offers of exchange on any basis other than the relative net asset value of the securities
to be exchanged, unless the terms of the exchange offer have first been approved by the SEC. Section 11(c) provides
that section 11(a) will be applicable to any type of exchange offer involving securities of a registered unit investment
trust, irrespective of the basis of exchange. Applicants request an order pursuant to section 11 (a) and (c) approving
the termination option. At the termination of the Trust, unitholders still holding units at maturity will have the
option of either transferring the registration of their proportionate number of Fund shares from the Trust to a registration
in the investor's name, or receiving a cash distribution. Such unitholders also will have the option of either reinvesting
the proceeds of the zero-coupon obligations in additional shares of the Fund (without imposition of the normal sales
load), or receiving a cash distribution. The exchange will be made on the basis of the net asset value of the Fund shares.

4. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 thereunder make it unlawful for any affiliated person of, or principal
underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of either of them, acting as a principal,
to engage in a joint transaction with the investment company unless the joint transaction has been approved by the
SEC. Applicants' proposed arrangements may be a joint transaction under these provisions. Applicants believe that
the proposed arrangements are consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and the participation
by each registered investment company is not on a basis less advantageous than that of other participants.

5. Applicants do not request relief under section 12(d)(1) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1) limits purchases by registered
investment companies of securities issued by other investment companies. Section 12(d)(1)(E) provides, however,
that section 12(d)(1) shall not apply to securities purchased by a registered unit investment trust if the securities
are the only ``investment securities'' held by the trust. Applicants believe that the U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations
are not ``investment securities'' for purposes of section 12(d)(1)(E)
 and that the Fund shares are the only ``investment securities'' which the Trust will hold. Accordingly, they do not
believe relief from section 12(d)(1) is necessary.




Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree to the following as conditions to the granting of the requested order:

1. The Trustee will not redeem Fund shares except to the extent necessary to meet redemptions of units by unitholders,
or to pay Trust expenses should distributions received on Fund shares and rebated rule 12b-1 fees prove insufficient
to cover such expenses.

2. Any rule 12b-1 fees received by the Sponsor in connection with the distribution of Fund shares to the Trust
will be immediately rebated by the Sponsor to the Trustee. 
3. All Trust Series will be structured so that their maturity dates will be at least thirty days apart from one another.

4. Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Trust will not
restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' 
5. Shares of a Fund which are held by a Series of the Trust will be voted by the Trustee of the Trust, and the Trustee will
vote all shares of a Fund held in a Trust Series in the same proportion as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust
are voted. 
6. Any shares of the Funds deposited in any Trust Series or any shares acquired by unitholders through reinvestment
of dividends or distributions or through reinvestment at termination will be made without imposition of any otherwise
applicable sales load and at net asset value. 
7. The prospectus of each Trust Series and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of a reinvestment
option will disclose that shareholders who elect to invest in Fund shares will incur a rule 12b-1 fee.

APPLICANTS: 

The Travelers Life and Annuity Company (``Travelers''), The Travelers Fund VA For Variable Annuities (``Fund VA'')
and Other Separate Accounts (``Other Accounts'') (collectively, ``Separate Accounts''), and Travelers Equities
Sales, Inc. (``Sales'') (collectively, ``Applicants'').

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from the provisions of Sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations



1. Travelers is a stock life insurance company currently licensed to conduct a life insurance and annuity business
in all states except Alabama, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas,
Wyoming and New York. Travelers currently is seeking to obtain licensure in the remaining states, except New York.
Travelers is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Travelers Insurance Company, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
The Travelers, Inc. (``Travelers, Inc.'').
2. Fund VA is a separate account established by Travelers to fund certain individual and group flexible premium deferred
variable annuity contracts and certificates (``Current Contracts''). Travelers also may issue through Fund VA,
or Other Accounts established in the future, other individual or group flexible premium deferred variable annuity
contracts and certificates that are substantially identical in all material respects to the Current Contracts (``Future
Contracts,'' together with Current Contracts, the ``Contracts'').

<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00172 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

3. Fund VA has filed with the Commission on Form N-8A a Notification of Registration as a unit investment trust
under the 1940 Act and a registration statement on Form N-4 under the Securities Act of 1933 in order to register
as securities the Current Contracts. Future Contracts issued through Fund VA or any Other Accounts will be registered
as securities under the 1933 Act. Other Accounts established in the future by Travelers to fund the Future Contracts
will be registered with the Commission as unit investment trusts.


4. Fund VA currently is subdivided into twenty-one subaccounts (``Subaccounts''), each investing exclusively
in shares of corresponding registered open-end management investment companies (``Underlying Funds''). Other
Subaccounts may be created in the future to invest in additional Underlying Funds which may now or in the future be made
available. Each Subaccount of any Other Account established by Travelers in the future will invest exclusively in
the shares of a specific corresponding open-end management investment company registered with the Commission.
Shares of the Underlying Funds will be sold to Fund VA at net asset value. Each Underlying Fund is responsible for all
of its own expenses, including applicable investment advisory fees.

5. Sales, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Travelers, Inc. and an affiliate of Travelers, will be the principal
underwriter of the Contracts. Sales is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.


6. The Contracts are designed for use in connection with retirement plans that may qualify for favorable federal income
tax treatment under Sections 408, 403(b), 401(a), 401(k) and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and for non-qualified group and/or individual contracts.


7. The Contracts provide for the allocation of purchase payments to the Subaccounts and/or to a fixed account funded
by the general assets of Travelers. Certain minimum purchase payments are required under the Contracts, which also
provide for annuity payments on a fixed or variable basis. Fixed payments are based on the tables shown in the Contracts.
Variable annuity payments will increase or decrease during the payment period. The first payment is based on the tables
shown in the Contracts. Subsequent payments will increase or decrease depending on the net investment performance
of the underlying funds chosen for investment during the annuity payment period relative to the 3.5% assumed interest
rate used to determine the tables shown in the Contracts.

Prior to annuitization, Contract owners may transfer all or part of the Contract Value between Subaccounts at no cost.
Currently, there are no restrictions on the frequency of transfers, but the right is reserved to limit transfers to
no more than one in any six-month period. Currently, no charge is made for transfers among the Portfolios. The death
benefit paid under individual Contracts and certain group Contracts for a death of the Annuitant prior to age 75 will
equal the greatest of: (a) Contract Value, less applicable premium tax or outstanding cash loans; (b) total purchase
payments under the Contract, less prior surrenders or cash loans; or (c) Contract Value on the most recent fifth contract
date anniversary on or immediately preceding the date of receipt of proof of death by Travelers, less applicable premium
tax, outstanding cash loans or prior surrenders not previously deducted. In the event of the death of an Annuitant
on or after age 75, the death benefit will be Contract Value, less applicable premium tax or outstanding cash loans.

8. Certain charges and deductions are assessed under the Contracts. An administrative charge of $15 will be deducted
from Contract Value semi-annually for each individual Contract and for each participant account under a group Contract,
and 

pro rata 

upon full or partial surrender or other termination, death of the annuitant, or commencement of the annuity payment
period. This charge is to reimburse Travelers for its actual administrative costs expected to be incurred over the
life of the Contracts. Administrative charges are guaranteed not to increase during the life of the Contracts.

9. Applicable premium taxes, currently ranging from 0.5% to 5%, will be deducted from Contract Value upon death, surrender,
annuitization, or from Purchase Payments at the time they are made under the Contract, but no earlier than when Travelers
incurs a tax liability under state law.

10. Contract owners may elect to participate in an asset allocation program (``CHART Program'') provided under the
Contracts by entering into a separate investment advisory agreement (``Agreement'') with Copeland Financial Services,
Inc. (``Copeland''). Copeland, an affiliate of Travelers, is an investment adviser registered under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.


Under the CHART Program, purchase payments and Contract values may be allocated among certain Subaccounts. Travelers
will be authorized under the Agreement to redeem, in a non-taxable transaction, a sufficient number of units from
a Contract owner's Contract Value to pay a quarterly fee, which will be paid directly to Copeland. In addition to a $30
initial fee, Copeland charges for its advisory services a maximum of 1.50% of the assets subject to the CHART Program.
This fee currently is reduced by 0.25%, the amount of the fee paid to the investment manager of the relevant Underlying
Funds, and further reduced for assets over $25,000 and for certain plans. Applicants represent that the fee payment
arrangement will be operated in a manner substantially identical to that described in a no-action letter, 

Travelers Insurance Company, et al. 

(IP-7-93, avail. Sept. 3, 1993).

11. No sales charge is deducted from premium payments under the Contracts. However, to pay Travelers for its costs
of distributing the Contracts, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') equal to 5% of a purchase payment will
be assessed in the first five years following such payment for certain full or partial surrenders. After the first
contract or certificate year, Contract owners may surrender up to 10% of their contract value as of the first valuation
date of any given contract year without incurring a CDSC (``Free Withdrawal''). Free Withdrawals do not apply to full
surrenders, and, under IRA plans, are only available after the annuitant has attained age 591/2. Additionally, the
CDSC is not assessed on Contract earnings which equal (a) Contract Value, minus (b) the sum of all purchase payments
not previously surrendered, and minus (c) the amount of the Free Withdrawal, if applicable.
For purposes of determining the CDSC, surrenders will be deemed to be taken first from any applicable Free Withdrawal
amount, then from purchase payments on a first-in, first-out basis, and finally from Contract earnings in excess
of any 10% Free Withdrawal. The CDSC cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts and may be waived under certain
circumstances.
Travelers does not expect that revenues from the CDSC will be sufficient to cover sales and distribution expenses
incurred in connection with the Contracts. In that event, the excess distribution costs would have to be paid out of
Travelers' general assets, which may include profits, if any, from the mortality and expense risk charges assessed
under the Contracts. In some cases, where Travelers may expect to incur lower sales and administrative expenses or
perform fewer services, it may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate certain administrative and CDSC charges.
12. A charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of net asset value of the Subaccounts will be imposed to compensate
Travelers for bearing certain mortality and expense risks. Of this amount, .625% is for mortality and .625% is for
expense risks. This charge cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts.
13. The mortality risk arises from Travelers' contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments for the life of the
annuitant under annuity options involving life contingencies, regardless of the annuitant's longevity and any
improvement in life expectancy generally. Thus, Travelers assumes the risk that the annuitants, as a class, may live
longer than has been estimated by its actuaries, so that payments guaranteed for the life of the Contracts will continue
for longer than had been anticipated.
14. Travelers assumes additional mortality and certain expense risks under the Contracts by its contractual obligation
to pay the death benefit in a lump sum (or in the form of an annuity option) upon the death of the annuitant before annuity
or income payments commence. Also, no CDSC will be assessed if the Contract Value is paid as a death benefit. Travelers
also assumes an expense risk under the Contracts because the administrative charges may be insufficient to cover
actual administrative expenses.
15. In the event that the administrative charge and the mortality and expense risk charge are more than sufficient
to cover Travelers' costs and expenses, any excess will be a profit to Travelers. While Travelers does not expect to
profit from the administrative charges, it does expect a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Any profit
realized from this charge would be available for any proper corporate purpose, including the payment of distribution
expenses for the Contracts not reimbursed by the CDSC.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act granting exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from
the assets of: (a) Fund VA in connection with the offering of Current Contracts; (b) Fund VA in connection with the offering
of Future Contracts; and (c) any Other Accounts established in the future by Travelers in connection with the offering
of Future Contracts. Applicants believe that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the 1940 Act.
2. Applicants represent that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Future Contracts funded by Fund
VA or the Other Accounts are consistent with the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants represent
that the Future Contracts will be substantially identical in all material respects to the Current Contracts. Applicants
state that without the requested relief, Travelers would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for Fund VA,
or each new Other Account, to fund Future Contracts. Applicants assert that these additional requests for exemptive
relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this application. Further, if Travelers
were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors
would not receive additional protection or benefit and could be disadvantaged by increased overhead of Travelers.
Applicants argue that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because the relief will promote
competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for Travelers to file redundant exemptive
applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. Applicants
believe that both the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would impair Travelers' ability
to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.

3. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission, by order upon application, to conditionally or unconditionally
grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation of the 1940 Act to the extent that the exemption is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

4. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust,
its depositor or principal underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments, other than sales loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit
any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for
performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself.
5. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Travelers under the Contracts and is within the range of industry practice for comparable annuity contracts. This
representation is based upon Traveler's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products,
taking into consideration such factors as guaranteed minimum death benefits, minimum initial and subsequent purchase
payments, other contract charges, the manner in which charges are imposed, market sector, investment options, and
availability of the contract for use in qualified and non-qualified plans. Travelers represents that it will maintain
at its principal office, available to the Commission, memoranda setting forth in detail the variable annuity products
analyzed in the course of, and the methodology used in, and the results of, its comparative review.
6. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. Travelers has concluded that
there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate
Accounts and investors in the Contracts. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by Travelers at its principal office and will be available to the Commission.
7. Travelers also represents that the Separate Accounts will invest only in underlying mutual funds which have undertaken,
in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors
or trustees, a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the such fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19)
of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.



Conclusion


For the reasons set forth above, Applicants submit that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in
the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.



For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Pioneer Ventures Limited Partnership II; Notice of Filing of an Application for a License to Operate as a Small Business
Investment Company</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given of the filing of an application with the Small Business Administration (SBA) pursuant to Section
107.102 of the Regulations governing small business investment companies (13 CFR 107.102 (1994)) by Pioneer Ventures
Limited Partnership II, 60 State Street, Boston, MA 02109, for a license to operate as a small business investment
company (SBIC) under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, (15 U.S.C. et. seq.), and the Rules and
Regulations promulgated thereunder.

The initial investors and their percent of ownership of the Applicant are as follows:






Pioneer Ventures Limited Partnership II will be managed by Pioneer Capital Corporation. The principal shareholder
and officers of Pioneer Capital Corporation who will be responsible for management of the Applicant are:






The applicant will begin operations with committed capital of approximately $14.1 million and will be a source of
debt and equity financings for qualified small business concerns. The applicant will invest primarily in technology,
industrial products, and consumer businesses located in the New England States.

Matters involved in SBA's consideration of the application include the general business reputation and character

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice sets forth a statement of U.S. international air transportation policy. This notice is being published
to provide interested persons an opportunity to comment on the statement.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This statement of U.S. international air transportation policy, which was developed by the Department of Transportation
in consultation with the Department of State and other executive agencies, sets forth objectives and guidelines
for use by U.S. Government officials in carrying out U.S. international air transportation policy. Before this statement
is finalized, we will carefully consider any comments that are received. 



United States International Air Transportation Policy 

Introduction 



The availability of efficient international air transportation will greatly enhance the future expansion of international
commerce and the development of the emerging global marketplace. Worldwide, travelers and shippers are demanding
more and better quality service to more places. U.S. and foreign airlines are responding to this demand by expanding
traditional forms of service and by developing new and innovative services. Increased demand and the variety of carrier
responses to it challenge the existing intergovernmental system's ability to ensure the development of a competitive
air transportation system that meets the needs of the rapidly evolving, expanding and increasingly integrated international
aviation marketplace. In many cases, existing bilateral agreements impede the growth of the marketplace. 

We must address the challenges presented by these rapid changes to meet our future air transportation needs, and to
provide our aviation industry with the environment and the opportunities that will enable it to grow and compete effectively
in the world market. This policy statement outlines our approach to addressing those challenges. 



Our Goal: Safe, Affordable, Convenient and Efficient Air Service for Consumers 



As established in our last aviation policy statement in 1978, our overall goal continues to be to foster safe, affordable,
convenient and efficient air service for consumers. We continue to believe that the best way to achieve this goal is
to rely on the marketplace and unrestricted, fair competition to determine the variety, quality, and price of air
service. We believe that this approach will provide consumers and shippers with more and better service options at
costs that reflect economically efficient operations and work best to:

 Increase airlines' opportunities to expand their 
operations; 
 Increase productivity and high-quality job 
opportunities within the aviation industry; and 
 Promote aerospace 
exports and general economic growth.



Changing Environment



Growing economic interdependence among nations_the 
``globalization'' of the world economy_has expanded demand 
for convenient, reliable and affordable international air 
service. Demand for international service is growing faster 
than demand for U.S. domestic service, and most major U.S. 
airlines are now providing and planning to expand 
international operations. Between 1983 and 1993, the 
international component of U.S. airlines' route networks, 
measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), grew from around 
16% to over 27%. U.S. airline revenues from international 
air service nearly tripled from $6.3 billion to $17.6 
billion. Moreover, forecasts indicate that U.S. carrier 
international traffic, measured by RPMs, will increase to 
almost one-third of their total system traffic by the year 
2000. 
Just as important, the pattern of demand for international 
service has changed considerably. First, the regional 
distribution of U.S. carriers' international revenues has 
changed dramatically, as the primary focus of carriers' 
expansion moved beyond Europe to meet new demand in the 
emerging markets of Asia, the Pacific Rim and Latin America. 
In 1983, the Atlantic accounted for 48% of our carriers' 
international revenues, while the Pacific accounted for 32%. 
By 1993, the Pacific had grown to 46% while the Atlantic was 
only 37%. The fastest growing sectors of the international 
aviation market are new and relatively undeveloped markets. 
During this same period, revenues in the Pacific grew 286%, 
in Latin America 151% and in Europe 116%. Second, from 1983 
to 1993, the number of international aviation city-pair 
markets in which U.S. airlines participate has grown by more 
than a third, reflecting the major expansion of air service 
and carrier networks throughout the world and the increased 
dispersion of demand. Many of these city-pair markets are 
relatively small, generating only a few passengers per day. 


Towards a Globalized Aviation Industry 


The rapid growth of demand for international air service and 
the wider dispersion of traffic in city-pair markets are 
primary factors influencing the development of the air 
service industry. Carriers are increasingly finding that they cannot remain 
profitable unless they can respond to this changed demand. 
To compete effectively, carriers today must have 
unrestricted access to as many markets and passengers as 
possible. 
To meet demand and to improve their efficiency, many 
carriers are developing international hub-and-spoke systems 
that permit them to combine traffic flows from many routes 
(the ``spokes'') at a central point (the ``hub'') and transport 
them to another point either directly or through a hub in 
another region. Just as U.S. carriers developed 
hub-and-spoke systems to tap the broad traffic pool in the 
domestic market and to provide the most cost-efficient 
service for hundreds of communities that could not support 
direct service, international air carriers are developing 
world-wide hub-and-spoke systems to tap the substantial pool 
of international city-pairs. Internationally, an even 
larger portion of traffic moving over hub-and-spoke systems 
will require the use of at least two hubs (

e.g.

, a hub in 
both the U.S. and Europe for a passenger moving from an 
interior U.S. point to a point beyond the European hub). 
This increases the complexity and interdependence of the 
components of the system (both the spokes and hubs) and the 
importance of multinational traffic rights to the success of 
the system. 
As a result, carriers wishing to establish global networks 
require a higher quality and quantity of supporting route 
authority than they have sought in the past. Airlines will 
become increasingly concerned with every market that enables 
them to flow passengers over any part of their system 
network. These airlines will be looking for broad, flexible 
authority to operate beyond and behind hub points, in 
addition to the hub-to-hub market between two countries. At 
present, governments operating in a bilateral context 
naturally focus on opportunities for their respective 
carriers to serve the local market between their two 
countries. In a bilateral context, services destined for or 
coming from third countries receive less consideration. In 
the future, governments will have to adjust their focus to 
bargain for the bundles of rights that will permit airlines 
to develop global networks. 
Carriers can either serve markets themselves (direct 
service) or provide service through commercial arrangements 
with other carriers (indirect service), whether on a 
traditional interline connecting basis or under a closer 
commercial agreement between the carriers, such as code 
sharing. Carriers will develop service products_single-plane, on-line connecting, interline connecting, 
joint service_that respond to the preferences of the 
traveling public as measured by passenger willingness to pay 
for differences in the quality of service and that take into 
account their cost structure and market strategy. To the 
greatest extent possible, airlines should be free to set 
prices and offer various service products in response to 
passenger preferences.

Significant challenges face carriers wishing to develop 
international networks using their own direct services. 
They need: 
 Substantial access not only to key hub cities 
overseas, but also through and beyond them to 
numerous other cities, mostly in third countries. 
This type of access is not readily obtainable in 
today's bilateral system of negotiating air rights, 
since governments can only exchange access rights to 
their own countries and cannot, between themselves, 
deliver access to third countries, thus requiring 
piecemeal negotiating efforts to build the necessary 
package of rights; 
 Access to a large number of gates and 
takeoff/landing slots, frequently at some of the 
world's most congested airports. It may become 
increasingly difficult for carriers to gain 
effective, direct access to certain airport 
facilities, including some in the United States; 
 Considerable financial resources to establish and 
sustain commercially successful overseas hub systems; 
and 
 The ability to obtain infrastructure and establish 
market presence in a new region quickly. Existing 
foreign investment laws can effectively preclude 
airlines from entering new markets in one of the most 
efficient means available: merger or acquisition. 
Some carriers are taking on these challenges directly and 
are striving to develop their own global systems of direct 
service. Other carriers have chosen to side-step the 
obstacles, turning instead to a new network-building technique: 
cross-border marketing alliances that 
link traffic flows between established hub-and-spoke systems 
in key cities of the Western Hemisphere, Europe and Asia. 
Some of these alliances involve cross ownership, while 
others do not. Under this strategy, the linking of hubs 
requires indirect market access through code-sharing or 
other cooperative marketing arrangements. Although code 
sharing has become a widely-used marketing device for 
airlines and is currently the most prevalent form of 
commercial arrangement, further evolution of the industry 
and its regulatory environment may lead to new marketing 
practices that could supplement or supplant code sharing. 
Code sharing and other cooperative marketing arrangements 
can provide a cost-efficient way for carriers to enter new 
markets, expand their systems and obtain additional flow 
traffic to support their other operations by using existing 
facilities and scheduled operations. Because these 
cooperative arrangements can give the airline partners new 
or additional access to more markets, the partners will gain 
traffic, some stimulated by the new service, and some 
diverted from incumbents. In this way, cooperative 
arrangements can enhance the competitive positions of both 
partners in such a relationship. 
Increased international code-sharing and other cooperative 
arrangements can benefit consumers by increasing 
international service options and enhancing competition 
between carriers, particularly for traffic to or from cities 
behind major gateways. By stimulating traffic, the 
increased competition and service options should expand the 
overall international market and increase overall 
opportunities for the aviation industry. U.S. airlines 
should be major beneficiaries of this expansion and the 
concomitant increased service opportunities, given their 
competitive advantages. 
Moreover, code sharing should also enhance domestic 
competition. Many international passengers traveling to or 
from U.S. interior cities use domestic services for some 
portion of their international journey. Code sharing should 
increase competition among domestic carriers to carry those 
passengers on the domestic segment of their international 
journey. 
Although we expect the expansion of cooperative arrangements 
to be largely beneficial, there may be some negative 
effects. The greater traffic access of participants may 
give them considerable competitive muscle, and we may need 
to watch for harmful effects on competition. 
Global systems and the growing use of code sharing may put 
significant competitive pressure on carriers whose strategy 
does not include participation in such systems or in 
code-sharing alliances, or whose options to participate may 
be limited due to the lack of potential partners. Such 
carriers will have to develop other commercial responses to 
compete effectively. We expect these pressures and 
responses to lead to a restructuring of service and 
airlines, similar to the U.S. domestic experience in the 
1980s. Overall, cities and consumers will probably enjoy 
improved service and access to the international 
transportation system, although some cities may have fewer 
or less convenient service options in some markets than they 
have today. Similarly, although some airlines will grow and 
prosper, others will not. Overall, this evolution should 
expand the level and quality of international air service 
for consumers. 
Code-sharing arrangements are designed to address the 
preference of passengers and shippers for on-line service 
from beginning to end through coordinated scheduling, 
baggage- and cargo-handling, and other elements of 
single-carrier service. However, innovative service 
products, such as code sharing, can only respond to consumer 
preferences accurately, and thereby enable the marketplace 
to function efficiently, if consumers make choices based on 
full information.

<TEXT>
 

Therefore, we must ensure that airlines 
give consumers clear information about the characteristics 
of their service product, and that consumers can distinguish 
between code sharing and other forms of service. 
In addition to the two types of global networks 
(sole-carrier systems and joint carrier systems), there will 
continue to be a role for air services outside of global 
networks. The U.S. experience with deregulation indicates 
that_absent legal barriers to entry_specialized 
competitors will enter the market and discipline the pricing 
and 
service behavior of the larger network operators. The 
introduction of technologically advanced aircraft such as 
the B-767, the MD-11 and the B-777 make direct service on 
longer or thinner routes economically viable. Moreover, 
airlines can viably serve heavily traveled routes with 
point-to-point service. 
In short, as indicated by our domestic experience, a variety 
of service forms_global networks with carriers 
participating either as the sole provider or as participant 
in a joint network, and regional niche carriers_can exist 
in the international aviation market and the competition 
among these services will enhance consumer benefits through 
efficient operations and low fares. Thus, our international 
aviation strategy should provide opportunities for all of 
these forms of service so that we realize the benefits from 
maximum competition among them. 
Our airlines are well positioned to be primary participants 
in all aspects of the future global marketplace. In recent 
years, our largest domestic carriers have become our primary 
international carriers, replacing specialized international 
operators. After operating in a deregulated domestic market 
for more than 15 years, our carriers have developed 
operating efficiencies that give them a cost advantage over 
their major foreign competitors. Moreover, the financial 
positions of our carriers are improving due to their 
cost-cutting measures and improving economic conditions. 
Coupled with their cost efficiencies, their improving 
financial status will further enhance their competitive 
capabilities. Over time, however, trends toward 
privatization and increased productivity of major foreign 
competitors may affect the current cost advantage U.S. 
airlines enjoy. We must try to provide our carriers with 
the flexible rights and economic environment that will 
enable them to respond to the dynamics of the marketplace. 


Intergovernment Aviation Relations 


International air services between two nations have 
traditionally been conducted pursuant to bilateral 
agreements. The U.S. National Commission To Ensure a Strong 
Competitive Airline Industry and the European Union's Comit&eacute; 
des Sages for Air Transport have both recognized that the 
bilateral system is limited in its ability to encompass the broad, 
multinational market access required by the new global 
operating systems. Consequently, progress in developing 
global networks has been and will be extremely fragmented 
and may preclude or limit the development of efficient 
operations. We must consider alternative forums for 
international aviation negotiations and agreements in which 
we can obtain the necessary broad access rights. We should 
examine the feasibility of achieving multilateral air 
service agreements among trading partners. Although such 
negotiations may be more complex and difficult because of 
the number of parties involved, they should be undertaken 
when they present a reasonable prospect for further 
liberalization.

<TEXT>
 

Moreover, some governments are taking steps to enhance their 
airlines' position both by restricting the development of 
new, competitive services and by trying to overcome, through 
government fiat, their carriers' cost disadvantages that 
make it difficult for them to compete against U.S. airlines 
in a free market. These efforts underlie many of the 
disputes we face in international negotiations today. 
Such countries are responding to the highly competitive 
integrated and global air transportation market, in which 
their airlines may not be fully prepared to compete. Most 
foreign airlines are only beginning to adapt to the more 
competitive operating environment through such mechanisms as 
streamlining costs and realigning their operations to 
achieve greater productivity and operating economies. For 
state-owned airlines, privatization is an important initial 
step as it will lead those airlines to develop 
cost-efficient operations and, in the longer term, to expand 
their markets. These governments also may be reacting to 
the U.S. airlines' recent operating successes in the 
international aviation market, which are largely 
attributable to the U.S. airlines' productivity and 
competitive gains. 
Some national governments continue to give their national 
airlines financial aid. Some also distort the marketplace 
by permitting their national airlines to maintain 
ground-handling and other monopolies, by denying airlines 
access to necessary airport facilities, or 
by allowing user fees that equalize cost differentials 
between carriers. These actions distort competition and 
deprive the aviation system and consumers of the benefits 
that greater cost efficiency and lower prices would 
encourage. In the long run, these efforts will work against 
the overall best interest of the world economy. Moreover, 
they will be unsuccessful in providing long-term protection 
against the developing global aviation systems because no 
individual government can control all facets of its 
airlines' marketplace. 


U.S. Objectives


We have outlined above our expectations about the future of 
the world air transportation industry and the role of U.S. 
airlines. We expect that international operations will 
depend more on traffic flows from multiple countries. In 
light of our goals, recent developments in the market and 
industry, and the positions and actions of our trading 
partners, we have designed our international aviation 
strategy to meet the following objectives: 
 Increase the variety of price and service options 
available to consumers. 
 Enhance the access of U.S. cities to the international 
air transportation system. 
 Provide carriers with unrestricted opportunities to 
develop types of service and systems based on their 
assessment of marketplace demand:



_These opportunities should include unrestricted 
rights for airlines to operate between international 
gateways by way of any point and beyond to any point, 
at the discretion of airline management. Carriers 
should be able to pursue both direct service using 
their own equipment and indirect service through 
commercial relationships with other carriers; 
_Service opportunities should not be restricted in 
any manner, such as restrictions on frequencies, 
capacity or equipment, so that carriers may provide 
levels of service commensurate to market demand; 
_Carriers' ability to set prices should also be 
unrestricted to create maximum incentives for cost 
efficiencies and to provide consumers with the 
benefits of price competition and lower fares; 
_These opportunities should apply not only to 
scheduled services, but also to cargo and charter 
opportunities, because of their growing importance to 
the world's economy.

 

 Ensure that competition is fair and the playing field 
is level by eliminating marketplace distortions, such 
as government subsidies, restrictions on carriers' 
ability to conduct their own operations and 
ground-handling, and unequal access to infrastructure, 
facilities, or marketing channels. 
 Encourage the development of the most cost-effective 
and productive air transportation industry that will be 
best equipped to compete in the global aviation 
marketplace at all levels and with all types of 
service:

 

_Infrastructure needs should be addressed and 
unnecessary regulatory barriers eliminated. 
_Privately held airlines have better incentives to 
reduce costs and respond to public demand. 
Therefore, as we have in the past, we will be 
supportive of governments wishing to privatize their 
airlines so that their privatization efforts will be 
successful; and 
_Reduce barriers to the creation of global aviation 
systems such as limitations on cross-border 
investments wherever possible.

Plan of Action 



We recognize that considerable time and effort will be required to achieve an open aviation regime worldwide. We can
get there by making a concerted effort to eliminate the obstacles to that regime and by taking a more strategic and long-term
approach to our overall international aviation policies. At a minimum, we must increase our focus on emerging markets
and their contribution to global networks; build a coalition of like-minded trading partners committed to the principles
of free trade in aviation services; work closely with our trading partners to address their concerns; develop new
incentives for encouraging market reform, such as increased opportunities for cross-border investment in airlines;
and devise alternatives to the bilateral aviation system for achieving our objectives. We are launching our new initiatives
to create freer trade in aviation services by taking the following steps: 

 Extend invitations to enter into open aviation agreements to a group of countries that share our liberalization
vision and offer important flow traffic potential for our carriers even though they may have limited Third and Fourth
Freedom traffic potential. This would assist the development of global systems and increase the momentum for further
worldwide liberalization. 

 Give priority to building aviation relationships between the United States and potential growth areas in
Asia, South America and Central Europe. This recognizes the importance of these trading partners and the need to provide
air transportation to support those developing trade markets. It will also make available new markets to build global
networks. 

 Renew efforts to achieve liberal agreements with trading partners with which our aviation relationships
lag behind those of our general trade advancements, such as Canada and the United Kingdom. 

 Emphasize the importance of economic analysis in developing policies and strategies for achieving our overall
aviation goals. This will enable us to remain focused on the overall strategic objectives, understand developments
in the industry and market, and plan for the future. 

 Seek changes in U.S. airline foreign investment law, if necessary, to enable us to obtain our trading partners'
agreements to liberal arrangements. 

 Increase our efforts to reach out to Congress and constituent groups, such as consumers, multinational corporations
(aircraft manufacturers, telecommunications, travel and hotel industries), cities, airlines, labor and travel
agents to learn their anticipated needs over a 3-5 year period. This will provide us with valuable information
for developing our positions, as well as enlisting their support in pushing for greater liberalization. 

 Establish stronger connections with U.S. government agencies whose functions are to promote U.S. business
and trade interests (

e.g., 

Department of Commerce and the Export/Import Bank) to ensure that we share a single vision of the future global marketplace.

Given the diverse positions of our trading partners and their varying degrees of willingness to liberalize aviation
relations, we must also have a strategy for dealing with countries that are not prepared or willing to join us in moving
quickly to an unrestricted air service regime. Our approach is a practical one: it proposes to advance the liberalization
of air service regimes as far as our partners are willing to go, and to withhold benefits from those countries that are
not willing to move forward. Specifically, we will pursue the following strategy: 

1. We will offer liberal agreements to a country or group of countries if it can be justified economically or strategically.
We will view economic value more broadly than we have in the past, in terms of both direct and indirect access and in terms
of potential future development. Moreover, there may be strategic value in adopting liberal agreements with smaller
countries where doing so puts competitive pressure on neighboring countries to follow suit. 

2. We recognize that some countries believe that they can resist the trend of economic forces and continue to control
access to their markets tightly. We believe that they cannot, and that attempts to do so will ultimately fail. Nevertheless,
we will work with these countries to develop alternatives that address their immediate concerns where this will advance
our international aviation policy objectives. We will examine alternative approaches that may include departing
from established methods of negotiation (perhaps negotiations with two or more trading partners); try to develop
service opportunities for the foreign airline to make service to the U.S. more economically advantageous for it;
and continue our efforts to help those governments and their constituencies appreciate the benefits that unrestricted
air services can bring to their economies and industries. 

While we work with such countries, we can consider, in the interim, transitional or sectoral agreements. 



Transitional agreements

_Under this approach, we would agree to a specified phased removal of restrictions and liberalization of the air service
market. This approach contemplates that both sides would agree, from the beginning, to a completely liberalized
air service regime at the end of a certain period of time. 



Sectoral agreements

_Traditionally, aviation agreements have covered all elements of air transportation between two countries. However,
as a first step, we can consider agreements that eliminate restrictions only on services in specific aviation sectors,
such as air cargo or charter services. 


3. For countries that are not willing to advance liberalization of the market, we will maintain maximum leverage to
achieve our procompetitive objectives. We can limit their airlines' access to the U.S. market and restrict commercial
relations with U.S. airlines. When airlines request authority to serve restricted bilateral markets that is not
provided for under an international agreement, we will consider their requests on a case-by-case basis in light of
all our policy objectives, including, 

inter alia

: 

 Whether approval will increase the variety of pricing and service options available to consumers; 

 Whether approval will improve the access of cities, shippers and travelers to the international air transportation
system; 

 The effect of the proposed transaction on the U.S. airline industry and its employees. In this regard, we will
ascribe greater value to code-sharing arrangements where U.S. airlines provide the long-haul operations. We will
also recognize the greater economic value of such arrangements where the services connect one hub to another; and


 Whether the transaction will advance our goals of eliminating operating and market restrictions and achieving
liberalization. 

If aviation partners fail to observe existing U.S. bilateral rights, or discriminate against U.S. airlines, we will
act vigorously, through all appropriate means, to defend our rights and protect our airlines. 



Conclusion 



We are living through a period in which international aviation rules must change. Privatization, competition, and
globalization are trends fueled by economic and political forces that will ultimately prevail. Governments and
airlines that embrace these trends will far outpace those that do not. The U.S. government will be among those that
embrace the future.

 Notice of final priority. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces a final priority to provide a competitive preference to applications funded under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) that serve communities that have been designated as Empowerment Zones or
Enterprise Communities under section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by title XIII of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. This priority is intended to focus resources on the needs of infants, toddlers, children,
and youth with disabilities and their families who live in these communities and who are often underserved. For 1995,
the Secretary anticipates using this priority with competitions for Parent Training and Information Centers under
the Training Personnel for the Education of Children and Youth with Disabilities program, and Outreach Projects
under the Early Education for Children with Disabilities program. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 26, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priority for projects funded under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38082). 




The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program is a critical element of the Administration's community revitalization
strategy. The program is a first step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities and rural
heartlands. It is designed to empower people and communities by inspiring Americans to work together to create jobs
and opportunity. 

Under this program, the Federal Government will designate up to nine areas as Empowerment Zones and up to 95 areas as
Enterprise Communities in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 1391, as amended by title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66). To be eligible for designation, an area must be nominated
by one or more local governments and the State or States in which it is located or by a State-Chartered Economic Development
Corporation. A nominated area must be one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress, and must have
a poverty rate of not less than the level specified in section 1392 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

In the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, communities have been invited to submit strategic plans
that comprehensively address how the community would link economic development with education and training as well
as how community development, public safety, human services, and environmental initiatives will together support
sustainable communities. Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be designated by the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) based on the quality of their strategic plans.
Designated areas will receive Federal grant funds and substantial tax benefits and will have access to other Federal
programs. (For additional information on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, contact HUD at
1-800-998-9999.) 

The Department of Education is supporting the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative in a variety
of ways. It is encouraging Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities to use funds they already receive from Department
of Education programs (including Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Drug-Free
Schools and Community Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education
Act) to support the comprehensive vision of their strategic plans. The Department of Education also intends to give
preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in a number of discretionary grant programs that are
well-suited for inclusion in a comprehensive approach to economic and community development. In addition to the
programs under IDEA, the Department intends to give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
in the Rehabilitation Act Projects with Industry program, the Rehabilitation Act Special Demonstration Projects
program, the Urban Community Service program, and a variety of discretionary programs under the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act. 

The discretionary programs funded under IDEA are well suited to play a role in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
because of the close relationship between poverty and disabilities. While the risk factors associated with disabilities
are highest in low income areas, these areas often serve the lowest numbers of children with disabilities. Under the
authority of IDEA, the Department supports a wide range of programs related to providing special education, related,
and early intervention services to infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities and their families.
Coordinated and comprehensive approaches to services, such as those under the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community
program, can be effective tools in addressing the needs of these children. 

For FY 1995, the Secretary expects to use this priority in conjunction with priorities under the following programs:


Parent Training and Information Centers (funded under IDEA Part D, Training Personnel for Education of Children
and Youth with Disabilities program); and Outreach Projects (funded under IDEA Part C, Early Education for Children
with Disabilities program).

<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00193 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00105 </PARENT>

Parent Training and Information Centers projects provide training and information to parents of infants, toddlers,
children, and youth with disabilities, and to persons who work with parents to enable parents to participate more
fully and effectively with professionals in meeting the educational needs of their children with disabilities.


Outreach projects build the capacity of educational and other agencies to adopt and implement proven models and components
of models to improve services for children under the age of eight with disabilities and their families. 






Note: 

This notice of final priority does not solicit applications. Notices inviting applications under these competitions
are published in a separate notice in this issue of the 

Federal Register

. 




On July 26, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priority in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38082). The comments, and the Secretary's responses to them, are discussed in appendix 1 to this notice. A listing
of areas for which applications have been made for designation as Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities is
contained in appendix 2. 



Priority 



Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(2) the Secretary gives a competitive preference to applications that are otherwise eligible
for funding under appropriate discretionary programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and
that meet the following priority. The Secretary will implement this priority for fiscal year 1995 and may implement
it for any later fiscal year: 

Propose to provide services to one or more Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities that are designated within
the areas served by projects. To meet this priority an applicant must indicate that it will: 

 Design a program that includes special activities focused on the unique needs of one or more Empowerment Zones
or Enterprises Communities; or, 

 Devote a substantial portion of program resources to providing services within, or meeting the needs of residents
of these zones and communities. 


As appropriate, the proposed project under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act must contribute to the
strategic plan of the Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities and be made an integral component of the Empowerment
Zone or Enterprise Community activities. 

Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities are not expected to be designated by the time proposals must be prepared
for fiscal year 1995 competitions. In order to obtain a competitive preference under this priority for FY 1995, applicants
must choose one of the following options. First, an applicant may indicate that it will serve a specific area or areas
that have applied for designations as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities within the geographic area that
the applicant proposes to serve. Alternatively, the applicant may simply state that it would serve one or more Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities that may be designated within the geographic area that the applicant proposes to
serve. In the first case, additional points will be awarded only if one or more of the areas specified in the application
are designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities. In the second case, additional points will be awarded
only if one or more Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities are designated within the geographic area that the
project proposes to serve. 



Intergovernmental Review 



One or more of the programs that may be affected by this priority are subject to the requirements of Executive Order
12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental
partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination
and review of proposed Federal financial assistance. 

In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for these programs.

Appendix 1_Analysis of Comments and Changes 


In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priority, 14 parties submitted comments. Six
of the 14 commenters generally supported the priority. The 8 remaining commenters objected to the priority for a variety
of reasons. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the proposed priority follows. Technical and other minor
changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are
not addressed. 


Comment:

 Six commenters expressed concern that services would be reduced for families in general that are not located in Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities, or that poor, isolated, and underserved populations not included in these areas
would receive fewer services. Most of these commenters also did not see a relationship between the purposes of IDEA
programs and the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. 


Discussion:

 The discretionary programs funded under IDEA program are well suited to play a role in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise
Communities because of the close relationship between poverty and disabilities. Because residents of low income
areas are often underserved, an important goal of the IDEA discretionary programs is to improve services for this
population. Providing preferences for applications serving Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will
assist in meeting this goal. While the risk factors associated with disabilities are highest in low income areas,
these areas often serve the lowest numbers of children with disabilities. In addition, the coordinated and comprehensive
approaches to services, such as those under the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, can be effective
tools in addressing the needs of these children. The priority is expected to both target resources on areas of greatest
need and to increase the effective use of resources. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comment:

 Three commenters were concerned that the competitive preference would lead to some areas not receiving any services
because they would not be able to compete effectively with applicants serving Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities.
This comment was made most often with regard to the Parent Training and Information Center (PTI) program, which is
intended to ensure coverage of services throughout the States to the greatest extent possible, and from small States.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that it is important in some programs to serve all areas of the country. Specifically, with regard
to the PTI program, section 631(e)(4)(A) of IDEA and regulations at 34 CFR 316.24 place a priority on projects that
ensure widespread geographic coverage. 


Changes:

 While no change is being made in this priority, a 15-point competitive preference will be given to applications under
the Parent Training and Information Centers competition that would provide parent training and information in a
State that would be unserved by an existing PTI center in 1995. The Secretary believes that this additional competitive
preference will help ensure that all areas of the country receive services. This competitive preference is announced
in the Notice inviting applications that is published separately in this issue of the 

Federal Register

. 


Comment:

 One commenter indicated that the priority would give grant applications from Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
priority for funding. 


Discussion:

 The priority would give applications proposing to serve Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities priority
for funding, not applications from the zones and communities themselves. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comment:

 Two commenters proposed replacing the competitive preference with a requirement that Parent Training and Information
Center applicants be required to consult and collaborate with the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
on activities which would serve families of children with disabilities who are poor, unemployed or in general distress.



Discussion:

 Parent Training and Information Centers are already required to collaborate with other agencies that would include
Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comment:

 One commenter noted that designation of the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities would not occur until later
this year and the information would not be available for applicants in time for this competition. The commenter suggested
postponing action until fiscal year 1996. 


Discussion:

 It is important to begin links between IDEA programs and Empowerment Zones and Enterprise communities as early as
possible. However, the Department agrees that much of the pertinent information will not be available to applicants
at the time their applications are prepared. Depending on the timing of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community
designations, applicants will not know the designations for Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities at the
time they prepare their proposals. 


Changes:

 The priority has been revised to indicate that, in order to obtain the competitive preference, applicants must propose
to provide services to one or more Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities that are designated within the areas
served by projects. If no zones or communities are designated within an applicant's proposed project areas, applicants
would not receive the competitive preference. 


Comment:

 Two commenters indicated a concern that the competitive preference would interfere with the ability of projects
to serve children with disabilities and their families in accordance with the intent of IDEA, because of conflicts
with the multiple purposes of the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities that emphasize economic development.



Discussion:

 While the scope of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative is significantly broader than that of
IDEA, the Secretary does not believe that there is a fundamental conflict between the purposes or operation of IDEA
programs and the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. However, it is important to clarify that project
activities are limited to carrying out the purpose of IDEA and do not extend to broader purposes of the Empowerment
Zones and Enterprise Communities that extend beyond IDEA. Language in the priority states that projects must contribute
to the strategic plan of the Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities and be made an integral component of the Empowerment
Zone or Enterprise Community activities. This language might incorrectly be construed to require projects to participate
in activities that are not consistent with IDEA, or that are inappropriate or infeasible within the context of a particular
IDEA program. For example, an Outreach project under the Early Education for Children with Disabilities program
that serves the entire Nation would find it infeasible to become an integral part of the activities of 104 Empowerment
Zones and Enterprise Communities. 


Changes:

 In order to clarify that projects activities related to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities must be appropriate
within the context of IDEA while participating in broader community empowerment strategies, the words ``as appropriate''
have also been added with regard to the inclusion of the projects in the planning and activities of the Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities.

 This notice contains five priorities under the Educational Media Research, Production, Distribution, and Training
Program authorized under Part F of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The purposes of the program
are to promote the general welfare of deaf and hard of hearing individuals and individuals with visual impairments,
and to promote the educational advancement of individuals with disabilities.



The priorities in this notice would ensure the continued availability of closed-captioned daytime television programming.
In addition, the priorities would support activities that provide cultural experiences to enrich the lives of deaf
and hard-of-hearing individuals, including children and youth, as well as adults. The priorities would provide
educational reading materials and textbooks on audiotape to persons who are visually or print disabled.

Additional priorities would support a captioned films and videos distribution system to provide hearing impaired
and other qualified individuals with access to captioned educational and general interest films and videos on a nonprofit
free loan basis, and video description of national television programming in order to make television more accessible
to persons with visual impairments.

This program supports the National Education Goals by assisting those with disabilities in school readiness and
adult literacy.

On July 28, 1994 the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38516).






Note:

 This notice of final priorities does 

not

 solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under these competitions is published in a separate notice
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.



Analysis of Comments and Changes



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priorities, seven parties submitted comments.
An analysis of the comments and of changes in the priorities since publication of the notice of the proposed priorities
follows. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make
under applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.



General





Comment:

 Three commenters expressed general support for all of the proposed priorities. Two of the three had additional comments
as follows under respective priorities.



Proposed Absolute Priority 1_Closed-Captioned Daytime Television Programs





Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the priority for Closed-Captioned Daytime Television Programs be modified to require
by law that television networks caption all television programming.



Discussion:

 Priorities cannot be used to impose mandates on third parties such as television networks.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that private sector support for daytime programming should be required while another commenter
indicated that a targeted level of private sector funding should not be required for the first project year.



Discussion:

 The Secretary cannot require private sector funding for captioning of television programming. However, projects
are encouraged to seek any support that might become available.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter expressed a concern that the priority should be defined in such a way as to not give undue competitive
advantage to nonprofit organizations.



Discussion:

 The priority as written gives no competitive advantage to nonprofit organizations.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter indicated that significant weight should be given to consumer preference and how effectively that
preference is measured.

<PARENT> FR941107-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges the importance of consumer preference and believes that the issue of consumer preference
is adequately addressed in the priority. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter expressed a concern that cost-effectiveness should be weighed heavily in the criteria. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that sufficient weight is given to cost effectiveness. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter indicated an interest in support for closed-captioned basic cable television programming. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes the importance of access to programs shown on local stations, national commercial and public
broadcast networks, as well as syndicated and cable programs shown nationally. In making awards the Secretary will
continue to support the closed-captioning of basic cable television programming under existing priorities. 



Change:

 The priority has been clarified by adding the word ``cable'' to part (6) of the project requirements. 

(6) Demonstrate the willingness of major national television networks and 

cable

 companies to permit captioning of their programs; and 



Comment:

 One commenter urged the Department to make more than one award in order to generate private section support. 



Discussion:

 In announcing proposed priorities, the Secretary does not establish numbers of awards for projects. Information
about anticipated number of awards will be provided when the Secretary invites applications for specific competitions.




Changes:

 None. 



Proposed Absolute Priority 2_Cultural Experience for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals 





Comment:

 Two commenters jointly recommended that the priority be expanded to include both school and community based educational
interventions. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges the value of intervention at the school and community levels. The Secretary believes
that this topic should be addressed under other IDEA program authorities. 



Changes:

 None. 



Proposed Absolute Priority 3_Captioned Films and Video Distribution System 





Comment:

 One commenter suggested that distribution, outreach and circulation methods incorporate recommendations which
grow out of the soon-to-be awarded Department of Education grant to hold a symposium on the future of captioning. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary deems it improper to mention recommendations that are yet to be made. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the annual meeting of depository managers and other related personnel should include
representatives from the major educational media distribution companies. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary appreciates the commenter's suggestion. Although not a requirement under this priority, the Secretary
encourages applicants to consider this as a viable option. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter proposed that the priorities include a mandate to study alternative Captioned Films and Video (CFV)
catalog and delivery systems, and that a national survey of consumer needs be conducted. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that a study of alternative approaches and strategies is important to assure that we are making
best use of our resources in serving our constituents. We expect that recommendations from the upcoming symposium
on the future of captioning will provide us with suggested alternate approaches as information on consumer needs.




Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter proposed that a study be required to explore ways in which the CFV catalog might also incorporate information
regarding captioned materials available from sources other than the CFV network. 



Discussion:

 It is not the intent of this priority to advertise materials other than those we distribute through the CFV program.




Changes:

 None.

Proposed Absolute Priority 4_Recorded Audio Cassettes for Visually and Print Disabled Students 





Comment:

 One commenter proposed that the priority be expanded to include the research and development, production, and distribution
of books in computerized form (electronic digital text files). The commenter also suggested that the priority consider
for funding the ``establishment of a national Clearinghouse for post-secondary education materials in audio and
digital text form'' and the ``establishment of a national repository of electronic text files for accessible text
format.'' 



Discussion:

 The suggested activities go beyond the purpose of the priority announced under section 652(d) of IDEA and are not included
within the activities authorized under this section. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 The commenter suggested inserting professional as one of the classifications under ``students'' to be served. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary feels that by adding professionals to the population of students to be served under this priority would
be going beyond the intent of this project, as originally visioned. 



Change:

 None. 



Proposed Absolute Priority 5_Video Description Project 





Comment:

 One commenter recommended that funds be made available for the description of programming designed specifically
for 
classroom instruction or broadcast programs, particularly documentaries, that will be distributed to educational
institutions. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that general access to national television programming is of greater importance at this time.
However, the type of programs to be described under this priority may include programming that can be used for classrooms.




Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the Department should encourage distribution of video described programming through
public and educational libraries. 



Discussion:

 The Department believes that the most effective use of resources is to concentrate on national television programming
at this time. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter expressed the concern that outreach was not identified as an important goal in the priority for video
description. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that outreach (marketing and dissemination) is a necessary component to approved projects
for video description. All applications submitted to the Secretary under this priority are evaluated under the established
evaluation criteria at 34 CFR 332.32, which includes information related to marketing and dissemination. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that private sector support for video description should be encouraged but not required.




Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes the importance of private sector support, although he cannot require it in this priority.




Changes:

 None. 



Priorities



Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute 
preference to applications that meet the following priorities. The Secretary funds under these competitions only
applications that meet one of these absolute priorities: 



Absolute Priority 1_Closed-Captioned Daytime Television Programs 



Background



This priority would continue and expand closed-captioning of a variety of daytime television programs broadcast
nationally for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing during this segment of the day that has proven to be the most difficult
in terms of private sector support. 



Priority:

 To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_ 

(1) Include the criteria used to determine which programs are proposed for captioning. These criteria must take into
account the preference of consumers for particular programs, the diversity of programming available, and the contribution
of programs to the general educational and cultural experiences of individuals with hearing impairments; 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00208 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Determine the total number of hours and the projected cost per hour for each program to be captioned; 

(3) For each proposed program to be captioned, identify the source of private or other public support and the projected
dollar amount of that support; 

(4) Identify the methods of captioning to be used for each hour and the projected cost per hour for each method used;


(5) Provide and maintain back-up systems that would ensure successful, timely captioning service; 

(6) Demonstrate the willingness of major national television networks and cable companies to permit captioning
of their programs; and 

(7) Implement procedures for monitoring the extent to which full and accurate captioning is provided and use this
information to make refinements in captioning operations. 



Absolute Priority 2_Cultural Experiences for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals 



Background




This priority supports a variety of cultural activities designed to enrich the lives of deaf and hard of hearing individuals,
including children and youth, as well as adults. These activities must use an integrated approach that mixes children,
youth, and adults, who are deaf and hard of hearing with those who can hear while conducting cultural experiences that
will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and
intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. 

During FY 1992 the Department funded projects that: (1) Provided theatrical experiences for deaf and hard of hearing
individuals, and (2) used integrated approaches by having among 
cast members a mixture of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing performers. During FY 1993 cultural experiences were extended
specifically to younger people with hearing impairments and to the creation of art as well as theatrical experiences,
using the same approaches. Projects under this proposed priority can include a variety of artistic approaches such
as the creation of works of art (painting, drawing, designing, etc.), dance, and storytelling, as well as developing
and performing dramatic productions. A grantee 

may not 

use funds under this priority for passive activities such as viewing a play or video, or passively watching a storyteller
or artist at work. 



Priority




To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_ 

(1) Use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults who are deaf and hard of hearing, with those who
are hearing in carrying out project activities; and 

(2) Develop and implement strategies that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other
hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including
children, youth, and adults. Outreach activities such as promoting the project to schools, community organizations,
news media, and relevant national organizations are encouraged. 



Invitational Priority 



Within this absolute priority 2, the Secretary is particularly interested in applications that meet the following
invitational priority. However, pursuant to 34 CFR 75.105(c)(i), an application that meets this invitational priority
does not receive competitive or absolute preference over applications that do not meet this priority: 

Projects that include people from a variety of cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. 



Absolute Priority 3_Captioned Films and Videos Distribution System 



Background




This priority would support the operation of a captioned films/videos distribution system which provides deaf and
hard of hearing individuals, as well as other eligible individuals with disabilities, with access to captioned educational
and general interest films and videos on a nonprofit free-loan basis. Activities under this priority include, but
are not limited to: (1) A computerized user-registration process; (2) circulation of captioned films and videos;
(3) development or updating of a catalog of captioned films and videos in the collection; and (4) outreach activities.
This priority would provide students and other eligible individuals with disabilities with captioned films and
videos so they may benefit from the same educational media used to enrich the educational experiences of students
and other individuals who do not have disabilities. 



Priority




To be considered for funding under this priority, the project must_

(1) Develop strategies and procedures to be implemented in operating a distribution system, consisting of local
and regional centers including depositories, and one central general interest and educational films/video center.
Local and regional centers may include State schools for disabled individuals, public or private school systems,
public libraries, colleges or universities, or other distribution points that distribute captioned films/videos.


(2) Ensure that the system permits interdepository circulation of captioned films/videos, allows individuals,
depositories, and local and regional centers to access booking information from the computerized depositories
and the general interest and educational films/video center via modem and 

generic 

communication software, and provides immediate confirmation or denial of a request; 

(3) Establish and describe the computerized registration procedures that will be used to register users. The current
computerized system configuration may be used as a basis; 

(4) Develop and implement criteria and procedures for replacing irreparable films/videos;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941107-2-00209 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941107-2-00109 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Prepare, update, and distribute copies of a catalog listing all captioned films/videos available under this
project, including copies of the lesson guides as they become available; 

(6) Convene an annual meeting of depository managers, librarians, and audiovisual and other personnel from local,
regional, and State education agencies for the purpose of training, planning, sharing, brainstorming, and other
activities related to improving the access of eligible individuals to audiovisual materials. The Washington, D.C.
metropolitan area will be the site of the meeting; 

(7) Implement outreach activities, especially activities that reach out to local school systems to make them aware
of the open and closed captioned materials that are available to them under this program and from other sources; and


(8) Submit quarterly progress reports to the grants and project officers. 



Absolute Priority 4_Recorded Audio Cassettes for Visually and Print Disabled Students 



Background 



This priority would support recording, producing, duplicating, and distributing 15/16 ips (inch per second) four-track
cassette versions of textbooks and other educational reading materials for students (elementary, secondary, postsecondary
& graduate) who are visually or print disabled. These cassette tapes will help provide equal educational opportunities
to target students and lessen some of the barriers they face in classrooms. 



Priority 



To be considered for funding under this priority, the project must_


(1) Handle all requests for materials, including confirmation of eligibility by disability; 

(2) Arrange for use of copyrights from publishers of supplied textbooks; 

(3) Record or duplicate the books on 15/16 ips (inch per second), four-track cassettes of one hour per track recording
time. (Publishers must be provided rights to copies of the master tape and rights to market the cassettes as they see
fit); 

(4) Mail the cassettes on a free-loan, postage paid basis; 

(5) Handle returned cassettes, preservative re-recording, and all other associated administrative and circulation
functions; and 

(6) To the extent that funds are not sufficient to meet the demand for free materials, place a priority on providing
free materials that are not otherwise required to be provided by educational agencies or institutions. 



Absolute Priority 5_Video Description Project 



Background 



This priority supports the description of national television programming in order to make television more accessible
to persons with visual impairments. The intent of this priority is to provide access to a diversity of programming
available in order to enhance shared educational, social, and cultural experiences for persons who are visually
impaired. The range of programs proposed for description may include, but is not limited to, children's programs,
prime time programming, emergency broadcasts, sports programs, and documentaries. 



Priority 



To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_

(1) For selecting programs to be video described, include criteria that take into account the preference of consumers
for particular programs, the diversity of programming available, and the contribution of programs to the general
educational, social, and cultural experience of individuals with visual impairments; 

(2) Determine the total number of hours and the projected cost per hour for each program to be described; 

(3) For each program to be described, identify the source of private or other public support, if any, and the projected
dollar amount of that support; 

(4) Identify the methods to be used in the provision of described video; 

(5) Demonstrate the willingness of major national television networks and cable companies to permit video description
of their programs; and 

(6) Implement procedures for monitoring the extent to which an accurate description is provided and use this information
to make refinements in the video description operations. 



Intergovernmental Review 



This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Economic Development Administration (EDA) announces the policies and the application procedures for economic
adjustment assistance as authorized by Public Law 103-211. These funds are designed to support the emergency
requirements of economic adjustment assistance for local communities arising from the consequences of the January
17, 1994, earthquake in Southern California.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Buy American-Made Equipment or Products




Applicants are hereby notified that they are encouraged, to the extent feasible, to purchase American-made equipment
and products with funding provided under this program in accordance with Congressional intent as set forth in the
resolution contained in Public Law 103-121, Sections 606 (a) and (b).


Refer to the Notice published on March 30, 1994, in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14996) for information on EDA's general policies and other requirements. 




Authority




Support for this program is authorized under the contingency fund provided to the President under Public Law 103-211,
the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994.




Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA)



The Special Economic Development and Adjustment Assistance Program_Long-Term Economic Deterioration (LTED)
and Sudden and Severe Economic Dislocation (SSED) is listed under CFDA 11.307.




Program Objectives




Funds will be used for the creation of a local Infrastructure Development Fund that will make funds available to repair
or upgrade local infrastructure damaged by the earthquake which is not eligible for Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) assistance. The Infrastructure Development Fund will be capitalized by EDA and will be administered
by the City of Los Angeles and other local jurisdictions. These funds will be used to leverage existing financing through
matching grants, loans, and subordinated debt. Local communities will identify the infrastructure projects to
receive assistance. Eligible projects would include earthquake damaged non-public infrastructure ineligible
for FEMA assistance, such as a privately-owned water system, and repair projects in which it makes economic sense
to upgrade the infrastructure beyond pre-earthquake specifications.


Additional program objectives are described in the 

Federal Register

 of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15005) announcing the policies and application procedures for EDA's Fiscal Year 1994 programs.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice is a request for review and comment of the draft Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals. The
Guideline consists of two parts, ``Evolution of Isolation Practices'' and ``Recommendations for Isolation Precautions
in Hospitals,'' and was prepared by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and the
National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID), CDC. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document updates and replaces the previously published CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals
(Infect Control 1983;4:245-325, Am J Infect Control 1984;12:103-163, and HHS Publ. No. [CDC] 83-8314).
Part I, ``Evolution of Isolation Practices,'' reviews the evolution of isolation practices in U.S. hospitals including
their advantages, disadvantages, and controversial aspects and provides the background for the HICPAC-consensus
recommendations contained in Part II, ``Recommendations for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals.'' 


HICPAC was established in 1991 to provide advice and guidance to the Secretary, DHHS; the Assistant Secretary for
Health, DHHS; the Director, CDC; and the Director, NCID, regarding the practice of hospital infection control and
strategies for surveillance, prevention, and control of nosocomial infections in U.S. hospitals. The committee
also advises the CDC on periodic updating of guidelines and other policy statements regarding prevention of nosocomial
infections. 
The Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals is the second of a series of CDC guidelines being revised by HICPAC
and NCID, CDC.

Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals 



Executive Summary 



The Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals was revised to meet the following objectives: (1) to be epidemiologically
sound, (2) to recognize the importance of all body fluids, secretions, and excretions in the transmission of nosocomial
pathogens, (3) to contain adequate precautions for infections transmitted by the airborne, droplet, and contact
routes of transmission, (4) to be as simple and user friendly as possible, and (5) to use new terms to avoid confusion
with existing infection control and isolation systems. 

The revised guideline contains two tiers of precautions. In the first, and most important, tier are those precautions
designed for the care of all patients in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. Implementation
of these ``Standard Precautions'' is the primary strategy for successful nosocomial infection control. In the second
tier are precautions designed only for the care of specified patients. These additional ``Transmission-based Precautions''
are used for patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important pathogens
that can be transmitted by airborne or droplet transmission or by contact with dry skin or contaminated surfaces.


Standard Precautions synthesize the major features of Universal (Blood and Body Fluid) Precautions (designed to
reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens) and Body Substance Isolation (designed to reduce the risk
of transmission of pathogens from moist body substances). Standard Precautions apply to (1) blood, (2) all body fluids,
secretions, and excretions regardless of whether or not they contain visible blood, (3) nonintact skin, and (4) mucous
membranes. Standard Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from both recognized
and unrecognized sources of infection in hospitals. 

Transmission-based Precautions are designed for patients documented or suspected to be infected or colonized with
highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens for which additional precautions beyond Standard
Precautions are needed to interrupt transmission in hospitals. There are three types of Transmission-based Precautions:
Airborne Precautions, Droplet Precautions, and Contact Precautions. They may be combined together for diseases
that have multiple routes of transmission. When used either singularly or in combination, they are to be used in addition
to Standard Precautions. 

The revised guideline also lists specific clinical syndromes or conditions in both adult and pediatric patients
that are highly suspicious for infection and identifies appropriate Transmission-based Precautions to use on an
empiric, temporary basis until a diagnosis can be made; these empiric, temporary precautions are also to be used in
addition to Standard Precautions. 

A working draft of this guideline was reviewed by experts in infection control. However, all recommendations in the
guideline may not reflect the opinions of all reviewers. 



Introduction 



To assist hospitals in maintaining up-to-date isolation practices, HICPAC1 has updated the CDC recommendations
for isolation precautions for use in hospitals. The recommendations are based on the latest epidemiologic information
on transmission of infection in hospitals; they supersede previous CDC recommendations for isolation precautions
for use in hospitals.

2-4



The recommendations are intended primarily for use in the care of patients in acute-care hospitals, although some
of the recommendations may be applicable for some patients receiving care in extended-care facilities. The recommendations
are not intended for use in day care, well care, or domiciliary care programs. Because (1) there have been few studies
to test the efficacy of isolation precautions, and (2) gaps still exist in the knowledge of the epidemiology and modes
of transmission of some diseases, disagreement with some of the recommendations is expected. 

HICPAC recognizes that the goal of preventing transmission of infections in hospitals can be accomplished by multiple
means, and that hospitals will modify the recommendations according to their needs and circumstances and as directed
by federal, state, or local regulations. Modification of the recommendations is encouraged if (1) the principles
of epidemiology and disease transmission are maintained, and (2) precautions are included to interrupt spread of
infection by all routes that are likely to be encountered in the hospital. 



Part I. Evolution of Isolation Practices 



Early Isolation Practices 



The first published recommendations for isolation precautions in the United States appeared as early as 1877, when
a hospital handbook recommended placing patients with infectious diseases in separate facilities,5 which ultimately
became known as infectious disease hospitals. Although this practice segregated infected patients from noninfected
patients, nosocomial transmission continued to occur because infected patients were not separated from each other
according to their disease, and few, if any, aseptic procedures were practiced. Personnel in infectious disease
hospitals began to combat problems of nosocomial transmission by setting aside a floor or ward for patients with similar
diseases6 and by practicing aseptic procedures recommended in nursing textbooks published from 1890 to 1900.5

In 1910, isolation practices in U.S. hospitals were altered by the introduction of the cubicle system of isolation
which placed patients in multiple-bed wards.6 With the cubicle system, hospital personnel used separate gowns,
washed their hands with antiseptic solutions after patient contact, and disinfected objects contaminated by the
patient. These nursing procedures, designed to prevent transmission of pathogenic organisms to other patients
and personnel, became known as ``barrier nursing.'' Use of the cubicle system of isolation and barrier nursing procedures
provided general hospitals with an alternative to placing some patients in infectious disease hospitals. 
During the 1950s, U.S. infectious disease hospitals, except those designated exclusively for tuberculosis, began
to close. In the mid-1960s, tuberculosis hospitals also began to close, partly because general hospital or outpatient
treatment became preferred for patients with tuberculosis. Thus, by the late 1960s patients with infectious diseases
were housed in wards in general hospitals, either in specially designed, single-patient isolation rooms or in regular
single or multiple-patient rooms. 


CDC Isolation Systems 


CDC Isolation Manual 


In 1970, CDC published a detailed manual entitled 

Isolation Techniques for Use in Hospitals 

to assist general hospitals with isolation precautions;2 a revised edition appeared in 1975.3 The manual could be
applied in small community hospitals with limited resources as well as in large metropolitan university-associated
medical centers. 
The manual introduced the category system of isolation precautions. It recommended that hospitals use one of seven
isolation categories (Strict Isolation, Respiratory Isolation, Protective Isolation, Enteric Precautions,
Wound and Skin Precautions, Discharge Precautions, and Blood Precautions). The precautions recommended for each
category were determined almost entirely by the epidemiologic features of the diseases grouped in the category,
primarily their routes of transmission. Certain isolation techniques, believed to be the minimum necessary to prevent
transmission of all diseases in the category, were indicated for each isolation category. Because all diseases in
a category did not have the same epidemiology (i.e., were not spread by exactly the same combination of modes of transmission),
with some requiring fewer precautions than others, more precautions were suggested for some diseases than were necessary.
This disadvantage of ``over-isolation'' for some diseases was offset by the convenience of having a small number
of categories. More importantly, the simple system required personnel to learn only a few established routines for
applying isolation precautions. To make the system even more user friendly, instructions for each category were
printed on color-coded cards and placed on the doors, beds, and/or charts of patients on isolation precautions. 
By the mid-1970s, 93% of U.S. hospitals had adopted the isolation system recommended in the manual.7 However, neither
the efficacy of the category approach in preventing spread of infections nor the costs of using the system were evaluated
by empirical studies. 
By 1980, hospitals were experiencing new endemic and epidemic nosocomial infection problems, some caused by multidrug-resistant
microorganisms and others caused by newly recognized pathogens, which required different isolation precautions
from those specified by any existing isolation category. There was increasing need for isolation precautions to
be directed more specifically at nosocomial transmission in special-care units, rather than at the intrahospital
spread of infectious diseases acquired in the community.8 Infection control professionals and nursing directors
in hospitals with particularly sophisticated nursing staffs were increasingly calling for new isolation systems
that would tailor precautions to the modes of transmission for each infection and avoid the over-isolation inherent
in the category-specific approach. Further, new facts about the epidemiology and modes of transmission of some diseases
made it necessary for CDC to revise the isolation manual. Toward that end, during 1981-1983, CDC Hospital Infections
Program personnel consulted with infectious disease specialists in medicine, pediatrics, and surgery; hospital
epidemiologists; and infection control practitioners about revising the manual. 



CDC Isolation Guideline 



In 1983, the CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals4 (hereafter referred to as the isolation guideline)
was published to take the place of the 1975 isolation manual; it contained many important changes. One of the most important
was the increased emphasis on decision-making on the part of users. Unlike the 1975 manual, which encouraged few decisions
on the part of users, the isolation guideline encouraged decision-making at several levels.

9-10

 First, hospital infection control committees were given a choice of selecting between category-specific or disease-specific
isolation precautions or using the guideline to develop a unique isolation system appropriate to their hospital's
circumstances and environment. Second, personnel who placed a patient on isolation precautions were encouraged
to make decisions about the individual precautions to be taken, (e.g., whether the patient's age, mental status,
or condition indicated that a private room was needed to prevent sharing of contaminated articles). Third, personnel
taking care of patients on isolation precautions were encouraged to decide whether they needed to wear a mask, gown,
or gloves based on the likelihood of exposure to infective material. Such decisions were deemed necessary to isolate
the infection but not the patient and to reduce the costs associated with unnecessary isolation precautions.

In the category-specific section of the guideline, existing categories were modified, new categories were added,
and many infections were reassigned to different categories. The old category of Blood Precautions, primarily directed
toward patients with chronic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), was renamed Blood and Body Fluid Precautions and
expanded to include (1) patients with AIDS and (2) body fluids other than blood. The old category of Protective Isolation
was deleted because of studies demonstrating its lack of efficacy in general clinical practice in preventing the
acquisition of infection by the immunocompromised patient for whom it had originally been described.

11-12

 The 1983 guideline contained the following categories of isolation: Strict Isolation, Contact Isolation, Respiratory
Isolation, Tuberculosis (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) Isolation, Enteric Precautions, Drainage/Secretion Precautions,
and Blood and Body Fluid Precautions. As with the category approach in the former CDC isolation manuals, these categories
tended to over-isolate some patients. 
In the disease-specific section of the guideline, the epidemiology of each infectious disease was considered individually
by advocating only those precautions (e.g., private room, mask, gown, and gloves) needed to interrupt transmission
of the infection. In place of the categories and signs of the category-specific approach, a chart listed all diseases
posing the threat of in-hospital transmission with checks in columns indicating which precautions were required
for each. Because precautions were individualized for each disease, hospitals using the system were encouraged
to provide more initial training and in-service education and to encourage a much higher level of attention from patient-care
personnel. Although disease-specific isolation precautions eliminated ``over-isolation,'' personnel might
be prone to mistakes in applying the precautions, especially if the disease was not regularly seen in the hospital,

9-10

 if there was a delay in diagnosis, or if there was a misdiagnosis. Placing disease-specific isolation precautions
in a hospital computerized information system resulted in more accurate use of the system.13

Since gaps existed in the knowledge of the epidemiology of some diseases, disagreement was expected, and occurred,
regarding the placement of individual diseases within given categories, especially diseases with a respiratory
component of transmission.14 Placing measles in Respiratory Isolation (designed to prevent transmission of large-particle
droplets) rather than in a category that had provisions for preventing transmission by airborne droplet nuclei and
placing rubella and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in Contact Isolation were controversial.15 There
was also disagreement about the lack of a recommendation for adult patients with influenza, the need for a private
room for pediatric patients with RSV infections, and the length of time that precautions should be maintained.15
The lack of empiric studies on the efficacy and costs of implementing the recommendations contributed to the disagreements.


As new epidemiologic data became available, several subsequent CDC reports

16-18

 updated portions of the isolation guideline. Updated recommendations for management of patients with suspected
hemorrhagic fever were published in 1988.16 The recommendation for Respiratory Isolation for acute erythema infectiosum
was superseded by a 1989 report that recommended Respiratory Isolation for human parvovirus B19 (the causative agent
for erythema infectiosum) only when infected patients were in transient aplastic crisis or had immunodeficiency
and chronic human parvovirus B19 infection.17 

Recommendations for Tuberculosis (AFB) Isolation were updated in 199018 because of heightened concern about nosocomial
transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,

19-20

 particularly in settings where persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were receiving care.
The 1990 tuberculosis guidelines emphasized (1) placing a hospital patient with confirmed or suspected tuberculosis
in a private room that has lower, or negative, air pressure compared with surrounding areas, (2) reducing mycobacterial
contamination of air by dilution and removal of airborne contaminants, and (3) wearing particulate respirators,
rather than standard surgical masks, when hospital personnel shared air space with an infectious tuberculosis patient.
Subsequent recommendations reemphasized the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.21 In
1993, a second edition of the guidelines for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis in health care facilities
was published in draft for public comment.22 After review of written comments, the guidelines were modified and published.23




Universal Precautions 



In 1985, largely because of the HIV epidemic, isolation practices in the United States were dramatically altered
by the introduction of a new strategy for isolation precautions, which became known as Universal Precautions (UP).
Following the initial reports of hospital personnel becoming infected with HIV through needlesticks and skin contamination
with patients' blood, a widespread outcry created the urgent need for new isolation strategies to protect hospital
personnel from bloodborne infections. The subsequent modification of isolation precautions in some hospitals
produced several major strategic changes and sacrificed some measures of protection against patient-to-patient
transmission in the process of adding protection against patient-to-personnel transmission. In acknowledgment
of the fact that many patients with bloodborne infections are not recognized, the new UP approach placed emphasis
for the first time to applying Blood and Body Fluid Precautions universally to all persons regardless of their presumed
infection status.24 Until this time, most patients placed on isolation precautions were those for whom a diagnosis
of an infectious disease had been made or was suspected. This provision led to the new name of Universal Precautions.


In addition to emphasizing prevention of needlestick injuries and the use of traditional barriers such as gloves
and gowns, UP expanded Blood and Body Fluid Precautions to include use of masks and eye-coverings to prevent mucous
membrane exposures during certain procedures and the use of individual ventilation devices when the need for resuscitation
was predictable. This approach, and particularly the techniques for preventing mucous membrane exposures, was
reemphasized in subsequent CDC reports that contained recommendations for prevention of HIV transmission in health
care settings.

25-28



In 1987, one of these reports27 stated that implementation of UP for all patients eliminated the need for the isolation
category of Blood and Body Fluid Precautions for patients known or suspected to be infected with bloodborne pathogens;
however, the report stated that other category- or disease-specific isolation precautions recommended in the CDC
isolation guideline4 should be used as necessary if infections other than bloodborne infections were diagnosed
or suspected.
 
The 1987 report was updated by a 1988 report28 that emphasized two important points: (1) blood was the single most important
source of HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens in the occupational setting, and (2) infection control efforts
for preventing transmission of bloodborne pathogens in health care settings must focus on preventing exposures
to blood as well as on delivery of HBV immunization. The report stated that UP applied to blood, body fluids that had
been implicated in the transmission of bloodborne infections (semen and vaginal secretions), body fluids from which
the risk of transmission was unknown (amniotic, cerebrospinal, pericardial, peritoneal, pleural, and synovial
fluids), and to any other body fluid visibly contaminated with blood, but not to feces, nasal secretions, sputum,
sweat, tears, urine, or vomitus unless they contained visible blood. Although HIV and HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)
had been found in some of the fluids, secretions, or excretions to which UP did not apply, epidemiologic studies in
the health care and community setting had not implicated these substances in the transmission of HIV and HBV infections.
However, the report noted that some of the fluids, secretions, and excretions not covered under UP represented a potential
source for nosocomial and community-acquired infections with other pathogens and referred readers to the CDC isolation
guideline. 



Body Substance Isolation

In 1987, a new system of isolation, called Body Substance Isolation (BSI), was proposed, after 3 years of study by infection
control personnel at the Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and the University of California at San Diego, as an
alternative to diagnosis-driven isolation systems.

29

 BSI focused on the isolation of all moist and potentially infectious body substances (blood, feces, urine, sputum,
saliva, wound drainage, and other body fluids) from all patients, regardless of their presumed infection status,
primarily through the use of gloves. Personnel were instructed to put on clean gloves just before contact with mucous
membranes and nonintact skin, and to wear gloves for anticipated contact with moist body substances. In addition,
a ``Stop Sign Alert'' was used to instruct persons wishing to enter the room of some patients with infections transmitted
exclusively or in part by the airborne route to check with the floor nurse, who would determine whether a mask should
be worn; personnel were to be immune to or immunized against selected infectious diseases transmitted by airborne
or droplet routes (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) or they were not to enter the rooms housing patients with
these diseases. Other issues related to implementing BSI in a university teaching hospital were described.

30

 

Among the advantages cited for BSI were that it was a simple, easy to learn and administer system, and that it avoided
the assumption that (1) individuals without known or suspected diagnoses of transmissible infectious diseases
were free of risk to patients and personnel, and (2) that only certain body fluids were associated with transmission
of infection. The disadvantages of BSI included the added cost of increased use of barrier equipment, particularly
gloves;

31

 the difficulty in maintaining routine application of the protocol for all patients; the uncertainty about the precautions
to be taken when entering a room with a ``Stop Sign Alert''; and the potential for misapplication of the protocol to
overprotect personnel at the expense of the patient.

32

 

In a prospective study,

33

 a combination use of gown and glove protocols similar to BSI led to lower infection rates in a pediatric intensive care
unit (ICU), and in other studies similar combinations of barriers were associated with lower rates of nosocomial
RSV infection in a pediatric ICU

34

 and of resistant gram-negative organisms in an acute-care hospital.

35

 However, in none of these studies, initiated before publication of BSI, were the authors attempting to evaluate BSI,
nor were they able to separate the effect of gloves from that of gowns or from gloves and gowns used in combination. 

Controversial aspects of BSI have been summarized.

15,



16

 BSI appeared to replace some, but not all, of the isolation precautions necessary to prevent transmission of infection.
BSI did not contain adequate provisions to prevent (1) droplet transmission of serious infections in pediatric populations
(e.g., invasive 

Haemophilus influenza, Neisseria meningitides

 meningitis and pneumonia, and pertussis), (2) direct or indirect contact transmission of epidemiologically important
microorganisms from dry skin or environmental sources (e.g., 

Clostridium difficile

 and vancomycin-resistant enterococci), or (3) true airborne transmission of infections transmitted over long
distances by floating droplet nuclei. Although BSI emphasized that a private room was indicated for some patients
with some diseases transmitted exclusively or in part by the true airborne route, it did not emphasize the need for
special ventilation for patients known or suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis or other diseases transmitted
by airborne droplet nuclei. The lack of emphasis on special ventilation was of particular concern to CDC in the early
1990s because of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

18-19



BSI and UP shared many similar features designed to prevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens in hospitals.
However, there was an important difference in the recommendation for glove use and handwashing. Under UP, gloves
were recommended for anticipated contact with blood and specified body fluids and hands were to be washed immediately
after gloves were removed.

27-28

 Under BSI, gloves were recommended for anticipated contact with any moist body substance but handwashing after glove
removal was not required unless the hands were visibly soiled.

29

 The lack of emphasis on handwashing after glove removal was cited as one of the theoretical disadvantages of BSI.

15,



37-38

 Using gloves as a protective substitute for handwashing may have provided a false sense of security, resulted in less
handwashing, increased the risk of nosocomial transmission of pathogens because hands can become contaminated
even when gloves are used

39

 and are easily contaminated in the process of removing gloves, and contributed to skin problems and allergies associated
with the use of gloves.

40-41

 On the other hand, proponents of BSI have noted that studies of handwashing have indicated relatively low compliance
by hospital personnel,

42-43

 that glove use may have been easier to manage than handwashing, and that frequent handwashing may have led to eczema,
skin cracking, or, in some persons, clinical damage to the skin of the hands.

44

 Although use of gloves may have been better than no handwashing, the efficacy of using gloves as a substitute for handwashing
has not been demonstrated. 



OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Regulations 



In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a proposed rule regarding occupational
exposure to bloodborne pathogens in hospitals and other health care settings.

45

 The proposed rule, based on the concept of UP, raised concerns in the infection control community. Among them were
concerns about the use of ``visibly bloody'' as a marker for the infectious risk of certain body fluids and substances,
the imbalance toward precautions to protect personnel and away from protection for patients, the lack of proven efficacy
of UP, and the costs for implementing the proposed regulations.

46-50

 After a series of OSHA public hearings and review of written comments, the proposed rule was modified and the final
rule on occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens was published in 1991.

51

 Although the final rule was expected to improve occupational safety in the care of patients infected with bloodborne
pathogens, its impact on the cost of patient care and on nosocomial infection control has remained undefined. Information
on complying with the OSHA final rule has been made available by the American Hospital Association

52

 and others.

The Need for a New Isolation Guideline 



By the early 1990s, isolation had become an infection control conundrum.

54

 Although many hospitals had incorporated all or portions of UP into their category- or disease-specific isolation
system and others had adopted all or portions of BSI,

55-56

 there was much local variation in the interpretation and use of UP and BSI and a variety of combinations was common.
Further, there was considerable confusion about which body fluids or substances required precautions under UP and
BSI. Many hospitals espousing UP were really using BSI and vice-versa. Moreover, there was continued lack of agreement
about the importance of handwashing when gloves were used

14-15,27-29,37-38,57-58 

and the need for additional precautions beyond BSI to prevent airborne, droplet, and contact transmission.

14-15,27-29,31,36,59-60

 Some hospitals had not implemented appropriate guidelines for preventing transmission of tuberculosis, including
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

61

 As other multidrug-resistant microorganisms

62-63

 were emerging, some hospitals failed to recognize them as new problems and to add appropriate precautions that would
contain them. 

In view of these problems and concerns, no simple adjustment to any of the existing approaches_UP, BSI, the CDC isolation
guideline, or other isolation systems_appeared likely to solve the conundrum. Clearly what was needed was a new synthesis
of the various systems that would provide a guideline with logistically feasible recommendations for preventing
the many infections that occur in hospitals through diverse modes of transmission. To achieve this, the new guideline
would have to be (1) epidemiologically sound, (2) recognize the importance of all body fluids, secretions, and excretions
in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens, (3) contain adequate precautions for infections transmitted by the
airborne, droplet, and contact routes of transmission, (4) be as simple and user friendly as possible, and (5) use
new terms to avoid confusion with existing systems. 

Based on these considerations, a new guideline was subsequently developed. It contains three important changes
from previous recommendations. First, it synthesizes the major features of UP

27-28

 and BSI

29-30

 into a single set of precautions to be used for the care of all patients in hospitals regardless of their presumed infection
status. These precautions, called Standard Precautions, are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne
and other pathogens in hospitals. As a result of this synthesis, a large number of patients with diseases or conditions
that previously required category- or disease-specific precautions in the 1983 CDC isolation guideline

4

 are now covered under Standard Precautions and do not require additional precautions. Second, it collapses the old
categories of isolation precautions (Strict Isolation, Contact Isolation, Respiratory Isolation, Tuberculosis
Isolation, Enteric Precautions, and Drainage/Secretion Precautions) and the old disease-specific precautions
into three sets of precautions based on routes of transmission for a smaller number of specified patients known or
suspected to be infected or colonized with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens; these
Transmission-based Precautions, designed to reduce the risk of airborne, droplet, and contact transmission in
hospitals, are to be used in addition to Standard Precautions. Third, it lists specific syndromes in both adult and
pediatric patients that are highly suspicious for infection and identifies appropriate Transmission-based Precautions
to use on an empiric, temporary basis until a diagnosis can be made; these empiric, temporary precautions are also
designed to be used in addition to Standard Precautions. The details of the guideline recommendations are presented
in Part II, ``Recommendations for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals.'' 

In summary, the new guideline is another step in the evolution of isolation practices in U.S. hospitals. It is now recommended
for review and use by hospitals with the following provision. No guideline can address all of the needs of the more than
6,000 U.S. hospitals, which range in size from 5 beds to more than 1,500 beds and serve very different patient populations.
Hospitals are encouraged to review the guideline and to modify it according to what is possible, practical, and prudent.




Part II. Recommendations for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals 



Rationale for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals 



Spread of infection within a hospital requires three elements: a source of infecting microorganisms, a susceptible
host, and a means of transmission for the microorganism. 



Source 



Human sources of the infecting microorganisms in hospitals may be patients, personnel, or, on occasion, visitors
and may include persons with acute disease, persons in the incubation period of a disease, persons who are colonized
by an infectious agent but have no apparent disease, or persons who are chronic carriers of an infectious agent. Other
sources of infecting microorganisms can be the patient's own endogenous flora, which may be difficult to control,
and inanimate environmental objects that have become contaminated, including equipment and medications. 



Host 



Resistance among persons to pathogenic microorganisms varies greatly. Some persons may be immune to infection or
be able to resist colonization by an infectious agent; others exposed to the same agent may establish a commensal relationship
with the infecting microorganism and become asymptomatic carriers; still others may develop clinical disease.
Host factors such as age; underlying diseases; certain treatments with antimicrobials, corticosteroids or other
immunosuppressive agents; irradiation; and breaks in the first line of defense mechanisms caused by such factors
as surgical operations, anesthesia, and indwelling catheters may render patients more susceptible to infection.




Transmission 



Microorganisms are transmitted in hospitals by several routes, and the same microorganism may be transmitted by
more than one route. There are five main routes of transmission_contact, droplet, airborne, common vehicle, and
vectorborne. For the purpose of this guideline, common vehicle and vectorborne transmission will be discussed only
briefly since neither play a significant role in typical nosocomial infections.

1. 

Contact Transmission

, the most important and frequent mode of transmission of nosocomial infections, is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact
transmission and indirect-contact transmission. 

a. Direct-contact transmission involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of
microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as occurs when a person turns
a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other patient-care activities that require direct personal contact.
Direct-contact transmission can also occur between two patients with one serving as the source of the infectious
microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host. 

b. Indirect-contact transmission involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object,
usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between
patients. 

2. 

Droplet transmission

, theoretically, is a form of contact transmission. However, the mechanism of transfer of the pathogen to the host
is quite distinct from either direct- or indirect-contact transmission. Therefore, droplet transmission will
be considered a separate route of transmission in this guideline. Droplets are generated from the source person primarily
during coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning and
bronchoscopy. Transmission occurs when droplets containing microorganisms generated from the infected person
are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the host's conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth. Transmission
of this nature must not be confused with airborne transmission. 

3. 

Airborne Transmission 

occurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue [5 microns or smaller in size]
of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust
particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be widely dispersed by air
currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source
patient depending on environmental factors. 

4. 

Common Vehicle Transmission 

applies to microorganisms transmitted by contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.


5. 

Vectorborne Transmission 

occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms; this route of transmission
is of less significance in hospitals in the United States than in other regions of the world. 

Isolation precautions are designed to prevent transmission of microorganisms by these routes in hospitals. Since
agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of spread of infection is directed primarily at
transmission. The recommendations presented in this guideline are based on this concept. 

Placing a patient on isolation precautions, however, often presents certain disadvantages to the hospital, patients,
personnel, and visitors. Isolation precautions may require specialized equipment and environmental modifications
that add to the cost of hospitalization. Isolation precautions may make frequent visits by nurses, physicians, and
other personnel inconvenient, and they may make it more difficult for personnel to give the prompt and frequent care
that is sometimes required. The use of a multi-patient room for one patient uses valuable space that might otherwise
accommodate several patients. Moreover, forced solitude deprives the patient of normal social relationships and
may be psychologically harmful, especially to children. These disadvantages, however, must be weighed against
the hospital's mission to prevent the spread of serious and epidemiologically important microorganisms in the hospital.




Fundamentals of Isolation Precautions 



A variety of infection control measures are used for decreasing the risk of transmission of microorganisms in hospitals.
These measures make up the fundamentals of isolation precautions.

Handwashing and Gloving 



Handwashing is frequently called the single most important measure for preventing spread of infection. The scientific
rationale, indications, methods, and products for handwashing have been delineated in other publications.

64-71



Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with blood, body
fluids, secretions, excretions, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection
control and isolation precautions. In addition to handwashing, gloves play an important role in the prevention of
the spread of infection. 

Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, gloves are worn to provide a protective barrier and
prevent gross contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes,
and nonintact skin;

27-29

 the wearing of gloves in specified circumstances to reduce the risk of exposures to bloodborne pathogens is mandated
by the OSHA bloodborne pathogens final rule.

 Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted
to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes
and nonintact skin. Third, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that hands of personnel contaminated with microorganisms
from a patient or a fomite can transmit these microorganisms to another patient; in this situation, gloves must be
changed between patient contacts and hands washed after gloves are removed. 

Wearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing because (1) gloves may have small inapparent defects or be
torn during use, and (2) hands can become contaminated during removal of gloves.

14-15,39,72-75

 Failure to change gloves between patient contacts is an infection control hazard.

Patient Placement 



Appropriate patient placement is an important component of isolation precautions. When possible, patients with
highly transmissible or epidemiologically important microorganisms are placed in a private room with handwashing
and toilet facilities to reduce opportunities for transmission of microorganisms. A private room is also important
to prevent direct- or indirect-contact transmission when the source patient has poor hygienic habits, contaminates
the environment, or cannot be expected to assist in maintaining infection control precautions to limit transmission
of microorganisms (i.e., infants, children, and patients with altered mental status). 

When a private room is not available, infected patients are placed with appropriate roommates. Patients infected
by the same microorganism can usually share a room provided (1) they are not infected with other potentially transmissible
microorganisms, and (2) the likelihood of reinfection with the same organism is minimal. Such sharing of rooms, also
referred to as cohorting patients, is especially useful during outbreaks or when there is a shortage of private rooms.
When a private room is not available and cohorting is not achievable or recommended,

23

 it is very important to consider the epidemiology and mode of transmission of the infecting pathogen and the patient
population being served in determining patient placement. Under these circumstances, consultation with infection
control professionals is advised before patient placement. Moreover, when an infected patient shares a room with
a noninfected patient, it is also important that patients, personnel, and visitors take precautions to prevent the
spread of infection and that roommates are carefully selected. 

Guidelines for construction, equipment, air handling, and ventilation for isolation rooms have been delineated
in other publications.

76-78

 A private room with appropriate air handling and ventilation is particularly important for reducing the risk of transmission
of microorganisms from a source patient to susceptible patients and other persons in hospitals when the microorganism
is spread by airborne transmission. Some hospitals use an isolation room with an anteroom as an extra measure of precaution
to prevent airborne transmission. Adequate data regarding the need for anterooms, however, is not available. Ventilation
recommendations for isolation rooms housing patients with pulmonary tuberculosis have been delineated in other
CDC guidelines.

Limiting the movement and transport of patients infected with virulent or epidemiologically important microorganisms
and ensuring that such patients leave their rooms only for essential purposes reduce opportunities for transmission
of microorganisms in hospitals. When patient transport is necessary, it is important that (1) appropriate barriers
(e.g., masks, impervious dressings) are worn or used by the patient to reduce the opportunity for transmission of
pertinent microorganisms to other patients, personnel, and visitors and to reduce contamination of the environment,
(2) personnel in the area to which the patient is to be taken are notified of the impending arrival of the patient and
of the precautions to be used to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious microorganisms, and (3) patients are
informed of ways by which they can assist in preventing the transmission of their infectious microorganisms to others.



Masks, Respiratory Protection, Eye Protection, Face Shields 


Various types of masks, goggles, and face shields are worn alone or in combination to provide barrier protection.
A mask that covers both the nose and mouth and goggles or a face shield are worn during procedures and patient-care activities
that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions to provide protection
of the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth from contact transmission of pathogens. The wearing of masks,
eye protection, and face shields in specified circumstances to reduce the risk of exposures to bloodborne pathogens
is mandated by the OSHA bloodborne pathogens final rule.

51

 A surgical mask is generally worn to provide protection against spread of infectious large-particle droplets that
are transmitted by close contact and generally travel only short distances (up to 3 feet) from infected patients who
are coughing or sneezing. 
An area of major concern and controversy over the last several years has been the role and selection of respiratory
protection equipment and the implications of a respiratory protection program for prevention of transmission of
tuberculosis in hospitals. Traditionally, although the efficacy was not proven, a surgical mask was worn for isolation
precautions in hospitals when patients were known or suspected to be infected with pathogens spread by the airborne
route of transmission. In 1990, however, the CDC tuberculosis guidelines

18

 stated that surgical masks may not be effective in preventing the inhalation of droplet nuclei and recommended the
use of disposable particulate respirators despite the fact that the efficacy of particulate respirators in protecting
persons for the inhalation of 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis 

had not been demonstrated. By definition, particulate respirators include dust-mist (DM), dust-fume-mist (DFM),
or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter respirators certified by the CDC National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH); since the generic term particulate respirator was used in the 1990 guidelines, the implication
was that any of these respirators provided sufficient protection.

79

 
In 1993, a draft revision of the CDC tuberculosis guidelines

22

 outlined performance criteria for respirators and stated that some DM or DFM respirators might not meet these criteria.
After review of public comments, the guidelines were finalized in October 1994

23

 with the draft respirator criteria unchanged. The only class of respirators that currently are (1) known to consistently
meet or exceed the performance criteria outlined in the 1994 tuberculosis guidelines, and (2) certified by NIOSH
(as required by OSHA) are HEPA filter respirators. However, recently NIOSH has announced that they will change their
respirator certification process.

80

 The proposed changes should enable users to select from a broader range of certified respirators for use in hospitals
for protection against 

M. tuberculosis. 

Additional information on the evolution of respirator recommendations, regulations to protect hospital personnel,
and the role of various federal agencies in respiratory protection for hospital personnel has been prepared for publication.

Gowns and Protective Apparel 


Various types of gowns and protective apparel are worn to provide barrier protection and reduce opportunities for
transmission of microorganisms in hospitals. Gowns are worn to prevent contamination of clothing and protect the
skin of personnel from blood and body fluid exposures. Gowns especially treated to make them impermeable to liquids,
leg coverings, boots, or shoe covers provide greater protection to the skin when splashes or large quantities of infective
material are present or anticipated. The wearing of gowns and protective apparel under specified circumstances
to reduce the risk of exposures to bloodborne pathogens is mandated by the OSHA bloodborne pathogens final rule.51

Gowns are also worn by personnel during the care of patients infected with epidemiologically important microorganisms
to reduce the opportunity for transmission of pathogens from patients or items in their environment to other patients
or environments; when gowns are worn for this purpose, they are removed before leaving the patient's environment
and hands are washed. Adequate data regarding the efficacy of gowns for this purpose, however, is not available. 


Patient-Care Equipment and Articles 


Many factors determine whether special handling and disposal of used patient-care equipment and articles are prudent
or required, including the likelihood of contamination with infective material; the ability to cut, stick, or otherwise
cause injury (needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments [sharps]); the severity of the associated disease;
and the environmental stability of the pathogens involved.

27,51,81-83

 Some used articles are enclosed in containers or bags to prevent inadvertent exposures to patients, personnel, and
visitors and to prevent contamination of the environment. Used sharps are placed in puncture-resistant containers;
other articles are placed in a bag. One bag is adequate if the bag is sturdy and the article can be placed in the bag without
contaminating the outside of the bag;84 otherwise two bags (double bagging) are used. 
The scientific rationale, indications, methods, products, and equipment for reprocessing patient-care equipment
have been delineated in other publications.

68,83,85-90

 Contaminated, reusable critical medical devices or patient-care equipment (i.e., equipment that enters normally
sterile tissue or through which blood flows) or semicritical medical devices or patient-care equipment (i.e., equipment
that touches mucous membranes) are sterilized or disinfected (reprocessed) after use to reduce the risk of transmission
of microorganisms to other patients; the type of reprocessing is determined by the article and its intended use, the
manufacturer's recommendations, hospital policy, and any applicable guidelines and regulations. 
Noncritical equipment (i.e., equipment that touches intact skin) contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions,
or excretions is cleaned and disinfected after use according to hospital policy. Contaminated disposable (single-use)
patient-care equipment is handled and transported in a manner that reduces the risk of transmission of microorganisms
and decreases environmental contamination in the hospital; the equipment is disposed of according to hospital policy
and applicable regulations. 


Linen and Laundry 


Although soiled linen may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms, the risk of disease transmission is negligible
if it is handled, transported, and laundered in a manner that avoids transfer of microorganisms to patients, personnel,
and environments. Rather than rigid rules and regulations, hygienic and commonsense storage and processing of clean
and soiled linen are recommended.

27,82,91

 The methods for handling, transporting, and laundering of soiled linen are determined by hospital policy and any
applicable regulations. 


Dishes, Glasses and Cups, and Eating Utensils 


No special precautions are needed for dishes, glasses and cups, or eating utensils. Either disposable or reusable
dishes and utensils can be used for patients on isolation precautions. The combination of hot water and detergents
used in hospital dishwashers is sufficient to decontaminate dishes, glasses and cups, and eating utensils. 


Routine and Terminal Cleaning 


The room or cubicle and bedside equipment of patients on isolation precautions are cleaned using the same procedures
used for other patients unless the infecting microorganism(s) and the amount of environmental contamination indicates
special cleaning. The methods, thoroughness, and frequency of cleaning and the products used are determined by hospital
policy. 


HICPAC Isolation Precautions 


There are two tiers of HICPAC isolation precautions. In first, and most important, tier are those precautions designed
for the care of all patients in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. Implementation
of these ``Standard Precautions'' is the primary strategy for successful nosocomial infection control. In the second
tier are precautions designed only for the care of specified patients. These additional ``Transmission-based Precautions''
are for patients known or suspected to be infected by epidemiologically important pathogens spread by airborne or
droplet transmission or by contact with dry skin or contaminated surfaces.

Standard Precautions 



Standard Precautions synthesize the major features of Universal (Blood and Body Fluid) Precautions

27-28

 (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens) and Body Substance Isolation

29-30

 (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens from moist body substances) and applies them to all patients
receiving care in hospitals regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status. Standard Precautions apply
to (1) blood, (2) all body fluids, secretions, and excretions regardless of whether or not they contain visible blood,
(3) nonintact skin, and (4) mucous membranes. Standard Precautions are designed to reduce the risk of transmission
of microorganisms from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in hospitals. 



Transmission-Based Precautions 



Transmission-based Precautions are designed for patients documented or suspected to be infected with highly transmissible
or epidemiologically important pathogens for which additional precautions beyond Standard Precautions are needed
to interrupt transmission in hospitals. There are three types of Transmission-based Precautions: Airborne Precautions,
Droplet Precautions, and Contact Precautions. They may be combined together for diseases that have multiple routes
of transmission. When used either singularly or in combination, they are to be used in addition to Standard Precautions.




Airborne Precautions 

are designed to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of infectious agents. Airborne transmission occurs by dissemination
of either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue [5 microns or smaller in size] of evaporated droplets
that may remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms
carried in this manner can be widely dispersed by air currents and may become inhaled by or deposited on a susceptible
host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors. Airborne
Precautions apply to patients known or suspected to be infected with epidemiologically important pathogens that
can be transmitted by the airborne route. 



Droplet Precautions

 are designed to reduce the risk of droplet transmission of infectious agents. Droplet transmission involves contact
of the conjunctivae, or the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth of a susceptible person with large-particle droplets
(larger than 5 microns in size) containing microorganisms generated from a person who has a clinical disease or is
a carrier of the microorganism. Droplets are generated from the source person primarily during coughing, sneezing,
or talking, and during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning and bronchoscopy. Transmission
via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons since droplets do not remain
suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances, usually 3 feet or less, through the air. Droplet Precautions
apply to any patient known or suspected to be infected with epidemiologically important pathogens that can be transmitted
by infectious droplets. 



Contact Precautions 

are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of epidemiologically important microorganisms by direct or indirect
contact. Direct-contact transmission involves skin-to-skin contact and physical transfer of microorganisms
to a susceptible host from an infected or colonized person, such as occurs when personnel turn a patient, give a patient
a bath, or perform other patient-care activities that require physical contact. Direct-contact transmission can
also occur between two patients (e.g., by hand contact), with one serving as the source of infectious microorganisms
and the other as a susceptible host. Indirect-contact transmission involves contact of a susceptible host with a
contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, in the patient's environment. Contact Precautions apply
to specified patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized (presence of microorganism in or on patient but
without clinical signs and symptoms of infection) with epidemiologically important microorganisms than can be
transmitted by direct- or indirect-contact. 

A synopsis of the types of precautions and the patients requiring the precautions is listed in Table 1. 



Empiric Use of Airborne, Droplet, or Contact Precautions 



In many instances, the risk of nosocomial transmission of infection may be highest before a definitive diagnosis
can be made and precautions based on that diagnosis implemented. The routine use of Standard Precautions for all patients
should greatly reduce this risk for conditions other than those requiring Airborne, Droplet, or Contact Precautions.
While it is not possible to prospectively identify all patients needing these enhanced precautions, certain clinical
syndromes and conditions carry a sufficiently high risk to warrant the empiric addition of enhanced precautions
while a more definitive diagnosis is pursued. A listing of such conditions and the recommended precautions beyond
Standard Precautions is presented in Table 2. 

The organisms listed under the column ``Potential Pathogens'' are not intended to represent the complete or even
most likely diagnoses, but rather possible etiologic agents that require additional precautions beyond Standard
Precautions until they can be ruled out. Infection control professionals are encouraged to modify or adapt this table
according to local conditions. To ensure that appropriate empiric precautions are always implemented, hospitals
must have systems in place to routinely evaluate patients according to these criteria as part of their preadmission
and admission care.

Immunocompromised Patients 



Immunocompromised patients vary in their susceptibility to nosocomial infections depending on the severity and
duration of immunosuppression. They are generally at increased risk for bacterial infections from both endogenous
and exogenous sources. The use of Standard Precautions for all patients and Transmission-based Precautions for
specified patients as recommended in this guideline should reduce the acquisition by these patients of institutionally
acquired bacteria from other patients and environments. 

It is beyond the scope of this guideline to address the various measures that may be used for immunocompromised patients
to delay or prevent acquisition of potential pathogens during temporary periods of neutropenia. Rather, the primary
objective of this guideline is to prevent transmission of pathogens from infected or colonized patients in hospitals.
Users of this guideline, however, are referred to the 

Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia



92-93

 for the HICPAC recommendations for prevention of nosocomial aspergillosis and Legionnaires' disease in immunocompromised
patients. 



HICPAC Recommendations for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals 



The HICPAC recommendations presented below are categorized according to the scheme outlined in Table 3. The recommendations
are limited to the topic of isolation precautions. Therefore, they must be supplemented by hospital policies and
procedures for other aspects of infection and environmental control, occupational health, administrative and
legal issues, and other issues beyond the scope of this guideline. 



I. Education 



Develop a system to ensure that hospital patients, personnel, and visitors are educated about use of precautions
and their responsibility for adherence to them. 

Category IB

 



II. Standard Precautions 



Use Standard Precautions, or the equivalent, for the care of all patients. 

Category IB

 



A. Handwashing 



1. Wash hands after touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items, whether or not
gloves are worn. Wash hands immediately after gloves are removed, between patient contacts, and when otherwise indicated
to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments. 

Category IB

 

2. Use a plain (nonantimicrobial) soap for handwashing except for specific circumstances (e.g., control of outbreaks
or hyperendemic infections) as defined by the infection control program. 

Category II

 



B. Gloves 



Wear gloves (clean nonsterile gloves are adequate) when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and
contaminated items; put on clean gloves just before touching mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Remove gloves
promptly after use, before touching noncontaminated items and environmental surfaces, and before going to another
patient, and wash hands immediately to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments. 

Category IB

 



C. Mask, Eye Protection, Face Shield 



Wear a mask and eye protection or a face shield to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures
and patient-care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, and
excretions. 

Category IB

 



D. Gown 



Wear a gown (a clean nonsterile gown is adequate) to protect skin and prevent soiling of clothing during procedures
and patient-care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or
excretions or cause soiling of clothing. Select a gown that is appropriate for the activity and amount of fluid likely
to be encountered. Remove a soiled gown as promptly as possible and wash hands to avoid transfer of microorganisms
to other patients or environments. 

Category IB

 



E. Patient-Care Equipment 



Handle used patient-care equipment soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions in a manner that prevents
skin and mucous membrane exposures, contamination of clothing, and transfer of microorganisms to other patients
and environments. Ensure that reusable equipment is not used for the care of another patient until it has been appropriately
cleaned and reprocessed and single use items are properly discarded. 

Category IB

 



F. Linen 



Handle, transport, and process used linen soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions in a manner
that prevents skin and mucous membrane exposures, contamination of clothing, and avoids transfer of microorganisms
to other patients and environments. 

Category IB

 



G. Occupational Health and Bloodborne Pathogens 



1. Take care to prevent injuries when using needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices; when handling
sharp instruments after procedures; when cleaning used instruments; and when disposing of used needles. Never recap
used needles or otherwise manipulate them using both hands, or any other technique that involves directing the point
of a needle toward any part of the body; rather, use either a one-handed ``scoop'' technique or a mechanical device
designed for holding the needle sheath. Do not remove used needles from disposable syringes by hand, and do not bend,
break, or otherwise manipulate used needles by hand. Place used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades,
and other sharp items in appropriate puncture-resistant containers located as close as practical to the area in which
the items were used, and place reusable syringes and needles in a puncture-resistant container for transport to the
reprocessing area. 

Category IB

 

2. Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags, or other ventilation devices as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
methods in areas where the need for resuscitation is predictable. 

Category IB

 



H. Patient Placement 



Place a patient who contaminates the environment or who does not (or cannot be expected to) assist in maintaining appropriate
hygiene or environmental control in a private room. If a private room is not available, consult with infection control
professionals regarding patient placement or other alternatives. 

Category IB

 



III. Airborne Precautions 



In addition to Standard Precautions, use Airborne Precautions, or the equivalent, for patients known or suspected
to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue [5 microns or
smaller in size] of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air and can be widely
dispersed by air currents within a room or over a long distance).

A. Patient Placement 



Place the patient in a private room that has (1) monitored negative air pressure in relation to the surrounding areas,
(2) a minimum of six air changes per hour, and (3) appropriate discharge of air outdoors or monitored high-efficiency
filtration of room air before the air is circulated to other areas in the hospital.23 Keep the room door closed and the
patient in the room. When a private room is not available, place the patient in a room with a patient who has active infection
with the same microorganism, unless otherwise recommended,23 but with no other infection. When a private room is
not available and cohorting is not desirable, consultation with infection control professionals is advised before
patient placement. 

Category IB

 



B. Respiratory Protection 



Wear respiratory protection when entering the room of a patient with known or suspected infectious tuberculosis.23
Do not enter the room of patients known or suspected to have measles (rubeola) or varicella (chickenpox) if susceptible
to these infections. 

Category IB

 



C. Patient Transport 



Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room to essential purposes only. If transport or movement
is necessary, minimize patient dispersal of droplet nuclei by placing a surgical mask on the patient, if possible.


Category IB

 



D. Additional Precautions for Preventing Transmission of Tuberculosis 



Consult CDC Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities23 for additional
prevention strategies. 



IV. Droplet Precautions 



In addition to Standard Precautions, use Droplet Precautions, or the equivalent, for a patient known or suspected
to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by droplets (large-particle droplets [larger than 5 microns in size]
that can be generated by the patient during coughing, sneezing, talking, or the performance of procedures). 

Category IB

 



A. Patient Placement 



Place the patient in a private room. When a private room is not available, place the patient in a room with a patient(s)
who has active infection with the same microorganism, but with no other infection (cohorting). When a private room
is not available and cohorting is not achievable, maintain spatial separation of at least 3 feet between the infected
patient and other patients and visitors. 

Category IB

 



B. Mask 



In addition to standard precautions, wear a mask when working within 3 feet of the patient. (Logistically, some hospitals
may want to implement the wearing of a mask to enter the room.) 

Category IB

 



C. Patient Transport 



Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room to essential purposes only. If transport or movement
is necessary, minimize patient dispersal of droplets by masking the patient, if possible. 

Category IB

 



V. Contact Precautions 



In addition to Standard Precautions, use Contact Precautions, or the equivalent, for specified patients known or
suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important microorganisms that can be transmitted
by direct contact with the patient (hand or skin-to-skin contact that occurs when performing patient-care activities
that require touching the patient's dry skin) or indirect contact (touching) with environmental surfaces or patient-care
items in the patient's environment. 

Category IB

who has active infection with the same microorganism, but with no other infection (cohorting). When a private room
is not available and cohorting is not achievable, consider the epidemiology of the microorganism and the patient
population when determining patient placement; consultation with infection control professionals is advised
before patient placement. 

Category IB 



B. Gloves and Handwashing 



In addition to wearing gloves as outlined under Standard Precautions, wear gloves (clean nonsterile gloves are adequate)
when entering the room. During the course of providing care for a patient, change gloves after having contact with
infective material that may contain high concentrations of microorganisms (fecal material and wound drainage).
Remove gloves before leaving the patient's room and wash hands immediately with an antimicrobial agent. After glove
removal and handwashing, ensure that hands do not touch potentially contaminated environmental surfaces or items
in the patient's room to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients or environments. Category IB 



C. Gown 



In addition to wearing a gown as outlined under Standard Precautions, wear a gown (a clean nonsterile gown is adequate)
when entering the room if you anticipate that your clothing will have substantial contact with the patient, environmental
surfaces, or items in the patient's room, or if the patient is incontinent, or has diarrhea, an ileostomy, a colostomy,
or wound drainage not contained by a dressing. Remove the gown before leaving the patient's environment. After gown
removal, ensure that clothing does not contact potentially contaminated environmental surfaces to avoid transfer
of microorganisms to other patients or environments. Category IB 



D. Patient Transport 



Limit the movement and transport of the patient from the room to essential purposes only. If the patient is transported
out of the room, ensure that precautions are maintained to minimize the risk of transmission of microorganisms to
other patients and contamination of environmental surfaces or equipment. Category IB 



E. Environmental Control 



Ensure that patient-care items, bedside equipment, and frequently touched surfaces receive daily cleaning. Category
IB 



F. Patient-Care Equipment 



When possible, dedicate the use of noncritical patient-care equipment and items such as a stethoscope, sphygmomanometer,
bedside commode, or electronic rectal thermometer to a single patient (or cohort of patients infected or colonized
with the pathogen requiring precautions) to avoid sharing between patients. If use of common equipment or items is
unavoidable, then adequately clean and disinfect them before use for another patient. Category IB 



G. Additional Precautions for Preventing the Spread of Vancomycin Resistance 



Consult the HICPAC report on preventing the spread of vancomycin resistance for additional prevention strategies.94




VI. Adherence to Precautions 



Periodically evaluate adherence to precautions, and use findings to direct improvements. Category IB
