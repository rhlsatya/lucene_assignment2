Olives Grown in California and Imported Olives; Final Rule Establishing Limited Use Olive Requirements During the
1994-95 Crop Year 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule which authorized the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California
olives during the 1994-95 crop year. This rule is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels and
is consistent with current market demand for olives. As required under section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, this rule also changes the olive import regulation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Order No. 932 (7 CFR Part 932), as amended, regulating the
handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities, including olives, imported into the United States
that are the same as, or comparable to, those requirements imposed upon the domestic commodities regulated under
the Federal marketing orders. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 

There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act. 

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 

There are 5 handlers of California olives that will be subject to regulation under the order during the current season,
and there are about 1,200 olive producers in California. There are approximately 25 importers of olives subject to
the olive import regulation. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which
include handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000. None of the domestic olive handlers may be classified as small entities. The majority of olive
producers and importers may be classified as small entities. 

Nearly all of the olives grown in the United States are produced in California. The growing areas are scattered throughout
California with most of the commercial production coming from inland valleys. The majority of olives are produced
in central California. California olives are primarily used for canned ripe whole and whole pitted olives which are
eaten out of hand as hors d'oeuvres or used as an ingredient in cooking and in salads. The canned ripe olive market is
essentially a domestic market. A few shipments of California olives are exported.

Olive production has fluctuated from a low of 24,200 tons during the 1972-73 crop year to a high of 163,023 tons
during the 1992-93 crop year. The California Olive Committee (committee) indicated that 1993-94 production
totalled about 120,049 tons. Total production for the 1994-95 crop year is estimated to be 95,000 tons. Because
olive trees need to restore their nutrients from one season to the next, various varieties of olives produced in California
have alternate bearing tendencies. This results in high production one year and low the next, which usually causes
the total crop to vary greatly from year to year. This crop year's estimated production is expected to be smaller than
last year due to weather conditions early in the season which resulted in poor fruit pollination. 

However, based on past production and marketing experience, the committee believes that handlers will need smaller
sized olives during the 1994-95 crop year to meet market demand for limited use styles of canned olives. Limited
use olives are too small to meet the minimum size requirements established for whole and whole pitted canned ripe olives.
However, they are large enough to be suitable for processing into limited use styles such as wedges, halves, slices,
or segments. Absent this action, olives which are smaller than those authorized for whole and whole pitted canning
uses would have to be disposed of by handlers into non-canning uses such as crushing into oil. 

Paragraph (a)(3) of  932.52 of the order provides that processed olives smaller than the sizes prescribed for
whole and whole pitted styles may be used for limited uses if recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
Until October 1, 1991, paragraph (a)(3) also prescribed minimum sizes, by variety group, which could be authorized
for use in the production of limited use styles by the Secretary. 

Effective October 1, 1991, certain non-canning size disposition requirements specified in  932.51(a)(3)
and minimum sizes authorized for limited use specified in  932.52(a)(3) of the marketing order were suspended.
The committee may now recommend the use of olives for limited uses that are smaller than those previously permitted
under the order. Minimum size and grade requirements may be recommended annually by the committee and approved by
the Secretary. During the past three crop years, 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94, the committee recommended
sizes smaller than those previously authorized. 

The minimum sizes which could previously be authorized for limited uses were established in a 1971 amendment to the
marketing order. Olives smaller than the prescribed minimum sizes which could be authorized for limited uses had
to be disposed of through less profitable non-canning uses such as crushing for oil. Returns to producers are lower
on fruit used for such purposes. The use of smaller sized olives for limited use styles has been authorized in all but
two crop years since the order was promulgated in 1965. 

This final rule finalizes an interim final rule that will help growers and handlers to meet the growing market demand
for limited use style olives based upon current conditions. The limited use size requirements allow the use of sizes
which would otherwise have to be disposed of for less profitable, non-canning uses. Permitting the use of such smaller
olives for limited use styles would therefore improve grower returns. 

On July 13, 1994, the committee recommended by a vote of 15-1, to establish grade and size regulations for limited
use size olives during the 1994-95 crop year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of  932.52 of the order. The one
handler member who dissented was concerned that approval of limited use size olives would be detrimental to handlers,
due to already large inventories of such olives from the two previous seasons. The recommended grade and size requirements
are the same as those established during the 1990-91 crop year, which means slightly larger minimum sizes than
were in effect during the 1991-92, 1992-93, and 1993-94 crop years. 

The specified sizes for the different olive variety groups are the minimum sizes which are deemed desirable for use
in the production of limited use styles at this time. As in past years, permitting the use of the smaller olives in the
production of limited use styles allowed handlers to take advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced,
and chopped canned ripe olives. Handlers will be able to market more olives with this relaxation in size requirements
than under regulations effective prior to the interim final rule.

The committee also based its decision on certain production and market factors. The last three crop years were the
first crop years that limited use olives were authorized at sizes below the 1990-91 crop year minimum size requirements.
Prior to the 1990-91 crop year, the committee investigated limited use olives that were below permitted minimum
sizes. From investigations and surveys within the industry, the committee determined that limited use olives below
1990-91 minimum sizes could be efficiently sliced using current technology. However, consumer interest in
and need for such olives also had to be determined, specifically for smaller sliced olive rings. Thus, minimum size
requirements below the 1990-91 crop year were recommended and became effective for limited use olives.

During the following three seasons, the industry experienced a higher percentage of broken pieces in the smaller
olives than with the slightly larger sizes. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) define
a broken piece as any piece of olive that is less than three quarters of a full unit. This situation had a negative impact
on the California olive market as the extra broken pieces caused customers to complain about the lack of uniformity
and poorer quality of product from these smaller sizes. Such olives also had to compete with imported sliced olives
that had fewer broken pieces. Therefore, the committee recommended slightly larger minimum size requirements for
limited use olives in order to improve the quality of and enhance the market for California limited use olives.

Also, the committee estimates that production for this crop year is expected to be at 95,000 tons, which is smaller
than the previous two seasons. Weather conditions early in the crop year caused poor pollination resulting in a smaller
crop with an uneven distribution of sizes. The 1992-93 and 1993-94 crop years produced large crops of 163,023
tons and 120,049 tons, respectively. During years with large olive crops, the ratio of limited use olives to other
sizes tends to be higher; there are more limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. During years with
small olive crops, the ratio of smaller olives to other sizes is smaller; there tends to be fewer limited use size olives
in proportion to the other sizes. The increased availability of limited use sized fruit could be reflected in handler
processing for the last three seasons. For example, during the 1992-93 crop year, 19 percent of the olives (163,024
tons) processed by handlers were limited use, and during the 1991-92 crop year, 11 percent of total olives (63,259
tons) processed by handlers were limited use. Although limited use minimum sizes were larger during the 1990-91
season, limited use olives processed by handlers were 16 percent of total olives (126,879 tons) purchased by handlers.
Thus, unlike the two previous seasons, fewer small limited use olives are expected to be harvested this season. The
percentage of limited use olives is expected to be smaller. The slight increase in minimum limited use size requirements
being established for the 1994-95 season is therefore not expected to greatly impact available supplies.

Thus, it is found that permitting limited use olives as recommended by the committee is expected to improve market
conditions, and grower returns, and meet market needs for limited use style olives.

Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives
under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows
smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the
olive import regulation.

Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet
certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in Olive Regulation 1 (7 CFR 944.401). All canned ripe olives
are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release from custody of the United States Custom
Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must be inspected and certified prior to canning.
``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers and heat sterilized under pressure, of two
distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the Standards. The term does not include Spanish-style
green olives.

Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported, disposed of, or shipped for exempt uses.
Exportation or disposal of such olives would be accomplished under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch
of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer.
Exempt olives are those imported for processing into oil or donation to charity. Any person may also import up to 100
pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements.

This final rule finalizes an interim final rule that modified paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation to
authorize the importation of bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for
whole and whole pitted uses to be used in the production of limited use styles during the 1994-1995 crop year.
This rule also finalizes establishment of size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12).

The committee recommended authorizing establishment of minimum sizes for use in the production of limited use styles
during the 1994-95 crop year. The sizes are specified in terms of minimum weights for individual olives in various
variety groups and are the same for both domestic and imported olives. An extra category is continued in the import
regulation to apply comparable requirements for varieties not grown domestically. The minimum sizes for import
requirements are as follows:




Variety Group 1, except the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/90 pound

Variety Group 1 of the Ascolano, Barouni, or St. Agostino varieties_1/140 pound

Variety Group 2, except the Obliza variety_1/180 pound

Variety Group 2 of the Obliza variety_1/140 pound

Olives not identifiable as to variety or variety group_1/180 pound




Each of the categories includes a 35 percent tolerance for olives weighing less than the specified minimum size.

Continuing to permit the use of smaller olives in the production of limited use styles will allow importers to take
better advantage of the strong market for halved, segmented, sliced, and chopped canned ripe olives. Importers will
be able to import and market more olives than would be permitted under regulations prior to the interim final rule that
relaxed size requirements. This additional opportunity is provided to maximize the use of the available olive supply
and facilitate market expansion. Prior to the interim final rule, the smaller fruit could not be imported for limited
uses, and would have to be disposed of through less profitable, non-canning uses under the supervision of the inspection
service, exported, or utilized in exempt outlets.

Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final
rule.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that this final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act.

Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is amending its Regulation H to remove the requirement that a state member bank publish its reports of condition.
The amendment implements section 308 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvements Act of 1994
which contains a number of measures to reduce the burden of federal regulation in depository institutions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title III of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvements Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-325, 108
Stat. 2160) (the Act) contains a number of measures to reduce the burden of federal regulation on depository institutions.
Title III, section 308, amended the Federal Reserve Act to repeal the requirement in section 9, paragraph 6 (12 U.S.C.
324) that state member banks publish their reports of condition. Section 308 also removed similar publication requirements
in the National Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 


The Board's Regulation H, Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System, currently requires
that a state member bank publish its report of condition (Forms FFIEC 031-034) within 20 days of the date the call
for a report of condition is issued. 12 CFR 208.10(a). The report of condition is included in the Consolidated Reports
of Condition and Income, usually referred to as the ``Call Report,'' that state member banks generally are required
to submit on a quarterly basis. 
In order to achieve the reduction in regulatory burden intended under the Act, the Board is removing the provisions
of Regulation H that require publication of a state member bank's report of condition. The amendments delete paragraphs
(a) and (b) of  208.10 of the regulation. Additionally, the section is renamed to reflect the subject of the remaining
paragraph, in which the Board exercises its authority under section 21 of the Federal Reserve Act to waive submission
of reports of affiliates by state member banks required under section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act. 
The Board notes that a bank's Call Reports, including its reports of condition, will continue to be publicly available
through the National Technical Information Service of the United States Department of Commerce under the Board's
Rules Regarding Availability of Information. See 12 CFR 261.6(c)(3). Additionally, state member banks will continue
to be required to advise shareholders, customers, and the general public of the availability of year-end Call Reports
or other financial information under  208.17 of Regulation H. See 12 CFR 208.17. The Board believes that these
provisions are sufficient to ensure that adequate information is available to the public with respect to the condition
of a state member bank. Additionally, the amendment has no effect on any publication requirements that may be imposed
on a state member bank under state law. 


Notice and Public Participation 


The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act relating to notice and public participation (5 U.S.C. 553(b))
have not been followed in connection with the adoption of these amendments, as the amendments implement a statutory
provision that is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on banks. The Board therefore finds good cause for determining,
and so determines, that notice and public participation are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 
The provisions of the Act relating to notice of the effective date of a rule (5 U.S.C. 553(d)) have not been followed
in connection with the adoption of these amendments. Section 308 of the Act was effective as of the date of enactment
(September 24, 1994), and the Board is amending Regulation H promptly to implement the statutory provision. For this
reason, the Board finds there is good cause to determine, and so determines, that notice is not necessary and would
be contrary to the purpose of section 308. These amendments have therefore been published in final with an immediate
effective date. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Because the Board finds that no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, a statement concerning the effects of the
rule on small entities is also not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 5 U.S.C. 604. The Board notes, however,
that the proposed amendments will reduce the regulatory burden imposed on all state member banks. The amendments
should be particularly helpful to smaller institutions for which the publication requirement represent a more significant
cost burden.

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series
airplanes, that requires inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies
and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies, and modification or replacement
of the wheel subassemblies. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks and broken spokes found on certain main
wheel assemblies of these airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of a main wheel assembly
during takeoff or landing.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9450). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracks of certain demountable
flange (inboard) wheel subassemblies and of the bolt bosses on certain demountable flange (outboard) wheel subassemblies,
and modification or replacement of the wheel subassemblies.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
One commenter requests that proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to provide credit for inspections accomplished
within the last 500 landings before the final rule becomes effective. This commenter has been performing the repetitive
inspections proposed in the AD. The commenter indicates that accomplishment of these inspections has proven to provide
an acceptable level of safety by detecting all cracking before a critical cumulative defect size has been exceeded.
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. The FAA finds that the requested change is unnecessary because
such credit is provided by the statement in the AD, ``Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.'' Any
operator that has accomplished the required inspections may take credit for those inspections provided that the
repetitive inspections are accomplished in accordance with the requirements of this AD.
The same commenter also requests that paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of the proposed rule be revised to clarify that
the modification must be accomplished prior to further flight following the third inspection accomplished after
the effective date of the AD. Since the commenter has been conducting the proposed inspections, the FAA infers from
this commenter's request that it would like credit for those inspections without having to modify the wheel subassemblies
sooner than the AD would require had the operator not conducted any inspections.
The FAA concurs that clarification is necessary, and has revised paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of the final rule to
clarify its intent that the modification must be accomplished prior to further flight following the third inspection
accomplished after the effective date of this AD.
This commenter also requests that paragraph (c) of the proposed rule be revised to delete the words ``and modified.''
The commenter points out that wheel subassemblies that are inspected in accordance with the proposal may remain in
service until the third inspection after the effective date of the AD, at which time those subassemblies must be modified.
Therefore, a wheel subassembly that has been inspected in accordance with the proposed rule would be considered to
be safe. The FAA finds that clarification is necessary. Paragraph (c) of the final rule has been revised to specify
that certain parts may not be installed on the airplane unless the part has been inspected and subsequently modified
in accordance with the requirements of this AD.
The FAA has revised paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of the final rule to indicate that the replacement procedures required
by those paragraphs are found in the Airplane Maintenance Manual. This information was omitted inadvertently from
the proposal.
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
The FAA estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $66,990, or $770 per airplane.
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Airworthiness Directives; Bombardier (Formerly Canadair) Model CL-600-2B19 
(Regional Jet Series 100) Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Bombardier Model CL-600-2B19 series airplanes, that requires modification of 
the stall protection system (SPS) input wiring; a revision to the FAA-approved Airplane 
Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must 
be conducted prior to engine start; and modification of the stall protection computer 
(SPC) to accept restored dual attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) input. This 
amendment is prompted by a report that the AHRS could send conflicting input to the 
SPC on the airplane. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of 
stall warning protection on the airplanes.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Bombardier Model CL-600-2B19 (Regional Jet Series 100) series airplanes
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10340). That action proposed to require modification of the stall protection system (SPS) input
wiring; a revision to the Normal Procedures section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to specify that
a pre-flight check of the slip/skid indications must be conducted prior to engine start; and modification of the attitude
and heading reference system (AHRS) to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter requests that the FAA revise the final rule to indicate that it is not 
the AHRS that will be modified, but the stall protection computer (SPC). The FAA 
concurs, and has revised the preamble and paragraph (c) of the final rule to clarify its 
intent that the SPC be modified to restore the dual AHRS inputs to the SPC. 

The commenter also requests that the proposed compliance time of 6 months for 
modification of the SPC, as specified in paragraph (c) of the proposed rule, be extended 
due to the complex nature of the SPC modification and the need to modify additional 
equipment to support the SPC change. The commenter proposes a target date of April 4, 
1995, for accomplishment of the modification. As justification for this suggested 
extension, the commenter states that the SPC software will detect a loss of AHRS input to 
both SPC channels, and a ``STALL FAIL'' amber message will be displayed; additionally, 
the AFM defines abnormal procedures to be followed when loss of the SPS occurs. The 
commenter adds that there are several components in the SPS that can fail and cause the 
loss of stall protection on any one flight. The commenter believes that the loss of AHRS 
input is no worse than, and the system is just as reliable as, a system with two 
independent AHRS inputs. 

The FAA does not concur. Compliance times for AD's are normally based on a 
parameter related to failure of a particular component. The FAA has determined that 
there is no apparent direct relationship between the transmittal of conflicting input from 
the AHRS to the SPC (and subsequent loss of stall warning protection on the airplane) 
and a calendar date. Therefore, the FAA does not consider that the compliance time for 
modification of the SPC should be expressed in terms of a calendar date, as suggested by 
the commenter. 

Further, in developing a compliance time for this requirement of the rule, the FAA 
considered not only the safety implications, but the availability of required parts and the 
practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval of time 
allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. 
In light of these items, the FAA finds that a compliance time of 6 months is appropriate. 
(Additionally, based on the effective date of this final rule, the compliance time for 
operators to perform the modification will fall close to the calendar date requested by the 
commenter.) 

A new paragraph (d) has been added to the final rule to clarify the FAA's intent 
that modification of the SPC constitutes terminating action for the AFM revision required 
by paragraph (b) of this AD. Therefore, once the SPC is modified, the AFM revision 
may be removed from the AFM. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
AD. 

The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The cost for required parts 
will be minimal. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. 
operators is estimated to be $990, or $110 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model ATP Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes, that requires modification of the power 
supply for the communications system. This amendment is prompted by reports of loss 
of power to the communications system due to an electrical fault in the ground crew jack 
box or the handset of the public address (PA) system. The actions specified by this AD 
are intended to prevent the inability of the flight crew to communicate with passengers 
via the PA system and with air traffic control due to loss of power to the communication 
system, which may lead to unsafe operation of the airplane. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes series airplanes was 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24382). That action 
proposed to require modification of the power supply for the communications system. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the 
FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 

Since issuance of the notice, Jetstream has issued errata sheets Numbers 1, 2, and 
4, pertaining to Service Bulletin ATP-23-21-35288A. Erratum No. 1 was issued 
March 14, 1994, and adds an additional part number to the list of pertinent cable looms 
that appeared in Revision 2 of Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-23-21-35288A. Erratum 
No. 2 was issued April 25, 1994, and corrects certain editorial errors that appeared in that 
same service bulletin. Erratum No. 4 was issued June 1, 1994, and includes an additional 
reference to the fuse and circuit breaker index that appeared in that same service bulletin. 
The final rule has been revised to add a note referencing the existence of these errata 
sheets. These errata sheets do not require any further work by operators who have 
previously complied with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-23-21-35288A, Revision 2, 
dated February 15, 1994. 

After careful review of the available data, the FAA has determined that air safety 
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously 
described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic 
burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
that it will take approximately 30 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required 
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will be 
provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total 
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $18,000, or $1,800 per 
airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-8-70 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model
DC-8-70 series airplanes, that currently requires replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust
nozzle plug splice, and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. This amendment
requires modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies as terminating action for the currently required replacement
and check. This amendment is prompted by reports of loose or missing attachments at the splice joint of the engine forward
and aft 
exhaust plugs, and loss of the rear exhaust plug following an engine bird strike. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent reduced integrity of the engine exhaust plug installation, which may lead to separation of exhaust
plugs from the airplane, and create a hazard to persons and property on the ground.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 83-02-05,
amendment 39-4544 (48 FR 5539, February 7, 1983), which is applicable to all McDonnell Douglas Model DC-8-70
series airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38144). The action proposed to require replacement of all attachment screws at the exhaust nozzle
plug splice, and a check of nut plates for running torque and replacement of nut plates, if necessary. The action also
proposed to require modification of the engine exhaust plug assemblies; when accomplished, this modification would
terminate the need for the currently required replacement and check.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposed rule. 

One commenter requests that the compliance time for the accomplishment of the modification be extended from the proposed
24 months to 60 months. This commenter states that it would have to procure additional spare engines and would need
to special schedule its fleet of airplanes to accomplish this modification within the proposed compliance time.
This would entail considerable expense over what was estimated in the FAA's cost impact analysis. The commenter indicates
that a compliance time of 60 months would allow the modification to be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance,
thereby eliminating any additional expenses. 

The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered the safety
implications, parts availability, and the practical aspect of installing the required modification during normal
maintenance schedules. In light of this, the FAA does not consider it appropriate to change the compliance time for
all operators based on the unique circumstances of an individual operator. On the other hand, paragraph (c) of the
AD provides that an individual may request an adjustment of compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety,
and this would be the appropriate means for the commenter to seek the requested relief. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

There are approximately 110 Model DC-8-70 series airplanes of the affected 
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 78 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that
it will take approximately 46 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required modification, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $21,400 per airplane. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,866,540, 
or $23,930 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) as the controlling agency for Restricted Area
R-3302, Savanna, IL. This is an administrative change initiated by the Chicago ARTCC to facilitate joint use
of the airspace. There are no changes to the boundaries, altitudes, time of designation, or activities conducted
within the restricted area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Rule 


This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations adds the Chicago ARTCC as the controlling agency for
R-3302, Savanna, IL. This change was initiated by the Chicago ARTCC and coordinated with the U.S. Army to facilitate
joint use of the airspace. This will allow access for general aviation aircraft when the special use airspace is not
active. Because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested, I find
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Section 73.33 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally 
current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Environmental Review 


This action adds the controlling agency for the restricted area. There are no changes to the boundaries, altitudes,
time of designation, or activities conducted within the restricted area. Accordingly, this action is not subject
to environmental assessments and procedures as set forth in FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering
Environmental Impacts.''

Technical Corrections to the Customs Regulations Relating to Customs Modernization 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations by making certain technical corrections necessitated by one of the
Customs Modernization provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, which went into
effect when signed on December 8, 1993. The changes involve the time period that Customs must retain goods seized for
certain intellectual property violations before the goods can be sold.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Customs Modernization provisions contained in Title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act of 1993, Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057 (the NAFTA Act), went into effect when the NAFTA Act was signed
on December 8, 1993 (section 692 of the NAFTA Act). One of the changes effected by this legislation was an amendment
to 19 U.S.C. 1526(e)(3), which involves the time period for retention of goods seized by Customs for certain intellectual
property rights violations. Section 663 of the NAFTA Act amended 19 U.S.C. 1526(e)(3) to allow Customs to sell merchandise
bearing a counterfeit trademark at a public auction 90 days after the forfeiture of the merchandise if Customs has
determined that a need for the merchandise has not been established by any federal, state, or local government or eleemosynary
institution. Prior to this amendment, the statute had required Customs to wait more than one year before the sale of
the merchandise by appropriate Customs officers. 
As a result of the changes in 19 U.S.C. 526(e)(3), corresponding changes are required in the Customs Regulations,
in  133.52(c)(3) (19 CFR 133.52(c)(3)). 


Discussion of Changes 


In 19 CFR 133.52(c)(3), the time period is changed from ``one year'' to ``90 days,'' and the entity responsible for
the sale is changed from ``the Commissioner or his designee'' to ``the Customs Service.'' 


Inapplicability of Public Notice and Comment 
Requirements, Delayed Effective Date Reguirements, 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and 
Executive Order 12866 


Inasmuch as these amendments merely conform the Customs Regulations to existing law, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.(a)(2)
and (b)(3)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with notice and public procedure thereon as unnecessary. For the
same reason, good cause exists for dispensing with the requirement for a delayed effective date, under 5 U.S.C. (a)(2)
and (d)(3). Since this document is not subject to the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, it is
not subject to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). This amendment does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in Executive Order
12866.

Penalty Guidelines Applicable to Transshipped 
Textiles and Textile Products 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the revised penalty guidelines pertaining to section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
by adopting the interim rule that added, as an example of an aggravating factor in arriving at a final administrative
penalty decision, violations involving the illegal importation and entry of transshipped textiles and textile
products. This amendment will enhance the U.S. textile import program and other programs or laws administered or
enforced by Customs which involve a determination of the country of origin of imported merchandise.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background





Customs is confronted with a continuing problem involving textiles and textile products which, after exportation
from their country of origin, are transshipped through a second country, thereby facilitating a false or otherwise
unlawful statement, act, or omission regarding the country of origin of the merchandise when ultimately imported
and entered in the United States. Such statements, acts or omissions may impinge on a number of programs or laws administered
or enforced by Customs, including country of origin marking requirements, textile quota limitations and visa requirements
under the U.S. textile import program, duty assessment and collection, and collection of trade statistics. The consequences
of such unlawful statements, acts or omissions may include interference with the consumer's right to make an informed
decision regarding a prospective purchase, undermining of bilateral and multilateral textile agreements to which
the United States is a party and with resulting injury to domestic producers of textiles and textile products, loss
of revenue, and inability to maintain proper trade statistics to support overall U.S. trade policy and analysis.




Under section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), a penalty may be assessed against any party
who has committed fraud, gross negligence or negligence in connection with the unlawful entry of any merchandise
in the United States, including textiles and textile products that have been transshipped in the circumstances described
above. Provisions relating to the filing of petitions, and action upon petitions, for relief from fines, penalties
and forfeitures incurred under laws administered by Customs, including penalties under section 592, are set forth
in Part 171 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 171). Appendix B to Part 171 sets forth Revised Penalty Guidelines
under section 592. Although Appendix B is not intended to have regulatory effect, it represents the official Customs
position regarding the standards that are generally applicable to the administrative review of petitions for remission
or mitigation of penalties incurred under section 592. Appendix B includes, in section (G), certain factors that
may be determined by Customs to be aggravating factors in arriving at a final administrative penalty decision. Appendix
B is currently undergoing review within Customs with a view to publication of a proposed revision of those guidelines,
with opportunity for public comment, in the near future. 



Notwithstanding the upcoming revision of Appendix B to Part 171 and the intended solicitation of public comments
thereon, Customs determined that immediate action should be taken in a penalty mitigation context to address the
textile and textile products transshipment problem described above. Customs notes that transshipments have resulted
in material false statements, acts or omissions regarding the country of origin of the imported merchandise, including
false designations of origin. Consequently, it is Customs position that transshipment must be susceptible to treatment
as an aggravating factor in arriving at a final mitigated section 592 penalty decision under Part 171 of the regulations.




On March 30, 1994, Customs published as T.D. 94-29 an interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14745) to amend section (G) of Appendix B to Part 171 by adding a reference to ``transshipment in the case of textiles
and textile products affecting a country of origin determination'' as an aggravating factor. Although this change
was effective for merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after April 1, 1994, Customs
stated that it would consider any comments submitted. 



Customs received eleven comments in response to the interim rule. The comments received, and Customs responses to
them, where appropriate, are set forth below. 




Comment Analysis





The comments received ostensibly fell into two categories: those unequivocally endorsing the interim rule as written
(three comments); and those opposing the interim rule or seeking to limit its application (eight comments).

Comments Supporting the Interim Rule 


The three commenters supporting the interim rule expressed concern over Customs ability to combat transshipment
resulting in an unlawful entry of textiles and textile products, and were of the opinion that the interim rule, as written,
would serve as a useful deterrent to such unlawful practices. 


Comments Opposing the Interim Rule 


Regarding the eight commenters opposing the interim rule or seeking to limit its application, three claimed that
the interim rule unfairly discriminated against textile importers by holding such importers to a higher standard
of care than that required of parties importing other merchandise. Two of these three commenters indicated that it
was illogical for Customs to consider the act of transshipment an aggravating factor when, in fact, the act of transshipment
constitutes the violation in question or, at least, an element of the violation. Put another way, these two commenters
were of the opinion that aggravating factors cannot constitute the violation in question. Otherwise, according
to one of these commenters, undervaluation logically would have to be an aggravating factor in cases involving understatement
of value. 
Two other commenters stated that the interim rule should be limited in its application to those instances where the
importer had actual knowledge of the improper transshipment of the textile products at issue. 
Regarding the remaining three commenters fully opposed to the interim rule, they objected on the basis that the rule
constituted the imposition of unfair additional penalties and that mitigation in such cases would become meaningless.
These commenters felt that existing guidelines were adequate and that the interim rule was not in keeping with the
spirit of the recently enacted Customs Modernization Act. One of these commenters also expressed concern that the
rule would permit Customs to raise the assessed penalty in cases involving transshipment. Finally, one of the commenters
indicated that rules such as the interim rule have forced the closure of his apparel importing company. 


Customs Response 


Customs acknowledges the concerns expressed by those commenters opposed to the interim rule on the basis that the
rule discriminates against textile importers, but the importing community and domestic industry must, in Customs
opinion, acknowledge the dilemma faced by the agency, namely, balancing the interests of the importer against the
explosion of illegal transshipments to the United States. Aside from the obvious negative impact such shipments
can have on domestic industry, illegally transshipped goods deceive U.S. consumers regarding the country of origin
of imported merchandise, as well as distort the application of bilateral agreements with our trading partners. When
faced with similar situations, Customs has had to take enforcement actions which focus on specific commodities or
types of merchandise. In effect, the interim rule provides a warning to textile importers about the threat of illegal
transshipment and suggests that such importers take extra pre-importation measures to ensure the accuracy of the
country of origin of the products in question. 
Contrary to some commenters' views, it is clear that these textile transshipments do not, 

per se,

 constitute a violation of section 1592. Such transshipments may, or may not, result in false statements concerning
the country of origin on entry documents, or goods being falsely marked with an incorrect country of origin. Consequently,
a violation occurs at the time when the transshipped textile goods arrive for entry in the United States and are falsely
marked, or the entry documents contain culpable, material false statements, omissions or acts. In other words, with
respect to the circumstances under discussion, the act of textile transshipment does not, in and of itself, constitute
a violation of section 1592. 
With respect to those commenters who recommended implementation of the rule provided that it only apply to those instances
where the importer has actual knowledge of the improper transshipment, Customs notes that application of this aggravating
factor would first require that Customs establish a violation of section 1592. If the importer is an innocent party
to the transaction, then that importer will not be considered culpable, and therefore, cannot be charged with a violation
of section 1592. 
Customs also would like to clear up what appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the meaning of the term ``aggravating
factor'' and the practical impact of the presence of an aggravating factor in a penalty situation. First, as indicated
above, aggravating factors alone do not constitute a violation of section 1592. Second, contrary to some commenters'
belief, the presence of an aggravating factor does not increase or decrease the asserted level of culpability set
forth in Customs section 1592 prepenalty and/or penalty notices. For example, in the case of an importer's material
grossly negligent false statement of origin on an entry document, Customs does not increase the asserted level of
culpability to fraud because the goods were transshipped. Rather, in arriving at the administrative disposition
in a penalty action, Customs treats the presence of an aggravating factor (designated as such in the Customs guidelines)
as an offset to the presence of a mitigating factor. It should also be noted that because the interim rule involves Customs
penalty guidelines and such guidelines are neither statutory nor regulatory, per se, certain circumstances may
warrant deviation from the ordinary application of the guidelines.

Customs also is of the opinion that the interim rule is, in fact, in keeping with the spirit of the Customs Modernization
provisions (Title VI) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the Act), Public Law 103-182,
107 Stat. 2057 (December 8, 1993). Both the language of the Act and its legislative history clearly set forth the concepts
of ``shared responsibility'' and ``informed compliance'' as critical to its effectiveness and application. In
the instant situation, the interim rule is one of the measures Customs intends to use to address the significant problem
of illegal transshipment. The interim rule informs the textile importer that he or she can avoid application of the
interim rule by taking adequate measures prior to importation to attempt to ensure the accuracy and completeness
of the information provided to Customs at the time of entry, including proper marking or other indication of the country
of origin of the articles. In light of the problems associated with illegal transshipment, Customs believes that
it is not unreasonable to expect textile importers to exert diligence in attempting to verify the source of their goods
prior to importation commensurate with the statutory requirement to exercise reasonable care in presenting documentation
to Customs during the entry process. If a textile importer can demonstrate that such measures were taken (i.e., the
importer was not culpable and acted with reasonable care), then there can be no violation of section 1592 because culpability
is a requisite element of such a violation. Put another way, the interim rule does not apply to those textile importers
who responsibly take such adequate measures prior to importation. 
In view of the foregoing, Customs is adopting the text of the interim rule as final without change. 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Executive Order 12866 


Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

North Carolina; Final Authorization of Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions of HSWA Cluster I promulgated
November 8, 1984, through June 30, 1987. The Environmental Protection Agency has reviewed North Carolina's application
and has made a decision, subject to review and comment, that North Carolina's hazardous waste program revision satisfies
all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North Carolina's
hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's application for program revisions is available for public
review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 

A. Background 



States with final authorization under Section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'')
allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements
promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the
HSWA requirements under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the
HSWA requirements. 

In accordance with Part 271,  271.21(a) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 271.21(a)), revisions
to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified
or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's
regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270. 



B. North Carolina 



North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984,
(49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final authorization effective June 3, 1994, for RCRA Cluster
II (59 FR 15633, April 4, 1994). On October 29, 1991, North Carolina submitted a program revision application for additional
program approval for the requirements of HSWA Cluster I. EPA granted North Carolina interim authorization for HSWA
Cluster I effective June 1, 1993. Today, North Carolina is seeking final authorization of its program revisions in
accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 

EPA has reviewed North Carolina's application and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the HSWA Cluster I program modifications to North Carolina. The public
may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until December 12, 1994. 

Copies of North Carolina's application for these program revisions are available for inspection and copying at the
locations indicated in the ``Addresses'' section of this notice. 

Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective January 9, 1995, unless an adverse comment
pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 

If an adverse comment is received, EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision; or (2)
a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or
reverses the decision. 

EPA issues, administers, and enforces RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits, that contain conditions
based upon the Federal program provisions for which the State has not received authorization. Upon the effective
date of this authorization, EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions for which the State
is being authorized. Any permits, or portions of permits, that were issued by EPA prior to the effective date of this
authorization will be terminated pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d). Those permits, or portions of permits, issued by EPA
not terminated pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d) will either: (1) Be modified to allow for an earlier expiration date pursuant
to 40 CFR 270.41 (a); or (2) be administered by the State until the permit is reissued. 

North Carolina is today seeking authority to administer the following Federal requirements promulgated between
November 8, 1984, through June 30, 1987:

With the passage of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), responsibilities for hazardous waste
permitting in North Carolina were split between EPA and the State. Upon receiving interim authorization for HSWA
corrective action, North Carolina assumed responsibility for HSWA corrective action for new permits. EPA continued
to administer and enforce federal permits issued prior to the interim authorization. Upon final authorization of
the State program for those provisions specified above, EPA will suspend issuance of federal permits in those areas
for which the State is receiving authorization. Additionally, EPA will terminate, pursuant to 40 CFR 124.5(d), federal
permits or portions of permits containing those provisions specified above and issued prior to the effective date
of this authorization. A discussion of how North Carolina and EPA will delineate permitting responsibilities is
contained in the EPA-North Carolina Memorandum of Agreement. 

North Carolina is not authorized to operate the federal program on Indian lands. This authority remains with EPA unless
provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation. 




C. Decision 




I conclude that North Carolina's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste
program as revised. 




North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations
of HSWA, the Memorandum of Agreement, and this notice. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities,
although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under Section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under
Sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 

This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year)
flood elevations for new buildings and their contents.

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base flood elevation determinations are
available for inspection is provided. 



Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 

The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 

For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.


The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 

These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities. 

The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4. 




National Environmental Policy Act



This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program.
No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. 



Regulatory Classification



This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism



This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated
October 26, 1987. 




Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 



This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 



List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 65



Flood insurance, Floodplains, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 





Accordingly, 44 CFR part 65 is amended to read as follows:

Western Pacific Crustacean Fisheries 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues a final rule to implement selected measures of Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Crustacean
Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region (FMP). The rule eliminates a 2-year landing requirement for permit renewal,
which had an unintended detrimental effect on lobster fishery permit holders. The rule also modifies existing notification
and reporting procedures. The implemented changes are intended to improve administration, monitoring, and enforcement
of the fishery. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The WPFMC developed Amendment 8 to the FMP and submitted it to NMFS for approval. A proposed rule to implement Amendment
8 was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40515). The proposed rule provided background on the following provisions of Amendment 8:
(1) Removing the requirement for a vessel to land at least four lobsters for each trap normally used during 1 of the 2
most recent years in which fishing was allowed as a condition of permit renewal; (2) establishing a framework procedure
for reviewing, with the possibility of changing, the target catch-per-unit-of effort (CPUE) used in the formula
to derive the quota for the fishery from 1.0 lobster per trap-haul to a number that is more reflective of the current
status of the lobster resource; (3) establishing a framework procedure authorizing, under some circumstances,
fishing for the purposes of obtaining fisheries data or alleviating economic hardship, when the initial quota is
zero; (4) requiring vessel owners to notify NMFS of the location and time of offloading of their catch; and (5) requiring
information from the first-level buyer to be attached to the Sales Report, if available, and requiring first-level
buyers to make records of their transactions involving management unit species available to authorized officials.



The measures establishing framework procedures for the review and possible change of the target level of the CPUE
in the model used to calculate the annual quota and to allow fishing under some circumstances when the initial quota
is zero (numbers 2 and 3 above) have been disapproved by NMFS. These two measures are neither necessary nor appropriate
for conservation and management of the fishery as required by section 303(a)(1)(A) of the Magnuson Act. 
There has been a substantial decrease in recruitment to the lobster fishery. This, the total closure of the fishery
during the 1993 season, and the great difference between the initial quota and the final quota during the 1994 season
has prompted a complete review of the model used to determine the annual quotas and the quota system in general. For
this reason, the provision allowing changes in the target CPUE pursuant to framework procedures is premature. Any
change in the model should be postponed until an analysis of the model is available. 
The purposes of the framework procedure under which fishing might be allowed when the initial quota is zero are to obtain
fisheries data or to relieve economic hardship. The proposal to consider allowing fishing to relieve economic hardship
is ambiguous because the term ``economic hardship'' is not defined. Without defining the term, it is unclear how and
when allowing fishing would be considered and how it would meet the goals of the FMP. Allowing fishing to collect data
duplicates section 681.26 of the implementing regulations regarding experimental fishing. Issuing experimental
fishing permits is an effective way of allowing fishing that ordinarily would not be permitted so that fisheries data
can be collected. The other provisions of Amendment 8 have been approved. 


Comment and Response 


Only one comment was received on the proposed rule. 


Comment: 

One individual commented that eliminating the landing requirement gives the resource in perpetuity to those who
currently hold permits. He felt the point system for new entry should be maintained. The holders of these permits may
or may not view the fishery as a long-term trust. This commenter also indicated it was a mistake to allow the transfer
of permits given that carrying capacity now exceeds the capacity of the resource. 

Response: 

The issues of maintaining the point system or not allowing the transfer of permits are not within the scope of Amendment
8. 
Nevertheless, the landing requirement, coupled with transferable limited entry permits, was intended to ensure
that there always would be sufficient capacity to harvest the optimum yield. The number of permitted vessels was based
on an assumption of stable recruitment and would provide the greatest economic return from the fishery. Presently,
productivity of the resource is low and the harvesting capacity of the fleet is greater than needed; however, the Council
did not propose changing the number of permits allowed in the fishery. There are numerous restrictions to protect
the resource, including size limits, a closed season, protection of berried females, and a quota based on productivity
of the resource. When productivity is low, the quota is low. 
Eliminating the landing requirement relieves vessel owners from fishing for lobster when investing fishing effort
would be poor business; therefore, an unforeseen and unintended economic burden will be removed. The point system
has not resulted in and would not be expected to result in new entry. Permits are transferable, and permit holders would
likely transfer permits rather than forfeit them. In addition, at low quota levels, there may be risks of overrunning
the quota before the fishery can be closed.

Changes From the Proposed Rule 



The changes in the Quota Management Program ( 681.31) described in the proposed rule have not been approved;
therefore, those revisions have been dropped from the final rule and  681.31 remains unchanged. Also in the
final rule, the definition of ``forecast quota'' is not added to replace the definition of ``initial quota'' because
this was intended to implement one of the disapproved measures. No other changes were made to the proposed rule. 



Classification 



This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. The collection
of this information has been approved by the OMB under OMB Control Number 0648-0214. A notification requirement
before offloading of the catch is added. The existing sales report is modified by eliminating certain data elements.
First-level buyers can choose to submit a worksheet in lieu of allowing an authorized officer to access, inspect,
and copy records relating to their sales. The estimated total reporting burden (assuming that all 15 permit holders
will take 4 trips per year) is estimated at 5 minutes per response. This includes the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to NMFS and OMB (see

amended by subsequent 1988, 1989, and 1990 legislation. 
These provisions make significant changes in the process of 
surveying skilled nursing facilities under Medicare and 
nursing facilities under Medicaid and in the process for 
certifying that these facilities meet the Federal 
requirements for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs. They also set forth a number of alternative 
remedies which may be imposed on facilities that do not 
comply with the Federal participation requirements (instead 
of or in addition to termination), and specify remedies for 
State survey agencies that do not meet surveying 
requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


To participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, 
long-term care facilities must be certified as meeting Federal participation requirements. Long-term care 
facilities include skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) for 
Medicare and nursing facilities (NFs) for Medicaid. The 
Federal participation requirements for these facilities are 
specified in HCFA regulations at 42 CFR part 483, subparts A 
through C. 
Section 1864(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) 
authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with State 
survey agencies to determine whether SNFs meet the Federal 
participation requirements for Medicare. Section 
1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act provides for State survey agencies 
to perform the same survey tasks for facilities 
participating or seeking to participate in the Medicaid 
program. The results of Medicare and Medicaid related 
surveys are used by HCFA and the Medicaid State agency, 
respectively, as the basis for a decision to enter into, 
deny, or terminate a provider agreement with the facility. 
To assess compliance with Federal participation 
requirements, surveyors conduct onsite inspections (surveys) 
of facilities. In the survey process surveyors directly 
observe the actual provision of care and services to 
residents and the effect or possible effects of that care to 
assess whether the care provided meets the assessed needs of 
individual residents. 
SNFs that are approved for participation in the 
Medicare program also meet the participation requirements 
for the Medicaid program. However, the Medicaid State 
agency is not obligated to enter into a Medicaid provider 
agreement with a facility just because the Secretary has 
entered into a Medicare provider agreement with the 
facility. Additionally, if a State imposes Medicaid 
requirements that exceed those of Medicare, section 1863 of 
the Act provides that the higher requirements must be met by 
the Medicare SNFs in that State. 
Before the 1987 legislation, the only adverse actions 
available to HCFA and the States against facilities that 
were determined to be out of compliance with Federal 
participation requirements included termination, nonrenewal, 
or automatic cancellation of provider agreements; denial of 
participation for prospective facilities; and denial of 
payment for new admissions in lieu of termination when the 
facilities had deficiencies that did not pose an immediate 
and serious threat to the health and safety of residents. 
(The denial of payment action has been considered an 
``alternative'' sanction because it is an alternative to 
termination.)

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 
'87), Public Law 100-203, enacted on December 22, 1987, 
amended the Act to incorporate specific provisions for 
nursing home reform. These provisions included specific 
revised requirements for the survey and certification 
process (section 4202 for Medicare and section 4212 for 
Medicaid) and for the enforcement process (sections 4203 and 
4213). Sections 4202 and 4212 of OBRA '87 added new 
sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) to the Act to revise and expand 
Medicare and Medicaid provisions, respectively, on State and 
Federal responsibilities for survey and certification, types 
of and requirements for surveys, survey team composition and 
responsibilities, requirements for validation surveys, 
procedures for investigating complaints and monitoring 
compliance, disclosure of results of inspections and 
activities, and provisions for penalties imposed on the 
States for failure to comply with survey process 
requirements. Sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87 added 
sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) to the Act to specify the 
Medicare and Medicaid enforcement process, respectively, and 
specified remedies for noncompliance to be used in lieu of 
or in addition to termination of facilities' participation 
in the programs. Section 411 of the Medicare Catastrophic 
Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA), Public Law 100-360, enacted on 
July 1, 1988, also included a number of technical and 
correcting amendments affecting these OBRA '87 provisions. 
These changes will be discussed in detail later in this 
preamble. 
On August 28, 1992, we published a proposed rule in the 


Federal Register

 (57 FR 39278) setting forth our proposal 
for altering the requirements for surveying facilities and 
expanding the choice of alternative remedies for HCFA and 
the Medicaid State agency to apply in lieu of or in addition 
to termination of facilities that do not comply with 
participation requirements. In the proposed rule we said 
that our goal is to promote facility compliance by ensuring 
that all deficient providers are appropriately sanctioned. 
Termination is still possible any time a facility is 
identified as having deficiencies, and if a facility 
continues to have deficiencies after a specified period of 
time, the law requires that Federal payments for services in 
that facility cease at that time. 
In the proposed rule we indicated that we are 
implementing the Congress' mandate, as indicated in OBRA 
'87, to abandon our traditional hierarchical requirement 
system and develop a system capable of detecting and 
responding to noncompliance with any requirement. The 
system we proposed was built on the assumption that all 
requirements must be met and enforced and that requirements 
take on greater or lesser significance as a function of the 
circumstances and resident outcomes in a particular facility 
at the time of survey. The surveyors will determine the 
existence or nonexistence of immediate and serious threat to 
residents as well as the severity and scope of a deficiency 
to arrive at a conclusion as to the seriousness of that 
deficiency in that facility. The proposed regulations 
incorporated scope and severity surveyor guides for 
determining the remedy or remedies to apply. We also 
proposed that the selection of a particular remedy be based 
on the nature of the deficiencies and the remedy (or 
remedies) that either HCFA or the Medicaid State agency 
believes is most likely to achieve correction of the 
deficiencies. As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe 
that remedies applied in the manner described within the 
proposed regulations will deter violations as well as 
encourage immediate response and sustained compliance.

The new system also proposed changes in the enforcement 
authority for dually participating (Medicare and Medicaid) 
facilities. OBRA '89 provided the basis for decisions as to 
whether the State's or the Secretary's determination of 
compliance or noncompliance or choice of remedies is binding 
in the case of a dually participating facility. Moreover, 
the statute at section 1919(h)(8), provides that whether 
certification decisions and enforcement actions, as applied 
to Medicaid, are those of the Secretary or the State, the 
same certification decision and enforcement actions will 
also apply to Medicare in a dually participating facility. 
In addition, the statute specifies whether the Secretary's 
or State's certification decision and enforcement remedies 
will prevail in the case of Federal validation surveys. Our 
August 28, 1992 proposed rule reflected these changes. 


II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 


In the proposed rule published on August 28, 1992 in 
the 

Federal Register

, we proposed to implement the 
provisions of OBRA '87, as further amended by subsequent 
1988, 1989, and 1990 legislation. The specific proposals 
were as follows: 


A. Routine Process of Certification and Enforcement 


1. State-Operated Facilities 


We proposed at  488.155 and  488.180 that in all 
State-operated facilities, the State survey agency conduct 
the survey, recommend to HCFA a certification of compliance 
or noncompliance and recommend appropriate enforcement 
action(s). After the survey agency forwards its survey 
findings and recommended certification and enforcement 
action(s) to HCFA, HCFA in turn would certify facility 
compliance or noncompliance and impose any enforcement 
action(s). 


2. Non-State Operated Facilities 


At   488.155 and 488.180, we proposed the following: 
 For non-State operated SNFs, to continue to use the 
process in effect before October 1, 1990, whereby the State 
survey agency conducts the survey and certifies compliance 
or noncompliance with Federal requirements subject to HCFA 
approval. We also proposed that the survey agency recommend 
appropriate remedies, and that, after the survey agency 
forwards its survey findings and recommended enforcement 
action(s) to HCFA for review, HCFA determines the compliance 
or noncompliance of the facility and imposes any enforcement 
action(s). 
 For non-State operated NFs, to continue to use the 
process in effect before October 1, 1990, whereby the survey 
agency conducts the survey, certifies compliance or 
noncompliance with Federal requirements, and recommends 
appropriate enforcement actions to HCFA and the Medicaid 
State agency. The certification of compliance or 
noncompliance by the State is final except in the case of a 
complaint or validation survey, or review of the State's 
findings by HCFA in which the Secretary substitutes her 
judgment for that of the State. Except where the Secretary 
intervenes, the State makes all enforcement decisions and 
imposes remedies after consideration of the survey findings 
and recommended enforcement remedies. Regardless of which 
agency of the State exercises certification and enforcement 
authority, however, we look to the Medicaid State agency to 
assure compliance with Federal requirements. 
 For dually participating facilities, the survey agency 
would conduct the survey, certify compliance or 
noncompliance with Federal requirements, and recommend 
appropriate enforcement actions. The certification of 
compliance or noncompliance and recommended enforcement 
action(s) by the State would be sent to both HCFA and the 
Medicaid State agency for review. In a new subpart F 
(Remedies for Long-Term Care Facilities with Deficiencies), 
we proposed to add a new  488.234, to set forth procedures 
for occasions when there are State and Federal disagreements 
involving findings when there is no immediate and serious 
threat to the residents. We view section 1919(h)(8) of the 
Act as calling for the application of the decision for 
Medicaid NFs to Medicare SNFs when a facility is dually 
participating.

B. Validation Surveys and HCFA Oversight 


Sections 1819(g)(3)(A) and 1919(g)(3)(A) of the Act direct the Secretary to conduct onsite surveys of a representative
sample of nursing homes within 2 months of the last day of survey when the Secretary is validating the State survey agency's
performance. If the State determines that the facility is in compliance, but the Secretary finds that the facility
is out of compliance, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance is binding and supersedes
that resulting from the State survey as specified at  488.234(a)(2) of our NPRM and section 1919(h)(6)(B) of
the Act. However, section 1919(h)(6)(A) specifies that when the State finds noncompliance and the Secretary makes
no such finding, the State's noncompliance decision and enforcement actions control. We incorporated this in  488.234(a)(1)
of our proposed rule. At paragraph (a)(3) of  488.234, we proposed that, when HCFA's survey findings take precedence,
HCFA could_

 Impose any of the alternative remedies we specify in our proposed  488.206 (Available remedies); or

 Permit payments to continue to the NF and dually participating facility if the applicable conditions at our
proposed  488.232 (Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies) are satisfied. 



These provisions proposed to specify the means to determine compliance or noncompliance for the Medicaid NF which
would then become the compliance/noncompliance decision for the Medicare SNF. 


In our proposed  488.234(b), we stated that, if both the Secretary and the State disagree over the decision to
terminate a non-State operated NF or dually participating facility_

 HCFA's decision to terminate the participation of a facility takes precedence when_

+ Both HCFA and the State find that the facility has not met all requirements; and 
+ HCFA, but not the State, finds that the facility's participation should be terminated. We proposed that
HCFA would permit continuation of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination not to exceed
6 months from the last day of the survey. 
 The State's decision to terminate a facility's participation and the timing of termination would take precedence
when_

+ The State, but not HCFA, finds that a facility's participation should be terminated; and 
+ The State's timing for the termination is for no later than 6 months after the last day of survey. 
In paragraph (c) of the proposed  488.234, we stated that when the State and HCFA disagree over timing of termination
of a facility, the State's timing takes precedence if it does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding
to terminate. Paragraph (d) stated that when there is overlap of State and HCFA remedies, the HCFA remedies apply,
and paragraph (e) stated that, regardless of whose decision controlled in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d), the compliance
and enforcement decision for the Medicaid agreement is binding on the Medicare agreement in the case of a dually participating
facility. 


C. Hearings and Appeals 


At  488.180(e)(1), we proposed that the State must impose remedies on any Medicaid provider_





</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 When the State identifies violations of Federal requirements after notifying the provider of the deficiencies
and impending remedy; and 
 Except for civil money penalties, during the pendency of any hearing that the provider may request. 
At  488.180(e)(2), we proposed that appeal procedures under 42 CFR part 498 (Appeals Procedures for Determinations
that Affect Participation in the Medicare Program) apply when the provider requests a hearing on HCFA's denial of
participation, termination of provider agreement, or the Secretary's certification of noncompliance leading
to an enforcement remedy, except State monitoring, against all State-operated facilities, as a result of a HCFA validation
survey or HCFA's review of the State's survey findings and for non-State operated SNFs and dually participating facilities.
The State must impose the same remedy, which is also subject to these appeal procedures. At  488.180(e)(3) of
our proposed rule, we proposed that the appeal procedures under 42 CFR part 431 (State Organization and General Administration)
apply in cases when the provider requests a hearing on the State's denial of participation, termination of provider
agreement, or certification of noncompliance leading to an alternative remedy against a non-State operated Medicaid
NF. 


D. Prospective Providers 


At  488.180(f), we proposed that prospective providers applying to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid
(or both) programs meet all participation requirements as a precondition of their participation. As we explained
in the preamble of the proposed rule, we based this on various provisions of the Act and the legislative history and
on the overall structure of the Act which differs significantly from the one previously in effect. 


E. Substandard Care 


In  488.151 (Definitions), we proposed defining substandard care as care furnished in a facility that has one
or more deficiencies in any area with a severity level of 3 or 4, regardless of scope; or a level 2 in severity with a level
3 or 4 in scope in quality of care requirements, as defined in  483.25 (Quality of care). We described the levels
for severity and scope in detail under the section of the preamble entitled, ``Enforcement Options.'' That discussion
is summarized in section J.11 of this background statement. 


F. Surveys 


Sections 1819(g) (2) and (3) and 1919(g) (2) and (3) of the Act, as added by sections 4202 and 4212 of OBRA '87, specify
the requirements for types and periodicity of surveys that are to be conducted for each facility; including standard,
special, partial extended, extended, and validation surveys. These provisions include specific contents and procedures,
frequency, consistency, and team composition, and are intended to protect residents' rights, health and safety
and not unduly burden the facilities or the survey agencies. We proposed to set forth implementing regulations as
follows: 


Standard Surveys 


At  488.155, we proposed that, for each SNF and NF, the State survey agency must conduct standard surveys and
stated what they must include. 
At  488.158, we proposed to require each SNF and NF to be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after
the last day of the previous standard survey and that the statewide average intervals between standard surveys must
not exceed 12 months. We also specified when and how the average intervals would be computed. 


Special Surveys 


Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87, specify that a standard survey
or an abbreviated standard survey may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management
of a facility, or director of nursing to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care
furnished by the facility. A survey conducted for the purpose of investigating a complaint against a facility is also
considered a special survey. An abbreviated standard survey is a partial survey that focuses on a specific participation
requirement or requirements. At paragraph (e) of  488.158, we proposed that the decision of whether to conduct
a standard or an abbreviated standard survey under these circumstances be at a State survey agency's or the Secretary's
discretion, based on the individuals and facilities involved and the State's concern that the quality of care may
have declined.

Extended and Partial Extended Surveys 



In accordance with Sections 1819(g)(2)(B) and 1919 (g)(2)(B) of the Act, we proposed to require that, during an extended
survey, the survey team must review and identify the policies and procedures for those provisions of the regulations
that produced the substandard quality of care and must determine whether a facility complies with all requirements
of participation. The extended survey must also include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents' assessments
reviewed, a review of the staffing levels and staff inservice training, and, if appropriate, an examination of contracts
with consultants. 

These provisions were incorporated in the proposed rule at  488.160 (Extended survey). 



Validation Surveys 



We proposed that the validation surveys must be conducted within 2 months of the date of the State's surveys and must
be of sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacy of the State's surveys. In addition, the Act requires
us to conduct validation surveys in at least 5 percent of the SNFs and NFs surveyed by each State during the year but in
no case less than 5 facilities in each State. The same protocol used for the standard or extended survey must be used
for the validation survey. We proposed to incorporate these requirements in paragraph (a) of  488.166 (Validation
surveys). 

In the proposed rule, we dealt with four other survey-related issues: 



Composition of Survey Teams 



At  488.164, we proposed that_

_Surveys must be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals, which must include a registered nurse.


_A surveyor is disqualified for surveying a particular facility if he or she currently serves or, within the previous
2 years has served as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to that facility, or if a member of his or her immediate
family has any financial interest or any direct or indirect ownership interest in that facility. 

Surveyors must receive comprehensive training, including the application and interpretation of regulations for
SNFs and NFs, techniques and survey procedures for conducting standard and extended surveys; and techniques and
survey procedures for auditing resident assessments and plans of care. 



Consistency of Surveys 



The proposed regulations at  488.162 specify that the State must conduct ongoing studies and analyses, and/or
implement new programs to measure and improve consistency in survey results, such as validation of surveyor findings,
and the application of enforcement remedies. The proposed regulations also specified that HCFA will perform the
same tasks. 



Unannounced Surveys 



While sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Act specifically require unannounced standard surveys,
we proposed that all surveys, whether abbreviated, extended, follow-up, validation or otherwise, be unannounced
and incorporated this provision in the proposed regulations at  488.157. When a survey agency is found to have
notified a SNF or NF through its scheduling or procedural policies, we are authorized to apply appropriate sanctions
for inadequate survey performance specified at the proposed  488.170 and described immediately below under
the section entitled, ``Inadequate Survey Performance.'' 



Inadequate Survey Performance 



If we find, as a result of the validation surveys, that the State has failed to perform the standard and extended surveys
properly or that the State's performance is otherwise inadequate, we are authorized to apply an appropriate sanction
for inadequate survey performance. Section 1819(g)(3)(C) of the Act requires the Secretary to provide an appropriate
remedy (which may include training) when the State has failed to perform surveys required under the Act or when the
Secretary has decided survey performance is not otherwise adequate. At  488.170, we proposed the following
remedies to be applied as appropriate: 

 For Medicaid facilities HCFA will_
+ Reduce FFP and if appropriate, 
+ Provide for training of survey teams. 
 For Medicare facilities HCFA will_
+ Specify the inadequacy to the survey agency; 
+ Require a plan of correction; 
+ Provide for training of survey teams; 
+ Provide technical assistance on scheduling and procedural policies; 
+ Provide HCFA-directed scheduling; or

In  488.151, we proposed to define ``abuse'' as physical, psychological, or verbal interaction with a facility
resident, including, but not limited to, ill treatment, physical violation, and/or other disregard of an individual
which could cause or result in mild to severe, temporary or permanent mental or physical injury, harm, or, ultimately,
death. ``Neglect'' would mean a failure, through inattentiveness, carelessness, or omission, of an individual,
to provide timely, consistent and safe services, treatment, and care to a facility resident. ``Misappropriation
of resident property'' would mean the deliberate misplacement, exploitation, or wrongful, temporary, or permanent
taking or use of a facility resident's belongings or money, or both, without the resident's consent. 

Sections 1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87 and amended by section 411(a)(5)(C) of Public
Law 100-360 (MCCA), require the State, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of nursing
facilities, to develop a process for the receipt and timely review and investigation of allegations of neglect and
abuse and misappropriation of resident property by a nurse aide of a facility or by another individual used by the facility
in providing services to residents. These sections also provide, after notification of the allegations, for the
State to provide the opportunity for a hearing to the individual against whom an allegation has been made; and if the
allegations are confirmed, for the State to notify the individual, the nurse aide registry, and the appropriate licensure
authorities if applicable. In  488.185 (Action on complaints of neglect, abuse, and misappropriation of property),
we proposed regulations that would implement these provisions. 



H. Investigation of Complaints of Violations of Federal Participation Requirements and Monitoring Compliance




In  488.182 (Investigation of complaints of violations: Investigations and monitoring), we proposed that
the survey agency be required to conduct surveys as frequently as necessary to ascertain compliance with the Federal
requirements of participation or to confirm the correction of deficiencies under the cited circumstances. The proposed
regulations would also incorporate the provisions of sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4) of the Act that a State may
maintain and use a specialized team to identify, survey, gather, and preserve evidence and to administer appropriate
enforcement remedies against substandard facilities. 



I. Disclosure of Survey Information 



At  488.175 (Disclosure of survey information), we proposed regulations to implement sections 1819(g)(5)
and 1919(g)(5) of the Act, as added by OBRA '87. We proposed at  488.175 to accept oral as well as written requests
for information and to charge the public for the cost of retrieval, reproduction, and mailing information in accordance
with regulations under the Freedom of Information/Privacy Act. The disclosing entity (HCFA, the survey agency,
or the Medicaid State agency) would respond within 10 days with the requested information, if releasable and already
available, or with an interim response explaining whether the information is releasable and when it will be available
for release. 

OBRA '90 specified which information is releasable and when it is available for release. Sections 1819(g)(5)(A)
and 1919(g)(5)(A) of the Act provide that each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public information
concerning all surveys and certifications of NFs and SNFs, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar
days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction. We proposed
to implement this provision at  488.175(d)(3).

Sections 1819(g)(5)(B) and 1919(g)(5)(B) of the Act 
require State survey agencies to notify the State's long-term care ombudsman of any adverse actions imposed against
a 
facility. We proposed at 488.175(e) that the State 
survey agency be required to provide the State's long-term 
care ombudsman with the report of noncompliance of a 
facility, report of any adverse actions imposed, any written 
response by the SNF or NF, and the results of any appeals. 

As a result of sections 4008(h)(2)(E) and 4801(e)(5)(D) 
of OBRA '90, sections 1819(b)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) and 
1919(b)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) of the Act require the Secretary and 
the State, respectively, to provide notice to the State 
long-term care ombudsman and the State protection and 
advocacy system for the mentally ill and mentally retarded 
of SNF and NF waivers. Sections 1819(b)(4)(C)(ii)(V) and 
1919(b)(4)(C)(ii)(V), as added by OBRA '90, require the 
facility receiving such nursing waivers to notify the 
residents of the facility (or, when appropriate, the 
guardians or legal representatives of such residents) and a 
resident's immediate family of the waiver. We proposed, at 
section 488.175 (f) and (g), that facilities give this notice 
within 10 days from the date the SNF or NF is granted the 
waiver. 

Under sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the 
Act, the State is required to notify each attending 
physician and the State board responsible for licensing 
nursing home administrators when a facility has provided 
substandard quality of care. We proposed requiring each SNF 
or NF to provide either HCFA or the State, no later than 10 
days after receiving a notice of substandard care, with a 
list of each Medicare and Medicaid resident in the facility 
and the name and address of his or her attending physician. 
We also proposed at  488.175 requiring the State to notify 
the attending physicians and the State licensing board 
within 30 days of the date the SNF or NF is notified of a 
finding of substandard care. We recognized that this and 
the notification requirement related to nurse waivers were 
the only provisions in our proposed regulation which set 
forth requirements for nursing homes. All other provisions 
in the proposed rule set forth requirements for the 
Secretary and the State in the enforcement of nursing homes 
requirements. We included these facility requirements in 
the proposed rule because they directly or indirectly 
pertain to the enforcement process. The same sections of 
the Act also required the State survey agency to provide 
access to any information incidental to a facility's 
participation in Medicare or Medicaid upon request by the 
State Medicaid fraud control unit established under 42 CFR 
part 1002, subpart C. We proposed incorporating this 
provision under paragraph (j) of  488.175. 



J. Enforcement Options 



1. Overview 



As stated earlier, before the passage of OBRA '87, the 
only adverse actions available to HCFA and the States for 
imposition against long term care facilities that were out 
of compliance with Federal requirements were termination of 
participation, nonrenewal and automatic cancellation, and 
denial of participation for prospective providers. In 
addition, HCFA and the States had authority, in cases of 
long-term care facilities, to deny payment for new 
admissions to facilities rather than to terminate the 
provider agreements when deficiencies did not present an 
immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of 
residents of the facilities. The denial of payment 
provision was considered both an alternative to the more 
severe measures, as well as an intermediate step that HCFA 
or the State could take prior to and possibly in lieu of 
termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The 
sanction afforded HCFA and the States the opportunity to 
defer the decision to terminate. Thus, the terms 
``alternative sanction'' and ``intermediate sanction'' came into 
use to designate denial of payment for new admissions to 
facilities for a period of up to 11 months after the month 
in which the sanction was imposed. Former sections 1866(f) 
and 1902(i) of the Act were the authority for the 
alternative sanction under Medicare and Medicaid 
respectively. The Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 
100-345, repealed the Medicare provision and MCCA made the 
Medicaid provision applicable only to ICFs/MR.

OBRA '87 included revised and expanded authority for enforcement of the Federal participation requirements for
long-term care facilities. We proposed adding a new subpart, subpart F (Remedies for Long Term Care Facilities with
Deficiencies) to part 488 to implement these new provisions.



2. Determination of Deficiencies 



Effective October 1, 1990, providers of nursing services participating in the Medicare or Medicaid programs were
subject to the requirements of participation that were published on February 2, 1989 (54 FR 5316). These requirements
focus more sharply on the resident care practices and outcomes, and facility practices with respect to resident rights.

In the proposed rule we explained that the collective exercise of surveyor judgments, which has always been the vehicle
for the identification of deficiencies would remain unchanged. For this reason, we concluded that there was no more
reason to have specific regulations governing this process than there had been in the past. Thus, we proposed that,
surveyors would gather information based upon direct observations, record review, and interviews with residents,
staff, and family members. Based on their collection of information, they would collectively compile and analyze
it, and match the data to the legal standards facilities are obliged to meet to determine if deficiencies exist. As
is true now, these conclusions would be based upon single observations or groups of observations, either one of which
may sustain a finding that a requirement has not been met. We proposed that once the survey team made its judgments about
whether the facts supported a conclusion that deficiencies exist, it would be the team's responsibility to assess
the scope and severity of those deficiencies (in the manner described later in this preamble) in order to recommend
one or more remedies to either HCFA or the Medicaid State agency for the enforcement of the requirements.



3. Remedies To Be Imposed as Alternative or Intermediate Sanctions 



Consistent with sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act as added by OBRA '87, we proposed to add a new  488.206,
listing the available remedies. It stated that, in addition to termination of the provider agreement, the following
remedies would be available: 

 Temporary management; 
 Denial of payment including_


+ Denial of payment for all new admissions; 

+ Denial of payment for all new admissions in certain diagnostic categories or requiring specialized care;
and 

+ Denial of all payment (to be imposed only by HCFA) to facilities, for Medicare and to States, for Medicaid.

 Directed plan of corrections; 
 State monitoring; and 
 Civil money penalties.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 488.206 also proposed other remedies for non-State-operated Medicaid-only and dually participating facilities.
They were: 
 Closure of the facility and transfer of residents; and 
 Additional or alternative State remedies.

Finally, we proposed at  488.153 that, if a State wishes to use additional or alternative remedies, it must specify
those remedies in the State plan, and demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction that those remedies are as effective as those
set forth in the Act.

At  488.208, we set forth proposed rules governing the choice of remedies. We said that the survey agency or HCFA
would assess individual deficiencies or clusters of deficiencies first according to the presence or absence of immediate
and serious threat to resident health and safety, the severity of the deficiency, and the scope of the deficiency.
We proposed that, following the initial assessment, HCFA and the survey agency may consider the following secondary
factors: 
 The relationship of one deficiency or group (cluster) of deficiencies to other deficiencies; and 
 The facility's prior compliance history in general and specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies.

We said that the selection of a remedy would be based on the nature of the deficiencies or cluster of deficiencies. Proposed
  488.210 and 488.212 set forth the rules for imposition of particular remedies in specified circumstances.
We said that, regardless of which remedy or remedies are imposed, each facility that is out of compliance with a program
requirement would be required to submit a plan of correction for approval by HCFA or the survey agency, except in the
case of deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines to be at a scope and severity level of 1.

The choice of remedy, by either HCFA or the State, including the manner in which HCFA or the State uses the scope and severity
scales specified in  488.204 would not be subject to review as part of the appeals process set forth in part 431
or part 498.



4. Temporary Management as a Remedy 


When alternative remedies are imposed instead of termination to bring a facility into compliance with program requirements
in an immediate and serious threat situation, temporary management would always be imposed immediately to remove
the threat to residents in accordance with sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(B)(i) of
the Act. We proposed that temporary management also be available in addition to termination in an immediate and serious
threat situation while there is an orderly termination or closure of the facility. In situations where deficiencies
do not constitute an immediate and serious threat, HCFA or the State also may appoint a temporary manager to substitute
as a manager or administrator. (Other remedies in addition to temporary management may also be imposed in the case
of immediate and serious threat situations.) 
The temporary manager would have the authority to hire, terminate and reassign staff, obligate facility funds, alter
facility procedures as appropriate, or otherwise manage the facility as necessary to correct deficiencies identified
in the facility's operation. The temporary manager would be required to be a licensed nursing home administrator
within the State or have a reciprocal agreement with the State in which he or she is to serve, demonstrate prior competence
as a nursing home administrator, and have had no disciplinary action taken against him or her by any licensing board
of any State or by any professional society in the past 5 years. We proposed as well that neither the temporary manager
nor his or her immediate family could have a financial or ownership interest in the facility. The temporary manager's
salary would be paid by the facility. We proposed that the salary for the temporary manager may not exceed an amount
equivalent to the prevailing salary paid by providers in the geographic area for positions of this type, additional
costs that would have reasonably been incurred by the provider if such person had been in an employment relationship,
and any other costs incurred by such a person in furnishing services under such an arrangement (for example, travel
allowance) or as otherwise set by the State.

We proposed that termination would be imposed if the facility does not agree to this remedy or refuses to relinquish
authority to the temporary manager. In addition, if, despite the appointment of a temporary manager, the immediate
and serious threat is not removed within 23 days of the appointment of the temporary manager or if non-immediate and
serious threat deficiencies are not corrected within 6 months from the last day of survey, the facility's participation
would be terminated.

We proposed incorporating the above provisions 
regarding temporary management in   488.206, 488.210, and 
488.215. 


5. Denial of Payment for New Admissions As a Remedy 


We proposed that a new  488.217 be added to part 488 
to set forth denial for payment for all new admissions as a 
sanction as follows: 
 For all new admissions 
_HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions. 
However, HCFA will and the State must deny payment for new 
admissions if_
+ Any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar 
days after the last day of survey identifying the 
deficiencies; or 
+ The survey agency has cited a facility with substandard 
quality of care on the last 3 consecutive standard surveys. 
_If the facility achieves compliance with the 
requirements, HCFA does or the State must resume payments to 
the facility prospectively from the date that it determined 
that compliance has been achieved. 
 Denial of payment for new admissions in certain 
diagnostic categories or requiring specialized care. 
_HCFA or the State may deny payment for new admissions 
who have certain specified diagnoses or special care needs 
when HCFA or the State finds that_ 
+ The facility is not currently able to provide care for these individuals; or 
+ Caring for these individuals will adversely affect care 
provided to other residents. 
_If the facility achieves compliance with the 
requirements, HCFA does or the State must resume payment to 
the facility prospectively from the date that it determines 
that compliance has been achieved. 


6. Directed Plan of Correction 


Sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A) permit the 
Secretary and the State, respectively, to provide for other 
specified remedies. At  488.224, we proposed adding a 
directed plan of correction as a remedy in which a facility 
could be required to take action within specified timeframes 
according to the plan of correction developed by HCFA, the 
survey agency, or the temporary manager (with HCFA or survey 
agency approval). 
The directed plans of correction would set forth the 
expected correction actions which the facility must take to 
achieve compliance and the dates by which the actions must 
be taken. 


7. Use of State Monitoring As a Remedy 


In   488.206 and 488.222, we proposed that, if State 
monitoring is used as a remedy, State monitors would be 
required to be onsite as frequently as necessary to oversee 
the correction of specific deficiencies cited. This remedy 
differs from traditional revisits by the survey agency in 
that State monitors are onsite, as necessary, while 
corrections are being made, as opposed to a revisit which 
occurs after corrections are completed, and serve to confirm 
that the deficiency has been removed. We said that State 
monitoring must be used as a remedy when a survey agency has 
cited a facility with substandard quality of care on the 
last three consecutive standard surveys. 
We proposed that individuals serving as State monitors 
would be required to be employees or contractors of the 
State survey agency, and maintain professional 
qualifications needed to address the specific nature of the 
deficiencies. The State would be responsible for ensuring 
that the monitors are appropriate health care professionals. 
A State monitor could not function as a consultant to the 
facility nor could the State monitor be an employee of the 
facility. We concluded that a monitor serving as a 
consultant to a facility would potentially put the State in 
a situation of defending the monitor's recommendations 
rather than making the facility responsible for correcting 
its deficiencies. Additionally, a monitor employed by a 
facility and working for the State would constitute a 
conflict of interest. 


8. Civil Money Penalties 


At  488.230, we proposed allowing civil money 
penalties to be imposed for noncompliance regardless of 
whether or not the deficiencies constitute immediate and 
serious threat to resident health and safety. However, we 
proposed at  488.230(b) that civil money penalties 
would not be imposed during the pendency of a hearing on the 
imposition of that remedy.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We proposed that, if HCFA wants to impose a civil money 
penalty, it must notify the provider in writing of the 
intent to impose a penalty. The notice would include 
reference to the statutory basis for the penalty, the amount 
of the penalty per day of noncompliance, any circumstances 
that were considered when determining the amount per day of 
the proposed penalty, and instructions for responding to the 
notice, including a specific statement of the facility's 
right to a hearing and implications of waiving a hearing. 
If the State proposes to impose a civil money penalty, 
the State would notify the facility in accordance with State 
procedures. 
We proposed that a penalty amount would be permitted to 
be imposed within the following ranges: 
 For deficiencies constituting an immediate and serious 
threat (that is, a severity level of 4, regardless of scope)_$3,050 to $10,000 per day; 
 For deficiencies constituting nonimmediate and 
nonserious threat above a scope or severity level of 1_$50 to $3,000 per day. 
 For both levels, the amount of the civil money penalty 
would be set at $50 increments within these ranges. 
Removal of the immediate and serious threat, but not 
the deficiencies, would justify the shift to the range of 
penalties that are imposed for nonimmediate and nonserious 
threat above a scope or severity level of 1. A penalty 
would be imposed at the immediate and serious level for the 
number of days the immediate and serious threat is present. 
We proposed that a provider may, in lieu of contesting the 
deficiency which led to the imposition of the civil money 
penalty, waive the right to a hearing within the specified 
timeframes and procedures in the regulations under  498.40 
(Request for hearing) for Medicare and  431.221 (Request 
for hearing) for Medicaid. If the facility were to waive 
the right to a hearing within 60 days from the date of 
notice, HCFA or the State would be required to reduce the 
civil money penalty by 35 percent. If the facility were to 
waive the right to a hearing after the 60th day, HCFA's or 
the State's settlement would be discretionary. The 
reduction in the civil money penalty would reflect the 
savings to both the government and the provider of costs 
that would otherwise be incurred to formally adjudicate the 
dispute. The provider would be free to reject the option to 
waive the right to a hearing. We proposed that the daily 
fine amount of a facility could be increased if the facility 
alleges compliance, but on a revisit by HCFA or the State 
survey agency, the facility is still found to be 
noncompliant with the same requirements. The purpose of 
giving HCFA or the State discretion to increase the daily 
fine, we believe, would be to deter unfounded allegations of 
compliance. The amount of increase, if any, would be 
effective the day following the resurvey.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In determining the amount of the penalty, section 
1128A(d) of the Act requires the Secretary to consider 
specific matters and also provides authority to take into 
account any other items relevant to the penalty 
determination. We proposed that the Secretary's 
nondiscretionary and discretionary requirements be 
applicable to the State as well to make the Medicare and 
Medicaid requirements equivalent for SNFs and NFs. We do 
not believe that the Congress intended to have two separate 
assessment methodologies in place between both enforcement 
authorities when a civil money penalty from each could 
potentially be imposed on a single facility. Our proposal 
included two additional factors so that the noncompliance 
itself is considered when determining the penalty amount. 
In determining the amount of the penalty, we proposed 
at  488.230(g) that HCFA or the State must take into 
account the following factors: 
 The facility's degree of culpability; 
 The facility's history of prior offenses, including 
repeat deficiencies; 
 The facility's financial condition; 
 The nature, scope, severity and duration of the 
noncompliance; and 
 The category of requirement with which the facility is 
out of compliance. 
The effective date for a civil money penalty would be 
the 10th day after the last day of the survey in the case of 
immediate and serious threat deficiencies; or the 20th day 
after the last day of survey in the case of non-immediate 
and non-serious threat deficiencies. These timeframes 
permit time to notify the facility of the intent to impose a 
civil money penalty 5 days after the last day of survey. 
When HCFA's or the State's imposition of a civil money 
penalty is upheld on appeal or the facility waives its right 
to a hearing, we proposed that the civil money penalty would 
be for the number of days between the effective date of the 
penalty and the date of correction of deficiencies, or, if 
applicable, the effective date of termination. Penalties 
would be computed after compliance is verified or the 
facility has been sent notice of termination and the 
effective date. In the case of the facility achieving 
compliance, HCFA or the State would send a separate notice 
to the facility containing the amount of penalty per day, 
the number of days involved, the due date of the penalty, 
and the total amount due. In the case of a facility to be 
terminated, HCFA or the State would send this penalty 
information in the termination notice. 
The daily accrual of civil money penalties would be 
imposed for no longer than 6 months for non-immediate and 
non-serious threat deficiencies after which HCFA would 
terminate a SNF provider agreement, or stop Federal funding 
to the State for a NF, and the State may terminate the 
provider agreement of the NF if deficiencies remain. In the 
case of immediate and serious threat deficiencies, the 
daily accrual of civil money penalties would continue until 
HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement or the 
deficiencies are corrected. If the facility can supply 
documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey agency 
that compliance with participation requirements was attained 
on a date preceding that of the revisit, fines would only 
accrue until that date.

Payments for civil money penalties would be due 15 days 
after_

 Compliance is verified, if a hearing decision upholding 
the imposition of the penalty had been rendered before 
compliance had been verified, or the 60-day period for 
requesting a hearing has expired and the facility has not 
requested a hearing or has waived its right to a hearing; 

 A hearing decision upholding the imposition of the 
penalty if compliance was achieved before the hearing 
decision; or 

 The effective date of termination if compliance has not 
been achieved by that time. 

Currently,  431.153 (Evidentiary hearing) does not 
specify the number of days a facility has to request a 
hearing. We proposed amending  431.153 to add a new 
paragraph (b) which specifies that a NF or ICF/MR must file 
a request for hearing within 60 days of receipt of the 
notice of denial, termination, nonrenewal, or imposition of 
a civil money penalty or other remedies. 

Consistent with the way other civil money penalties are 
recovered, as provided in section 1128A(f) of the Act, we 
proposed that the amount of any penalty, when determined, 
may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by HCFA or 
the State to the facility against whom the penalty has been 
assessed. Interest would be assessed on the unpaid balance 
of the penalty beginning on the due date. We proposed that 
the rate of interest to be assessed on the unpaid balance 
would be negotiable and for that reason might vary on a case 
by case basis. Funds collected by HCFA or the State as a 
result of a civil money penalty would be returned to the 
Medicare Trust Fund or to the State, respectively. Civil 
money penalties collected from dually participating 
facilities would be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and 
the State in proportion commensurate with the relative 
proportions of the number of Medicare and Medicaid beds 
actually in use at the facility at the time the facility 
receives notice of the imposition of the civil money 
penalty. Under section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act, funds 
collected by a Medicaid State agency must be put into a 
common fund to be applied to the protection of the health or 
property of residents of any NF that the State or HCFA finds 
deficient, including payment for the cost of relocating 
residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a 
facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and 
reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost. 
Oversight of the collection and use of funds will be 
addressed through HCFA's State agency evaluation program now 
in place.

With respect to SNFs, State-operated facilities, or 
HCFA validation actions when HCFA's enforcement choice 
prevails, HCFA would have the exclusive authority to settle 
any case at any time prior to a final administrative law 
judge hearing decision. With respect to non-State-operated 
NFs or dually participating facilities or HCFA validation 
surveys when only the State's enforcement decision prevails, 
the State would have the authority to settle any case at any 
time prior to the hearing decision. 



9. Closure of a Medicaid Facility and Transfer of Residents 
as a Remedy 



Section 1919(h)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act allows the State 
to close a Medicaid facility and transfer its residents as 
an available remedy in emergency situations. This provision 
appeared in our proposed  488.226 (Closure of a Medicaid 
facility and transfer of residents). Notice and appeal 
rights would be in accordance with State procedures. 



10. Other Alternative or Additional State Remedies Other 
Than Termination_Medicaid only 



Section 1919(h)(2)(A) allows the State to develop alternative or additional State remedies (other than denial 
of payment for new admissions and State monitoring). At 
 488.228 (Alternative or additional State remedies), we 
proposed that for Medicaid facilities, the State may 
establish and impose alternative remedies if the State 
demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that the alternative 
remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and 
correcting deficiencies as the remedies of temporary 
management, civil money penalties, and emergency closure of 
the facility and transfer of residents. Regardless of which 
alternative remedies the State establishes, we proposed that 
they must include denial of payment for new admissions and 
State monitoring as remedies. We reached this conclusion 
because section 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act requires that 
denial of payment for new admissions and State monitoring be 
imposed when a NF was found to have provided substandard 
quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys. We 
also required the State to include denial of payment for new 
admissions because section 1919(h)(2)(C) of the Act requires 
this remedy be imposed on a NF that has not complied with 
the participation requirements within 3 months after the 
last day of the survey which found the facility out of 
compliance with the requirements. We proposed requiring 
that these alternative or additional remedies be approved by 
HCFA and specified in the State plan. 



11. Selecting an Enforcement Remedy 



Once a State or HCFA determines that violations of 
nursing home requirements have occurred, there is an 
obligation to assess what the most effective remedy ought to 
be to assure the protection of the well being of the 
resident population. At  488.208 (Choice of remedies), we 
proposed that the survey agency or HCFA assess individual 
deficiencies or clusters of deficiencies first according to 
the following initial factors: 

 The presence or absence of immediate and serious threat 
to resident health and safety; 
 The severity of the deficiency; and 
 The scope of the deficiency. 
We also proposed that, following the initial 
assessment, HCFA and survey agency could consider the 
following secondary factors: 
 The relationship of one deficiency or group (cluster) 
of deficiencies to other deficiencies; and 
 The facility's prior compliance history in general and 
specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We said that the selection of a remedy would be based 
on the nature of the deficiencies or cluster of 
deficiencies. In the proposed   488.210 (Action when there 
is immediate and serious threat) and 488.212 (Action when 
there is no immediate and serious threat), we set forth 
rules for the imposition of particular remedies in specified 
circumstances. Regardless of which remedy or remedies are 
imposed, each facility that is out of compliance with a 
program requirement must submit a plan of correction for 
approval by HCFA or the survey agency, except in the case of 
deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines to be at a 
scope and severity level of 1. 
We said that the choice of remedy, by either HCFA or 
the State, including the manner in which HCFA or the State 
uses the scope and severity scales specified in  488.204 
(Determination of remedies) would not be subject to review 
as part of the appeals process. 
We set forth the proposed severity and scope scale in 
 488.204 (Determination of remedies). We said that, in 
order to determine the seriousness of deficiencies, the 
survey team would apply the following severity and scope 
scale guides: 
 Severity scale. 
The four levels of the severity scale are as follows: 
_

Level 1. 

Any deficiency with respect to requirements 
for long term care facilities that does not meet the 
criteria for severity levels 2, 3, or 4. 
_

Level 2. 

Either a negative outcome or resident rights 
violation has occurred, or, in the survey team's judgment, 
the ability of the individual to achieve the highest 
practicable physical, mental, or psychosocial well-being has 
been compromised, or both. 
_

Level 3. 

Potential physical harm, which could cause 
serious harm, impairment or death. In the survey team's 
judgment, there is a recognizable health or safety hazard, 
which if left unabated, is likely to cause serious harm, 
impairment or death. 
_

Level 4. 

Actual physical harm, which has caused 
serious impairment or death. Life threatening harm, severe 
impairment, or death has occurred. 
 Scope scale. 
The four levels of the scope scale are as follows: 
_

Level 1

_Isolated. The survey team might conclude 
that a deficiency is isolated if its perception is such 
that, it believed the deficiency to exist only in a very 
limited number of cases. 
_

Level 2

_Occasional. The survey team might conclude 
that a deficiency is occasional if, in its combined 
judgment, the deficiency is identified in a number of cases, 
but does not appear to reflect a pattern of facility 
behavior. 
_

Level 3

_Pattern. The survey team might conclude 
that a pattern exists where, in its judgment, there are a 
sufficient number of repeated observations that it is likely 
that the deficiency might exist in cases not reviewed by the 
team. 
_

Level 4

_Widespread. The survey team might conclude 
that a deficiency exists in sufficient number that, in its 
judgment, the deficiency represents a systemic or pervasive 
practice of the facility. 


12. Application of Remedies 


At  488.210, we proposed that, if a determination has 
been made that a deficiency would present an immediate and 
serious threat to resident health or safety, HCFA or the 
State would take immediate action to appoint a temporary 
manager to remove the threat, impose other remedies as it 
determines necessary to bring the facility into full 
compliance, and/or terminate the facility's participation in 
the program within 23 calendar days of the last day of 
survey. If the facility does not accept temporary 
management, HCFA or the State would immediately terminate 
the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last 
day of survey. If the facility accepts temporary management 
but does not remove the immediate and serious threat within 
23 calendar days of the appointment of the temporary 
manager, HCFA or the State would terminate the provider 
agreement on the 23rd day from that appointment. The 5-calendar day period for providing notice to facilities of 
termination of a provider agreement as specified in  489.53 
(Termination by HCFA) of the regulations would be included 
within this 23-day period.

<TEXT>
 

At  488.212, we proposed that, if the facility is 
found, at the time of the survey, to have deficiencies that 
do not pose an immediate and serious threat to resident 
health and safety, HCFA or the State may allow the facility 
to continue to participate for up to 6 months from the date 
of the survey if_

 The State finds that it is more appropriate to impose 
alternative remedies than to terminate the facility; 
 The State survey agency has submitted a plan of 
correction approved by HCFA; and 
 The facility (in the case of a Medicare SNF or the 
State in the case of a Medicaid NF) agrees to repay to the 
Federal government payments received if corrective action is 
not taken in accordance with the approved plan of 
correction. 
We said that, if a facility does not meet these 
eligibility criteria for continuation of payment, HCFA would 
and the State must terminate the facility's provider 
agreement. If any deficiency at any severity or scope level 
remained uncorrected within 90 calendar days after the last 
day of survey, HCFA would and the State must deny payment 
for new admissions. 
We proposed that HCFA terminate provider agreements for 
SNFs and NFs, and stop FFP for NFs for which participation 
was continued, if cited deficiencies were not corrected 
within 6 months of the last day of the survey. 
In the proposed rule, we also set forth specific rules 
on how to apply both low severity and scope levels and all 
other severity and scope levels as follows: 
 Low severity and scope levels 
_If both the severity level and the scope level are 1, 
a deficiency still exists, but no alternative remedies are 
imposed or plan of correction required as long as correction 
is achieved within 90 calendar days from the last day of 
survey. 
_The survey agency would be required to give the 
facility a summary of the deficiencies. 
_If the survey agency identifies a recurrence of these 
deficiencies at the next standard survey, HCFA or the State 
would be required to impose one or more remedies specified 
at  488.206 (Available remedies) due to the persistence of 
the deficiencies over time.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


 All other severity and scope levels 



_If the severity level is 1 and the scope is 2, 3, or 
4, the State must (and HCFA does) require a plan of 
correction and may impose one or more remedies specified at 
 488.206. 



_If the severity level is 2 and the scope level is 1 or 
2, the State must (and HCFA does) impose one or more of the 
remedies specified at  488.206 paired with a plan of 
correction. 



_If the severity level is 2 and the scope level is 3 or 
4 in quality of care, the State must (and HCFA does) impose 
one or more of the remedies specified at  488.206 paired 
with a plan of correction. The State would be required to 
notify the attending physician of each resident to which 
such finding is made, as well as any State board responsible 
for the licensing of the facility administrator. 




13. Procedures for the Imposition of Remedies Notice 





HCFA or the State would give the facility notice of 
intent to impose a remedy. At  488.202(f), we proposed 
that HCFA or the State give the facility notice of the 
remedy at least 2 days but not more than 4 days before the 
effective date of the remedy in immediate jeopardy 
situations, and at least 15 days before the effective date 
of the remedy when there is no immediate jeopardy. 
Therefore, in practice, in immediate jeopardy situations, 
the remedy could be imposed anytime after the minimum 2 day 
notification period, but not later than the 10th day after 
the last day of survey. This would allow up to 5 days for 
HCFA or the State to send the notice and an additional 2 to 
4 days before the remedy is imposed. 




14. Hearings: Medicare and Medicaid Consistency 





We proposed revising  431.153 (Evidentiary hearing) to 
provide that States must impose remedies, with the exception 
of civil money penalties, against providers of services at 
the time that they identify the existence of violations of 
Federal requirements, notwithstanding any other provision of 
State law. We intended that, under this provision, 
sanctions available under the program would become effective 
immediately after the identification of program violations 
and notification to the provider of the deficiencies and the 
impending sanction(s). 



We also proposed to delete  442.40 (Availability of 
FFP during appeals). This section has enabled States to 
continue to receive FFP, under certain circumstances, for 
facilities whose provider agreement has been terminated, for 
up to 120 days after the effective date of the termination 
if a required administrative hearing decision has not been 
reached. In light of our objective to be more aggressive in 
the enforcement of nursing home requirements by requiring 
that States provide only post-action hearings, just as is 
done under Medicare, we see  442.40 as plainly inconsistent 
with this objective. 




15. Continuation of Payment Pending Remedies 





At  488.232, we proposed that HCFA may continue 
payments to a facility with deficiencies if the following 
criteria are met: 
 The State finds that it is more appropriate to impose 
alternative remedies than to terminate the facility; 
 The State has submitted a plan of correction approved 
by HCFA; and 
 The facility in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State 
in the case of a Medicaid NF agrees to repay the Federal 
government payments received if corrective action is not 
taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction. 



We also proposed that HCFA or the State may terminate 
the SNF or NF agreement before the end of the 6-month 
correction period if these criteria are not met. We said 
that, if any of these criteria are not met or agreed to by 
either the State or the facility, the facility would receive 
no Medicare or Federal Medicaid payments, as applicable, 
from the date of the determination of noncompliance by 
either HCFA or the State.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


If the criteria are met, HCFA or the State may continue 
payments to a facility with deficiencies that do not 
constitute an immediate and serious threat for up to 6 
months from the last day of the survey. If the facility 
does not correct deficiencies by the end of the period 
specified, HCFA would_ 
 Terminate the provider agreement for Medicare SNFs; and 
 Discontinue FFP to the State for Medicaid NFs. 
The State may terminate the provider agreement for NFs. 



We proposed that the required termination notice would 
be sent 15 days before the end of the 6-month period, and 
that the notice period would run concurrently with the last 
15 days of the 6-month period. 



Medicare SNFs and dually participating facilities 
adversely affected by the requirement to repay to the 
government all payments received if corrective action is not 
taken could appeal the decision. 




16. Resolution of Differences in Findings and Recommended Remedies Between State and HCFA for non-State operated

Medicaid Facilities and Dually Participating Facilities. 





Sections 1919(h) (6) and (7) of the Act set forth 
special rules for when the State and Secretary do not agree 
on findings of noncompliance, timing of termination or where 
remedies overlap. To implement these provisions, we 
provided in  488.234 that, if HCFA finds that a non State-operated NF or a dually participating facility has
met all 
requirements, but the State survey agency finds that the 
facility has not met all requirements and the failure does 
not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its 
residents, the State survey agency's finding will control 
(proposed  488.234(a)(1)). In this instance the State's 
certification of noncompliance would control. The dually 
participating facility would have its hearing rights met 
through the procedures set forth at 42 CFR part 498. The 
non-State operated NF would have its hearing rights met 
through the procedures set forth at 42 CFR part 431. If 
HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility has 
not met all requirements and the failure does not 
immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its 
residents, but the State survey agency has not made such a 
finding, HFCA's finding could control. In this case, HCFA 
would impose the remedies and would permit the State to 
continue payments to the facility during the correction 
period (proposed  488.234(a) (2) and (3)). These provisions 
specify the means to determine compliance or noncompliance 
for the Medicaid NF which will then, by virtue of section 
1919(h)(8) of the Act, become the compliance/noncompliance 
decision for the Medicare SNF.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not met all requirements and neither find that the failure immediately
jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the following procedures would apply: 

 If both HCFA and the State find that a facility's participation should be terminated, the State's timing of
any termination (as specified in proposed  431.153(c)) would control so long as the termination date does not
occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate ( 488.234(b)). 

 If HCFA, but not the State finds that a facility's participation should be terminated, HCFA's decision to terminate
would prevail and HCFA would permit continuation of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination,
not to exceed 6 months from the last day of survey ( 488.234(b)(l)). 

 If the State, but not HCFA finds that a facility's participation should be terminated, the State's decision
to terminate and the timing of the termination (as specified in proposed section 431.153(c)) would control ( 488.234(b)(2)).


 If HCFA or the State, but not both, would impose one or more remedies that are additional or alternative to termination,
the additional or alternative remedies would also be applied ( 488.234(d)(l)). 

 If both HFCA and the State would impose one or more remedies that are additional or alternative to termination,
only the additional or alternative remedies of HCFA would apply ( 488.234(d)(2)). 



17. Termination of Provider Agreements and Discontinuation of FFP 



At  488.238, we said that termination of the provider agreement would end payment to the facility and any alternative
remedy. We proposed that HCFA and the State may terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_

 Fails to correct deficiencies within the specified time; 

 Fails to submit a plan of correction within the time specified by HCFA; or 

 Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment. 

We said that HCFA and the State would terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility with immediate and serious
threat deficiencies refuses temporary management, if that remedy is offered by HCFA or the Medicaid agency. In addition,
we proposed that, before terminating a provider agreement, HCFA does and the State must notify the facility and the
public_ 

 At least 2 and not more than 4 calendar days before termination for a facility with immediate and serious threat
deficiencies; and 

 At least 15 calendar days before termination for a facility with non-immediate and serious threat deficiencies.


The current termination notification requirement at  489.53(c)(1) requires HCFA to give notice to any provider
at least 15 days before the actual effective date of a termination of a provider agreement, irrespective of whether
the situation poses an immediate and serious threat, except in the case of Medicare SNFs. Section 489.53(c)(2) provides
that SNFs with deficiencies that pose an immediate and serious threat are entitled to notice of the termination at
least 2 days before the effective date of the termination of the provider agreement. Since the existing regulations
do not discriminate between immediate and serious and nonimmediate and serious threat situations except in the case
of Medicare SNFs, we proposed to amend  489.53(c)(2) to require at least 2 and not more than 4 calendar days notice
to all providers of a termination action involving an immediate and serious threat.

<TEXT>
 

If HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement, we would require the survey agency to arrange for the orderly
transfer of all Medicare and Medicaid residents to another SNF or NF. If there is a closure of a Medicaid NF or dually
participating facility by the State, we proposed at  488.240 that the State would be required to arrange for
an orderly transfer of all residents. 


18. Conflict Resolution 


In the proposed rule, we sought public comment about the desirability and feasibility of establishing a conflict
resolution system whereby facilities dissatisfied with a certification of noncompliance would be afforded a formal
mechanism for disputing deficiencies prior to the administrative and judicial review processes. We also requested
comments on the best way for such a system to be implemented. 


K. Incentives for High Quality Care 


Section 1919(h)(2)(F) of the Act, as added by section 4213 of OBRA '87, provides that, in addition to the remedies discussed,
a State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities
that provide the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to Medicaid. A State would incorporate such an
incentive program in its State plan. We proposed incorporating this provision in our proposed  488.153(b).



L. Educational Program 


Sections 1819(g)(l)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of the Act provide that each State must conduct periodic educational programs
for the staff and residents (and their representatives) of nursing homes in order to present current regulations,
procedures, and policies on the survey and certification and enforcement processes. We proposed incorporating
this provision in   488.153(c) and 488.184. 


M. Conforming Changes 


In addition to changes already discussed in this preamble, we proposed making other conforming changes to regulations
under part 431, 442, and 489. 


III. Summary of Major Provisions in Final Rule 


In response to public comments, we made numerous technical changes and some major policy changes, which are explained
in detail in the following section. In summary, the major changes include the following: 
 We reconfigured the criteria used to determine enforcement remedies when facilities are out of compliance
with Federal requirements, so that there is a clearer correlation between levels of noncompliance and types of remedies
imposed. We have also grouped the remedies into three remedy categories ranging from least to most severe. In this
final rule, we present an enforcement scheme in which States may use their own methods for interpreting terms that
describe the relative frequency or seriousness of deficiencies, other than immediate jeopardy, as long as they are
consistent with the guidance presented in the regulation. 
 We provide that remedies may cease when substantial compliance is achieved, and define substantial compliance
as ``a measure of compliance with the participation requirements such that no deficiencies exist which pose actual
harm or have the potential for more than minimal harm.'' The only exceptions to this rule are those involving temporary
management and State monitoring and denial of payment imposed for repeated noncompliance. In these cases, in addition
to achieving substantial compliance, the facility must prove to HCFA's or the State's satisfaction that it will remain
in substantial compliance. 
 We also revise or add definitions for abuse, neglect, immediate jeopardy, substandard quality of care, standard
survey, validation survey, extended survey, partial extended survey, abbreviated standard survey, deficiency,
nursing facility, skilled nursing facility, substantial compliance, noncompliance and revisit.

<TEXT>
 

 We clarify the term ``professionals'' as it relates to 
the members of a survey team by setting forth examples and 
by stating that the State, subject to HCFA approval, 
determines what constitutes a ``professional.'' 
 We modify the qualifications for temporary managers and 
set a salary floor. 
 We expand the financial, employment, and familial 
circumstances that disqualify a surveyor from surveying a 
particular facility. 
 We limit the instances in which a reduction in FFP is 
taken for inadequate survey performance to situations when a 
State demonstrates a pattern of failure to identify 
deficiencies in Medicaid facilities. 
 We redefine what constitutes inadequate survey 
performance. 
 We amend the regulations text at  488.312 ( 488.162 
of the proposed rule), consistency of survey results, to 
require that State survey agencies study surveyor accuracy 
as well as consistency. 
 We clarify that the survey agency will review complaint 
allegations and conduct a standard or abbreviated standard 
survey 

if

 the survey agency concludes that a deficiency in 
one or more requirements may have occurred and 

only

 a survey 
can confirm the existence of the deficiency or deficiencies. 
 We limit HCFA's and the State agency's discretion to 
conduct an extended or partial extended survey to situations 
in which substandard quality of care has been identified. 
HCFA or the State will, however, continue to have complete 
discretion to examine any and all aspects of a facility's 
performance in order to determine compliance with the 
requirements. 
 We add directed in-service training as a new remedy. 
 We expressly state that denial of all payment for all 
Medicare residents in a facility may be imposed by HCFA and 
that HCFA may deny payment to the State for all Medicaid 
residents in a facility. 
 We clarify that one or more remedies may be imposed for 
one or more deficiencies. 
 We eliminate as a remedy denial of payment for certain 
diagnostic categories. 
 We add the following to clarify the civil money penalty 
provisions: 
+ The amount of the civil money penalty can be adjusted 
to reflect changes from non-immediate jeopardy to immediate 
jeopardy and from immediate jeopardy to non-immediate 
jeopardy. 
+ A civil money penalty is increased for repeated 
deficiencies within the same regulatory grouping of 
requirements in those cases where a civil money penalty was 
imposed as a remedy for the first occurrence of the 
deficiency; 
+ The interest rate for civil money penalties is in 
accordance with the rate fixed by the Secretary of the 
Treasury and used by the Department for Medicare and 
determined by the State for Medicaid; 
+ The HCFA notice of the imposition of the civil money 
penalty does not have to be sent by mail; 
+ The HCFA notice of intent to impose the civil money 
penalty includes more information regarding the nature of 
the noncompliance, dates of accrual and dates of collection; 
+ The State's notice to non-State operated NFs when the 
State takes action must include at a minimum the information 
specified in the HCFA notice; 
+ If the facility waives its right to a hearing in 
writing within 60 days from the date of the notice of intent 
to impose the civil money penalty, HCFA or the State reduces 
the civil money penalty by 35 percent. 
+ The civil money penalty may start to accrue as early as 
the date the facility was first found out of compliance, as 
determined by HCFA or the State. This may be the last day 
of the survey or, in certain situations, before that date.

 When the basis for imposing a civil money penalty 
exists, the administrative law judge or State hearing 
officer may not set a penalty of zero, reduce the penalty to 
zero, or review the exercise of discretion to impose the 
civil money penalty. 
 In the case of civil money penalties, facilities may 
challenge the level of noncompliance found by HCFA or the 
State if a successful challenge on the issue would affect 
the range of civil money penalty amounts from which HCFA or 
the State could collect a civil money penalty. 
 We add a provision to direct the State during a 
complaint investigation to follow the specific procedures 
found at  488.335 ( 488.185 of the proposed rule), action 
on complaints of resident neglect and abuse, and 
misappropriation of resident property, when there is reason 
to believe that an identifiable individual neglected or 
abused a resident or misappropriated a resident's property. 
 We add a requirement that the State must have written 
procedures for the timely review and investigation of 
allegations of resident neglect and abuse and 
misappropriation of resident property. In addition, we have 
required that the State should take appropriate precautions 
to protect a complainant's anonymity and privacy, if 
possible. 
 If arrangements have been made with other State 
components for investigation of complaints, we require that 
the State have a means of communicating information among 
appropriate entities, and that the survey agency retain the 
responsibility for the investigation process. 
 We require that findings of investigations be included 
in the nurse aide registry within 10 working days of the 
findings. 
 We require that the survey agency determine if 
complaints violate any requirements of part 483, subpart B 
and take appropriate enforcement action as necessary if the 
allegation of neglect, abuse or misappropriation of property 
against an individual is a complaint against the facility. 
 We require the notification of physicians of those 
residents identified as receiving substandard quality of 
care. 
 We clarify that survey findings are reported with 
recommendations for corrective action to officials in the 
enforcing agency who determine what remedies to impose. 
 With respect to the disclosure of survey information, 
we revise the provisions on fees, charges, and timeframes 
for release of information to provide that, with certain 
exceptions, HCFA or the State will disclose survey-related 
information and may charge the public in accordance with 
pre-existing Federal regulations and State procedures. 
 We eliminate 120 days of FFP for a Medicaid NF and 
retain, for now, 120 days of FFP for an ICF/MR while the 
facility waits for a post-termination hearing. 
 We formalize the opportunity for informal dispute 
resolution currently in the State Operations Manual for 
providers to raise unresolved issues to the State agency or 
the respective HCFA regional office after the provider's 
receipt of the official deficiency statement, and have 
prohibited challenges by providers from postponing or 
otherwise delaying the effective date of any enforcement 
action. 
 We specify that a provider in substantial compliance at 
the end of 6 months may continue to participate without 
repayment of Federal funds. 
 We delete the section on validation surveys from the 
regulation text because the statutory provisions are self- 
implementing and regulatory interpretation is not needed to 
clarify them. The few elaborations on the requirements in 
sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Act are duplicated 
elsewhere in the regulation and there is little reason to 
repeat them.

 We renumber proposed   488.150-488.185 and proposed   488.200-488.240
as   488.300-488.335 and   488.400-488.456, respectively, to take into account
existing section numbers already included in part 488, subpart D.
 We incorporate the provision of proposed  488.240, Transfer of residents, into  488.426 in the
final rule. We revise the title of  488.426 to Closure and/or transfer of residents.
 We incorporate the provisions of proposed  488.228 into  488.406 of the final rule.


IV. Discussion of Public Comments


We received more than 27,900 timely letters in response to our August 28, 1992 proposed rule. Most were from the owners
and operators, administrators, staff, and attorneys of long term care facilities. Others were from professional
organizations, chains of long term care facilities, employee unions, and vendors that supply facilities. We also
heard from consumer advocates and ombudsmen, Federal, State, and local governments, consumer organizations, and
residents of long term care facilities. Families of residents and their guardians and other legal representatives
commented as well. A discussion of the comments follows. We do not discuss sections of the rule on which the public had
no comment.
Normally, a final rule is not effective until 30 or 60 days after it is published in the 

Federal Register

. Because implementation of the complex and far-reaching provisions of this final rule will require a major, nationwide
training effort to train surveyors, their supervisors and related personnel, this rule is effective June 1, 1995.


Effective Date




Comment: 

One commenter stated that HCFA must provide nursing homes with a reasonable education and retraining grace period
of no less than one year before implementing the new survey standards so that facilities can adjust to the enormous
changes. The States and HCFA should provide reasonable funding to ensure that training is completed before the new
requirements take effect. There is a precedent for this in HCFA's recent recognition that State certification requirements
for home health care aides should be accompanied by State funding to help facilitate retraining.


Response: 

HCFA routinely provides a long lag time for the effective date of particularly complicated regulations and has done
so for this regulation as well. The new long term care requirements were published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826), and were effective April 1, 1992. This final enforcement rule should have no effect
on the requirements for long-term care as stated in the September 1991 regulation and the facilities should have had
ample time to become familiar with its requirements. Our primary concern is to provide oversight for the protection
of residents in nursing homes who are dependent upon others for the care they receive. It would serve no purpose to allow
facilities to have additional time to become familiar with requirements of which they are already aware. Our responsibility
is to continue to move forward in enacting the enforcement provisions for long term care facilities.

Part 431 State Organization and General Administration




Comment: 

In response to our proposed revisions to part 431, most opposing comments concerned the effect on ICFs/MR of withdrawing
FFP during appeals. Some commenters noted that OBRA '87 specifically exempted ICFs/MR from its scope, and stated
that it is not appropriate to change the ICF/MR rules in implementing a law that applies to other facilities. Some commenters
stated that the discussion on ICFs/MR was lost within the SNF/NF regulations, and there was no discussion in the preamble
concerning applicability to ICFs/MR. Some stated that HCFA provided no rationale for this change in the ICF/MR rules,
and therefore a proposed rule should be published which allows for full notice and comment rulemaking. Some commented
that if the proposal had been written in a more direct manner, more groups would have written to object.


Response: 

We agree that it would be preferable to include the provisions applicable to ICFs/MR at a later date in rulemaking focused
on ICFs/MR. Therefore, we are adopting the commenters' proposals that the 120 days of FFP continue for ICFs/MR until
this issue may be more fairly resolved in such a rulemaking. Therefore, at this time, we are leaving the existing appeals
system in place for ICFs/MR. There were other comments concerning ICFs/MR that are outside the purview of this regulation,
and are therefore not addressed in this discussion.
For the reasons stated directly above, we are revising   431.151, 431.153, and 431.154 to delete reference
to SNFs and ICFs as follows:
  431.151 (``Scope and applicability.'') is revised so that subpart B of part 431 specifies the appeal
procedures the State must make available to an ICF/MR for which the State denies, terminates, or fails to renew certification
or a provider agreement for the Medicaid program.
  431.153 (``Evidentiary hearing.'') is revised to state that



_An ICF/MR whose certification or provider agreement is denied, terminated, or not renewed must be given an opportunity
for a full evidentiary hearing on the denial, termination or nonrenewal;
_If the facility requests a hearing, it must be completed either before the effective date of the denial, termination
or nonrenewal or within 120 days after that date; and
_The hearing must, at a minimum, include the provisions of  431.153(e).

Comment: 

Several commenters responded to our specific 
request for comments on whether States, adversely affected 
by the repayment statutory provisions of section 
1919(h)(3)(D), should have the right to appeal resulting 
disallowances to the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) in 
addition to appealing a provider's certification of 
noncompliance under part 498. The commenters said that 
States should have this right to appeal but believed that 
few States would find it necessary to exercise this right. 


Response: 

We agree that States probably would not 
often find it worthwhile to challenge a decision that had 
withstood the test of an appeal in accordance with part 498. 
However, because section 1116(d) of the Act provides States 
with a statutory right to reconsideration whenever HCFA 
takes a disallowance, and regulations at 45 CFR part 16 
provide States with a hearing before the DAB when 
disallowances are made, we agree that appeal to the DAB 
should be an option for the States. At any such DAB 
hearing, the decision of the ALJ upholding HCFA's adverse 
action against the provider would, of course, be part of the 
evidence. 


Comment: 

A few commenters noted that State hearings 
will significantly increase, and stated that the regulatory 
impact statement fails to consider the amount of time 
surveyors and other staff, including attorneys, will need to 
prepare for and participate in hearings. They commented 
that overall costs for which HCFA must reimburse the states 
will be increased. 


Response: 

We recognize that the revised regulations 
expand the initial determinations for which States are 
required to grant an appeal. However, we have no program 
experience upon which to base a prediction of appeal volume 
or costs. There is not even a precedent to follow from the 
Medicare program, inasmuch as the expanded initial 
determinations are also new in the Medicare regulations. We 
anticipate that, in many cases, providers will be able to 
meet the necessary requirements before remedies are to be 
imposed, thus obviating the need for a hearing. Moreover, 
we are finding that the percentage of facilities with no 
deficiencies continues to increase, thereby causing us to 
predict fewer facilities facing some form of appealable 
enforcement action than has been the case previously. 
Because of these factors which may affect the increased 
number of initial determinations that are appealable, we can 
offer no valid prediction as to effect on volume or costs of 
appeals. However, we expect that the informal dispute 
resolution process will reduce the number (or scope) of 
adverse actions that lead to a hearing. Any increased net 
costs to States that are found to occur will be reflected in 
the budget process. 
Because we are now providing for an informal dispute 
resolution, we are revising  431.154 (``Informal 
reconsideration'') to delete references to SNFs and NFs and 
state that_
 If the State decides to provide an ICF/MR with an 
opportunity for an evidentiary hearing required by 
 431.153(a) only after the effective date of a denial of 
participation or termination, the State must offer the 
ICF/MR an informal reconsideration, to be completed before 
the effective date of the adverse action; and 
 The informal reconsideration must, at a minimum, 
include

 

_Written notice to the facility of the denial of 
participation or termination, and the findings upon which it 
was based; 
_A reasonable opportunity for the facility to refute 
those findings in writing; and 
_A written affirmation or reversal of the denial, 
termination, or non-renewal.

Section 442.40 Availability of FFP During Appeals 


We proposed deleting  442.40, which presently provides 
for continuing FFP for up to 120 days after the effective 
date of termination of a Medicaid provider agreement if an 
appeal is pending. (See the discussion of comments on part 
431 above.) 


Comment: 

Several commenters wanted to retain the 
current provisions which allow for up to 120 days of FFP 
during a State's appeal process. A few wanted Federal 
funding to continue until a final decision is issued after a 
hearing. A few stated that elimination of the current rule 
would provide no benefit to the overall process. 


Response: 

As we stated in the proposed rule, it is our 
belief that the needs of individual residents are best 
served by the availability of prompt and effective remedial 
action that will motivate the fastest efforts by providers 
to comply with Federal program requirements. The Congress 
has already set the maximum time for a termination at 6 
months. Because a State could be paid for perhaps as long 
as 4 months after the effective date of provider 
termination, the State would have no incentive to challenge 
NFs to promptly comply with all program requirements. This 
is because, in all likelihood, the State would continue 
funding the Medicaid facility while receiving Federal 
payments. If we eliminate Federal funding to the State on a 
more accelerated schedule, States are likely to stop funding 
the NF once we stop Federal payments to the State. Thus, a 
greater incentive will exist for NFs to promptly comply with 
program requirements. Moreover, because the 120-day 
provision would significantly delay the imposition of 
certain remedies, it would not be consistent with section 
1919(h)(2) of the Act, which calls for States to minimize 
the period of time between the identification of 
deficiencies and the imposition of remedies. In our 
opinion, the residents will benefit because the facilities 
in which they reside will come into substantial compliance 
faster. However, for the reasons previously explained, we 
have decided to continue FFP to ICFs/MR whose agreements 
have been terminated for up to 120 days after termination 
while we work on the publication of a separate rulemaking on 
ICF/MR policy. 


Comment: 

A few commenters stated that if pre-hearings 
were provided, the 120 day regulation would not be necessary 
for SNFs and NFs, but that if pre-hearings were not 
provided, the 120 regulation should be retained in order to 
give a facility time to present its side of the story before 
suffering irreparable harm. 


Response: 

As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, we 
are providing for dispute resolution beginning with the 
provider's receipt of the official Statement of 
Deficiencies, in order to give facilities an opportunity to 
rebut survey findings early in the process. By adding this 
feature to the enforcement process, we are balancing the 
needs of facilities to avoid unnecessary disputes and 
protracted litigation, on one hand, with the interests of 
facility residents, which we believe to be paramount, in 
assuring the most rapid correction of deficiencies. In so 
doing, we believe that the continued application of the 120- 
day rule would upset this balance of interests that we 
believe the Congress intended us to have. 


Comment: 

A few commenters predicted that the courts 
would be clogged with pretermination or presanction hearings 
if FFP were denied during the State appeal procedures. 


Response: 

Post-termination hearings have been upheld 
by all the circuit courts that have analyzed the issue of 
whether post-termination hearings satisfy the due process 
clause of the Constitution (see discussion titled, 
``Hearings: Medicare and Medicaid Consistency''). Moreover, 
we do not believe that the courts will be eager to entertain 
legal challenges from providers that have failed to exhaust 
their administrative remedies. 
We note that the Federal courts are not clogged with 
pre-termination challenges when Medicare agreements are 
terminated and Federal funding ceases on the effective date 
of termination. Under both Medicare and Medicaid, 30 days 
of funding will be available, as it is now, to provide a 
period of time for orderly transfer of residents.

Comment: 

A few commenters believed that HCFA would be 
punishing those States that aggressively implement the Act, 
and some noted that States would have a financial incentive 
to ``settle'' during the survey process. 




Response: 

Because the Medicaid program is a joint 
Federal-State program, we do not believe that States have an 
incentive to spend their own State money on nursing care 
provided in a facility that does not meet the statutory 
requirements. 




Comment: 

Some wondered why HCFA's finding of 
noncompliance takes precedence over a State survey agency's 
finding of compliance, yet HCFA has no obligation to provide 
FFP during the appeal. 




Response: 

HCFA's finding of noncompliance takes 
precedence over a State's finding of compliance because the 
Act mandates this result in sections 1919(h)(6) and 
1919(g)(3)(A). The Congress provided detailed procedures 
for resolving differences between a State and HCFA, but did 
not provide that FFP should continue merely because HCFA and 
a State disagree about a facility's compliance status. If 
HCFA's termination determination is overturned as a result 
of the appeal process, the State would receive FFP based on 
the reinstated provider agreement should the State have 
continued to make Medicaid payments to the facility. 




Comment: 

Some commenters apparently equated the 
availability of 120 days FFP during the hearing process with 
providing a pre-termination hearing. These commenters noted 
that Medicare's post-termination hearing does not cause 
concern to most providers because Medicare pays for only a 
small portion of days, whereas, to require post-termination 
hearings for Medicaid will cause greater concern because 
more money is at stake. 




Response: 

As we explain more fully elsewhere in this 
preamble, we believe it is important that, in light of the 
great similarity between facility requirements in Medicare 
and Medicaid and the fact that such a large percentage of 
facilities participate in both programs, appeal procedures 
ought to be the same for both programs. Additionally, 
because of the informal opportunities to resolve differences 
in the form of an informal dispute resolution mechanism, we 
believe that a facility's concerns for due process are more 
than adequately protected when balanced with the interests 
of nursing home residents in the swift correction of 
deficiencies.

Section 488.301 Definitions 






Comment: 

Many commenters were concerned that the 
proposed definition of ``abuse'' is too broad and ambiguous. 
Unless the definition is amended, they believe it will 
generate inconsistency in the survey process and overburden 
the system with complaints of abuse. Other suggestions and 
recommendations are as follows: 
 Willfulness and/or deliberate intent should be 
incorporated into the definition; 
 Change ``and/or otherwise disregard of an individual 
which could cause or result in mild to severe harm'' and 
replace with ``has caused or creates a high probability of 
causing serious harm'';

 Physical harm should be defined; include a definition of assault suggested by a particular State's definition;


 The phrase ``otherwise disregard of an individual'' should be deleted as this statement more accurately describes
neglect; 

 Incorporate the definition of abuse as found in the Older Americans Act. 



Response:

 We have considered the above comments and are revising the definition of abuse in  488.301 to address some of
the aforementioned concerns. However, we do not believe it appropriate to adopt any one State's definition as there
is no evidence to suggest that one definition is superior to another. We are adopting the major concepts of the definition
in the Older Americans Act. Therefore, the modified definition of abuse now reads: Abuse means the willful infliction
of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental
anguish. 



Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that we require that the resident perceive the conduct as abusive. 



Response:

 We do not accept this comment. Our obligation is to protect the health and safety of every resident, including those
that are incapable of perception or are unable to express themselves. This presumes that instances of abuse of any
resident, whether cognizant or not, cause physical harm, pain, or mental anguish. 



Comment:

 Some commenters believed that the definitions of abuse and neglect should also apply to nurse aides in hospitals as
well as in nursing facilities. 



Response:

 This comment falls outside the purview of this regulation. This rule specifically pertains to the survey, certification
and enforcement of requirements of participation for SNFs and NFs. 



Comment:

 Some commenters thought that the proposed definition of abuse was inconsistent with that in  483.13. 



Response:

 Section 483.13(b) does not provide a definition of abuse. What it does provide is a list of the types of abuse from which
residents have a right to be free. The definition, a statement as to the meaning of the term ``abuse,'' is offered at
 488.301. 



Comment:

 Several commenters thought the proposed definition of ``neglect'' was too broad and ambiguous. They contend it is
necessary to narrow the definition in order not to inundate the system with complaints. Some commenters requested
that the terms ``willful'' and ``intent'' be inserted into the definition to limit the scope of actions that could
be considered neglect.

Response

: In order to promote consistency in the survey process, there needs to be a common definition of neglect for a variety
of applications. We have, therefore, adopted the concept of the definition used in the Older Americans Act, as we explain
below. That definition does not incorporate the terms ``willful'' or ``intent.'' While an act of neglect can be intentional,
neglect can also occur unintentionally. However, we are specifying at  488.335(e) that a State must not make
a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused
by factors beyond his or her control. If the inattentiveness is due to factors within that person's control, intentional
or unintentional, he or she can be considered to have neglected the resident(s). Therefore, while willfulness and
intent may be considered when a State finds that an individual has neglected a resident, we believe the terms ``willful''
or ``intent'' should not be included in the definition because neglect can occur unintentionally. 


Comment

: Some commenters perceived that, in order for a finding of neglect to be made against an individual, the alleged neglect
must be within the individual's control or job responsibility. It was suggested that a provision be added to the proposed
definition that includes the individual's ``breach of duty to provide * * * needed * * *
services.'' The commenters contend that the proposed definition places the blame upon the individual and excludes
the extent of the culpability of the facility to provide the necessary services or goods. 


Response

: We agree that an employee should not be found to have neglected a resident if the neglect was caused by factors beyond
the control of the employee. As this provision is already addressed in  488.335(e), we do not believe it needs
to be restated in  488.301. 


Comment

: Other commenters suggested their own State definition of neglect should suffice in order not to confuse facilities
with separate definitions. 


Response

: As noted earlier, there has been no evidence to suggest that any State definition is preferable to ours. In fact, we
believe allowing each State definition to stand, as is, would increase confusion among the providers and promote
inconsistency from State to State. 


Comment

: Many commenters wished to add the phrase: ``Each resident should be free from * * *,'' prior to the
proposed definition of neglect. 


Response

: We agree that each resident should be free from neglect as well as other forms of mistreatment. This prohibition of
neglect is inherent in  483.13(c). We do not believe the phrase suggested by the commenters defines the term.
Therefore, we did not include it in  488.301. 


Comment

: Other commenters requested that we require (within the definition of neglect) that evidence be presented that physical,
emotional or psychological harm or some other negative outcome had occurred. 


Response

: We do not accept this comment because neglect may be determined even if no apparent negative outcome has occurred.
The potential for negative outcome must also be considered. For example, instances of neglect may include, but are
not limited to, being left to sit or lie in urine or feces, isolating dependent residents by leaving them in their rooms
or other isolated locations, or failing to answer call bells to provide needed assistance. 


Comment

: Many commenters believed that ``timely'' should be removed from the definition of neglect or else be defined, as
it is overly broad. Other commenters wish to add the language incorporated within section 102(37) of the Older Americans
Act. 


Response

: Although the term ``timely'' does not appear in the final definition, we believe timeliness is an integral component
in determining neglect. A delay in providing needed services for a resident has the potential to cause physical harm
and/or mental anguish. Such a delay (or lack of timeliness) can be considered neglect under the definition we are incorporating
in the final regulation. We are adopting the concept from the Older Americans Act which provides that neglect means
failure to provide goods and services necessary to avoid physical harm, mental anguish, or mental illness. 


Comment

: Many commenters asked that HCFA include the following occupations in the proposed list of licensed health professionals:

 Clinical Nurse Specialist; 
 Medical Records Specialist; 
 Dietitian; 
 Social Work Assistant; 
 Speech Pathologist or Audiologist; 
 Recreational or Activities Specialist; 
 Respiratory Therapist; 
 Dentist or Dental Hygienist; 
 Optometrist; 
 Podiatrist; 
 Pharmacist; 
 Psychologist; 
 Chiropractor; 
 Nursing Home Administrator; and 
 All other licensed health professionals.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>

Other commenters believed that licensed practical 
nurses (LPNs) should not be included on the list because, 
although licensed, LPNs are not professional nurses by 
education or by legal accountability and must work under the 
supervision of a registered nurse or a medical doctor. It 
was also suggested that the term be changed to ``licensed 
health personnel.'' 



Response: 

We are deleting the definition of ``licensed 
health professional'' as it is not used in this part. 



Comment: 

Several commenters recommended changing the 
proposed definition of ``misappropriation of resident 
property'' to apply to the resident's ``real or personal 
property,'' as opposed to ``belongings or money,'' because they 
believe the current language is not broad enough to 
encompass every type of resident property. Other commenters 
recommended that the definition include ``attempted'' 
misappropriation or the ``intent to deprive.'' 



Response: 

We do not discern any substantial difference 
between the terms ``belongings or money'' and ``real or 
personal property.'' We believe the terms ``belongings or 
money'' are sufficient to implement the statutory requirement 
in sections 1819(g)(1) and 1919(g)(1) of the Act. 
Additionally, the concept of ``intent to deprive'' is inherent 
within the phrase ``deliberate misplacement'' in the 
definition. Therefore, we are not accepting these comments 
as we believe the suggested changes do not substantially 
enhance the proposed definition. 


Comment:

 Some commenters proposed to limit the 
definition of misappropriation to that incurred by a nurse 
aide. 


Response:

 We disagree. Limiting the definition of 
misappropriation to a specific individual would exempt all 
others from the provisions of the Act which explicitly 
states in sections 1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C):



* * * allegations of * * * misappropriation of resident 
property [is] by a nurse aide of a resident in a 
nursing facility 

or by another individual 

used by 
the facility in providing services to such a 
resident.'' (emphasis added)





Comment:

 Some commenters wanted our definition to set 
a minimum of $50 on the amount of money or property which 
can be deliberately misplaced or wrongfully used without the 
resident's consent in order to be considered 
misappropriation of resident property. 


Response:

 We disagree because we believe that it is 
impossible to quantify the value of some personal items. 
Moreover, possessions, regardless of their apparent value to 
others, must be treated with respect, for what they are and 
for what they may represent to the resident. As no such 
limitations are dictated by the Act, we interpret 
misappropriation to apply to any belongings or money, 
regardless of their actual value. 


Comment:

 Some commenters questioned whether the 
proposed definition of ``nurse aide'' includes dietary aide or 
private duty paid individuals. They recommended that the 
definition of nurse aide be amended to read ``provides 
personal care and nursing related services under the 
supervision of licensed nurses.'' Additionally, commenters 
wanted a list of distinct duties required of nurse aides to 
be added to the final definition. 


Response:

 We do not adopt these comments because the 
definition of a nurse aide is specified by 
sections 1819(b)(5)(F) and 1919(b)(6)(F) of the Act and by 
implementing regulations at  483.75(e). 


Comment:

 Some commenters stated that the phrase 
``substandard quality of care'' was specifically used in the 
Act and that HCFA should recognize and adopt the same 
language. 


Response:

 We agree with the above comment. To be 
consistent with the Act, we are using that terminology 
throughout this final rule, where appropriate.

Comment:

 Some commenters wanted HCFA to include ``any 
violation of the requirements that leads to, or is likely to 
lead to a failure of the resident to achieve the highest 
practicable physical and mental well-being'' in the 
definition of substandard quality of care. 


Response:

 We are not accepting this suggestion. We 
believe that any infringement of any requirement could be 
construed to compromise some ability of a resident to 
achieve his or her highest practicable well-being. The 
definition proposed by the commenter could encompass every 
deficiency under every regulatory requirement. Given the 
ramifications a determination of substandard quality of care 
has for a provider (loss of NATCEP, notification of 
licensing boards and physicians), we are limiting the 
definition of substandard quality of care to reflect the 
most egregious situations related to participation 
requirements under   483.13 (``Resident behavior and 
facility practices''), 483.15 (``Quality of life''), and 483.25 
(``Quality of care''). However, we are not minimizing 
deficiencies in other participation requirements. As 
discussed later under the response to public comments for 
 488.401, it is possible that a deficiency under any 
requirement can encompass any degree of seriousness. 
Deficiencies under the remaining requirements can be more 
appropriately addressed through specified remedies rather 
than through the loss of NATCEP which would be precipitated 
by a substandard quality of care determination. 


Comment:

 Several commenters thought that the scope and 
severity grid should not be a determining factor in defining 
substandard quality of care. 


Response:

 As we discuss later at  488.404, we are 
removing references to the scope and severity grid from the 
definition of substandard quality of care. We are 
retaining, however, concepts of seriousness and frequency 
which we believe are important to determining this type of 
deficient facility practices. 


Comment:

 Other commenters wished to include compliance 
history in the final definition of substandard quality of 
care. 


Response:

 We do not agree with this comment. Our 
first priority is to protect the health and safety of the 
residents. If violations are identified, the problem must 
be rectified, regardless of the facility's compliance 
history. 


Comment:

 Some commenters wanted us to explicitly state 
in the definition of substandard quality of care that 
deficiencies of immediate jeopardy are regarded as 
substandard quality of care. 


Response:

 We are not adopting this comment. Given the 
ramifications a finding of substandard quality of care has 
for a provider, we are limiting the definition of 
substandard quality of care to those requirements mentioned 
previously. The only immediate jeopardy deficiencies 
considered substandard quality of care are those determined 
under the participation requirements of   483.13 (``Resident 
behavior and facility practices''), 483.15 (``Quality of 
life''), and 483.25 (``Quality of care''). 
Because we are removing references to the scope and 
severity scales from the definition of substandard quality 
of care we believe that it is necessary to amend the 
definition. We are now defining substandard quality of care 
as care furnished in a facility that has one or more 
deficiencies related to participation requirements under 
  483.13 (``Resident behavior and facility practices''), 
483.15 (``Quality of life''), or 483.25 (``Quality of care'') 
that constitutes immediate jeopardy, a pattern of widespread 
actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy, or widespread 
potential for more than minimal harm, but less than 
immediate jeopardy with no actual harm. 


Comment:

 Some commenters wanted compliance and 
correction to be defined as ``substantially meeting all 
applicable certification requirements.''

Response: 

While we do not agree with the suggested 
definition, we do agree with the intent of the commenters 
that there should be some range of compliance within which 
prospective and current providers may participate. This 
concept is discussed further in  488.330 ``Certification of 
compliance''. Accordingly, in  488.301, we define 
``substantial compliance'' to mean a level of compliance with 
requirements of participation such that any identified 
deficiencies pose no greater risk to patient health and 
safety than the potential for causing minimal harm. 



As we discuss later in this preamble, a facility may 
avoid a remedy even if it has failed to comply perfectly 
with all statutory requirements. However, the facility 
still has the duty to provide the care to each resident 
which enhances the chances for positive outcomes and avoids 
negative ones. If a single resident experiences 

any 

harm, 
no matter how minimal, the facility will not have satisfied 
its statutory obligations. 



We acknowledge that there might be many definitions 
that we could have chosen, but in our view, the definition 
we have settled on best implements the Act and accommodates 
both facility and resident concerns. 



Additionally, since we are incorporating the concept of 
substantial compliance, we believe it is necessary to 
provide a definition of noncompliance at  488.301. 
Noncompliance with the requirements of participation is any 
deficiency that causes a facility to not be in substantial 
compliance. 




Section 488.303 State Plan Requirement 







Comment: 

There were several comments concerning the 
requirement for and content of incentive programs. 
 Some commenters suggested that the incentives to reward 
quality care be required and implemented on a national scale 
by HCFA as well as the States. 
 A few commenters suggested that the States develop 
incentive programs with consultation from residents, 
families and the ombudsman. 
 One commenter presented an elaborate process including 
applications, group evaluations and resident participation 
for any award. 
 One commenter said that the regulation should define 
the rewards for quality to support quality improvement. 





Response: 

Section 1919(h)(2)(F) of the Act does not 
permit HCFA to require the States to establish a public 
recognition or incentive payment system for nursing 
facilities that provide high quality care. If the 
commenters mean that the same public recognition or 
incentive payment system be permitted for Medicare SNFs, the 
Act does not authorize such recognition. In addition, a 
HCFA program for nursing facilities would be duplicative. 



Section 1919(h)(2)(F) of the Act gives States the 
flexibility to decide if an incentive program would be 
appropriate and how they will implement the program. If a 
State decides to implement an incentive program, the State 
should have the option to consult those individuals and 
organizations it thinks necessary. In the same vein, it 
would be inadvisable to restrict the States' programs to 
elaborate regulatory procedures because, in so doing, we may 
inadvertently discourage States from establishing such 
programs. Although we encourage States to develop effective 
incentive programs, we are not making any changes to 
 488.303 because we want to preserve the States' 
flexibility in establishing such incentive programs. 





Comment: 

A few commenters suggested that the Medicaid 
program should fund the incentive payments through civil 
money penalties.

<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>

Response: 

The Act provides that State expenses for the 
implementation and maintenance of an incentive program is an 
authorized Medicaid administrative expense: the Act does not 
permit the use of funds collected from civil money penalties 
for this purpose. Indeed, section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the 
Act provides that when the State uses the specified civil 
money penalty remedy, the State must apply funds collected 
through civil money penalties to the protection of the 
health or property of nursing home residents. Therefore, we 
reject this comment. 





Comment: 

Several commenters suggested that the 
regulation should go beyond the Act and specify certain 
topics and methods of training. 
 Some wanted mandated educational programs for 
assessment and care planning, resident rights and quality of 
care issues as well as those in subparts E and F of part 
488. 
 Other commenters believe that the scope of the 
educational program should include a section on complaint 
investigation and resolution. 
 A few commenters asked that States work with the 
ombudsman program to develop and present training. 
 Another commenter believes that literature and/or video 
presentations would be more effective than State 
presentations. 





Response: 

Sections 1819(g)(1)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of 
the Act require that States conduct educational programs for 
staff and residents of facilities regarding current 
regulations, procedures and policies of the long term care 
survey and certification process. We agree with the 
commenters that the proposed regulation unnecessarily 
restricts the scope of the mandated educational programs. 
We are revising it to permit the education programs to cover 
all aspects of the long term care survey process so that the 
States have the flexibility to structure the educational 
programs to the needs of the facilities. The methods to 
develop the programs (for example, consultation with the 
ombudsman program) and the methods of presentation are being 
left to the States. 





Comment: 

A few commenters suggested that these 
requirements be met, in part, by giving facility staff and 
residents access to HCFA and State agency surveyor training 
sessions. 





Response: 

We believe that this suggestion, if done at 
the participant's expense, may have merit. Traditionally, 
we have not had the ability within available resources to 
accommodate all providers or other interested parties 
wanting to attend training; our available resources are 
devoted, for the most part, to providing timely training for 
surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training 
universally to providers and interested others at their own 
cost, and if space allows, may help improve understanding 
and cooperation between surveyors and the other parties. We 
are, therefore, seriously considering what changes in policy 
and legislation will be necessary to allow this. 





Comment: 

One commenter suggested that a review of the 
State educational activities be made a part of HCFA's State 
agency evaluation program which would assure its 
implementation. 





Response: 

The HCFA State Agency Evaluation Program 
(SAEP) currently is undergoing substantial review and 
revision. We are unable, at this time, to assert that a 
review of State educational activities will become a part of 
the revised SAEP. Nonetheless, the HCFA regional offices 
will continue to have the responsibility to monitor and 
assess the States' educational activities. 





Comment: 

Several commenters suggested that the States 
be directed to include bans on all new admissions as a 
required remedy because a ban on only Medicaid admissions is 
discriminatory. A majority of those commenting suggested 
that a directed plan of correction also be included as a 
required remedy. 





Response: 

We do not have statutory authority to allow 
the States the option of banning all new admissions. States 
are free, however, to enact their own laws regarding 
facility licensure that may extend enforcement options 
beyond the reach of the Act.

Section 1919(h)(2)(A)(i) of the Act expressly gives 
States the authority to impose payment denials with respect 
to new Medicaid admissions. While the Act also provides 
States with the opportunity to design other remedies, 
subject to Federal approval, that are as effective as those 
enumerated in the Medicaid law, we believe that it would be 
inappropriate for us to evaluate a remedy that would be 
aimed at the admissions of persons over whom the Medicaid 
law provides no jurisdiction. We believe it would be more 
appropriate to leave to State law remedies that extend as 
far as the commenters suggest. In any event, while a denial 
of payment for new Medicaid admissions does not reach all 
potential admissions, it will provide an incentive to a 
facility to correct deficiencies rapidly, which would serve 
to benefit not only Medicaid residents but all those persons 
who are receiving care at the facility regardless of payment 
source. Also, States may provide public notice of the 
imposition of the denial of payment for new admissions 
remedy which would alert potential residents to the 
situation in the facility. 

We are not accepting the suggestion that directed plans 
of correction be a required remedy. As discussed under 
``Factors to be considered in selecting remedies'' later in 
this preamble, we have provided a revised enforcement scheme 
in this final rule that correlates the seriousness of 
noncompliance with the selection of remedies from within 
specified enforcement remedy categories. While we do not 
intend to mandate the specific selection of the directed 
plan of correction remedy from among the available 
enforcement actions for any specific level of actionable 
noncompliance, in other words, when the facility is not in 
substantial compliance, we note that it is always an 
enforcement option and it may be the only remedy used for 
lower level deficiencies. 




Comment: 

Some commenters requested that we require 
States to submit any alternative or additional remedies to a 
full State rulemaking process with an opportunity for 
comment. Other commenters believed that States should be 
allowed to implement additional or alternative remedies 
unless HCFA can demonstrate that the State remedies are not 
as effective as the HCFA remedies. 




Response: 

The States must follow any internal State 
procedures which govern the development and submittal of a 
Medicaid State plan amendment. The Act does not require nor 
do we believe our regulations should require specific 
procedures that would limit State prerogatives for 
promulgating enforcement policies. Similarly, section 
1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act states that the State must 
demonstrate that any alternative remedies are as effective 
as the remedies specified in the Act. 


Comment: 

Commenters suggested that the effective 
remedies established by the States be made applicable to 
dually participating facilities. 




Response: 

We are accepting this comment with some 
clarification. Since States may establish their own 
sanctions through their respective State plan amendment, and 
since HCFA will be the entity imposing sanctions for dually 
participating facilities, it is highly likely that a State 
may choose to impose one of its own remedies on a Medicaid 
NF which HCFA would have no authority to impose against the 
Medicare provider agreement. It would not be rational for 
us to proceed with an enforcement scheme whereby a single 
facility, by virtue of participating in both Medicare and 
Medicaid, would be subject to a dual enforcement track. 
Also, and more importantly, since HCFA will be taking the 
lead on enforcement actions against dually participating 
facilities under part 498, we have concluded that HCFA needs 
to have the authority to impose these alternative or 
additional remedies against Medicare facilities in the 
States that have established these remedies. While we 
acknowledge that this would not permit consistency 
nationally relative to remedies available for dually 
participating facilities, we conclude that it is a realistic 
and necessary response to statutory intent that enforcement 
decisions made regarding the Medicaid agreement, which could 
include imposition of these ``other'' State remedies, will be 
applied by the Secretary to the Medicare agreement as well. 
Therefore, under the Secretary's general rulemaking 
authority, this final rule provides that, if the State's 
remedy is unique to the State plan and has been approved by 
HCFA, then that remedy, as imposed by the State under its 
Medicaid authority, can be imposed by HCFA against the 
Medicare provider agreement of a dually participating 
facility. 


Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the regulations 
create penalties for States that fail to implement the State 
enforcement rules. 



Response: 

The Act provides no specific penalty for 
State failure to implement the enforcement provisions of the 
Act, nor do we wish to add one. However, there are existing 
Medicaid rules regarding the submission of and adherence to 
State plan amendments. If a State does not comply with the 
Medicaid rules, the failure could lead to Medicaid 
administrative sanctions. 


Section 488.305 Standard Surveys

Comment: 

A large number of commenters opposed the 
provision at proposed 488.155(b) and suggested we delete it. 
This section states that the State survey agency's failure 
to follow HCFA survey procedures will not invalidate 
otherwise legitimate determinations that a facility's 
deficiencies exist. Because the provision does not appear 
in the Act, a few commenters questioned whether the Congress 
sanctioned this policy, and certain commenters asked that 
facilities be allowed to appeal surveyor noncompliance with 
the survey protocol. Many commenters felt that this 
provision would encourage disregard of established survey 
guidelines, and for this reason one commenter believed this 
provision would cause the standard survey to violate the 
Fourth Amendment. 


Response: 

We believe the provision accurately reflects 
the intent of the Act and are retaining it in  488.305(b). 
To invalidate legitimate determinations of noncompliance and 
leave them unaddressed would be in opposition to the mandate 
of OBRA '87 that all requirements be met and enforced, and 
would lead to inconsistent application of the law. 
Sections 1819(g)(2)(C) and 1919(g)(2)(C) of the Act 
reveal the intent of the Act very clearly. These sections 
state that standard surveys must be conducted based upon a 
protocol, but add that the failure of the Secretary to 
develop, test or validate such a protocol will not relieve 
any State or the Secretary of the responsibility to conduct 
surveys. Because the Congress intended for survey results 
to be binding even when surveys were conducted in the 
absence of a formal protocol, it is clear that the Congress 
views the substance of survey findings to be of greater 
importance than the process used to identify them. An 
appeal of a deficiency based on surveyor noncompliance with 
the established protocol would be inconsistent with this 
position, and as a result, we will not offer facilities an 
appeal on these grounds. In particular, we wish to avoid 
situations where otherwise well documented deficiencies are 
subject to challenge, and potentially invalidated, simply 
because a surveyor did not follow every last detail of the 
survey protocol. We believe this would be surrendering all 
substance to form and would clearly thwart Congressional 
will. Moreover, since the source of binding requirements on 
facilities is not in the survey protocol, but in the Act and 
regulations, the ultimate, and proper, test of facility 
noncompliance will not rest on whether the survey protocol 
was rigorously followed, but on whether a requirement of the 
Act or the regulations has been violated. 

The foregoing does not imply that HCFA encourages or 
condones disregard of its established survey policy; on the 
contrary, HCFA trains surveyors in survey policies and 
procedures and is responsible for assessing State survey 
agency performance and applying sanctions when there has 
been a failure to use Federal standards and protocols. The 
guidance we provide to surveyors, and the expectation we 
have that they adhere to our directives, contradict the 
claim that surveyors are given unbridled discretion which 
would render the standard survey an unreasonable 
administrative search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
Once a facility seeks participation in the Medicare or 
Medicaid programs, it must accept the responsibility of 
demonstrating its compliance with Federal certification 
requirements which the Congress has directed must be done 
through the survey process. A facility cannot seek such 
participation, and accept program funds, and then argue that 
Federal or State efforts to monitor compliance with 
essential health or safety requirements constitute a 
violation of the Fourth Amendment as an unreasonable search 
and seizure. In any event, surveys that nursing homes 
experience in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are 
reasonable. They advance the government's interest in 
protecting the health and safety of individual residents, 
and because of the various requirements for surveys in both 
the Act the Federal regulations, no facility can be said to 
be unaware of its obligations to permit onsite visits by 
State or Federal surveyors as a condition of its 
participation in these programs. Commercial enterprises, 
such as nursing homes, do not have the same expectation to 
be free of warrantless searches as individuals in their 
homes do. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has ruled 
that warrantless searches of closely regulated businesses do 
not pose a violation of constitutional Fourth Amendment 
protections that commercial enterprises have.

We recognize that protocols and guidelines are 
necessary to promote consistent survey practice. However, 
whether or not a surveyor follows protocols must be 
subordinate in importance to whether or not a facility meets 
Federal participation requirements. Violations must be 
recognized and remedied appropriately if resident interests 
are to be protected and integrity is to remain in the 
enforcement system. 



Comment:

 One commenter questioned whether proposed 
 488.155(a)(3) conflicts with subpart III of Appendix P of 
the State Operations Manual, Transmittal No. 250. Section 
488.155(a)(3) would require the State survey agency to 
include in the standard survey an audit of written plans of 
care and residents' assessments. Subpart III states that a 
review of the accuracy of resident assessments is to be 
performed as part of the extended survey which is triggered 
by the identification of a deficiency in quality of care 
during the standard survey. 



Response: 

There is no conflict because a review of 
comprehensive assessments and care plans is not limited to 
the extended survey. It is also a major part of the Quality 
of Care Assessment performed during the standard survey (see 
Task 5 in Appendix P of State Operations Manual Transmittal 
No. 250). The review that occurs during the extended survey 
is slightly different, though, in that surveyors are 
directed to review more recent care plan and assessment 
information, and are given more flexibility in choosing 
sample size than in the standard survey. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that we require 
surveyors to determine whether a facility attempted to 
accommodate both the exercise of a resident's rights and the 
resident's health when there appears to be a conflict. The 
commenter believed that accommodation should include 
exploration of care alternatives through a thorough care 
planning process in which the resident may participate. 



Response: 

Surveyors are presently instructed to make 
such determinations. At tag number F295 in the Interpretive 
Guidance to Surveyors, the surveyor is directed to determine 
whether the care plan reflects the facility's efforts to 
find alternative means to address a problem if a resident 
has refused treatment. Additional guidance concerning this 
matter is found at tags F174 and F158. We believe such 
specific instructions are more appropriately located in the 
State Operations Manual than in the regulation itself, so 
we are not incorporating them into the regulation. 



Comment: 

A few commenters suggested that we explicitly 
mention a review of the quantity and quality of nursing 
services staff in  488.305(a)(2) where we outline a survey 
of the quality of care. 



Response: 

Inherent in an evaluation of the indicators 
of care and services listed at  488.305(a)(2) is an 
examination of the quality of the staff providing them. 
As part of the observational portion of the Quality of Care 
Assessment, surveyors are directed to make observations of 
staff/resident interactions which necessarily involve 
evaluating the quality of care and services provided by the 
staff, which is an indication of the quality of the staff 
itself. For this reason we do not explicitly mention this 
assessment in the regulation. We do specifically address a 
review of staffing in Appendix P of the State Operations 
Manual Transmittal No. 250. 



Comment: 

One commenter recommended that we include, as 
part of the standard survey, private meetings between 
surveyors and family groups during evening and or weekend 
hours and another conference at the conclusion of the survey 
process to explain survey findings in lay person language.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

We recognize the value of family input in 
the survey process, and direct surveyors when interviewing 
to provide the opportunity for all interested parties to 
give what they believe is pertinent information. We expect 
this to include accommodating family members who wish to 
speak with the survey team but are unable to be at the 
facility at the time of the survey. It is possible for 
family members to call surveyors at the facility and be 
either interviewed over the telephone or scheduled for a 
personal meeting as the survey schedule allows. The survey 
team is in a better position than HCFA to know how to best 
accommodate these groups within the time and personnel 
constraints of the standard survey, and for this reason it 
would be unduly restrictive of us to require evening and 
week-end meetings. 

Neither will we require that there be an exit 
conference specifically for family groups. If survey teams 
conduct an exit conference for facility residents, family 
members are not prohibited from attending. If such a 
conference does not take place, family members still have 
many other opportunities to learn about the outcome of a 
survey. Survey results are available to family members 
whenever they visit a facility, because facilities are 
required to accessibly post the results of the most recent 
survey. These survey reports are thorough and detailed, and 
if a family member has any difficulty understanding the 
results, he or she may resolve it by contacting either the 
long-term care ombudsman or the State survey agency. 



Comment: 

One commenter proposed that we allow the 
survey team to expand the standard survey when it identifies 
substandard quality of care instead of requiring it to 
conduct an extended or partial extended survey to 
investigate the extent of the facility's problems. 



Response: 

We must reject this proposal. We are bound 
by sections 1819(g)(2)(B) and 1919(g)(2)(B) of the Act 
which require a facility to be subject to an extended survey 
when it is found to have provided substandard quality of 
care during the standard survey. 



Comment: 

One commenter proposed that we specify that 
the audit of written plans of care outlined at proposed 
 488.155(a)(3) must include an investigation of whether the 
written plans were implemented and subsequently reevaluated 
and revised, as necessary. 



Response: 

In Appendix P of State Operations Manual 
Transmittal No. 250, surveyors are directed, when conducting 
an audit of written plans of care, to determine whether care 
plans were consistently implemented, evaluated, and revised 
as necessary. We believe such detailed instruction is more 
appropriate in the manual than in the regulation itself, and 
so we are not including it in the regulation. 




Section 488.307 Unannounced Surveys 





Comment: 

Many commenters agreed that all surveys 
should be unannounced. Some commenters stated that survey 
schedules should be more unpredictable and one suggested 
that there should be even more unannounced inspections. 
Several commenters emphasized that many nursing homes are 
aware that they are about to be surveyed. One commenter 
stated that randomness of surveys has not yet been achieved 
and that HCFA should require States to demonstrate through 
survey scheduling that chronically substandard facilities 
have been targeted. Another commenter stated that annual 
licensure cycles, such as billings and certificates, may 
compromise unannounced surveys. Several commenters 
suggested that we require that the States provide a 
randomization plan or scheduling methods which would ensure 
that the timing of inspections is not predictable.

Response: 

We realize that commenters, in many cases, 
feel it is preferable to have unannounced surveys for the 
welfare of residents in nursing homes. However, after 
careful consideration, we have concluded that requiring all 
surveys to be unannounced is not mandated by the Act. 
Moreover, doing so would, in some cases, undermine the 
efficiency of the survey process in which, for example, the 
only thing necessary to verify compliance is a request for 
documentation or an interview with a particular part time 
employee who may, otherwise, not be at the facility if a 
survey is not announced. We are, therefore, revising 
 488.307(a) to require that only standard surveys be 
unannounced. 
We agree that survey schedules should be more 
unpredictable and have made this more possible at 
 488.308(a) by allowing the flexibility of conducting 
standard surveys no later than 15 months after the previous 
survey. We disagree with the recommendation that there 
should be more unannounced inspections than presently 
required by HCFA. The States are responsible for 
determining which facilities need to be surveyed and when 
the surveys should be scheduled, subject to the requirements 
of  488.307. The States already have the obligation to 
conduct extended surveys and complaint surveys as the need 
arises. Moreover, because of time and money constraints and 
the difficulty of scheduling the surveys already required, 
it would be unfair to place an additional burden on the 
States for conducting more surveys than required by law. 
We agree that complete randomness of surveys has not 
been achieved but we believe that complete randomness should 
not be our goal. Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) and 
1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act provide for a flexible survey 
cycle. While the law does not specify the criteria to be 
used to determine intervals between consecutive surveys, 
States will undoubtedly use past performance as a primary 
criterion. If past performance is considered in determining 
how frequently to survey specific facilities, the survey 
cycle can not be completely random. 
Our intention is to strive to have surveys conducted on 
as random a basis as possible consistent with effective 
enforcement. We are aware that annual licensure cycles may 
compromise unannounced surveys. However, we believe that, 
over time, State licensure cycles will not be a factor in 
survey predictability since licensure and certification 
surveys are generally conducted concurrently. In the event 
that States do not move to a more flexible licensing 
schedule, this will not create a problem because licensing 
schedules will not substitute for certification 
requirements. We believe that it is unnecessary to require 
States to provide a randomization plan for the timing of 
surveys because we are already stating at  488.307(b) that 
we will review States' procedures on at least an annual 
basis. In addition, the law does not require States to 
demonstrate that substandard facilities have been targeted, 
but in examining the States' scheduling practices annually, 
we will look for logical scheduling criteria and past 
performance will undoubtedly be one of the reasonable 
criteria States can use. 


Comment: 

Several commenters stated that it is unfair 
for surveyors to come into a facility without any advance 
notice. Another commenter stated that unannounced surveys 
are not more beneficial than announced ones. This commenter 
stated that the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) announces its surveys and 
that this practice is less stressful and avoids placing an 
unnecessary mystique on the process since it is known that a 
survey must occur 90 days before the license expires. (We 
assume the commenter is referring to the expiration of 
accreditation.) This commenter feels that the same 
objective is achieved. Another commenter stated that 
facilities should always be given a warning that a survey 
will occur and ample time to correct whatever is wrong. 


Response: 

We cannot accept the comments advocating 
announced standard surveys. To do so would be inconsistent 
with sections 1819(g)(2)(A) and 1919(g)(2)(A) of the Act. 
Moreover, warning facilities in all cases of an upcoming 
survey can undermine the accuracy of survey findings which 
sometimes is predicated on the element of surprise. 


Comment: 

Two commenters proposed that paragraph (a) of 
 488.307 be revised as follows: 
``(a) 

Basic rule. 

All surveys must be unannounced and 
their timing should be unpredictable. State survey agencies 
must adopt survey schedules that maximize the element of 
surprise. Scheduling procedures and practices must not have 
the effect of giving facilities notice of inspections. For 
example, inspections should not occur around the same time 
each year nor be conducted in a predictable sequential 
cycle.'' 


Response: 

We agree that the timing of surveys should 
be made as unpredictable to long term care facilities as 
possible. However, at this point, it does not seem 
practical or even possible to mandate, or enforce the total 
unpredictability of surveys by States or to require that all 
surveys be unannounced, as explained in the response to 
prior comments in this section. We will be looking into the 
possibility of incorporating some guidance on ways in which 
to maximize unpredictability into manual instructions.

Comment: 

Two commenters suggested that  488.307(b) be 
changed to provide that HCFA shall identify successful 
scheduling methods, distribute them, then monitor State 
agency performance, taking corrective action when necessary. 
One commenter thought that the way the provision was 
written, an agency gets constructive suggestions about 
scheduling surveys only after the surveys have been done and 
at the time of a review of its procedures. Two other 
commenters suggested it would be helpful if HCFA could put 
in the Regional Office Manual the successful methods it has 
identified that assure that surveys are unannounced. 


Response: 

We disagree with these comments suggesting 
that HCFA specify in regulations that it will provide 
successful scheduling methods because we believe the States 
are better able than we are to identify successful 
scheduling methods which may differ from one locality or 
region to another. Each State uses the methods that work 
best for it to schedule surveys within the required 
timeframes. We believe that the controls in place at 
 488.307, which provide that all standard surveys must be 
unannounced, and that we will review each State's scheduling 
procedures on an annual basis, are sufficient. 


Comment: 

One commenter asked what the term ``any 
individual'' means in reference to penalizing someone who 
notifies a facility that a survey is scheduled. Another 
commenter suggested that individuals other than an employee 
of the Federal and State government should be held harmless 
from fine if he or she notifies a facility that it is 
scheduled to be surveyed. This commenter further suggests 
that any individual who is fined for notifying a facility, 
should have the right to contest the fine in a formal 
hearing. 


Response: 

The Act, in sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 
1919(g)(2)(A)(i), is clear that ``any individual'' who 
notifies a nursing home of the time and date of a standard 
survey is subject to a civil money penalty. We, therefore, 
disagree that only employees of the Federal and State 
governments should be held responsible for notifying a 
facility that it is scheduled to be surveyed; any individual 
who knowingly advises a facility that a standard survey is 
scheduled will be held accountable, according to the Act. 
Any individual who is fined for notifying a facility is 
entitled to the appeals mechanisms specified at section 
1128A of the Act. The administrative appeals policy for 
civil money penalties imposed against an individual 
announcing a standard survey is not established by HCFA but 
rather by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and is 
already in place.

Comment: 

Two commenters suggested that ombudsmen should be informed in advance of a survey in order to be able to participate
fully, provided ombudsmen are subject to the penalties mandated by law and to loss of employment if they cause the time
of the survey to be known. One of these commenters suggested that advance notice of the survey should be given to the
local ombudsman by means of a letter from the survey agency stamped ``CONFIDENTIAL.'' This commenter feels ombudsmen
should be informed in advance because they are currently notified on the first or second day of three or four day surveys
and may have already scheduled appointments which cannot be changed in order to accommodate the survey schedule.
This commenter feels that advance notice would guarantee better surveys by strengthening ombudsman/consumer input.




Response: 

We disagree. Each additional individual or organization that has knowledge of a scheduled survey decreases the likelihood
that the survey will remain unannounced. The ombudsman is contacted soon after the survey team has entered the facility
and can participate meaningfully even if not present for the initial tour of the facility or other early phases of the
survey. 



Comment: 

Two commenters stated that a $2,000 fine is not a severe enough penalty for willfully disclosing in advance the timing
of a nursing home inspection or taking advantage of foreknowledge of an inspection. Another suggested that this type
of violation should also be referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution for obstruction of justice. 



Response: 

The $2,000 fine is the maximum allowable under sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(i) of the Act. The exact
amount of the civil money penalty is determined by the OIG. In response to the suggestion that this violation be referred
to the Department of Justice, OIG decides which cases are appropriate for such referral. 



Comment: 

This commenter stated that  488.307(c) is weakened by the use of the word ``standard'' and that civil money penalties
should be applied as a penalty for the announcement of any type of survey including validation, complaint, or other
surveys. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(g)(2)(A) and 1919(g)(2)(A) of the Act are applicable to standard surveys only, so that the civil money
penalties specified at sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(i) are imposed for announcing standard surveys.
We do not have the statutory authority to require that civil money penalties be imposed for announcing anything other
than standard surveys. 



Section 488.308 Survey Frequency

The nursing home reform provisions of OBRA '87 
reconfigured the way in which HCFA and the States would 
track nursing home compliance with Federal requirements and 
approach enforcement remedies. The survey and certification 
provisions, set forth at sections 1819(g) and 1919(g) of the 
Act, require implementation of a flexible survey cycle for 
Medicare skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid nursing 
facilities so that standard surveys are conducted at 
intervals not later than 15 months after the date of the 
previous standard survey with a statewide average interval 
that does not exceed 12 months. 


The legislative history of OBRA '87 and the National 
Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine (IoM) study 
(1986) are plain in their stated reasons for this change 
from the rigid, time limited system of having surveys for 
all facilities follow a 12 month cycle. First, a flexible 
survey cycle provides less predictability to the scheduling 
of surveys, thus reducing the opportunities for certain 
providers, by anticipating the survey, to achieve only 
temporary compliance for the short term period around the 
time of survey. Second, flexible survey cycles allow survey 
agencies to better allocate their limited resources by 
increasing the frequency of surveys for problem facilities 
while allowing other facilities with a better record of 
compliance to be less rigorously monitored. Additionally, 
because time limited agreements have automatic cancellation 
clauses, a significant paperwork and recordkeeping burden 
results from the frequent need to conduct resurveys as a 
means of avoiding provider agreement expirations. Third, 
the enforcement provisions of nursing home reform, set forth 
at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act, are designed to 
work in the context of provider agreements that do not have 
a fixed ending date. 


Specifically, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) 
of the Act speak to the ability of the Secretary to continue 
payments for up to 6 months after the identification of 
deficiencies if certain criteria, described in those 
sections, are met. Sections 1819(h)(2)(D) and 1919(h)(2)(C) 
of the Act require the Secretary and States to impose 
denials of payment for new admissions should deficient 
facilities fail to achieve compliance within 3 months after 
they have been determined not to comply with Federal 
requirements. In both cases, these remedies make sense only 
where a facility's provider agreement has no set expiration 
date. 


We reach this conclusion because under a time limited 
agreement survey system in which surveys are typically 
conducted shortly before the expiration of provider 
agreements, facilities would have only the shortest period 
of time to correct deficiencies if they are to be entitled 
to renewed agreements. The statutory remedies described 
above, however, contemplate periods of time that far exceed 
what would be available under a time limited agreement 
system for providers to achieve compliance. 



For HCFA and the States to attempt to fit this survey 
system into the procedures described in sections 1819(h) and 
1919(h) of the Act would require the wholesale revamping of 
surveys so that they occur no later than mid-way through the 
term of the 12 month provider agreement. Such a radical 
departure from more than 20 years of practice would require 
the kind of massive reallocation of survey resources that is 
not possible under a time limited agreement survey system 
and would likely cause many facilities to go unsurveyed by 
the time their time limited agreements are scheduled to 
expire. Of equal significance, we do not believe that the 
Congress would approve of a survey system in which the 
decisions about renewal of a provider agreement are made as 
far as 6 months prior to the expiration of that agreement, 
since determinations of compliance made so far in advance 
may not be reflective of the degree of facility compliance 
at the time the agreement is set to expire.

Continued implementation of time limited agreement 
requirements for skilled nursing facilities and nursing 
facilities frustrated many aspects of nursing home reform 
and, in a practical way, rendered them inoperable. For 
these reasons, a HCFA Ruling was signed on August 26, 1992 
eliminating time limited agreements for skilled nursing 
facilities and nursing facilities participating in the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs and these regulations further 
adopt this position. 
Section 488.308 implements sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii) 
and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act, which require that each 
skilled nursing facility and nursing facility be subject to 
a standard survey not later than 15 months after the last 
day of the previous standard survey and that the statewide 
average interval between standard surveys not exceed 12 
months. The regulation specifies when and how the average 
interval is computed, specific conditions that may prompt a 
standard or an abbreviated standard survey and HCFA's 
corrective action to ensure that State survey agencies meet 
the 12 month average interval requirement. These final 
rules also codify the substance of the HCFA ruling described 
above by eliminating from the regulations the requirements 
for time limited agreements for SNFs and NFs. 


Comment:

 One commenter requested clarification of the 
15 month interval by asking if determination would be ``to 
the day'' or ``during the 15th month.'' 


Response:

 We intend to calculate the 15-month interval 
by counting days. The survey agency calculates the number 
of days between the last day of the current standard survey 
and the last day of the facility's previous standard survey. 


Comment:

 Several commenters recommended that survey 
frequency be related to the compliance/noncompliance history 
of the facility. A few commenters suggested that States be 
required to conduct more frequent inspections of nursing 
homes with poor care histories. One commenter recommended 
that States take facility compliance history into account 
when establishing survey cycles and conduct more frequent 
surveys of nursing homes with a history of substandard 
quality of care. 


Response:

 We are retaining this provision of the 
regulation as written because we believe that the Act, as 
previously cited, provides a framework within which the 
State survey agency can establish a flexible survey cycle 
that effectively ensures that quality health care is 
furnished in a safe environment. Without restricting this 
flexibility, we expect that State survey agencies will 
consider a facility's compliance history when scheduling 
standard surveys and revisits. The survey agency may 
conduct surveys as frequently as necessary to determine 
compliance with participation requirements, to confirm that 
previously cited deficiencies have been corrected, to 
investigate complaints and to ensure that certain changes do 
not cause a decline in the quality of care furnished to the 
resident. 


Comment:

 Several commenters recommended that an 
additional provision be incorporated which would allow State 
survey agencies to conduct tailored or abbreviated surveys 
in those facilities which were deficiency-free in the 
previous standard survey. Some additional commenters 
recommended that facilities with a record of deficiency-free 
surveys be inspected less frequently than every 12 months. 
One commenter specifically suggested that surveys not be 
conducted yearly if there is in place good surveillance and 
monitoring from the State, and that, perhaps, over time a 
survey would be conducted every third year as hospitals are 
surveyed by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of 
Healthcare Organizations. One commenter recommended a 
demonstration project that would test the possibility of an 
extended survey cycle for excellent facilities.

Response:

 We cannot accept the comment to conduct 
abbreviated or tailored surveys of facilities that were free 
of deficiencies in the previous standard survey, because the 
Act does not include abbreviated standard surveys in the 
computation of the 15 month interval between standard 
surveys of a facility or in the computation of the 12 month 
statewide average for all facilities in a particular State. 
Abbreviated standard surveys are premised on complaints 
received, or a change of ownership, management or director 
of nursing, or other indicators of specific concern and, 
therefore, could be focused on certain specific 
requirements, whereas, a standard survey is a periodic 
inspection to gather information about the quality of 
service furnished in a facility to determine compliance with 
the certification requirements for participation. To use an 
abbreviated standard survey instead of a standard survey in 
the computation of the 15 month survey interval or the 12 
month statewide average would not meet the intent of the 
Act, nor would it be an accurate assessment of the State's 
ability to ensure that each facility furnishes quality 
health care in a safe environment. 


Sections 1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act require 
that each facility must have a standard survey no less 
frequently than every 15 months. With this constraint, we 
can accept the comment to conduct a standard survey of 
facilities with good compliance histories less frequently 
than every 12 months but not less frequently than every 15 
months. Once we have had the benefit of experience under 
the new survey process, we will consider whether it might be 
appropriate to approve a demonstration project that would 
explore whether other survey frequencies would be more 
effective. 


Comment:

 A commenter stated that a State could survey 
small facilities or facilities near the survey office most 
often to meet the 12 month average interval requirement. 


Response:

 Existing procedures call for HCFA regional 
office review of State survey agency workload planning. 
This review will continue and can identify and respond to 
inadequate survey practices. We do not believe a regulatory 
requirement is necessary to ensure the use of meaningful 
criteria for determining survey intervals. 


Comment:

 One commenter was confused about how HCFA can 
determine which facility survey did not meet the 12 month 
average interval requirement. 


Response:

 The regulation specifies that it is the 
statewide average interval between standard surveys that 
must not exceed 12 months, rather than the interval between 
consecutive surveys of specific facilities. 


Comment:

 Several commenters suggested alternative 
language for proposed  488.158(b)(2). These writers 
recommended that the sentence which reads, ``If the provider 
is a Medicaid facility, HCFA reduces FFP in accordance with 
 488.170'' be replaced with ``HCFA will reduce FFP in 
accordance with  488.170 and may apply corrective action 
which includes the following: * * *'' or ``HCFA reduces FFP to 
the State in accordance with  488.170.'' Another commenter 
recommended that HCFA's corrective action be limited to 
technical assistance and inservice training during the first 
year and only include FFP reduction if there is a gross 
violation.

Response:

 While we appreciate the merits of these 
suggestions, the FFP reduction formula now specified at 
 488.320 has certain limitations as it cannot logically be 
used to sanction a State for failure to achieve a 12 month 
statewide average interval requirement for standard surveys. 
This is because a survey agency's performance in calculating 
the 12 month statewide average interval is unrelated to the 
terms of the FFP reduction formula. The formula is 
comprised of two terms: the total number of residents in 
nursing facilities surveyed by HCFA during a quarter and the 
total number of residents in nursing facilities found, in 
accordance with HCFA surveys, to be noncompliant. Thus, the 
statutory formula does not lend itself to remedying problems 
States might be experiencing in conducting timely surveys. 
However, section 1919(g)(3) of the Act states that we may 
respond to inadequate State survey performance in Medicaid 
facilities by providing for the training of the State's 
survey teams. We are revising   488.308 and 488.320 in 
this final rule accordingly. 


Comment:

 A commenter asked that we explain which date 
is used for computation of the 12 month statewide average 
interval when an extended survey follows a standard survey. 


Response:

 The last day of the standard survey, not the 
last day of the extended survey, is the date used in the 
computation of the statewide average interval. Sections 
1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(I) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(I) of the Act 
specify the statewide average interval between standard 
surveys shall not exceed 12 months. 


Comment:

 In examining the criteria which trigger 
special surveys, one commenter agreed that survey agencies 
may need to conduct a survey when changes occur as specified 
in the regulation. A few other commenters disagreed and 
indicated that an abbreviated or standard survey within 60 
days of a change in ownership, management, nursing home 
administrator and/or director of nursing was stressful, 
wasteful of taxpayer dollars or unnecessary. One commenter 
specifically stated that the change of a director of nursing 
as a survey trigger was inappropriate and should be removed.

Response:

 We are retaining this provision as written. 
Sections 1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II) 
of the Act use the word ``may,'' thus permitting the State 
survey agency discretion in deciding to conduct a standard 
survey or an abbreviated standard survey within 60 days of 
any of the above stated changes to determine whether these 
changes have caused a decline in the quality of care 
furnished by the facility. 


Comment:

 A few other commenters recommended that the 
regulation specify that other surveys ( 488.308(c)) must be 
conducted as frequently as necessary to determine compliance 
with participation requirements and to confirm the 
correction of previously cited deficiencies. 


Response:

 We are retaining this provision in which the 
decision to conduct other surveys under the circumstances 
specified at  488.308(c) be at the State survey agency's 
discretion. We expect the survey agency to base its 
decision on the individuals and facilities involved and the 
State's concern that the quality of care may have declined, 
and to conduct a survey in those cases where one is 
necessary to confirm compliance with participation 
requirements. The correction of noncompliance will be 
monitored and verified by some type of follow up activity 
which may or may not be a survey. Section 488.332 states 
that the State survey agency conducts on-site monitoring as 
needed when: a facility is not in substantial compliance 
with the requirements and is in the process of correcting 
deficiencies; verification of continued substantial 
compliance is needed after deficiencies have been corrected; 
or, the survey agency has reason to question the substantial 
compliance of the facility with the requirements of 
participation. (Please refer to the discussion at 
 488.332, Investigation of complaints of violations and 
monitoring of compliance.) 


Comment:

 The proposed regulation indicates that the 
survey agency may conduct a standard or an abbreviated 
standard survey to determine whether certain changes have 
caused a decline in the quality of care furnished by a 
facility. The commenter recommended that the phrase 
``decline in the quality of care furnished by'' be modified to 
allow special surveys for the purpose of determining whether 
the facility is out of compliance with any conditions of 
participation. 


Response:

 Since the language of concern to the 
commenter simply reiterates the Act, at sections 
1819(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II) and 1919(g)(2)(A)(iii)(II), we are 
not free to modify the language as suggested. However, we 
believe the Act gives States ample authority to conduct 
surveys any time they suspect that conditions at a facility 
may be declining. 


Comment:

 A commenter proposed amending the regulation 
to expressly permit the survey agency to screen complaints 
to decide if they merit an on-site investigation. Another 
commenter wrote that this rule goes beyond the Act and 
requires a standard or abbreviated survey in every instance, 
including those which may be an isolated complaint or abuse. 
One commenter proposed revising  488.308(e)(2) to read, 
``The survey agency must conduct a standard or an abbreviated 
standard survey to investigate complaints of violations of 
the requirements by SNFs and NFs that the agency has 
reviewed and determined to provide a reasonable basis for 
investigation.'' 


Response:

 We are clarifying the wording of this 
provision to say the survey agency must review all complaint 
allegations and conduct a standard or an abbreviated 
standard survey to investigate complaints of deficiencies in 
requirements by SNFs and NFs if after reviewing the 
allegation, the survey agency concludes that a violation of 
one or more of the requirements may have occurred and only a 
survey can confirm that a deficiency or deficiencies exist. 
A survey will not be conducted if the complaint raises 
issues that are outside the purview of Federal participation 
requirements.

Section 488.310 Extended Surveys 
 




Comment:

 Several commenters advocated that HCFA 
mandate extended surveys and/or more frequent surveys (every 
6 months) whenever a facility has a nurse staffing waiver. 
Commenters reasoned that requiring extended surveys would 
protect residents through the process of reviewing a 
facility's staffing, as required in sections 
1819(g)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act. One 
commenter raised the presumption that in the case of nurse 
staffing waivers, quality of care problems exist and need to 
be closely examined. Further, the commenters fundamentally 
questioned the legality of granting nurse staffing waivers 
because they believe it contradicts the statutory definition 
of a SNF and NF. 
 


Response:

 While we agree that facilities with nurse 
staffing waivers should be carefully examined to ensure 
sufficient staffing, we do not believe that conducting an 
extended survey is the only means available to do so. The 
standard survey, as described in the Appendix P of the State 
Operations Manual Transmittal No. 250, permits surveyors to 
expand the standard survey ``as needed'' for any reason 
without requiring an extended survey. Subpart I of the 
State Operations Manual, Appendix P, Section A states, ``If 
in conducting the information gathering tasks of the 
standard survey you identify a possible noncompliant 
situation related to any requirement, investigate the 
situation to determine whether the facility is in full 
compliance with the requirements.'' Therefore, surveyors 
could review facility staffing records during the standard 
survey to assure sufficient staffing. We wish to reserve 
the use of extended surveys to those circumstances in which 
we have found substandard quality of care. 
 We are not accepting the commenters' suggestion that we 
require more frequent surveys for facilities with nurse 
staffing waivers. To do so would undermine the State survey 
agency's ability to choose survey intervals. We believe 
that the Congress intended State survey agencies to have the 
flexibility to choose the survey intervals. The law 
specifies that the interval between 2 successive standard 
surveys must not exceed 15 months and that the State survey 
agency must maintain no greater than a 12 month Statewide 
average for standard surveys. 
 We do not address the comments regarding the legality 
of nurse staffing waivers. The requirements for nurse 
staffing waivers are outside of the purview of this rule and 
were included in a final rule published in the 

Federal 
Register

 on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826).

Comment:

 Several commenters questioned the use of the 
survey agency and HCFA discretion to conduct an extended 
survey at any time for any reason. Some commenters 
disagreed that the Act gives HCFA or the survey agency the 
discretion to conduct an extended survey at any time. These 
commenters urged HCFA to clarify that the purpose of an 
extended survey is to identify policies and procedures that 
caused the facility to furnish substandard quality of care. 
 


Response:

 We disagree with commenters who believe that 
the Act does not give HCFA or the survey agency the 
discretion to conduct an extended survey at any time. 
Sections 1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act 
specifically state, ``Any other facility may, at the 
Secretary's or State's discretion, be subject to such an 
extended survey (or a partial extended survey).'' However, 
we recognize that when facilities are subject to an extended 
survey or partial extended survey, they are disadvantaged 
because they automatically lose approval of their nurse aide 
training and competency evaluation programs (NATCEP) for two 
years. There may be other instances when a facility would 
lose their NATCEP, for example, when a facility has a nurse 
staffing waiver or has had a denial of payment for new 
admissions remedy, or temporary manager remedy imposed. 
Therefore, as a matter of policy, we do not expect to 
exercise our discretionary authority to conduct an extended 
or partial extended survey unless we have found substandard 
quality of care on a standard survey or abbreviated standard 
survey and we will advise the State survey agencies in 
manual instructions to adopt the same policy. 
 We have built into our survey process the ability of 
the survey team to expand a standard survey at any time. 
The expanded standard survey can be tailored to the unique 
situation in a particular facility and need not include all 
of the tasks listed at  488.310(b). It allows more 
thorough investigation of specific areas in order to confirm 
noncompliance when the initial scope of the standard survey 
is not adequate to substantiate a particular deficiency. 
But it does not penalize a facility with loss of approval of 
a NATCEP. 
 We are not including proposed  488.160(c)(2) which 
would spell out the State survey agency's and Secretary's 
discretion to conduct extended surveys, as it is unnecessary 
given the explicit language of sections 1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 
1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. 
 


Comment:

 We received numerous comments urging us to 
amend the purpose of an extended survey as stated in 
 488.310(a). One commenter suggested the following 
revision: 


 
 
 

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The purpose of an extended survey is to determine the
 extent of the problems and their effect on residents,
 when surveyors determine or suspect that jeopardy
 exists, in order to document the problems fully and
 determine the appropriate combination of remedies. 
 Extended surveys must be conducted whenever a facility
 has been granted a waiver of nurse staffing
 requirements.





Response: 

We are not accepting this proposed change 
because it is inconsistent with the Act. Sections 
1819(g)(2)(B)(i) and 1919(g)(2)(B)(i) of the Act specify 
that an extended survey must be conducted when the Secretary 
or State survey agency finds substandard quality of care. 
Substandard quality of care does not necessarily pose 
immediate jeopardy to residents. Therefore, the commenter's 
proposal is more restrictive than the Act. As we discussed 
previously, we are not requiring that the Secretary or the 
State survey agency conduct an extended survey when a 
facility has a nurse staffing waiver. 
We believe that adding ``to determine the extent of 
problems and their effect on residents'' to the stated 
purpose of an extended survey is not necessary because it is 
inherent in identifying policies and procedures that caused
 substandard quality of care. For example, if there are poor
 policies and procedures (rather than isolated practices that
 don't conform to appropriate policies and procedures), the
 extent of the problem in the facility could be potentially
 pervasive. 


Comment: 

Other commenters suggested that random
 discretionary extended surveys are a good idea. However,
 they do not believe that penalties should be applied to
 facilities as a result of such random surveys when the
 facility was not cited for substandard quality of care.
 

Response: 

Sections 1819(f)(2)(B)(iii)(I)(

b

) and
 1919(f)(2)(B)(iii)(I)(

b

) of the Act require that the
 approval of NATCEP be withheld or withdrawn for 2 years when
 the State or HCFA conducts an extended survey. The law
 makes no exceptions for extended surveys conducted at the
 discretion of the Secretary or the State. However, we
 believe that we can achieve the indepth random survey
 favored by commenters through the standard survey. As we
 discussed above, the State survey agency or HCFA may expand
 a standard survey at any time without the threat of a loss
 of NATCEP.
 

Comment: 

Several commenters disagreed with or
 suggested alternatives for the items included in an extended
 survey, as specified in proposed  488.160(b). Some
 commenters asked that we add ``and review sampled residents
 in more depth'' after paragraph (b)(1). The majority of
 commenters asked that we delete paragraph (b)(5) which
 requires that an extended survey include ``an investigation
 of any participation requirement at the discretion of the
 survey agency.'' These commenters believe that the proposed
 language exceeds the concept of the statutory language. In
 part the commenters stated:


 
It returns to the old methodology of checking
 everything in contrast to the intent of the IoM study
 and resident-centered outcomes. It would also waste
 fiscal resources that could be better utilized
 elsewhere in the survey system.





Response: 

We are not accepting the proposed amendment
 to  488.310(b)(1) which would add the requirement that the
 survey agency review sampled residents in more depth. The
 purpose of an extended survey is to look at the policies and
 procedures that produced substandard quality of care. The
 Act only requires an expansion of the size of the sample of
 resident assessments and not the depth of the reviews of the
 residents themselves. A more indepth look at residents will
 not facilitate an investigation of policies and procedures
 and should, therefore, be accomplished through a standard
 survey if the survey agency so desires. We also disagree
 with commenters that  488.310(b) should not include ``an
 investigation of any participation requirement at the
 discretion of the survey agency.'' Section 488.310(b) says ``all'' and paragraph (b)(5) says ``any participation
 requirement at the discretion of the survey agency.'' This
 does not mean, as the commenter suggests, that every
 requirement would be surveyed, rather, only those that the
 survey agency chooses.

Comment: 

One commenter asked that we indicate whether 
the 2 weeks specified in  488.310(c) is 2 work or calendar 
weeks (that is, 10 work days or 14 calendar days). Another 
commenter asked that we define ``partial extended survey.'' 
One commenter wondered whether the survey agency would 
notify facilities that they were going to receive an 
extended survey.


Response: 

We are revising  488.310(c) to state that 
the 2 weeks are computed in calendar days. We are defining 
the term ``partial extended survey'' in  488.301 
(``Definitions''). The survey agency will not notify a 
facility when an extended survey will be conducted. The 
survey team will let the facility know at the exit 
conference when it finds substandard quality of care. Based 
on the finding of substandard quality of care, the facility 
will then know that an extended survey will be conducted 
any time within the next 14 calendar days. In most cases, 
we expect that the survey team will conduct the extended 
survey immediately following the standard survey especially 
when it would be more cost effective for the State to 
complete both the standard and extended survey while on site 
rather than scheduling another visit. 


Section 488.312 Consistency of Survey Results 


We specifically asked in the preamble of the proposed 
regulation for comments or suggestions for enhancing 
surveyor consistency. 


Comment: 

Several commenters support efforts by HCFA to 
assure consistency of survey results and the application of 
remedies. However, it was stressed that consistency should 
not receive greater emphasis than accuracy and efficiency. 
Increased accuracy of the citation of deficiencies will lead 
to greater consistency within the survey process. 


Response: 

In the preamble of the proposed rule, we 
stressed that surveyors should be trained to ``exercise 
consistency and accuracy.'' We agree that accuracy is as 
important as consistency and we are including the term in 
the text of the final regulation. Additionally, we believe 
that the recommendations of the studies and analyses 
required by the regulation should be implemented to enhance 
consistency and be monitored by each HCFA regional office. 
These changes are reflected in the final text at  488.312.

Comment: 

Some commenters suggested the use of 
consumers, ombudsmen, other resident advocates, and 
providers to evaluate the quality of the survey process. 
 

Response: 

This rule requires each State survey agency 
to implement programs to enhance consistency. Each State 
survey agency is encouraged to gather pertinent data and 
consider varied sources in its data collection. While we 
agree with this suggestion, we do not want to limit, in 
regulations, what data each State may consider. 
 

Comment: 

Commenters also suggested that deference be 
given to the data compiled on survey consistency by 
``entities and their associations.'' These commenters believe 
that these data are valuable and often compiled in a manner 
which permits ``valid and reliable statistical conclusions 
about the degree of inconsistency among surveyor results.'' 
Additionally, these commenters wanted the final regulation 
to require survey agencies to consult with the regulated 
entities as part of the effort to reduce inconsistency among 
survey teams.
 

Response: 

We assume that the commenters mean ``long-
term care facilities'' when they refer to ``entities and their 
associations.'' Sections 1819(g)(2)(D) and 1919(g)(2)(D) of 
the Act require that the State (and the Secretary under 
section 1819) implement programs to improve consistency in 
the interpretation and application of survey results among 
surveyors. The intent of the Act is to assign the authority 
to administer these programs to the States, not to 
facilities. In fact, the compilation of data to allow 
statistical conclusions about surveyor consistency may be a 
part of the programs that the law requires the States and 
the Secretary to establish. As far as mandating that the 
State survey agency must consult with facilities in the 
effort to ensure consistency, we believe it is unnecessary 
to require this in regulation as it is already inherent 
within the survey process. 
 

Comment: 

Other commenters wanted the required studies 
and programs outlined within the final regulation or the 
State Operations Manual. A few commenters wanted a written 
quality assurance program approved by HCFA which would 
outline specific data to be included in the required studies 
and programs. 
 

Response: 

The only requirements that we are specifying 
in regulations are that the State survey agencies must 
consider surveyor accuracy as well as consistency. We 
believe that it is preferable for individual State survey 
agencies to develop their own programs. 
 

Comment: 

Some commenters believed increased surveyor 
training and testing would enhance surveyor consistency.

Response:

 As previously stated in the preamble to the
 proposed rule, HCFA has implemented an exhaustive surveyor
 training and testing program that will ensure that surveyors
 are adequately trained and competent at performing surveys. 
This requirement is in  488.314.
 

Comment:

 Some commenters advocate the review of every
 statement of deficiencies by survey agency supervisory
 personnel for compliance with the requirements before the
 statement is sent to the provider.
 

Response:

 As stated in the preamble of the proposed
 rule, surveyors will, based upon their collective
 information, match the data to the legal standards the
 facilities are obligated to meet in order to determine if
 deficiencies exist. Most State survey agencies already
 employ some type of supervisory review for all statements of 
 deficiencies prior to provider notification. However, we
 will not require a 100 percent supervisory review in all
 State survey agencies. 
 

Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that a procedure 
for maintaining and monitoring records of individual 
surveyor's proficiency should be initiated and these records 
should be considered in the preparation of deficiency 
reports for facilities. 
 

Response:

 We are not making changes suggested by this 
commenter because there is no statutory basis for using the 
records of individual surveyor's proficiency in the 
preparation of deficiency reports. Compliance is something 
achieved or not achieved by the facility; therefore, 
individual surveyor proficiency records do not obviate the 
obligation of each facility to abide by Federal regulations. 
All decisions regarding the preparation of deficiency 
reports are made as a team, rather than by individual 
members. In fact, we require team decision making and 
provide comprehensive training on the regulations and 
documentation techniques in order to enhance consistency. 
 

Comment:

 One commenter claimed the section of the 
proposed regulation regarding consistency violates the 
Congressional mandate to establish new programs to improve 
consistency by stating ``* * * the collective exercise of 
surveyor judgements, which has always been the vehicle for 
the identification of deficiencies, will remain unchanged.'' 
(57 FR 39290)
 

Response:

 We do not agree with this comment. The 
above passage refers to the method by which the survey team 
collects the data for the identification of deficiencies. 
Following the above passage, as stated in the preamble of 
the proposed rule, this ``collective exercise'' is described 
as how ``* * * surveyors will 

gather 

information based upon 
direct observations, record review, and interviews with 
residents, staff, and family members'' (emphasis added). (57 
FR 39290) Through training, surveyors are instructed on 
this method of information gathering which assists them in 
identifying situations that are indicative of a facility's 
compliance with the regulations. Additionally, the 
Congressional mandate refers to the ``

establishment 

of new 
programs, studies and analyses'' (emphasis added), not to the 
method in which the information is gathered. 
 

Comment:

 A few commenters stressed the importance of 
consistency being sought in the application of enforcement 
remedies as well as the survey procedures. 
 

Response:

 We agree with the commenters. The final 
regulation requires that State survey agencies conduct 
programs designed to enhance consistency in the application 
of enforcement remedies as well as in survey results. 
 

Comment:

 A few commenters questioned the inclusion of 
the application of remedies as part of the evaluation of 
survey consistency. They assume it is not the surveyors who 
would be responsible for the selection and implementation of 
remedies.

Response:

 We recognize that the surveyors are not ultimately responsible for the selection and implementation of remedies.
As stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, it is the surveyor's responsibility to ``* * * 

recommend

 one or more remedies to either HCFA or the SMA [State Medicaid agency] for the enforcement of the requirements.'' (emphasis
added) However, we disagree with the comment questioning the inclusion of the application of remedies as part of the
evaluation of survey consistency. As it was the intention of the Congress to ``* * * measure and reduce
inconsistencies in the application of survey 

results

 * * *,'' (emphasis added) we interpret sections 1819(g)(2)(D) and 1919(g)(2)(D) of the Act to include
both inconsistencies in survey findings as well as inconsistencies in the application of enforcement remedies.
In order for each State survey agency to measure accuracy and consistency in the application of survey results among
surveyors, it must first ensure that these results are consistent across surveyors, and then determine that the enforcement
actions precipitated by the survey results are consistently applied.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that facilities be requested to fill out a questionnaire after their survey to give feedback
on the quality, competence and attitude of their survey teams.



Response:

 We believe that it is unnecessary to require a questionnaire because feedback is inherent in the survey process. There
are numerous times throughout the survey process for the provider to comment upon the performance of the survey team.
Providers have the opportunity to question survey findings during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting
receipt of the official deficiency statement, upon receipt of the same, and through dialogue with the State survey
agency and HCFA regional officials.



Section 488.314 Survey Teams 





Comment:

 Virtually everyone who commented on this proposed section emphasized the importance of ensuring that surveyors
have the appropriate professional credentials for the job and that they receive adequate training. For the most part,
the only differences were over exactly what constitutes ``appropriate'' professional credentials and ``adequate''
training. Opinion ran the gamut from maintenance/safety experts to physicians with experience in geriatric medicine
or long term care. Some suggested that trainees work under the supervision of an experienced surveyor.

Numerous commenters offered suggestions regarding team composition. Two examples included_

 A nurse, licensed administrator, pharmacist, nutritionist, and social services/activities therapist;
and

 A nurse, a maintenance/safety expert, and a social worker.

One commenter suggested that one team member must be ``a physician trained in geriatric and psycho-pharmacology,''
and said that, ``To the extent the new survey process incorporates new guidelines for chemical and physical restraints,
a physician (MD/DO) team member must be included.'' Some said that nurse surveyors should have, as a minimum qualification,
a B.S.N. One commenter said that the nurse on the team should have spent 2 or 3 years as a director of nursing at a long term
care facility. Other disciplines that commenters said should be represented in the ranks of surveyors include speech-language
pathologists, sanitarians, gerontologists, and dietitians. A number of commenters suggested a specific requirement
that all surveyors must have at least 1 year of experience with geriatric populations in a health care or related setting
or experience in long term care. Some said that this experience should be ``hands on'' experience, and a few commenters
suggested that we set forth the size of the team in regulations, with the size being proportional to the number of beds
in the facility or increasing in certain instances such as a historical pattern of serious deficiencies or complaints.

Many commenters asked for clarification of the meaning of ``multidisciplinary'' and ``professionals,'' and one
suggested we use the word ``interdisciplinary'' instead of ``multidisciplinary.''

Finally, one commenter said that surveyors should be sent to the same facilities year after year so that they become
more familiar with the facility and its staff. This would, the commenter suggested, enable the team to do a better job.
Another commenter said that surveyors should be rotated among facilities to maintain their objectivity.



Response:

 We are deleting the modifier, ``health,'' and clarifying the term, ``professionals,'' in  488.314(a)(1)
by setting forth examples. Examples of professionals include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners,
physical, speech, or occupational therapists, physical or occupational therapy assistants, registered professional
nurses, dieticians, licensed practical nurses, sanitarians, engineers, and social workers, but are not completely
inclusive; the State, subject to HCFA's approval, determines what constitutes a ``professional.'' We are deleting
the word ``health'' because it may be appropriate in some cases to include other types of professionals on a survey
team. For example, if the facility has or may have structural problems or other physical plant facilities, an engineer
may be needed.

We have chosen to continue to use the term ``multidisciplinary,'' rather than change it to ``interdisciplinary.''
Dictionary definitions of the prefixes ``multi-'' and ``inter-'' are very broad, with the former generally meaning
``more than one,'' and the latter generally meaning ``between or among.'' Therefore, we believe that ``multidisciplinary''
is the more appropriate choice. Furthermore, ``multidisciplinary'' is the term used in the 
Act. 

Different States have different licensure requirements and different staffing patterns. Also, it is difficult
to recruit qualified professionals in certain areas of the country. Therefore, other than requiring that there at
least be a registered nurse on the team, we do not believe dictating to the States in Federal regulations the precise
composition of survey teams is necessary at this time. (The registered nurse member of the team is necessary because
SNFs and NFs are primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and/or related services.) The most important
considerations are that the surveys be conducted by professionals and that the survey guidelines be followed. All
surveyors must pass HCFA's ``Surveyor Minimum Qualifications Test'' (SMQT), which is in itself, a test of several
disciplines directly related to the survey of health care facilities. 

Cogent cases can be made both for and against surveyor rotation, as is evidenced by the comments themselves. For this
reason, we are considering this an administrative matter and leaving it to the discretion of the States.



Comment:

 One commenter thought that  488.314(a)(2)(i) should be expanded to include surveyors who serve, or within
the previous 2 years, have served as a member of the staff or as a consultant to the chain of which the facility is a part
(if applicable). Another commenter said that we should also disqualify surveyors who work or who have worked in the
previous 2 years as agency staff. The commenter said that, in many States, nurses who work for agencies and are sent
to nursing homes for discrete periods of time are not always considered to be ``staff.''

Other suggestions were to revise  488.314(a)(2)(ii) to disqualify surveyors who_

 Own a part of any nursing home in the State;

 Own a part of any nursing home in the United States;

 Have a financial interest or any direct or indirect ownership interest in the facility to be surveyed, or in
any related facility, company, or chain; or

 Have an immediate family member who is a resident or an 
employee of the facility. 
 Finally, one commenter wants to prohibit any surveyor 
from accepting a job with a facility for 1 year after the 
individual has last surveyed it. 
 

Response: 

In response to comments, to preclude 
conflicts of interest and to ensure survey objectivity, we 
are expanding  488.314(a)(2) to disqualify anyone from 
surveying a facility if he or she works, or, within the 
previous 2 years, has worked as an employee, as employment 
agency staff at the facility, or as an officer, consultant 
or agent for the facility to be surveyed. The surveyor is 
also disqualified if a member of his or her immediate family 
has, or, within the previous 2 years has had, such a 
relationship with the facility or if a member of his or her 
immediate family is, or within the previous 2 years has 
been, a resident of the facility. 
 
 
In  488.314(a)(2), we continue to disqualify surveyors 
who have a financial interest or any ownership interest in 
the facility but have deleted the modifying phrase ``direct 
or indirect'' to preclude misunderstandings. One commenter, 
for example, interpreted the restriction against ``indirect'' 
financial interest to mean that a surveyor would be 
disqualified if he or she held shares in a broad-based 
mutual fund which included ownership in health care 
facilities. (This was not our intent.) The issue of what 
constitutes disqualifying financial interest must be 
discussed in considerable detail, and our manuals provide 
the most appropriate vehicle for this discussion. However, 
we have broken out the parallel restriction on surveyors 
whose family members have direct or indirect ownership 
interest and placed it in a new  488.314(a)(2)(iii). We 
are also extending the  488.314(a)(2)(i) disqualifying 
requirement to family members in paragraph (a)(2)(iii). 
Finally, in a new paragraph (a)(2)(iv), we disqualify any 
surveyor who has an immediate family member who is a 
resident of the facility. 
 
 
We believe that these safeguards are sufficient to 
ensure objectivity and that nothing beyond these is 
warranted. Finally, in our view, prohibiting any surveyor 
from accepting a job with a facility for 1 year after he or 
she has last surveyed it is unnecessary and would be 
difficult to enforce. Whether or not the ex-surveyor has 
surveyed that particular facility before would be of less 
benefit to the facility than the in-depth knowledge of 
Federal requirements that the individual could share with 
the facility. We believe that such knowledge can help the 
facility achieve and maintain compliance which ultimately 
serves the residents. The protection of the residents' 
health, safety, dignity, and general interests is our 
primary goal. 
 

Comment: 

Commenters were generally critical of 
surveyor training and skills, and most offered specific 
suggestions on how training could be enhanced. Some 
examples follow: 
 
 
 There should be provider and/or ombudsman input for 
surveyor training and/or testing; 
 
 
 ``Activity professionals'' or ``individuals with 
significant clinical and investigative skills'' should teach 
at least part of the surveyor training course; 
 
 
 Training should include__ 
 
 


_Interviewing and investigatory skills; 
_Quality of care standards; 
_Communication skills, particularly for communicating 
with residents who may have communication barriers; 
_How to identify outcomes; 
_How to identify iatrogenic declines; 
_How to identify care conditions that could lead to 
decline or failure to improve if not properly addressed; 
_Standards of care for the professional disciplines 
involved; 
_More training on long term care issues;

_Rules of evidence; 
 _120 hours or more field work experience in a long term 
care facility; 
 _Pharmacology; 
 _Gerontology; 
 _Therapeutic recreation; 
 _Training to produce or to update clinical competency 
in each surveyor's area of expertise; 
 _Residents' rights; 
 _Resident assessment and care planning; 
 _Mental health care and services; 
 _Rehabilitation; 
 _Correct application of the applicable statutes and 
regulations; and 
 _Proper documentation; 
 


 
 
 Some of the training should be done in the field; 
  There should be annual in-service training for 
surveyors; 
  Training should be held not only for surveyors, but for 
other State personnel with related duties; 
  There should be a continuing education requirement for 
surveyors; 
  Surveyor training must stress that only the established 
Federal survey methodology may be used in determining 
facility compliance; 
  The techniques taught in surveyor training courses 
should be published for public comment; 
  Providers, at their own expense, should be permitted to 
take surveyor training courses; 
  The number of training slots must be increased so new 
survey agency employees do not have to wait so long to 
receive HCFA surveyor training; 
  Training should be made available locally or through 
interactive video; 
  A passing score on a pre-test should not exempt a 
surveyor from the final test; all should be required to take 
and pass the final test; 
  All Federal and State surveyors should be trained by 
qualified, national HCFA staff; 
  Survey agencies should have built in mechanisms for 
quality assurance and supervision; 
  The survey agency's leadership should include health 
professionals and attorneys; 
  There should be a formal complaint mechanism that 
providers may use without fear of reprisal to challenge the 
actions and activities of ``rogue'' surveyors;

 No one should be a member of a survey team unless he or 
she has successfully completed a training and testing 
program, not only on how to conduct a standard survey, but 
on how to conduct an extended survey as well. Proof of 
successful completion of this training must be made 
available to the facility prior to the initiation of a 
survey; and 
 Before a citation is given, the surveyor must be able 
to demonstrate a negative outcome. 
One commenter said that the HCFA policy that surveyors 
are not to be consultants is a great disservice; surveyors 
should adopt a role like the JCAHO surveyors. Another said 
that HCFA should convene a national group of experts, 
including State and Federal surveyors with extensive 
experience, nursing facility providers, and consumers, to 
identify the knowledge and skills needed by survey teams. 
Some said that surveyors should pass not only the 
initial examination, but be tested annually. The passing 
scores for the tests should be 85 percent or more, 
commenters said, and the results of the testing and 
remediation must be made available to the public. 
One commenter said that, when surveyors are cross-
trained, their expertise in the new area is not good enough 
to survey facilities' performances in that area. For this 
reason, the commenter suggested that  488.314 be revised 
``* * * to preclude the use of surveyors without demonstrated 
professional training and experience in the substantive area 
being surveyed. By professional training and experience,'' 
the commenter said, ``we do not mean on-the-job or inter-
agency in-service training. Rather, we mean graduates of 
accredited or approved educational institutions.'' 
One commenter said that there should be no 
``grandfathering'' of surveyors. Another asked the following 
three questions: 
 What validity and reliability studies were conducted to 
ensure the test measures the ability of surveyors to perform 
their functions in a consistent manner? 
 Has the test been validated to allow States to meet 
their affirmative action plans? 
 Are the results of the tests in line with the State's 
requirements for merit systems and collective bargain 
contracts? 


Response: 

The listing of suggested topics for surveyor 
training was extensive. Some of the items (for example, 
correct application of the applicable statutes and 
regulations, quality of care standards, and proper 
documentation) are already covered in surveyor training. We 
believe others are inappropriate to require as part of 
survey training; they should be provided as part of each 
team member's initial and continuing training within the 
context of training for his or her area of professional 
expertise. 
We would encourage, but do not require, States to allow 
surveyors in training to act as observers on actual surveys 
in the field, and are taking all possible measures to meet 
the demand for surveyor training. For example, we are 
planning to use satellite transmissions for training 
courses. We have already begun to move ahead with one of 
the other suggestions, interactive video training. As for 
provider and/or ombudsman input for surveyor training and 
testing, we have convened a national workgroup which 
includes provider organization and consumer advocacy group 
representatives to assess the surveyor training program and 
make recommendations for changes. Finally, we will listen 
to all reasonable suggestions from providers and ombudsmen, 
but do not agree that the regulations need to be revised to 
require this input.

The qualifications for surveyors, other survey agency 
personnel, and HCFA trainers, we believe, are already high. 
In our operating experience, we have seen no reason to 
believe otherwise. Even if we required that each team 
include a physician, as some commenters recommended, we are 
not certain that some providers would be any more pleased 
with the survey results than they are now. We remain 
unconvinced that one must be a physician or an acknowledged 
expert in a clinical specialty in order to perform a valid 
survey. We believe that the heart of the survey process 
consists of clear guidelines and a detailed review of the 
results. 
The suggestions that survey training materials be 
published for public comment are addressed under the 
``Determination of a Deficiency'' section of this preamble. 
The suggestion that providers be permitted to attend 
survey training courses at their own expense has merit. 
Traditionally, we have had no provisions for accommodating 
all providers interested in attending: our resources are 
taxed enough by simply trying to provide timely training for 
surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training 
universally to providers at their own cost may help improve 
understanding and cooperation between surveyors and 
providers. We are therefore seriously considering the 
changes in law necessary to allow this. 
We do not accept the suggestion that surveyors present 
providers with proof of the successful completion of 
surveyor training. The fact that a surveyor is sent by the 
State or HCFA is, in itself, evidence that the bearer meets 
the requirements to be a surveyor. 
A number of the commenters did not make any suggestions 
with respect to the proposed rule. Instead, their comments 
were in the context of denigrating surveyors with whom they 
had had unpleasant experiences, declaring that running a 
facility is costly, frustrating, and unappreciated, or 
protesting the whole survey process in general. Because no 
specific suggestions were made concerning the proposed rule, 
we are unable to respond to these kinds of broad complaints. 


Comment: 

Two commenters suggested revising the end of 
the sentence at proposed  488.164(c) as follows: 
* * * completed the required training and competency testing 
program.'' Another said that, at the onset of each survey, 
facilities should be told which surveyors are serving as 
observers, and regulations should stipulate that these 
individuals should be excluded from active participation in 
the survey process. 
Some other commenters said that surveyors-in-training 
should be allowed to participate in the survey process as 
long as they are appropriately supervised. They said that, 
historically, these individuals have been used to 
``* * * collect information to be used by qualified surveyors 
during the deficiency decision making process.'' Further, 
two commenters said, not allowing surveyors-in-training to 
observe would mean that new surveyors would face significant 
periods of nonproductive time while waiting for courses to 
be offered. 


Response: 

We agree that surveyors must not only 
complete the required training, but the competency testing 
program as well. However, paragraph (c) already requires 
that a surveyor successfully complete ``* * * a training and 
testing program.'' We do not agree that the survey team 
should, at the outset of a survey, identify which of its 
members (if any) have not yet completed the required 
training and competency testing program. We also disagree 
that surveyors who have not yet completed the training and 
testing program should ``be excluded from active 
participation.'' We do not want to prohibit the ``historic'' 
role of observers mentioned by two of the commenters, that 
is, to ``* * * collect information to be used by qualified 
surveyors during the deficiency decision making process,'' or 
forbid individuals from making valuable contributions to the 
survey process if they are in a position to do so. We are, 
therefore, amending this section ( 488.164(d) in the 
proposed rule) redesignated as  488.314(c)(3) in the final 
rule, to provide that the survey agency may permit an 
individual who has not completed a training program to 
participate in a survey as a trainee if accompanied onsite 
by a surveyor who has successfully completed the required 
training and testing program.

Proposed  488.166 Validation Surveys


We have reconsidered the necessity of including this section in the text of the regulation, and have concluded that
it would be pointless and redundant to retain it. We believe that the statutory provisions upon which this section
is based are self-implementing, and that regulatory interpretation is not needed to clarify them. In addition, the
few elaborations on the requirements in sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the Act, which are found at  488.316
are duplicated elsewhere in the regulations, and we believe there is little reason to repeat them. Appeals applicable
to certifications of noncompliance based on validation surveys will be conducted according to  488.330, Certification
of compliance or noncompliance.
In the absence of a regulatory section devoted to validation surveys, we are adding a definition of a validation survey
to  488.301, Definitions, to serve as a reference because the term is used elsewhere in the regulations.
Our decision to not finalize proposed  488.166 does not make the public comments we received on this section
any less valuable for they are still pertinent commentary on validation survey policy and we are responding to them,
accordingly.


Comment: 

Several commenters insisted that HCFA validation surveys should be conducted concurrently with the State survey.
Other commenters encouraged HCFA to use the Onsite Performance Assessment and Training Survey (OSPATS) as the validation
survey method. Still other commenters said the HCFA validation survey should be as soon as possible after the State
survey, but no more than 2 weeks, 3 weeks or 30 days after the State survey. Most commenters noted that survey findings
may vary slightly from day to day and that it was essential that both survey teams were viewing the same set of facts.
In addition, concurrent surveys cause less disruption to facilities and residents and enable HCFA to provide immediate
feedback to State surveyors. One commenter recommended that HCFA validation surveys not be concurrent; another
said the unexpected nature of the validation survey was important in that the facility will return to its ``normal
daily routine'' after the State survey; and one commenter said the HCFA validation surveys were a waste of time.


Response: 

We agree with the commenters as to the advantages of a validation survey concurrent with the State standard recertification
survey. To that end, HCFA has developed the OSPATS. The OSPATS long term care survey process has Federal surveyors
assessing the facility while evaluating State survey agency performance. This process, which is fairly new for long
term care surveys, is believed by some providers to be less disruptive to facilities and residents. It does ensure
that both Federal and State surveyors observe the same conditions in the facility. It is our intent to expand the use
of the OSPATS process for validation surveys. We also agree that when the validation survey is not concurrent with
the State survey, it should occur as soon as possible after the State survey. Sections 1819(g)(3)(A) and 1919(g)(3)(A)
of the Act permit a 2 month period; in practice HCFA attempts to schedule the surveys closer to the State survey. However,
often there are scheduling and/or travel difficulties, which make minimum intervals between the two surveys difficult
to achieve. We want to retain the flexibility to use whatever survey process best achieves the goals of the Act. The
commenters who said that the validation surveys should not be concurrent or were a waste of time presented no reasons
or alternative proposals. We can say only that validation surveys, concurrent or not, are mandated by sections 1819(g)(3)
and 1919(g)(3) of the Act.

Comment: 

Several commenters proposed that HCFA establish procedures that would enable resident advocates, families and
the interested public to request validation (complaint) surveys for specific facilities. These procedures should
include public notice including a regulatory requirement that a poster notice be displayed in facilities. HCFA would
be required to respond to such requests and investigate complaints against facilities and allegations of poor performance
of State agencies.


Response: 

Disclosure of survey-related information is in accordance with  488.325, and it is also discussed in detail
under the section of this preamble entitled, ``Disclosure of Survey Information.''
We understand the concerns expressed by the commenters who would like HCFA to perform complaint investigations and
validation surveys at the request of advocates and other individuals. The Act and current regulations ensure that
the State survey agencies will respond to allegations of poor care or abuse and will investigate these allegations
according to State law and HCFA requirements. Most complaints directed to HCFA are referred to the State agencies
for investigation. HCFA is not staffed sufficiently to respond directly to complaints and/or requests for validation
surveys. The small HCFA survey staff is occupied fully in the assessment of State agency performance of its survey
and certification responsibilities under section 1864 of the Act. Because of these constraints, we are unable to
accept the commenters' suggestions.


Comment: 

Certain commenters asked that we give a facility that is dissatisfied with the State survey the ability to request
a validation survey and receive it within a reasonable time period.


Response: 

As mentioned above, we do not have the resources to conduct validation surveys upon every request. If a provider believes
that the State survey was done in an inappropriate manner, it may file a complaint with the HCFA regional office at whose
discretion a validation survey may be, but need not be, performed.


Comment: 

One commenter was concerned that when selecting facilities for validation surveys, HCFA will not draw a random sample
but will select inferior facilities in order to cut its Medicaid obligations to the States.


Response: 

This fear is groundless. It is not the quality of the facility that determines whether the State will be sanctioned
for inadequate State survey agency performance, but rather the quality of the State's assessment of the facility
which is relevant. Facility noncompliance does not reflect poorly upon the State unless the State has failed to identify
it.


Comment: 

One commenter believed that the identities of facilities on which validation surveys are to be performed should not
be disclosed to the State survey agency.


Response: 

There is no justification for such a policy. Currently, HCFA notifies States of an impending validation survey either
3 days before a nonconcurrent Federal validation survey or 3 weeks before a Federal/State OSPATS survey. In the case
of the nonconcurrent Federal validation survey, this allows the State to arrange to have a surveyor present to observe
the Federal survey and take advantage of the instructional opportunities that it presents.


Comment: 

Several commenters with recent experience with validation surveys noted that the State and Federal surveys were
very different; the Federal surveys stressed concepts (for example, use of restraints) not emphasized by the State.


Response: 

The primary emphasis of the Federal validation survey is on assessing State survey performance. Therefore, the Federal
review may stress certain areas of compliance in which an evaluation of State performance is particularly important.
In addition, the long term care survey protocol has only been in effect since October 1990, with appropriate instruction
enhancements for the final long term care regulations which were effective April 1, 1992. It is not unusual that some
variation in emphasis will occur in a new survey process. HCFA is committed to a survey process that produces accurate
and consistent findings. To that end, we have organized numerous educational sessions for Federal and State surveyors,
held regional training conferences in the HCFA regions and produced the ``Principles of Documentation'' which is
an attempt to standardize the writing of deficiency citations. Despite all of these continuing efforts, some variation
will remain as long as human beings perform surveys and statutory requirements involve the making of professional
judgments. As far as the use of restraints is involved, the decrease of restraints has been a HCFA priority since the
inception of the new survey protocol.


Comment: 

One commenter suggested that HCFA perform validation surveys of all facilities that have a waiver of the RN director
of nursing or other licensed nursing requirements for a year or more. Others suggested that HCFA list the criteria
it uses to select facilities for validation surveys and that the validation sample should reflect the State's diversity
in location, size and ownership of facilities.

Response:

 The selection of facilities for validation surveys depends upon which facilities the State has surveyed recently
or intends to survey imminently. Within those constraints, the typical sampling process for selecting facilities
for a validation survey ensures that a wide variety of facilities are selected. Because of this and the heavy demands
placed upon HCFA survey staff, we do not accept these suggestions that add survey responsibilities not mandated by
the Act. Moreover, we do not see the necessity of targeting facilities with waivers for validation surveys because
an annual review of the appropriateness of each waiver will be conducted whether the facility to which it was granted
is subject to a validation survey or not. 



Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that HCFA validation surveys be required to use the ``methods, procedures, and forms
prescribed for use by the survey agency.'' 



Response:

 The language used in the proposed rule (that HCFA conduct validation surveys ``using the HCFA protocol prescribed
for use by the survey agency'') was derived from sections 1819(g)(3)(A) and 1919(g)(3)(A) of the Act, which require
that the Secretary conduct validation surveys using ``the same survey protocols as the State is required to use * * *.''
We do not believe that there is any meaningful difference between the phraseology suggested by the commenter and that
used in the proposed rule. 



Comment:

 A few commenters said that when HCFA conducts a focused review at its discretion, it should not exceed the authority
contained in the Act. 



Response:

 HCFA's authority to conduct a survey at its discretion is pervasive in the Act. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that all validation surveys should be conducted by special teams dispatched from and responsible
to the HCFA headquarters office. 



Response:

 The HCFA survey staff is located in the ten HCFA regional offices. Although there are staff persons in the HCFA headquarters
qualified to conduct surveys, surveying is not their primary function. 



Comment:

 One commenter stressed that the HCFA surveyors should meet with the State surveyors if the Federal survey findings
disagree with the State findings. Another commenter said that the Federal validation survey team should not review
the State survey findings until after the Federal survey. 



Response:

 It is HCFA practice to meet with the State survey agency whenever possible if there is a significant difference of findings
between a State survey and the Federal validation survey. Often this is not possible because of time and travel constraints.
In these cases, we notify the State survey agency of the findings and begin discussions regarding the appropriate
enforcement remedy to apply. We agree with the commenter that a face to face meeting is the best practice. Current instructions
to Federal and State surveyors are to review all pertinent documents regarding the performance of the facility before
starting the survey. In practice, this review seldom covers the most recent State survey, because it is not available,
as these survey reports are not sent routinely to the HCFA regional offices. We appreciate the apparent concerns of
the commenter; however, it will be difficult to prevent Federal surveyors from seeing the most recent State report
at some time during the Federal survey because, in accordance with  483.10(g)(1), survey results must be made
available in the facility. Despite the concerns of the commenter, we believe that the accuracy of the Federal survey
is not compromised by the knowledge of what the State findings were. In any case, the increased use of the OSPATS process
should reduce the concerns of both commenters. 



Comment:

 One commenter said that the statutory provision that requires no fewer than five validation surveys in each State
is discriminatory to small States.

Response:

 We understand the commenter's concerns. However, sections 1819(g)(3)(B) and 1919(g)(3)(B) of the Act are explicit
that HCFA must conduct surveys in no fewer than five facilities in each State. 



Comment:

 A few commenters said that validation surveys should be focused on State survey performance, not facility compliance.
Unless the HCFA survey discovers a serious threat to residents, the findings should be directed toward the State.
For egregious failures of State survey performance, HCFA should consider contracting with another professional
survey entity. 



Response:

 The primary purpose of the validation survey is to assess State survey performance. In the process, we do determine
facility compliance and must take action consistent with this information. Therefore, the validation survey can
result in actions against non-compliant facilities and against the State. Section 488.320 provides the sanctions
authorized by the Act to be imposed against the States. 



Comment:

 One commenter said that validation surveys should focus on the validity of State deficiencies cited as well as the
failure to cite deficiencies. If the focus is on only the State's failure to cite deficiencies, it may lead State surveyors
to cite more deficiencies as a means of preventing Federal sanctions. 



Response:

 We agree with this comment. The HCFA focus is now and will continue to be on the accuracy of the State survey. Part of that
focus is to alert the State survey agency to situations where State surveyors are failing to cite valid deficiencies.
We are aware of the possibility that some State surveyors might cite more deficiencies in order to avoid sanctions
against the State. We have no concrete evidence that any actually have done so. In any case, our education efforts,
including training on the ``Principles of Documentation,'' are directed to the writing of accurate, well documented
deficiencies. Well documented deficiencies are more likely to prompt corrective action and avoid unnecessary contentiousness
between providers and survey agencies than poorly documented deficiencies. 



Comment:

 One commenter said that HCFA should provide for two separate hearings because the deficiency determinations and
the remedies selected are based on two sets of facts. Other commenters said it would be better to have one hearing; either
State or Federal. One commenter suggested that the closer the validation survey was to the State survey, the easier
it would be to hold one hearing.

Response: 

The Act is constructed so that a facility 
subject to a validation survey is entitled to only one 
hearing, either State or Federal. The provisions at section 
1919(h)(7) of the Act furnish the means for resolving 
disagreements between HCFA and the State over whose 
enforcement action will control, which in turn, determines 
whether the facility is entitled to a hearing under part 431 
or part 498. Moreover, HCFA excludes from the validation 
sample any facility against which adverse action has been 
initiated by the State survey agency. Therefore, if HCFA 
imposes remedies against a provider on the basis of 
noncompliance identified during a validation survey, HCFA's 
remedies are the only ones imposed, and the provider can 
contest the determination of noncompliance leading to the 
enforcement remedy in one Federal hearing. 




Section 488.318 Inadequate Survey Performance 






Comment: 

Some commenters asked how HCFA would 
determine ``inadequate survey performance'' by a State agency. 




Response: 

We monitor State agency survey performance 
primarily by reviewing State survey team findings and by 
conducting validation surveys. Sections 1819(g)(3) and 
1919(g)(3) of the Act, as added by sections 4202 and 4212 of 
OBRA '87, require the Secretary to conduct validation 
surveys of at least 5 percent of the SNFs and NFs in each 
State that have been surveyed by the State survey agency 
(but in no case less than 5 facilities). Prior to the 
effective date of OBRA '87, HCFA, acting for the Secretary, 
monitored State performance by conducting Federal monitoring 
surveys. OBRA '87 formalizes this process. The validation 
surveys must be conducted within 2 months of the date of the 
State's surveys and must be of sufficient number to allow 
inferences about the adequacy of the State's surveys. 




Comment: 

Several commenters said HCFA should sanction 
individual surveyors when they make erroneous findings 
against facilities, whether the errors are intentional or 
unintentional. 




Response: 

Section 1864(a) of the Act authorizes the 
Secretary to enter into agreements with State survey 
agencies to determine whether SNFs meet the Federal 
participation requirements for Medicare. Section 
1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act provides for State survey agencies 
to perform the same survey tasks for facilities 
participating or seeking to participate in the Medicaid 
program. HCFA assesses the performance of each State's 
survey and certification program annually, and  488.320 
sets forth the sanctions that HCFA may impose upon the 
States for inadequate survey performance. With respect to 
sanctions against individuals, we note that, with the 
exception of the relatively small number of HCFA staff who 
perform validation surveys, surveyors are State agency 
personnel, appointed and paid by the State agency, and 
supervised by State managers. For these reasons, HCFA 
considers that any corrective or disciplinary action is a 
State matter. Whenever HCFA validation surveys uncover 
errors on the part of any individual State agency surveyor, 
the State is informed so it can take whatever action is 
necessary. 


As a final measure, formal mechanisms are in place 
which provide an opportunity for facilities to appeal 
certifications of noncompliance that lead to enforcement 
remedies, except State monitoring. 




Comment: 

A few commenters said States may begin to 
cite more deficiencies than usual in order to avoid 
sanctions by HCFA based on failure to meet the requirement 
at  488.168(c) of the proposed rule, which provided that 
HCFA would consider it inadequate performance when a State 
agency fails to identify an immediate or nonimmediate 
jeopardy situation, substandard care, or other deficiencies.

Response: 

HCFA monitors the accuracy of a State survey 
agency's findings by performing validation surveys and 
reviews. Accuracy means not only that the State team has 
appropriately cited all the deficiencies that existed, but 
also that it has not cited a deficiency when no violation of 
a requirement has occurred. HCFA conducts random surveys 
concurrently with the State surveys as well as independent 
surveys within 2 months of the States' surveys, and also 
conducts indepth reviews of selected State survey 
documentation. If HCFA discovers that a State is 
systematically citing unfounded deficiencies, HCFA will 
consider there to be inadequate survey performance and may 
apply any of the sanctions provided for at  488.320(b)(2) 
of the proposed rule, Sanctions for Inadequate Survey 
Performance, in the case of Medicare facilities. In the 
case of Medicaid facilities, HCFA cannot reduce FFP as 
specified at  488.170(b)(1)(i) of the proposed rule because 
we have concluded that section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act does 
not accommodate such action under this scenario. The two 
terms of the FFP reduction formula at section 1919(g)(3)(C) 
of the Act are: the total number of residents in nursing 
facilities surveyed by HCFA during a quarter; and, the total 
number of residents in nursing facilities found pursuant to 
HCFA surveys to be noncompliant. The number of residents in 
nursing facilities which HCFA found to be compliant but 
which the State determined were noncompliant does not figure 
into the calculation; therefore, no FFP reduction can be 
taken when the form of the State survey inadequacy is the 
citation of unfounded deficiencies, or indeed when the 
inadequacy is anything other than the State's failure to 
identify deficiencies. However, the Act does allow the 
Secretary to impose another sanction for the citation of 
unfounded deficiencies in Medicaid facilities. Section 
1919(g)(3) of the Act states that the Secretary may also 
respond to inadequate State survey performance in Medicaid 
facilities by providing for the training of the State's 
survey teams. We are amending  488.320 of the regulation 
to indicate this and to clarify that the citation of 
unfounded deficiencies will be considered inadequate survey 
performance. An additional safeguard against the citation 
of unfounded deficiencies will be afforded to facilities by 
their opportunity to engage in informal dispute resolution, 
as described in  488.331. 





Comment: 

Some commenters said that  488.318 precluded 
facilities from informally challenging or expressing 
disagreement with survey findings. 





Response: 

All States currently offer some opportunity 
for providers to refute survey findings. In one State, the 
process is required by State law. It is State policy in the 
rest. Although these policies vary among States, they all 
apply to State surveys of Medicare and Medicaid providers. 
In addition, HCFA's State Operations Manual requires that 
States allow facilities to interact with the survey team 
during the survey, to discuss findings at an exit 
conference, to raise unresolved issues to the State survey 
agency or the HCFA regional office, or both, and to record 
their disagreement on the HCFA-2567. If none of these 
courses of action satisfy the provider, there are appeal 
mechanisms available. 



However, whenever possible, we want to provide every 
opportunity to settle disagreements at the earliest stage, 
before much time and money are spent by the provider, the 
State agency, and HCFA. Therefore, we are requiring, at 
 488.331, that States offer an opportunity for informal 
dispute resolution beginning with the provider's receipt of 
the official statement of deficiencies. Although inadequate 
survey performance will not invalidate adequately documented 
deficiencies, neither the State's inadequate performance nor 
a resulting HCFA sanction imposed on the State will prevent 
the facility from formally or informally challenging or 
expressing disagreement with survey findings. 





Comment: 

One State was concerned that any 
disagreement between the Federal and State agencies will 
equate to inadequate survey performance on the part of the 
State.

Response:

 We will not automatically consider any disparity between validation and State survey findings as inadequate survey
performance. For example, when Federal surveyors find a facility in compliance with a requirement that the State
cited as a deficiency, Federal surveyors are directed to go through a decision making process to determine if the disparity
is due to facility correction or a flaw of the State survey. When Federal surveyors find deficiencies that were not
previously cited by the State, we will consider whether the discrepancies can be explained by changed facility conditions
or by other case specific factors before concluding that State survey performance has been inadequate.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested we reverse the order of the provisions of this section, making the reference to the failure
to identify poor resident care of greater importance.



Response:

 We do not imply that the way in which paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) are ordered is of any relevance. All are of equal importance.



Comment:

 One suggestion was that determinations of inadequate survey performance be based on a State agency's overall performance
rather than on isolated instances. Commenters believed that a pattern of noncompliance and noncorrection should
be established before HCFA concludes that there is inadequate survey performance, and that HCFA should only consider
State survey performance to be inadequate when the State ``substantially'' fails to perform as required. Others
requested that we consider there to be inadequate survey performance only when the State fails to identify serious
deficiencies.



Response:

 Sections 1819(g)(3)(C) and 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act specify actions the Secretary may and must take if the State has
failed to perform surveys as required by the Act or if a State's survey and certification performance is otherwise
inadequate. Although the Act requires us to apply sanctions for inadequate survey performance, it gives us leeway
when it comes to determining what inadequate survey performance actually is. The Act does not specify the criteria
by which the Secretary is to make determinations of inadequate State performance, and does not obligate us to sanction
the State for every survey shortcoming. It would be inappropriate and unduly harsh to automatically consider any
failure by a State to cite a deficiency or to follow proper procedure to be inadequate survey performance. Rather,
we believe it would be preferable to reserve sanctions for States that demonstrate a pattern of failure to identify
deficiencies, or to follow proper procedure, or whose isolated oversights are particularly egregious. Changing
facility conditions may account for many of the discrepancies between Federal and State survey findings, and because
not every discrepancy or omission indicates systemic inadequate survey performance, not every one should cause
a State to automatically lose FFP or be subject to other sanctions.

We reflect this policy in  488.320. Guidelines for making determinations of inadequate survey performance
will be forthcoming in future manual instructions.



Comment:

 Some commenters said that any findings or remedies resulting from inadequate survey performance should be rescinded.



Response:

 As we stated in  488.168(c) of the proposed rule (which has been redesignated as  488.318(b) in this final
rule), ``Inadequate survey performance does not relieve a SNF or NF of its obligations to meet all requirements for
program participation, nor does it invalidate 

adequately documented

 deficiencies.'' (emphasis added) In other words, a flawed survey can still validly document one or many deficiencies;
the facility is still liable for sanctions where deficiencies, in fact, exist.

Section 488.320 Sanctions for Inadequate Survey Performance 




Comment: 

Some commenters asked if the State Agency Evaluation Program (SAEP) was going to be used to evaluate State survey agency
performance under this section. Certain commenters believe that it should be. 


Response: 

The SAEP is currently undergoing comprehensive evaluation. We do not know if the program, in its future form, will
be designed to identify performance problems of individual States for enforcement purposes, or whether the purpose
of the program will be more geared toward global evaluation of the State agency survey and certification process as
a whole. HCFA will, however, obtain information on the adequacy of State agency survey activity through validation
surveys and otherwise through its general oversight authority. 


Comment:

 Certain commenters recommended that we limit determinations of inadequate survey performance to the OSPATS. It
was their view that it is unfair to reduce FFP based on a comparison of survey findings, as conditions in nursing homes
change daily. 


Response:

 As stated previously, we acknowledge that there are great advantages to conducting a validation survey concurrently
with the State's standard recertification survey, and it is our intent to expand the use of the OSPATS process for validation
surveys. However, we reiterate that it is necessary to continue to use nonconcurrent validation surveys, despite
the preference of the States and HCFA for OSPATS, because Federal surveyors must have at least one year of experience
surveying before they are eligible to conduct an OSPATS. 


Comment: 

Some comments suggested the rules should state whether or not appeals under this section should stay the reduction
of FFP action. 


Response: 

Section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act requires that appeals of sanctions under this rule are to be made according to section
1116 of the Act. According to section 1903(d)(5) of the Act, if an appeal of a disallowance is made, the State has the
option of retaining the funds disallowed pending a final administrative decision. If the final decision upholds
the disallowance and the State elected to retain the funds during the appeal process, the proper amount of the disallowance,
plus interest computed in accordance with  488.442 will be offset in a subsequent grant award. 


Comment: 

Some commenters complained that FFP reduction is an excessive measure, and suggested that FFP not be reduced as a sanction,
or be reduced only after other methods of addressing inadequate State agency performance have been tried and failed.
Other commenters asked that the same sanctions be imposed against the State for inadequate survey performance regardless
of whether the inadequately surveyed facilities participate in Medicare or Medicaid. An additional commenter recommended
that we levy financial penalties against the survey agency instead of reducing FFP to the State. 


Response: 

While we appreciate the merits of these suggestions, section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act does not give us such flexibility.
Rather, it requires that, when HCFA finds, on the basis of validation surveys that the State has inadequately surveyed
Medicaid nursing facilities, HCFA may provide for training of State survey teams, but shall provide for a reduction
of FFP according to a prescribed formula.

However, the FFP reduction formula specified at section 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act and at  488.170(c) of the proposed
rule has certain limitations: it cannot be used to sanction a State when it has cited unfounded deficiencies or when
its survey findings are appropriate but its survey scheduling, team composition or other practices are unacceptable.
However, these survey defects are no less serious than a failure to identify deficiencies, and it is unlikely that
the Congress intended for us to disregard them. HCFA does have the authority to provide for the training of survey teams
in these instances. We are revising  488.320(b)(2) to provide that when the State's survey performance in Medicaid
facilities is inadequate but the inadequacy is not accommodated by the FFP reduction formula, HCFA will provide for
the training of State survey teams. In addition, HCFA has the authority to consider the Medicaid provider agreement
to be invalid for failure to follow proper survey procedures, and may invoke the FFP disallowance provision at  442.30,
Agreement as evidence of certification. 
We are unable to make the sanctions for inadequate survey performance parallel across facility type as commenters
suggested. As discussed above, the Act does not permit us to eliminate FFP reduction as a sanction for inadequate survey
performance in Medicaid facilities, and neither does it allow us to expand the application of this sanction to inadequate
survey performance in Medicare facilities. The conspicuous absence of Federal payment reduction in section 1819(g)(3)(C)
of the Act, which lists sanctions for inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities, as opposed to the inclusion
of FFP reduction in section 1919(g)(3)(C), which specifies sanctions for inadequate performance in Medicaid facilities,
is a clear indication that the Congress intended to restrict Federal payment reduction for inadequate survey performance
in Medicaid facilities alone. Likewise, section 1819(g)(3)(C) gives us the flexibility to devise our own sanctions
for inadequate survey performance in Medicare facilities, but no comparable authority exists in section 1919(g)(3)(C).
Therefore, we must assume that the Congress did not intend for us to impose sanctions other than the two specified in
the statute for inadequate survey performance in Medicaid facilities. 


Comment:

 One commenter asked that we convene a technical advisory group composed of State agency and HCFA regional office personnel
to explore the possibility of a legislative amendment to the Act's FFP reduction requirement. 


Response:

 We do not see the necessity of requesting a legislative amendment, but will not discourage the States if they choose
to pursue one. 


Comment:

 A question was asked regarding whether the reduction of FFP would be by audit exception or through a reduction in the
amounts of future budget approvals. 


Response: 

Procedures for such actions will be written following existing procedures found in section 3165, ``Non-audit Medicaid
Disallowances'', of the Regional Office Manual. As noted above, such procedures will be in accordance with section
1116 of the Act. 


Section 488.325 Disclosure of Results of Surveys and Activities 




Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that  488.325(a)(1) be expanded to require that the scope and severity levels of
all deficiencies, including those deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1, be recorded on and, therefore
disclosable as part of, the official deficiency statement, in an effort to promote facility competition and quality.
Some of these commenters argue that we must disclose notice of all deficiencies, regardless of scope and severity
level, if we are to provide the public with a complete and accurate report of a facility's current compliance status.
Some propose that another requirement be added under  488.325(a) to read: ``(9) The summary of 1-1 deficiencies.''

Response:

 As discussed later in this preamble, we are revising the scheme that appeared in the proposed rule by eliminating scope
and severity scales, as such, and by substituting instead a scheme in which HCFA and the State will assess deficiencies
by application of several factors that will gear enforcement remedies to the seriousness of noncompliance at facilities.
However, we are accepting the second comment with some modification. With the exception of isolated deficiencies
that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for only minimal harm, all deficiencies
will be recorded on the HCFA-2567. Those isolated deficiencies will not be recorded on the official deficiency
statement, but will be recorded on a separate document as discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule. However,
all of a facility's deficiencies, including those deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual
harm with potential for minimal harm, will be disclosable. We are revising  488.325(a)(2) to require the release
of the summary of isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with potential
for minimal harm deficiencies. 


Comment:

 One commenter asked how this information will be disclosed to the public and also wanted to know if facilities have
any responsibility relative to disclosure. The same commenter wasn't sure what we meant by ``direct or indirect interest
in a SNF or NF'' as used at  488.325(a) (7) and (8). 


Response:

 Existing procedural requirements at   401.133-136 and 431.115 as well as sections 3300-3320
in the State Operations Manual remain in effect relative to public disclosure of Medicare and Medicaid survey documents,
respectively. While  431.115 provides only minimum disclosure requirements for States, it directs that States
have a procedure for disclosing the specified survey information. 
Sections 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provide the statutory bases for  488.325 regarding disclosure
of inspection and other information on SNFs and NFs by the States and HCFA. The only requirement we are imposing on nursing
home providers in this regard is that, not later than 10 working days after receiving a notice of substandard quality
of care, a SNF or a NF must provide the State with a list of each resident in the facility and the name and address of his
or her attending physician. Failure of the facility to disclose the information timely will result in termination
or alternative remedies being imposed. 
Due to an administrative oversight, the word ``ownership'' was omitted from the proposed regulation text at proposed
 488.175(a) (7) and (8), clarifying ``direct or indirect interest.'' We are revising both cites, which have
been redesignated as  488.325(a) (8) and (9), respectively, to specify ``ownership'' interest. We are also
cross-referring these cites to  420.201, which defines ``direct'' and ``indirect'' ownership interest.

Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that results of complaint surveys be disclosable under this subpart. 


Response:

 The regulation implementing sections 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provides that information must be made
available by the State or HCFA for all surveys and certifications. Therefore, information from any survey, including
a complaint survey, is disclosable under this subpart. 


Comment:

 We received four distinct comments on  488.325(b), which concerns charges associated with making information
available. First, some commenters believe that, while charges should be permitted, they should not be required,
nor should they, when imposed, exceed the amount facilities charge residents for copies of records. They proposed
that the requirement to follow 42 CFR 401.140 regarding fees and charges be reduced to a suggestion by changing the
word ``will'' to ``may.'' Second, other commenters contended that  401.140 is outdated, too restrictive,
and in conflict with some States' Freedom of Information laws. Since many States have adopted their own fee schedule,
they suggested that this provision be revised to permit States to use their own fee schedule. Third, one commenter
questioned HCFA's authority to require States to impose any charges. Lastly, some commenters proposed that the regulation
allow for waiver of fees or reduced fees so that survey information is truly accessible to all. 


Response:

 We are not accepting the suggestion that fees imposed by HCFA or the States relative to disclosure parallel those charged
by facilities to residents because we have no basis to develop a provider-specific disclosure policy relative to
fees. However, since  431.115(d) requires only that the Medicaid agency ``have a procedure for disclosing
pertinent findings obtained from surveys made by the State survey agency,'' and since we understand that most, if
not all, States have their own fee schedules, we are amending this subsection to allow, but not require, States to use
their respective fee schedules for documents which they maintain and which they have been asked to disclose. In response
to the comments that fees be permissible but not required, as well as the request for a fee exception clause, we refer
the commenters to  401.140(c), which provides for waiver or reduction of fees for Medicare. That section discusses
when a waiver of fees and charges would be appropriate and permissible; States are free to use any such waiver provisions
within their respective disclosure procedures in the same way that they are free to use or not use a fee schedule at all.

Comment: 

Numerous commenters were strongly opposed to allowing oral requests for information. Some say that this is clearly
inconsistent with past practice which has generally been that requests be in writing. This claim is further substantiated
by the Freedom of Information Act which provides that all agencies generally stipulate that requests for information
be in writing. Some commenters say that only written requests can substantiate specific charges and fees, while others,
specifically States, use the written requests as a record of the distribution of information which is used for workload
and expenditure reporting, as well as for other administrative purposes. 


Response: 

Since publishing the proposed rule, we have concluded that it is not necessary to create a facility-specific requirement
relative to the method by which requests for survey information should be made, and we are revising  488.325(c)
to provide that such requests are to be made in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services' regulations
relative to disclosure at 45 CFR Part 5, in other words, generally in writing. 


Comment: 

Many commenters suggested that paragraph (d)(3) be expanded to include providers' responses in order to be consistent
with  488.325(a)(1) as well as to ensure full disclosure of all affected parties. 


Response: 

With the exception of those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with
potential for minimal harm, which are recorded on a separate form and which can be refuted by providers during the dispute
resolution process, any provider response to the deficiency statement itself would be noted on the plan of correction
(both of which are explicitly releasable under the Freedom of Information Act), we are making explicit in  488.325(d)
that provider responses to the deficiency statements are disclosable. 


Comment: 

Some commenters believed that States and facilities should be required to provide information immediately, especially
when State law or policy provides immediate access. Commenters also wanted to know whose disclosure provisions apply
(HCFA's or the State's) when there is a difference about what is releasable and when. A few commenters asked us to specify
whether the 10 days referred to in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) are calendar or working days. 


Response: 

As we have stated above, we have no basis to require facilities to disclose any information other than that which is
statutorily mandated. OBRA '90 provided that each State and the Secretary (HCFA), must make available to the public
information concerning all surveys and certifications of NFs and SNFs, including statements of deficiencies, and
approved plans of correction, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities.
For procedures relative to release of information not included in the OBRA '90 provision, HCFA or the State should
defer to  401.136 or State procedures, respectively. Also, we note that  488.325(d) implements sections
4008(h)(2)(M) and 4801(e)(14) of OBRA '90, which require release of information by HCFA and the States, respectively,
not by providers. 
Since paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of the proposed rule offered no additional guidance to HCFA or the States beyond what
is currently at  401.136 or in State procedures, respectively, we are deleting them. However, we are clarifying
the 10-day timeframe at  401.136 as ``working'' days. 
The question of whose regulations prevail when disclosure requirements differ between HCFA and the State should
not arise since the State and Federal disclosure systems operate separately from one another. It is possible that
the same document could be releasable under a State's disclosure laws yet not be releasable under Federal law, or vice
versa. It is also possible that a disclosable document may be released by HCFA and the State subject to different disclosure
timeframes. In other words, documents maintained by Federal agencies are subject to Federal regulations; those
maintained by the State are subject to the State's regulations.

Comment: 

A few commenters requested clarification regarding the 14 calendar days referenced in paragraphs (d)(3). They weren't
sure whether there was a single release of information that would occur 14 calendar days after some event, or whether
more than one release of information, each after 14 calendar days, was contemplated. Another commenter wanted to
know if the statement of deficiencies and plan of correction are a single document. 


Response: 

While the statement of deficiencies and the plan of correction are recorded on the same form (Statement of Deficiencies
and Plan of Correction, Form HCFA-2567), the completion and disclosure of each is separate, not concurrent.
The deficiency statement, as well as the separate sheet transmitting survey findings of isolated deficiencies which
constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm, are notices that the certifying agency gives to a provider
transmitting its official survey findings. We have concluded that, since the separate listing of a facility's isolated
deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm supplements the official deficiency
statement, the listing must be disclosed along with the official statement of deficiencies if we are to provide the
public with an accurate and complete report of that facility's compliance status. This information is disclosable
within 14 calendar days after it is made available to the provider. Upon receipt of the statement of deficiencies,
the provider responds, on the same form, with its plan and timetable for correction of cited deficiencies, as well
as any disagreement with the survey findings. Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act require that a
plan and timetable for corrective action be approved by HCFA if alternative remedies are the only remedies being sought,
and if the facility is to continue to participate with deficiencies that do not constitute immediate jeopardy in either
or both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Information about the plan of correction must be released to the public,
upon request, within 14 calendar days after the provider is notified of the approval status of its plan. Therefore,
each part, that is, the deficiency statement and the plan of correction, is releasable within 14 calendar days after
the provider's notification of that part.

Comment:

 A few commenters believe that States should not charge the State ombudsman for the notifications specified in this
subsection. 



Response:

 Since the information in this subsection is being disclosed by the State, any fees and charges, or waivers thereof,
would be subject to the specific State's disclosure law. 



Comment:

 Several commenters requested that proposed  488.175(e)(4) (redesignated in this final rule as  488.325(f)(4)),
be expanded to include requests for appeals as well as results of appeals. A few other commenters suggested that the
paragraph be revised to include facility cost reports, confidential survey records, for example, surveyor notes,
etc. 



Response:

 We are accepting the first suggestion and are revising redesignated paragraph (f)(4), to provide that the State must
provide the State's long term care ombudsman with requests for appeals and results of appeals. We are not accepting
the second suggestion. The fact that the Congress explicitly provided that a facility's Medicare and Medicaid cost
reports are disclosable to the public in accordance with applicable disclosure laws, and not routinely disseminated
to any specific party, demonstrates its intention that release of these reports should be based on the requestor's
right to know the information. The State's long-term care ombudsman, as well as any other member of the public, may
request these cost reports, surveyors' notes, and any other survey-related documents not included in this subsection
through the appropriate disclosure mechanism, for example, the Freedom of Information Act, where they will be evaluated
accordingly. 



Comment:

 Many commenters, mostly State agencies, were opposed to routinely providing ombudsmen with the information required
by this subsection. They contend that this results in a costly and overwhelming task especially in the larger States;
for example, California has 1300 nursing homes and 42 ombudsman field offices. They propose that a more reasonable
approach to notification would be that in cases where a specified degree of noncompliance exists, for example, substandard
care, notification would be automatic; in all other cases, notification would be upon request. Another comment was
that HCFA should develop a report using data from current reporting systems to provide the needed information. 



Response:

 We cannot accept these suggestions. Sections 1819(g)(5)(B) and 1919(g)(5)(B) of the Act, as amended by sections
4008(h)(2)(N) and 4801(e)(15) of OBRA '90, specifically provide, without exception, that ``States'' will notify
``the State long-term care ombudsman'' of a State finding of noncompliance with ``any'' participation requirement
as well as of ``any'' adverse action imposed against a facility in that State. Regarding the number of ombudsmen offices
within a State to which notifications must be made, we note that, since the statutory requirement to notify ``the State
long-term care ombudsman'' is singular, the State's central long-term care ombudsman office within each State's
organizational structure is the intended contact point for satisfying such notification requirements. While we
see the function of disseminating the information further among the district and other ombudsmen offices to be the
responsibility of the State's central long-term care ombudsman office, each State has the flexibility to design
its own system. 



Comment:

 A few commenters wanted HCFA or the State to notify the ombudsman of a nurse staffing waiver within 7 days of its approval.
Several commenters proposed that notice of nurse staffing waivers be provided to prospective residents, their physicians,
families or legal representatives, the State licensure board for nursing and the State and local medical societies.
They based their proposal on the public's need to know, not only from a consumer's perspective, but as taxpayers who
directly subsidize the affected facilities.

One commenter wanted to know who validates that nurse staffing waiver information is actually provided to those required
to receive it. 

A couple of commenters asked that the notice to residents about nurse staffing waivers be in the form of a sign and be
posted in a prominent place in the facility to ensure that notice is received. 


Response: 

Since publishing the proposed rule, we found that disclosure of nurse staffing waivers is addressed in regulations
at 42 CFR 483.30. Also, since sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act are clear as to the individuals and
organizations that would have the greatest need for specified survey-related information, we believe that all interests
have been adequately represented and that such information is easily accessible to any other interested parties
either through their respective professional affiliations, or through the public disclosure mechanism. Therefore,
we are eliminating notifications specific to nurse staffing waivers from this final rule. 


Comment: 

Some commenters urge that ombudsmen, protection and advocacy systems for the mentally ill and mentally retarded,
residents or legal representatives and immediate family members, and the public should be given an opportunity to
comment on a proposed nurse staffing waiver before it is granted. 


Response: 

This comment is outside of the purview of this regulation. 


Comment: 

One commenter suggested that we delete the last sentence of  488.175(h) (redesignated in this final rule as
 488.325(g)) relating to enforcement consequences to a facility that fails to satisfy the disclosure requirement
timely because it is not necessary. 


Response: 

We are not accepting this comment. We believe we must retain this provision since this final rule provides HCFA's and
the State's enforcement strategy when facilities do not substantially meet the nursing home participation requirements
which are codified at 42 CFR Part 483, Subpart B. The requirement that facilities provide information to the State
relative to specified residents so that the State can meet its statutory obligation to notify attending physicians
and licensing boards is in addition to the other participation requirements at Part 483, Subpart B, and we believe
that consequences for facility noncompliance with this requirement are noteworthy. 


Comment: 

Many commenters were opposed to our proposal implementing sections 1819(g)(5)(C)(i) and 1919(g)(5)(C)(i) of the
Act regarding notice to physicians when the State finds that a nursing home has provided substandard quality of care.
All of these commenters objected to the requirement that the attending physician of each Medicare and Medicaid resident
receive notification of the substandard quality of care. Some believed that physicians of all residents in the facility
should be notified when such care is found because they contend that all residents are vulnerable to such care and a
program relationship should not need to exist before notifications occur. An equal number of commenters argued that
this subsection exceeds the statutory requirement that provides for notification of ``* * * the attending
physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made * * *''. These commenters suggested
that the purpose of the statutory requirement was to ensure that the physician of a resident who has allegedly received
substandard quality of care is apprised of the situation in order to ensure appropriate medical interventions, if
needed.

Response:

 We are adopting a modified version of the above suggestions and are requiring that the physician of each resident in
the facility who was found to have suffered substandard quality of care, regardless of payment source, be notified
of findings of substandard quality of care. Findings of substandard quality of care are indicative of the facility's
inability or unwillingness to meet specific participation requirements relative to the entire resident population.
While we have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of program beneficiaries and recipients
in nursing homes that participate in one or both programs, noncompliance frequently affects residents in a facility,
other than just Medicare and Medicaid residents. Moreover, the Act plainly applies to all residents receiving substandard
quality of care regardless of payment source. Therefore, findings of substandard quality of care must be communicated
to the physician of each resident who was the subject of such care. 



Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that notification to the State board responsible for the licensing of the facility administrator
be limited to those situations where the administrator is found culpable for the violations identified. They describe
situations in which a reputable administrator is recruited to a problem facility in an effort to turn the facility
around. Shortly thereafter, a survey is performed which identifies substandard quality of care, and as a result,
the newly hired administrator is reported to the licensing board. They point out that this situation provides a disincentive
for quality administrators to assume control of problem facilities due to the risk to their reputation. A few commenters
wondered why licensing boards need to be notified, while others believed that notification should be expanded to
include State licensure boards for nursing and medicine as well as the State and local medical societies. 



Response:

 We are not accepting these suggestions. First, the requirements to notify the licensing board, as well as physicians
of Medicare and Medicaid residents, when substandard quality of care is identified, are statutory and do not provide
for exceptions. Second, a facility administrator, regardless of recency of appointment, is ultimately accountable
for the care and services provided in his or her facility at the time of the survey. We would expect that this consideration
as well as others would be evaluated by a prospective facility administrator. 

Regarding the comment that notification should be expanded, sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act
are clear as to the individuals and organizations that would have the greatest need for the specified survey-related
information. We believe that all interests have been adequately represented and that such information is easily
accessible to any other interested parties either through their respective professional affiliations, or through
the public disclosure mechanism. Therefore, we see no need to expand the list of parties the State must notify about
substandard quality of care. 



Comment:

 Several commenters asked whether the State notification requirements at sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C)
of the Act apply to surveys performed by HCFA. 



Response:

 States will provide the notification regardless of who performed the survey that identified the substandard quality
of care. For all State-operated facilities, as well as non-State-operated facilities which are subject to a Federal
survey, HCFA will notify the State of the finding of substandard quality of care so that the State can fulfill the notification
requirements. This requirement is based on the rationale that the State ``finds'' noncompliance when it is notified
of it by HCFA. This approach permits use of existing State systems and centralizes notification efforts.

Comment:

 Some commenters complained that in cases where the facility fails to provide the list of residents and their physicians
required in proposed  488.175(h) (redesignated in this rule as paragraph  488.325(g)), the State will
be unable to comply with the State notification requirements in proposed paragraph (i) (redesignated in this rule
as paragraph (h)). If the facility provides the list late, the State will miss its 30-day deadline. These commenters
believe that this paragraph should be rewritten to require the State to issue notice within 30 calendar days of receipt
of the resident/physician information from the facility. 



Response:

 We are accepting this suggestion with some modification and are revising redesignated paragraph (h) to read, ``Not
later than 20 calendar days after a SNF or NF complies with paragraph (g), the State must provide written notice of the
noncompliance to_''. This revision imposes the notification requirement on the State once the State has received
the necessary information from the facility. Also,  488.325(g) provides that facilities that fail to provide
the information to the State timely will have termination or alternative remedies imposed. 



Comment:

 A few commenters questioned whether there would be a revisit prior to the notification to physicians and licensing
boards, and, if so, and corrections had been made, whether notifications must still occur. 


Response:

 The Act does not require revisits, appeals or any other pre-notification activity prior to notification to physicians
and licensing boards. If the facility does manage to correct the deficiencies designated as substandard quality
of care and have the correction substantiated by State or Federal surveyors before the notification, that notification
should indicate that corrections have been made. However, the Act is clear that physicians and licensing boards are
to be notified when the facility has provided substandard quality of care. Therefore, substandard quality of care
provided before corrective action was taken, still must be reported. 



Comment:

 A few commenters wanted to know how physicians will know when a facility, previously found to have provided substandard
quality of care, has achieved compliance. Other commenters questioned whether physician and licensing board notifications
are subject to an appeal by the facility, and if so, whether the results of the appeal will be communicated to the physicians
and licensing board. These commenters also asked what becomes of this information. 



Response:

 There is no statutory basis for notifying physicians more than once about a facility's compliance status. However,
there is nothing to preclude facilities, physicians, or licensing boards from following up on this matter absent
a statutory or regulatory requirement. Physicians are free to initiate inquiries into this matter, just as facilities
are free to contact physicians and licensing boards about corrective action having occurred after the initial notification
by the State.

While the notification in and of itself is not appealable, providers may appeal, in accordance with parts 431 or 498,
as applicable, a finding of noncompliance that caused a remedy or remedies to be imposed. However, there is no statutory
basis to require that results of provider appeals be communicated to the physicians and licensing board previously
notified of the substandard quality of care. Again, the providers are free to notify physicians and licensing boards
about the outcomes of these appeals and physicians and licensing boards are free to inquire about such matters. 
All information related to the survey and certification of Medicare and Medicaid providers is retained in accordance
with Federal and State provider survey and certification records retention requirements. 


Section 488.330 Certification of Compliance or Noncompliance 




Comment: 

A small number of commenters suggested that HCFA delegate to the State all enforcement responsibilities for the SNF
portion of dually participating facilities. Commenters believe that States have better resources to perform the
enforcement functions and this solution would eliminate duplicative efforts and be more cost effective. One commenter
further suggested that the State handle all enforcement responsibilities for all SNFs. 


Response: 

We cannot accept this suggestion. Section 1819(h)(2) of the Act requires the Secretary to take certain enforcement
actions when the Secretary finds either through his or her own survey, or through the State's survey, that a SNF no longer
meets the requirements set forth in section 1819(b), (c) or (d) of the Act. Thus, we do not have the authority to delegate
the enforcement authority for SNFs to the State. 


Comment: 

A few commenters believed that HCFA, not the State, should perform the on-site surveys of State-operated nursing
homes. 


Response: 

To the extent possible, we have attempted to use the survey and certification process in effect before October 1, 1990,
whereby the survey agency would conduct the survey and certify compliance or noncompliance with Federal requirements,
subject to HCFA approval as necessary for SNFs. The OBRA '87 legislation made a distinction between State operated
and non-State operated facilities. Specifically, OBRA '87 provided that the Secretary would be responsible for
certifying State-operated facilities. To be as consistent as possible with our present survey process, we proposed
that the State survey agency would conduct all surveys (with the exception of validation surveys). We believe that
requiring survey agencies to survey all facilities will make surveys for all nursing homes in a State more consistent
since the same entity will conduct all surveys. However, HCFA would maintain the certification responsibility,
thus assuring oversight as envisioned by the Act. 


Comment: 

Some commenters were concerned that, although the Secretary's determination of a facility's noncompliance takes
precedence over a State's finding of compliance, the regulation is unclear about which agency's remedies control
when both HCFA and the State determine that the facility is not in compliance. 


Response: 

When both the Secretary and the State survey agency agree that a facility is not in compliance, the rules at proposed
 488.232 (redesignated as  488.452(b),(c),(d) and (e)) are applied to determine whether the Secretary's
or the State's timing and choice of remedies control. 


Comment: 

A few commenters were unclear about whether the validation survey and the certification survey would be counted as
separate surveys for sanction purposes because the denial of payment sanction must be imposed when the State or Secretary
finds substandard quality of care through three consecutive standard surveys. 


Response: 

The Secretary's finding of noncompliance during a validation survey would not be counted toward three consecutive
findings of substandard quality of care. Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act refer to facilities
being found to have provided substandard care under three consecutive standard surveys conducted under sections
1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act, respectively. Sections 1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act describe the State's
standard survey of a facility. 


Prospective Providers 


In the proposed rule, we asked for public comments regarding our requirement that prospective providers be in full
compliance with the requirements of sections 1819 (b), (c) and (d) and 1919 (b), (c) and (d) of the Act in order to participate
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, respectively.


Comment:

 Many commenters believe that HCFA's proposal ignores the concept of substantial compliance because the proposed
regulations define any failure to comply with the regulations as a deficiency. The commenters suggest that the regulation
be rewritten to state that facilities will be judged on substantial compliance. A few commenters asked if a deficiency
with a scope of 1 and a severity of 1 would constitute noncompliance that is sufficient to exclude a prospective provider
from program participation.

Response: 

After carefully considering the matter, we are accepting the commenters' suggestion to incorporate the concept
of substantial compliance in the regulation as the standard that prospective providers and existing providers must
meet in order to begin or continue to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We arrived at this conclusion
for several reasons. 
Based on public comments and further consideration on our part, we believe that the notion of perfect compliance,
as discussed in the proposed rule, is an impractical and, perhaps, unrealistic standard for providers or prospective
providers to meet. This is because in lieu of approximately 15 statutory requirements with which facilities had to
comply before OBRA '87, the Act now sets forth more than 100 requirements that facilities have to meet in order to participate
in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. In fact, in 1992 only 7.3 percent of all nursing homes surveyed were deficiency-free.
Under a regulatory system defined by condition and standard level requirements, such as the system in place for many
years, we found that almost all facilities that were experiencing only minor problems did retain program eligibility
since the system allowed for some noncompliance at the standard level. That is no longer the case. By vastly increasing
the number of statutory requirements that facilities have to meet in order to meet the statutory definition of a SNF
or NF, and by directing the Department to do away with its former hierarchy of requirements, the Congress made it far
more difficult for facilities to meet prerequisites for program participation. As discussed above, however, we
do not believe that the Congress intended to write into law a set of requirements that would eliminate almost all providers
from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, we have drawn upon the principles enunciated by the Institute
of Medicine in its study of nursing home regulation that helped spawn nursing home reform. 
A benchmark of the IoM study was its conclusion that the focus of nursing home regulation should be on resident outcomes
and not procedural requirements that do not always accurately measure whether quality care is being rendered. Sections
1819 and 1919 of the Act, and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR Part 483, as well as our survey process, reflect
this focus. 
We believe that the Act sets forth many examples of requirements which, if violated by a facility, would not necessarily
expose a resident to the potential for anything more than minimal harm, much less actual harm. For example,  1919(b)(3)(C)
requires that a facility conduct a resident assessment for each individual no later than 14 days after admission.
If a facility were to conduct almost all of its assessments in compliance with this requirement, but failed in the case
of only one resident who was assessed on the 15th day after admission, a very narrow reading of the statute would compel
a conclusion that the facility was out of compliance and thereby failed to meet the statutory definition of a nursing
facility under  1919(a) of the Act. This kind of approach to nursing home regulation, as we alluded to above,
would be unduly harsh and impractical where the facility's failure did not expose the resident to any harm. Indeed,
it may be the case that the facility prepared an exemplary assessment for the one resident for whom it acted untimely.
The same type of analysis could be made for violations of the requirement at  1919(c)(2)(B) regarding the requirement
to be given at least 30 days in advance notice of a resident's transfer. Where in a given case, a facility gives 29 days
advance notice, the question might better be, was there a potential for minimal harm as a result of this infraction
rather than conclude that the Act was violated and expose the facility to one or more remedies, even where the resident
experienced no more than the potential for minimal harm.

Accordingly, we are defining ``substantial compliance'' at  488.301 as a level of compliance with requirements
of participation such that any identified deficiencies pose no greater risk to patient health and safety than the
potential for causing minimal harm. Thus, while a facility may avoid a remedy even if it fails to comply perfectly with
all statutory requirements, it still has a duty to each resident to provide care that enhances the chances of positive
outcomes and avoids negative outcomes. If a single resident experiences any harm, a facility will not have satisfied
its statutory obligations. Given the statute's focus on each resident's right to receive quality care, and the facility's
mirrored obligation to provide it, we believe that we could not adopt a less rigorous standard of compliance. 

We acknowledge that there might be many definitions that we could have chosen from, but in our view the definition we
have settled upon strikes the appropriate balance that best implements the statute, the IoM study, and accommodates
both facility and resident concerns. 

Second, as commenters suggested, we considered the fact that section 1866(b)(2) of the Act allows the Secretary to
enter into provider agreements with facilities that ``substantially'' meet applicable requirements. Although
there is no analogous provision in the Medicaid law for nursing facilities, we are exercising our general rulemaking
authority in section 1102 of the Act, to extend the ``substantiality'' concept to Medicaid providers. We believe
that since Congress stressed that it intended to adopt the IoM recommendation that the same requirements apply to
both Medicare and Medicaid facilities, it is logical to recognize substantial compliance as an acceptable standard
to meet for participation in both programs. 

As we discuss in more detail later in this preamble, the scope and severity gradations that appeared in the proposed
rule will only serve as one example of how States can determine remedies. Furthermore, we are removing the numerical
designations from the scope and severity measure. In response to the commenter who asked if a deficiency at a scope
of 1 and a severity of 1 would constitute noncompliance sufficient enough to exclude a prospective provider from program
participation, the answer is no. While we are not mandating the use of numerical ranges, if States use such ranges,
and if a 1/1 designation denotes a deficiency which is of limited scope and which has caused no harm and is unlikely to
cause more than minimal harm, a facility with such a deficiency would not be precluded from participating in the Medicare
or Medicaid program.

Comment: 

Several commenters raised concerns with the provision that facilities must meet all requirements because they wonder
how many follow-up surveys will be necessary to ascertain that a facility is in full compliance. 



Response: 

As we discussed earlier, we reconsidered our position spelled out in the proposed rule that prospective providers
had to comply perfectly with all requirements to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Instead, we are
requiring that providers and prospective providers be in substantial compliance with all requirements in order
to participate in both programs. If a State survey agency is requested to conduct more than one initial survey of a prospective
provider because it was not in substantial compliance, the State survey agency will have the flexibility to conduct
follow-up surveys up to three weeks after the facility alleges correction of the noncompliance that disqualified
it from Medicare and/or Medicaid participation. This is consistent with section 2008 of the State Operations Manual
which established 3 weeks as the timeframe in which the State should conduct an initial survey of a prospective provider
after its notification of full operation. The 3-week interval is necessary to allow the State survey agency adequate
time to schedule a revisit, and gives the prospective provider who has corrected noncompliance the opportunity to
demonstrate that it is capable of continued substantial compliance. 



Comment: 

Some commenters suggested adding a phrase at the end of the sentence in  488.330(b)(2)(ii) to require that when
a provider has achieved compliance, the State can only remove the remedy if the State has reason to believe that compliance
will be maintained. 



Response: 

We accept this suggestion, but only with regard to the denial of payment and State monitor sanctions imposed for repeated
substandard quality of care, as specified at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act, and for the imposition
of temporary management as specified at sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii), and 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii)
of the Act. Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act provide that, if the State or Secretary finds substandard
quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys, the State or the Secretary must impose a denial of payment remedy
and monitor the facility until the facility has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary or State that it
is in compliance with the requirements of sections 1819 (b), (c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d), and that it will
remain in compliance with such requirements. Likewise sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(iii)
of the Act specify that temporary management must not be lifted until the Secretary or State has determined that the
facility has the management capacity to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of sections 1819 (b),
(c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d) of the Act. We are, as explained earlier in this preamble, imposing a substantial
compliance standard for the purpose of imposing and lifting sanctions. Therefore, for the above mentioned remedies,
we are requiring that the remedies be lifted when the facility achieves substantial compliance and the facility has
demonstrated to the Secretary or the State that substantial compliance can be maintained. There is no statutory authority
for the continuation of any other remedies past the date that a facility achieves substantial compliance. We are making
changes to  488.330(b)(2)(ii) accordingly and corresponding changes to proposed  488.236 (redesignated
as  488.454).

Comment:

 A few commenters recommended amending the proposed text to provide that a facility that is certified meets all Federal
requirements, except that a facility may be considered to meet the requirements if it has requested and been granted
a waiver by either HCFA or the State survey agency. Commenters further requested that we clarify in the regulation
that once a waiver is granted, the existing situation which required the waiver is not considered a deficiency for
the purpose of remedies or repeat deficiencies. 


Response:

 We do not believe the regulation needs to be changed. Waiving requirements renders those requirements not applicable
to a particular facility for the duration of the waiver. If requirements are not applicable to a particular facility,
that facility cannot be out of compliance with those requirements. Therefore, when a facility has been granted a waiver
of certain requirements, there would be no remedies imposed nor would those waived requirements be considered when
looking at a pattern of repeated noncompliance. 


Comment:

 Some State commenters believed that the proposed rule was unclear about when the certification of compliance or noncompliance
would be issued. For example, in the case of a plan of correction, would HCFA or the State certify compliance after an
acceptable plan of correction was received or would noncompliance be certified, and after successful completion
of the plan of correction, a subsequent certification of compliance be issued. 


Response:

 The certification of compliance or noncompliance is issued by the State survey agency approximately 20 to 25 days
after the last day of the survey. A finding of substantial compliance is considered within the range of compliance
and would receive a certification of compliance. A certification of compliance would be issued after a certification
of noncompliance if, as in the example the commenter offers, a facility submits a plan of correction and achieves substantial
compliance. The exact mechanism by which the facility will be notified of the subsequent certification of compliance
will be specified in manual instructions. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that HCFA not terminate a Medicaid provider agreement based on a validation survey unless
there is immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety. 


Response:

 We continue to believe that there is ample authority in the Act for the Secretary to terminate Medicaid provider agreements
in situations that do not pose immediate jeopardy. First, section 1919(h)(3)(B) of the Act provides that ``[n]othing
in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a facility's
deficiencies.'' Second, section 1919(h)(3)(C) of the Act provides that the Secretary may provide for other specified
remedies. We view these provisions as statutory authority and Congressional intent that the Secretary design enforcement
remedies that will assist in effectively assuring prompt and lasting compliance by nursing facilities that serve
the Medicaid population. Third, the Act already expressly provides for terminations by the Secretary in non-immediate
jeopardy cases. Specifically, sections 1919(h)(6) and 1919(h)(7) of the Act, by their own terms, apply to findings
of noncompliance by the Secretary when there is no immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety. Each of these
provisions speaks to actions of the Secretary to terminate the provider agreement of such facilities. Accordingly,
we are not accepting the commenter's suggestion. 


Comment:

 A few commenters recommended that we revise  488.330(d)(1) to remove ``nature of noncompliance'' and replace
it with ``basis for the determination.'' The commenters suggested that the word ``nature'' was not specific enough
and does not furnish the provider with the necessary information to formulate an appropriate plan of correction or
response to deny the allegation. Some commenters further suggested that the facility should be provided with full
information that supports each citation and the survey agency's decisions including the underlying reason, basis
or rationale for the findings of noncompliance with a regulatory requirement.

Response:

 We are not accepting this suggestion because we believe that the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction
Form (HCFA-2567) provide facilities with the specific information necessary to formulate an acceptable plan
of correction. To include such detailed information regarding deficiencies in the notice of noncompliance would
be duplicative and administratively burdensome. We also are not accepting the suggestion to replace ``nature of
noncompliance'' with ``basis for the determination'' because we believe there is virtually no substantive difference.



Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that the notice of a certification of noncompliance should include all of the specified
items in  488.330(d) and not only some of them. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters and are amending  488.330(d) to require that all of the information included in
proposed paragraph (d) must be included in the notice. 


Comment:

 Many commenters supported our proposal to impose remedies prior to the hearing, and noted that from the perspective
of the residents and their families this proposal is a strength of the proposed rules. These commenters approved of
applying remedies once the violations are found. Consumer groups emphasized that imposing remedies prior to appeals
is essential to carrying out the statutory requirement to ``minimize the time between identification of violations
and the final imposition of remedies''. They also commented that the IoM report expressed a similar view, stating
that HCFA ``should develop regulations that would allow states to implement sanctions prior to hearings and appeals.''
Many commenters stressed that delays in enforcement could harm the residents, and that remedies should not be delayed
pending a hearing. One consumer group noted that immediately imposing a restriction on admissions while a hearing
is pending is particularly effective. 
Many commenters also indicated that facilities should initiate a plan of correction immediately. 


Response:

 We agree with the above comments, and are adopting procedures that allow for the swift imposition of remedies prior
to a hearing. We believe that the intent of the Act was that remedies be imposed as soon as possible in order to protect
the residents. 


Comment:

 Several commenters were concerned that providing hearings only after imposition of remedies denied providers their
rights to due process. Many commenters recognized that in cases of immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety,
pre-hearings were not necessary, but in cases in which there is no immediate jeopardy, they favored a hearing prior
to imposition of any sanctions. Some commenters wanted HCFA to require the States to give an informal hearing prior
to imposition of alternative remedies if the deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety.

A few commenters recognized that the majority of courts that have addressed the issue have found that providers are
not constitutionally entitled to pre-hearing relief, but that a minority of courts have found that hardships are
imposed on providers and residents when no pre-termination process is afforded. These minority-view courts have
found facilities entitled to a pre-termination hearing on due process grounds when no pre-termination procedures
are available. 
A few commenters challenged HCFA's reliance on the court cases which have upheld post-termination hearings on the
grounds that these cases involved deficiencies analogous to immediate jeopardy situations. These commenters concede
that in immediate jeopardy situations, the residents' interests are compelling enough to permit post-termination
relief to providers, but not otherwise.

Several providers noted that residents could suffer transfer trauma, the facility's business could be destroyed,
and facility employees could lose their jobs, none of which could be restored if the facility were ultimately successful
on appeal. A few commenters noted that a prior hearing is often the only safeguard against a mistake or incorrect judgment
of a less experienced surveyor. 

A few people commented that when penalties become incrementally more severe for repeated non-compliance, and imposition
of penalties takes into account a facility's compliance history, the need for hearings becomes more critical. 

A few commenters urged that facilities be given an opportunity to correct deficiencies before any remedy is imposed.




Response: 

We believe that post-sanction hearings are entirely compatible with due process. Courts that have addressed this
issue have concluded that, because the facility has numerous opportunities to prevent mistakes from occurring and
to present its side of the story both during the survey process, at the exit interview, and by submitting written statements
and a plan of correction, due process is satisfied by the availability of post-sanction hearings. See, for example


Case 

v. 

Weinberger, 

523 F.2nd 602 (2nd Cir. 1975),

v. 

Califano,

v. 

Harris, 

640 F.2d 262 (10th Cir. 1981), cert. denied 454 U.S. 832, 102 S.Ct. 1295. Although the Supreme Court has not directly
decided the issue of due process requirements when a provider is terminated, the Court has decided in 

O'Bannon 

v. 

Town Court, 

447 U.S. 773, 100 S.Ct. 2467 (1980), that residents are not entitled to a pre-termination hearing. The Court reached
this result notwithstanding the fact that residents were the intended beneficiaries of the provider agreement through
their entitlement to high quality care. Moreover, consistent with the balancing of interests formula first enunciated
by the Supreme Court in 

Mathews 

v. 

Eldridge, 

434 U.S. 319 (1976), we have concluded, first and foremost, that the private interest that facilities have in their
continued participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs must give way to the Government's interest in protecting
the health and safety of the resident population. Additionally, in light of the opportunities available to providers
to question the accuracy of survey findings at various points during the survey process including during the survey,
exit conference, and through informal meetings with State or Federal officials, we believe that the chances for an
erroneous deprivation are quite small when compared to the enormous delay in the correction of noncompliance that
could occur were hearings to be routinely held prior to the institution of remedies. The use of an informal dispute
resolution process, to be discussed later in this preamble, should serve to reduce even further the chances of an erroneous
deprivation. 

Apart from the support of case law, the nursing home reform statutory provisions clearly reflect the desire expressed
in the enactment's legislative history that remedies be applied swiftly once deficiencies are identified. Specifically,
sections 1919(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(C) of the Act require that when States and the Secretary develop criteria detailing
the manner in which remedies are to be imposed that they be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification
of violations and final imposition of the remedies. Additionally, section 1919(h)(8) of the Act specifies that States
may impose a denial of payments for new admissions, temporary management, and facility closures during the pendency
of any hearing. We believe it would be incompatible with these pronouncements were we to devise an appeal scheme that
would provide for hearings before the imposition of remedies. Moreover, we conclude that this is the case regardless
of whether the facility's deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety since the Act makes no
distinction on this basis and because the delay in imposing remedies once noncompliance has been identified could
be considerable. 



Comment: 

One commenter stated that residents should have the right to remain in their nursing homes until after the alleged
deficiencies are substantiated. 



Response: 

The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of the right of residents to a pre-termination hearing when the nursing home
in which they reside loses its Medicaid agreement (

O'Bannon 

v. 

Town Court, 

447 U.S. 773, 100 S. Ct. 2467 (1980)). The Court noted that although termination may be harmful to some residents, residents
are moved to a complying nursing facility for their own benefit, so that they can obtain the care to which they are entitled
as Medicaid residents. The Court noted that Medicaid residents who are forced to move may have difficulty locating
other homes they consider suitable or may suffer both emotional and physical harms as a result of the disruption associated
with their move, and might have a claim for damages against the nursing home, yet they would not have any claim against
the government for deprivation of an interest in life, liberty or property (Id. 447 U.S. at 788, 100 S.Ct. at 2476).

As discussed more fully below, residents do have opportunities for giving information to the surveyors during the
survey process. 



Comment: 

One commenter believed that providing pre-hearings for monetary penalties, without providing any hearing, formal
or informal, prior to imposition of harsher sanctions is irrational. 



Response: 

Pre-sanction hearings are available when monetary penalties are assessed because the provisions of section 1128A
of the Act apply. These procedures require pre-sanction hearings when civil monetary penalties are assessed. As
discussed above, the statute clearly provides for the immediate imposition of remedies where civil money penalties
are not involved. 



Comment: 

One commenter argued in favor of a written appeals process prior to revocation of the facility's license. 



Response: 

Termination of a provider agreement is not termination of a license to do business; therefore, we do not accept the
implication that pre-termination hearings should be available on the grounds that a license is being revoked, especially
when the statute, legislative history and case law so clearly point in the other direction. 



Comment: 

A few commenters stated their belief that HCFA is inappropriately extending its rulemaking authority to supersede
State laws which provide pre-sanction hearings. Some commenters noted that current Medicaid regulations at  431.153(b)
allow States the option of providing pre-hearings. 

A few commenters stated that there was no statutory basis for HCFA's proposal to eliminate pre-sanction hearings
in the Medicaid program, and no indication that the Congress intended to eliminate this State practice. These commenters
noted that there is a material difference between the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the impact of not having a pre-hearing
available because nursing homes usually have many more Medicaid residents than Medicare residents. They stated
that loss of Medicaid reimbursement has a greater financial impact than the loss of Medicare reimbursement. 

A few people commented that the statutory requirement to minimize the length of time between identification of deficiencies
and imposition of remedies is not a mandate to eliminate the time between the two events. 

A few people commented that the proposed regulation was making terminations so easy to accomplish, by providing only
for post-termination hearings, that the Congressional intent to provide alternatives to termination was being
undermined.

One commenter noted that the legislative history of Public Law 96-499, indicated that the Congress wanted providers
to have an opportunity to present their cases at an informal hearing prior to imposition of a sanction, citing H.R.
1169 at 56, reprinted in 1980 U.S. Code, Cong. & Admin News, 5526, 5569. 



Response:

 OBRA '87, as discussed more fully above, OBRA '87 specifically provides that the Secretary must ``minimize the time
between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies'' (see sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and
1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act). In addition, OBRA '87 provides that, ``It is the duty and responsibility of the Secretary
to assure that requirements which govern the provision of care [* * * in both Medicare and Medicaid
facilities * * *] and 

the enforcement of such requirements,

 are adequate to protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents and to promote the effective and efficient
use of public moneys.'' (Sections 1819(f) and 1919(f) of the Act, emphasis added). 

As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe that there are compelling reasons to provide for an appeals mechanism
under Medicaid that is triggered only after an adverse action has gone into effect. As discussed above, we believe
this scheme most accurately reflects legislative intent. Additionally, we believe the Act gives us general rulemaking
authority to achieve this objective and that, in particular, we have authority to regulate the timing of State Medicaid
hearings that may be provided in accordance with section 1919(h)(7) of the Act. We also see no reason why the rules governing
the Medicaid program in this area should be any different than those governing the Medicare program when the substantive
requirements affecting providers are exactly the same and the enforcement options are virtually identical. 

For Medicaid, the only hearing a provider will receive is that which is provided for in this final rule, as determined
by  488.330(e)(4). When States hear certification and licensure appeals under the same process, that process
can be used for Medicaid purposes as long as it does not go beyond the scope of the hearing procedures in part 431. Part
431 only provides for appeals of deficiencies that lead to an enforcement remedy; therefore, appeals of deficiencies
that did not lead to an enforcement remedy will not be recognized for Medicaid purposes. 

As stated above, we believe that residents are the primary beneficiaries of the Medicare and Medicaid program, and
their interests are paramount. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated as follows in 

Case 

v. 

Weinberger,

 523 F.2d 602, 607 (2nd Cir. 1975):

This anticipated damage to Mrs. Case, which is certainly serious, does not compare favorably with the government's
interest in the safety of her patients. A nursing facility's ``need'' for patients has nothing to do with the statutory
benefits structure. The facility's need is incidental. That a particular nursing facility cannot survive without
Medicaid participation was certainly not Congress' foremost consideration in its creation of the Medicaid program.
This is not to derogate Mrs. Case's property interest in her expectation of continued participation. We must, however,
place that right in proper perspective with regard to the health and safety expectations of the patients, which expectations
the Secretary has a valid interest in protecting. The benefits to a nursing home from its participation in Medicaid
reimbursement result from nothing more than a statutory business relationship.




The above comments on the relationship of providers to the Medicare and Medicaid programs were cited with approval
by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 

Geriatrics 

v. 

Harris,

 640 F.2d 262, 265 cert denied, U.S. Supreme Court (1981). 





Comment:

 Several commenters offered alternatives to the proposed post-sanction hearings. Some accepted HCFA's goal of applying
remedies immediately, but proposed that States should be allowed the flexibility to use pre-sanction hearings in
limited circumstances. 

Some wanted the option to use pre-sanction hearings in cases where deficiencies are minor and States have a high caseload
of appeals (presumably making it difficult to obtain a speedy post-remedy hearing); some wanted pre-sanction hearings
in all cases unless the facility was substantially out of compliance or the deficiency was deemed life threatening.


Some stated that although the residents' interests prevail when the deficiencies impair their safety, the facility's
interests should prevail when the deficiencies are less serious, thereby justifying pre-sanction hearings. For
example, some commenters agreed that substandard care needed to be addressed expeditiously, prior to any hearing,
but other deficiencies could be addressed after an expedited appeals process. 

Some proposed a balancing test under which the procedures would vary according to the interests at stake. The residents'
interests would specifically be balanced against the nursing home's interests on a case by case basis. A post-sanction
hearing would be held in cases of immediate jeopardy, and pre-sanction hearings would be held when the threat to residents
was less extreme. 

Some wanted States to have the option of providing pre-sanction hearings in all cases. Some wanted to retain the present
State option in the Medicaid program to provide either pre-termination hearings or post-termination hearings which
must be completed within 120 days of the effective date of the termination. A few commented that requiring completion
of the hearing within 120 days would alleviate HCFA's concern that pre-sanction hearings would delay imposition
of remedies. 

One commenter proposed that an existing State procedure be adopted, whereby the State schedules an appeal within
30 days of receiving a request for a hearing; an impartial decision maker makes a recommendation within 30 days of the
hearing, and the Secretary makes a final decision within 10 days. Another proposed a 10 day filing period for requesting
an appeal; a hearing held within 30 days of request; and a decision within 30 days of the hearing.

A few commenters proposed minimizing the time between 
identification of remedies and imposition of remedies by 
instituting deadlines in an expedited hearing process. 
These commenters proposed imposing time periods for filing 
of documents by all parties, and mandatory deadlines for 
decisions by hearing officers. 
Some commenters proposed allowing States to follow their 
own Administrative Procedure Act provisions. 
Some submitted State license laws for our consideration. 
For example, under one State's license law, deficiencies are 
classified based on whether there is a substantial 
probability of death or serious mental or physical harm 
(Class A), a direct threat to health, safety or welfare of a 
resident (Class B), or no direct threat to health, safety or 
welfare of a resident (Class C). Class A violations require 
immediate abatement, subject to a Court injunction for 
failure to abate; Class B or C violations require a plan of 
correction within 10 days (extendable to 30). Timeframes 
are included, providing generally for requesting hearings 
within 10 days after notice, and providing hearings within 
30 days of request. 


Response: 

We are not accepting suggestions that would 
require pre-sanction hearings because we continue to believe 
that residents are best served if remedies are imposed 
promptly. The residents are the beneficiaries of the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, and their best interests are 
the motivating force behind OBRA '87 and these regulations. 
We are not mandating post-remedy hearings. We are merely 
not requiring a hearing to be completed before imposing any 
sanction but civil money penalties. Depending on the size 
of the case load and processing times, a State could 
complete a hearing prior to the imposition of a remedy, but 
to be consistent with these regulations any hearing would 
need to be conducted and concluded very shortly after 
noncompliance was identified. However, we acknowledge that 
the ability to provide a pre-sanction hearing would be 
difficult for most States. 
We are not accepting the various proposals on timing 
events within the hearing process itself. With respect to 
Medicare, some of these time periods are established by the 
Act, as is true, for example, for the 60 day period in which 
to appeal. With respect to both Medicare and Medicaid, 
hearings are held by independent hearing officers who are in 
a far better position than HCFA to determine how quickly 
various hearings can be held. 
We do not believe that State license law is analogous to 
Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements. As we stated 
above, providers have entered into agreements with Medicare 
and Medicaid in which they have agreed to comply with 
Federal requirements, including the requirements applicable 
to remedies for noncompliance.

Comment: 

Several commenters proposed an explicit review 
period during which the State survey agency's central office 
would give providers an opportunity to question, clarify and 
develop the issues. 


Response:

 We are adopting this proposal with some 
modification to require dispute resolution by an official in 
the survey agency and/or HCFA regional office. See 
discussion under the heading, Dispute resolution. We 
believe that making an informal dispute resolution process 
available alleviates many of the concerns expressed above, 
and gives a provider an opportunity to present its side of 
the story to the survey agency and/or regional office 
officials prior to imposition of remedies. 


Comment:

 Several commenters wanted a right to appeal 
all deficiencies, even if no remedy was imposed. 


Response:

 We are not accepting this suggestion because 
if no remedy is imposed, the provider has suffered no injury 
calling for an appeal. We agree that deficiencies that 
constitute noncompliance and that result in a remedy imposed 
are appealable (except for minor remedies such as State 
monitoring). 


Comment:

 Several commenters approved our plan to 
provide a single hearing for dually participating SNF/NFs. 
One commenter wanted two hearings, if the same deficiency 
was cited by two survey agencies, unless the provider 
requested a single hearing. 


Response:

 We are adopting a single hearing, as 
proposed, in accordance with procedures in 42 CFR part 498, 
because we believe that it would be extremely burdensome and 
costly for the government to participate in two hearings. 
Witnesses would need to testify twice, in different 
locations. Attorneys would be required to prepare for two 
separate proceedings, and respond to two different sets of 
procedural rules. Further, because the two hearings would 
be based on the same set of facts, a second hearing is not 
necessary. Before OBRA '87, the practice was to provide one 
hearing for dually participating facilities, in accordance 
with procedures at 42 CFR part 498, and this proved to be 
satisfactory. 


Comment:

 One commenter stated that the ombudsman should 
participate in the hearing because sections 712(a)(3)(E), 
and 712(a)(5)(B)(iv) of the Older Americans Act Amendments 
of 1992 authorize ombudsmen to represent the interests of 
the residents before governmental agencies. 


Response:

 We are not adopting this suggestion because 
residents are not a party to the Medicare or Medicaid 
agreements between providers and HCFA or the State agency. 
Moreover, the entire process of surveys, determining 
compliance or noncompliance, and citing deficiencies is a 
process designed to protect the interests of the residents. 
The ombudsman can, of course, advise the survey agency of 
any concerns relevant to a particular facility. 


Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that States should 
be necessary parties in any hearing, stating that when HCFA 
decertifies facilities the results of the survey could be 
used as evidence that the State survey agency was negligent 
in surveying the facility. 


Response:

 This comment apparently refers to 
decertification of a facility after a HCFA validation 
survey. We are not adopting this proposal, because in any 
hearing the parties to the hearing are the complainant (the 
provider, in this case) and the party who made the decision 
about which the complaint is made (HCFA in the case of a 
validation survey). 


Comment:

 A few commenters recommended that residents be 
permitted to be parties in any hearings, to ensure that 
terminations are used only as a last resort. A few also 
wanted residents to be able to initiate challenges through 
the appeal process when either HCFA or the State failed to 
apply remedies when appropriate. A few wanted residents to 
be notified of enforcement actions at the same time a 
nursing home is notified.

Response: 

We are not adopting these suggestions, 
because we believe that the needs of the residents to be 
heard are addressed in other ways. As a threshold matter, 
the Supreme Court has already concluded in the previously 
cited 

O'Bannon 

decision that residents do not have a right 
to a pre-termination hearing when the facility in which they 
reside faces a provider agreement termination. Whether 
residents might testify to a facility's compliance or 
noncompliance, arguments on both sides of the issue are 
already being made by either the government or the provider. 
Certainly, a provider has every incentive to state its case 
that it was in compliance with certification requirements 
and that it ought not be the subject of an adverse action. 


On the other hand, if residents were interested in 
contributing to the case against a facility, whatever 
evidence they might have could be shared with surveyors 
before, during, or after the completion of a survey. 
Residents have always had, and will continue to have, 
opportunities to discuss facility conditions with surveyors 
either individually or in group meetings, and always have 
the right to comment on the care they are receiving. Except 
when there is immediate jeopardy to resident health or 
safety, the States and the Secretary have very broad 
discretion under the Act to select among enumerated 
remedies. Just as we believe it is not for facilities to 
choose what remedies they should be subject to, we do not 
believe that facility residents should make that choice 
either. 




Comment: 

Many commenters favored an informal procedure 
to challenge the survey agency's findings prior to making 
the Statement of Deficiencies (HCFA-2567) final. 




Response:

 As discussed in the section entitled, Dispute 
Resolution, we are accepting this proposal and are providing 
for such a process in  488.331. We believe that such a 
process will alleviate many of the concerns expressed on 
providing only post-sanction formal hearings. 




Comment: 

A few commenters noted that the existing 
appeals regulations at 42 CFR part 498 should be amended to 
reflect the additional issues which can now be appealed in 
addition to termination. 




Response: 

We agree and are amending  498.3 to make it 
clear that noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy 
(other than State monitoring) is appealable. These changes 
are identified in section V. of this preamble, Additional 
Conforming Changes. 




Comment: 

Several commenters proposed that we clarify 
when sanctions are to be imposed. Some feared that 
sanctions would be imposed by the survey team onsite as soon 
as a deficiency is cited. Some wanted clarification that 
the State survey agency would be given a reasonable period 
of time in which to review surveyor findings in order to 
decide upon a sanction. 




Response: 

It is not our intent that the survey team 
impose remedies. Moreover, the appropriate agency for 
imposing remedies does not do so prior to the time the 
facility receives written notice of the noncompliance and 
written notice of the remedy(ies) to be imposed. The survey 
agency will have time to review the findings and make a 
decision as to compliance or noncompliance, and recommend a 
remedy or remedies to the appropriate State entity or to 
HCFA, depending on whose decision controls as specified at 
sections 1919(h)(6) and (7) of the Act. 




Comment: 

A few commenters wanted clarification of the 
timing and meaning of a certification of noncompliance 
specified in proposed  488.180(d), the notice of hearing 
given specified in proposed  431.153(e), and the notice of 
imposition of remedies specified in proposed  488.202(f).

Response: 

Under section 1864 of the Act, the State 
survey agency certifies to HCFA, in a document called a 
``Certification and Transmittal,'' the status of a facility's 
compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements. 
In certain situations, HCFA itself makes the decision on 
whether a facility complies, as is the case for State 
facilities and in the case of validation surveys. This 
certification of compliance or noncompliance is a decision 
made by one of the governmental agencies (HCFA or the State) 
prior to notification of the provider. 


If a certification of noncompliance is made, the 
provider is notified in accordance with  488.330(c). It is 
usually notified in a separate notice of remedies to be 
imposed, in accordance with  488.402(f). (There may not be 
two separate notices in the case of immediate jeopardy.) 
Except for the imposition of civil money penalties, 
providers are given notice before the effective date of all 
remedies. In the case of civil money penalties, providers 
are given a pre-sanction hearing before civil money 
penalties can be collected. The notice given to the 
provider includes a notice of the remaining noncompliance, 
(even if there was a prior notice of deficiencies 
constituting noncompliance found on the survey) and notice 
of an opportunity to request a hearing, in accordance with 
 431.153(d) and  498.20(a). 


If a hearing is requested, the hearing must include the 
components specified in  431.153(e). Note that the 
requirement in  431.153(e) that the facility receive notice 
and a copy of the statement of deficiencies is accomplished 
prior to the hearing, in accordance with  431.153(d). 


We do not believe that the regulations need to be 
re-written to achieve the above intended result. Providers 
will be given notice of any deficiencies if HCFA or the 
State survey agency determines, that is, certifies 
noncompliance. They will also be given notice of any 
remedies that are imposed, and notice of their right to 
request a hearing. 




Comment: 

A few commenters requested that the notice 
given to the provider include not only the deficiencies 
found and the remedies selected but also the severity/scope 
rating for each deficiency. These commenters wanted an 
opportunity to appeal the severity/scope ratings. 




Response: 

We are not accepting this comment. As we 
discuss later in this preamble, with the exception of 
certain civil money penalties, providers will not have the 
opportunity to appeal the scope and severity of 
deficiencies. 




Comment: 

Many States commenting on this section believe 
that the HCFA finding of noncompliance should not supersede 
a State survey agency certification of compliance when both 
are available. States assert that State surveyors are more 
familiar with the operation of specific facilities in the 
State and that HCFA's surveyors may impose remedies because 
of their lack of familiarity with a particular facility. 




Response: 

Section 1919(g)(3)(A) of the Act mandates 
that the Secretary's determination as to the facility's 
noncompliance is binding and supersedes that of the State 
survey. Moreover, HCFA surveyors do not impose remedies. 
Rather, the managerial staff in the HCFA regional offices 
decide on the most appropriate remedy to be imposed. 
Therefore, we are not accepting this suggestion. 




Section 488.332 Investigation of Complaints of Violations and 
Monitoring of Compliance 






Comment: 

A few commenters said that the certification 
and validation surveys constitute unreasonable 
administrative searches which violate the Fourth Amendment. 
They stated that routine inspections require a warrant 
unless the survey is initiated in accordance with neutral 
criteria and the surveyor's discretion is limited by an 
administrative plan defining the scope and procedure of the 
inspection, citing 

Barlow's Inc., 

436 U.S. at 323 and 


Donovan 

v. 

Dewey, 

452 U.S. 594 (1981). 


A few commented that warrantless complaint 
investigations also violate the Fourth Amendment because the 
proposed rule provides no assurance that investigations are 
justified and because the proposed rule contains no limits 
on time, place, scope and manner of any complaint 
investigation.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>

Response:

 Providers have consented to certification and 
validation surveys and to complaint investigations by 
choosing to participate as providers in the Medicare or 
Medicaid programs, or both. As indicated previously, the 
Supreme Court has long upheld warrantless searches of 
closely regulated businesses, and the nursing home industry 
is no exception. Moreover, section 1128(b)(12) of the Act 
provides for the exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs of an individual or an entity who denies access to 
the Secretary or the State agency for the purpose of a 
survey to determine a provider's compliance with Federal 
requirements. 


Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that we require 
coordination of complaint investigations with the State or 
local ombudsman program. 


Response:

 The Act does not require the State to 
coordinate complaint investigations with ombudsman programs. 
However, under the Act, each State is required to notify the 
State long-term care ombudsman of its findings of 
noncompliance as specified on the HCFA-2567, with any of the 
requirements pertaining to provision of services, resident 
rights, or administration and other matters. The State also 
provides the long term care ombudsman with any report of 
adverse action (specified at  488.406 of this rule) imposed 
on a facility. We are including the requirement for 
disclosing such information to long term care ombudsman at 
 488.325. 


Comment:

 Some commenters believed that  488.332 should 
include procedures, including timing, evaluation of 
severity, and protocols, to be used in the investigation of 
complaints of violations of participation requirements. 
These commenters offered a variety of specific procedures to 
be included in this regulatory section. Also, commenters 
suggested that the State investigate all complaints 
received, while other commenters suggested giving States 
flexibility to determine whether there is a reasonable basis 
for an investigation. 


Response:

 As explained fully in the preamble to the 
proposed rule, sections 1819(g)(4)(A) and 1919(g)(4)(A) of 
the Act require each State to maintain procedures to 
investigate complaints of violations of Federal 
participation requirements. Additionally, the State 
Operations Manual has prescribed procedures State agencies 
must follow if complaints involve Medicare and/or Medicaid 
facilities. We believe these procedures, which are subject 
to ongoing revisions, provide basic minimum instructions, 
with sufficient flexibility, for State agencies to follow 
when investigating complaints. 
We do not believe that it would be reasonable or 
economically feasible to require States, especially those 
with remotely located facilities, to survey all facilities 
for which complaints are received. The experience of State 
survey agencies has shown that many complaints are either 
groundless or are not potential violations of requirements 
for certification. This position, however, does not relieve 
the States from their responsibilities to properly evaluate 
and investigate all complaints that may affect a facility's 
certification. 
To ensure these responsibilities are properly carried 
out,   488.318 and 488.320 of these rules and sections 
1819(g)(3)(C) and 1919(g)(3)(C) of the Act require that the 
Secretary provide appropriate remedies when a State fails to 
perform survey and certification responsibilities required 
under the Act. In addition, HCFA evaluates the 
Medicare/Medicaid survey and certification performance of 
State survey agencies with the State Agency Evaluation 
Program (SAEP). The SAEP identifies, among other factors, 
State actions with regard to the investigation of 
complaints. In Federal fiscal year 1992, the SAEP 
assessment of the State agency's timely processing of 
general certification related complaints indicated that on a 
national average between 90 and 99 percent of all general 
certification related complaints reviewed in the sample were 
processed in a timely manner. The evaluation included 
determining if allegations which may involve immediate 
jeopardy were investigated within two working days of 
receipt and also determining if non-immediate jeopardy 
complaints were processed in accordance with existing State 
agency procedures for prioritizing and investigating general 
certification related complaints. The SAEP data for fiscal 
year 1992 also confirmed that in the sample of complaints 
reviewed, which included general certification related 
complaints, complaints against accredited hospitals and 
violations of section 1867 of the Act (Examination and 
Treatment for Emergency Medical Conditions and Women in 
Labor), between 90 and 100 percent of complaints were 
collected, logged, referred and acknowledged in accordance 
with the guidelines provided in the State Operations Manual 
and specific policy memoranda. Any inappropriate State 
actions are discussed with State survey agency management 
and reconciled accordingly.

Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that the regulations 
state that complaints may be accepted from anonymous sources 
or provide for the anonymity of complainants if requested. 


Response:

 We recognize there are instances when it is 
necessary to protect the identity of a complainant to avoid 
possible reprisal. In keeping with this, States are 
instructed in the State Operations Manual to take 
appropriate precautions to protect a complainant's anonymity 
and privacy, if possible. While we do not believe we can 
guarantee anonymity should an adverse action result from the 
investigation, we would expect that ultimately the issue 
before a trier of fact would be the substantial compliance 
or noncompliance with certification requirements, not the 
identity of the individual who brought the allegation to the 
survey agency's attention. We are revising  488.332 to 
provide that, if possible, the State survey agency takes 
appropriate precautions to protect a complainant's anonymity 
and privacy. 


Comment:

 Many commenters asked for an explanation of 
the term ``monitoring'' used in this section. There seemed to 
be a pervasive thought that the term as used in this section 
was analogous to the remedy of ``State monitoring'' found in 
 488.406. 


Response:

 We believe the term ``monitoring,'' as found in 
section 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4) of the Act, is intended to 
encompass the entire survey process, which is to ascertain 
whether a facility is in substantial compliance with the 
requirements for participation in the Medicare or Medicaid 
programs, or both. The use of this term in this section of 
the rules should not be construed as to alter the protocols 
for long term care surveys which are found in the State 
Operations Manual. 
Section 488.332(b) gives States flexibility to visit 
facilities at their discretion in order to determine whether 
or not they are in compliance with program requirements. It 
should not, as some commenters felt, be an option whether or 
not to follow up on deficiencies cited on previous visits. 
(Note the following comment and response regarding follow up 
visits.) 
Finally, we are changing the title of this section so 
that ``monitoring'' is distinct and separate from complaint 
investigation. 


Comment:

 Commenters asked whether or not follow up 
visits for determining correction of all cited deficiencies 
must be conducted. 


Response:

 The proposed rules do not change our position 
regarding the scheduling and conduct of follow up visits. 
This position is described in the State Operations Manual. 
Correction of noncompliance must be verified by some type of 
follow up activity; albeit, not necessarily by an on-site 
visit. The timing of follow up visits must be determined by 
factors such as the effect of the noncompliance on the care 
of the facility's residents and the date of correction 
specified in the provider's plan of correction. 


Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that investigations 
of complaints regarding violations of participation 
requirements be solely the responsibility of the State 
survey agency. Other commenters maintained that necessary 
referrals are not being made to other State agencies. 


Response:

 The Act provides that a State may maintain 
and utilize a specialized team for the purpose of 
identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence 
and does not specify that such team be part of the survey 
agency. However, if a State uses a specialized team that is 
not part of the survey agency, the State survey agency is 
not absolved of its responsibility to properly document 
complaints and their findings and take required 
certification action with respect to a facility's Medicaid 
or Medicare participation, or both.

In keeping with this responsibility, we are strengthening  488.332 by requiring that, if arrangements have
been made with other State components for investigation of complaints, the State must have a means of communicating
information among appropriate entities, and the State survey agency retains responsibility for the investigation
process. 

Also, we are adding a paragraph to  488.335 requiring that State survey agencies consider complaints of neglect,
abuse or misappropriation of resident property by an individual used by a facility to provide services to residents
as a potential reflection on a facility's compliance with Medicaid and/or Medicare participation requirements.




Comment: 

Some commenters expressed concern about the use of an attorney on a specialized investigation team. 



Response: 

The Act, at sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4), refers to an ``attorney'' as well as other professions (auditor,
appropriate health care professionals) to describe examples of various disciplines that may be used to make up specialized
teams to investigate violations of requirements by nursing facilities or skilled nursing facilities and, in a broader
sense, to monitor all facilities for compliance with the requirements of sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b),
(c), and (d) of the Act. 

We did not intend that attorneys be a routine part of such teams; however, the language of the Act and proposed rules
gives States a broad choice of occupations from which to choose for the survey and certification process. 




Comment: 

Several commenters requested that a facility have prior notice of a complaint investigation to notify its attorney
in those instances when an attorney is part of the specialized complaint investigation team. 



Response: 

Notifying a facility in advance of a complaint survey so that its attorney might be present is, in fact, announcing
the survey. To do so is inconsistent with HCFA policy, which intends that as many surveys as possible be unannounced.




Comment: 

A few commenters identified specific areas of concern in the complaint investigation process. These concerns stemmed
from the general comment that the complaint investigation team may not have proper training. 



Response: 

We appreciate the concern of these commenters who recognize that the investigation and resolution of complaints
is a critical certification activity requiring properly trained investigators, and we will consider these concerns
as we strive to continually improve our training courses. However, we believe that the expertise of a special investigation
team and the overall State survey agency responsibility for complaint investigations provides a coordinated effort
that assures that the complaint investigation process is executed by properly trained individuals. Sections 1819(g)(4)
and 1919(g)(4) of the Act provide that the State may maintain and utilize a specialized team which may include an auditor,
an attorney, and appropriate health care professionals to identify, survey, gather and preserve evidence, and carry
out appropriate enforcement action against substandard facilities. The discipline, specific training, and education
of such a specialized team provides the narrow focus that is often essential to conduct a comprehensive complaint
investigation. The State survey agency has the overall survey and certification responsibility and expertise that
assures that surveyors can ascertain when Medicare and Medicaid facilities meet participation requirements. 



Comment: 

A few commenters recommended that a process for appeal by the complainant be implemented. 



Response: 

While we cannot deny that there may be instances in which a complainant is dissatisfied with the findings of a complaint
investigation, we cannot accept the recommendation to include an appeal process for the complainant in the regulation
as the complainant is not a party to the provider agreement. 



Comment: 

A commenter asked what type of action could be invoked when a complaint was received after the violation occurred and
was resolved by the time the surveyors arrived. 



Response: 

Although we may have discretion with the selection of remedies to address noncompliance with requirements that are
corrected by the time of a survey, it is likely that we would give serious consideration to imposing a civil money penalty
in such cases. Sections 1819(h)(1) and 1919(h) (1) and (3) of the Act expressly authorize the impositions of these
sanctions even if, at the time of the survey, the facility is in compliance. 



Comment: 

A few commenters recommended that the provision which includes administering remedies to noncompliant facilities
found during a complaint investigation be revised to say that the State will carry out appropriate enforcement remedies
against chronically substandard facilities. 



Response: 

We do not agree. While the facility's compliance history is a factor in general and specifically with reference to
the cited deficiencies in determining the appropriate remedy or remedies, we will not limit the remedies to only those
facilities which have chronically provided substandard care. To do so, would be to allow many deficiencies that constitute
noncompliance to go unsanctioned. This undermines the purpose of remedies that are intended to motivate prompt compliance
with participation requirements. 


Section 488.334 Educational Programs

Comment: 

The consensus of those who commented on  488.334, with the exception of the following two commenters, was that
there is a definite need for educational programs for facilities, residents, and their representatives. The two
commenters stated that it was unrealistic to expect the States to conduct periodic educational programs for the staff
and residents of facilities either because of the cost, because they felt the requirement was already met when surveyors
interviewed residents, or because the appearance of objectivity would be jeopardized. 



Response: 

The regulatory provision requiring the States to conduct periodic educational programs stems from a statutory requirement
at sections 1819(g)(1) and 1919(g)(1) of the Act. The concept that the requirement is met when surveyors interview
residents is not acceptable for two reasons: First, surveyors do not interview every resident. Secondly, the responsibility
of a surveyor is to survey nursing homes and not to have attention deflected to educate staff and residents as to regulations,
procedures, and policies. In fact, even if surveyors were to attempt an educational task, time and money constraints
would prevent them from being able to provide complete information to staff and residents. As to the appearance of
objectivity being jeopardized, this is not an issue since the Act requires that States assume this responsibility.
However, irrespective of the Act, there is no reason why a State's educational program, explaining the Federal requirements,
should jeopardize the State's objectivity in exercising its survey function. We believe that well-informed staff
and residents contribute to nursing homes' being able to achieve and maintain compliance. If the implementation
of training programs is followed by a pattern of increased facility compliance, one can just as easily conclude that
providers and their clients are becoming more knowledgeable about the requirements to which they are subject, than
that surveyors are losing their objectivity. 



Comment: 

Several commenters recommended that State educational programs for consumers be expanded. Several commenters
suggested that we require State survey agencies to involve ombudsmen in the development of educational programs
and in the planning and implementation of additional training of residents. Another commenter suggested that we
require State agencies to give NFs access to training programs for State surveyors. Several commenters suggested
that we conduct joint continuing education programs for providers and surveyors. A few commenters recommended that
we make HCFA's inservice training programs available to facilities. Another commenter recommended adding to this
regulation that the State make available to staff and residents documents related to current regulations, procedures,
and policies. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(g)(1)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of the Act require that States conduct educational programs for facility
staff and residents (and their representatives) regarding current regulations, procedures and policies of the
long-term care survey process. We include ombudsmen as representatives of residents. Such information will be provided
during educational programs as they relate to the content of the program. Such regulations, policies, and procedures
are also releasable under the Freedom of Information Act, and can be requested outside of the scope of the educational
program. There is no statutory requirement to include ombudsmen in the development, planning, and implementation
of educational programs and we feel that each State should develop its own program regarding these activities. A State
may or may not choose to include ombudsmen in the 

development

 of its program. In any case, we are interpreting the Act to include ombudsmen in educational programs as representatives
of residents. The suggestion has been made that providers be permitted to attend survey training courses. Traditionally,
we have had no provisions for accommodating all providers interested in attending; our resources are taxed enough
by simply trying to provide timely training for surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training universally
to providers at their own cost may help improve understanding and cooperation between surveyors and providers. We
are therefore seriously considering changing our policy to allow this. 



Comment: 

Two commenters representing consumer groups, suggested that   488.303 and 488.334 be expanded to require
State agencies to provide education to residents and their representatives in a variety of additional areas such
as 

 How to participate in assessment and care planning. 

 Residents' rights. 

 Rights to rehabilitation and other services.

One of these commenters also recommended that States work with residents and family councils to: 

 Solicit recommendations prior to any changes in the requirements. 

 Evaluate the effectiveness of the survey process. 

 Receive consultation prior to and during imposition of remedies to determine their effectiveness. 

 Receive consultation prior to determining whether to grant a waiver of nurse staffing.

Another commenter suggested that residents' 
understanding is critical and their education should be 
expanded to include: 
 How the survey process works and how to participate. 
 How the investigation process works and how to 
participate. 
 How the care planning process works and how to 
participate. 


Response:

 These suggestions have considerable merit and 
are within both the spirit and intent of the Act. We agree 
with the commenters that the proposed regulation 
unnecessarily restricted the scope of the mandated 
educational programs. The regulation is being revised to 
permit the education programs to cover all aspects of the 
long-term care survey process. We believe the States should 
have the flexibility to structure the educational programs 
to the needs of the facilities. The methods of developing 
the programs (for example, consultation with the ombudsmen 
program) and the methods of presentation are best left to 
the States. The comment that States should work with 
residents and family councils to solicit their 
recommendations prior to any changes in requirements goes 
beyond the educational process. In some respects, this 
comment incorporates residents and families as participants 
in the survey and enforcement processes. Whenever there is 
public rulemaking, any member of the public is a participant 
in the process and can comment and make recommendations on 
such matters. In addition, when surveyors speak with 
residents during the survey, residents are free to bring up 
comments about the survey process if they wish. Regarding 
the comment that residents' understanding of the survey, 
investigation, and the care planning processes should be 
expanded, we repeat that the regulation is being amended to 
permit the educational programs to cover all aspects of the 
long-term care process. 


Comment:

 One commenter recommended that HCFA share 
central office and regional office satellite training to 
provide training simultaneously with nursing facility staff 
and consumers. 


Response:

 It is beyond the scope of this regulation to 
institute such detailed procedures as providing satellite 
training to consumers or specifying any other training 
medium. It is beyond our technological capabilities to 
provide training via satellite to every SNF and NF in the 
country. The costs of installing the necessary equipment in 
each facility would far exceed our budgetary resources. 


Comment:

 One commenter stated that, although this 
section providing education to residents and staff of 
facilities is an excellent idea, it lacks specificity and 
oversight. Because of budgetary crises, this is but another 
educational program at State expense and will receive low 
priority. HCFA must ensure that the State will conduct 
educational programs at particular time intervals or face 
sanctioning by HCFA. 


Response:

 Although there is no statutory provision 
requiring HCFA to oversee States to determine if they have 
failed to conduct educational programs as required by the 
Act, we recognize that we have some responsibility to do so. 
It is within the purview of the States to decide how and 
when to conduct their educational programs. We believe it 
is wiser to leave these decisions to the individual States 
since they must design the educational programs the Act 
specifies. However, we are looking into the feasibility of 
monitoring the States in some way to assure that they are in 
compliance with this statutory requirement. We plan to find 
an acceptable approach to evaluating State efforts in 
providing educational programs to facilities and their 
staffs, and residents and their representatives. 


Comment:

 A commenter stated that further definition of 
the nature and frequency of educational programs is needed 
and, for consistency, HCFA should establish the nature and 
content of such programs. There could be extensive new 
resource requirements if the program is not considered 
adequate. Another commenter recommends that we define 
``periodic'' and detail the process for State compliance. 


Response:

 As previously mentioned, the nature and 
content could cover any of the requirements of sections 1819 
and 1919 of the Act. When manual instructions are 
developed, they will provide guidelines on topics such as 
frequency of educational programs. 


Comment:

 One commenter questioned whether on-site 
presentations were preferable to written communication. 


Response:

 This is a detailed and specific matter. The 
methods of training will be determined by the States, but 
HCFA will publish guidelines in manuals to assist States in 
structuring their programs. 


Comment:

 This commenter also recommends replacing the 
word ``conduct'' with ``provide'' to allow for the use of 
subcontractors, and for the distribution of written and/or 
auto-visual materials toward this end. 


Response:

 We believe to make such a change could be 
interpreted as changing the intent of the Act, which uses 
the word ``conduct.'' The Act gives the responsibility for 
developing educational programs specifically to the States. 


Comment:

 Two commenters stated that funds must be made 
available to the States for educational purposes.

Section 488.335 Action on Complaints of Resident Neglect and 
Abuse, and Misappropriation of Resident Property 


Upon further analysis, we revised the title of this 
section to be more explicit. 


Comment:

 Some commenters suggested regulatory language 
requiring coordination of investigations of complaints of 
neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of property with the 
State or local ombudsman program. 


Response:

 The Act does not require the State to 
coordinate complaint investigations with the State long term 
care ombudsman. However, under the Act, each State is 
required to notify the State long term care ombudsman of its 
findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements 
pertaining to provision of services, resident rights, or 
administration and other matters. The State also provides 
the State long term care ombudsman with any report of 
adverse action (specified at  488.406 of this rule) imposed 
on a facility. We have included the requirement for 
disclosing such information to the long term care ombudsman 
at  488.325. 


Comment:

 Some commenters felt procedures for 
investigating complaints of neglect, abuse, or 
misappropriation of property should be included in the final 
rule. 


Response:

 As stated in the proposed rule, we believe 
such an approach is inconsistent with our view that States 
should have the flexibility to rely on State entities other 
than the State survey agency to investigate and adjudicate 
these matters. States will likely use an array of different 
licensing or investigative bodies to meet their obligations 
in this area. 


Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that 
investigations of allegations of neglect, abuse, or 
misappropriation of property be integrated into the 
comprehensive survey, certification and enforcement process. 
Further, there were suggestions that investigations of these 
complaints be conducted solely by the State survey agency. 


Response:

 The Act requires that States must provide, 
through the agency responsible for surveys and certification 
of nursing facilities, for a process for the receipt and 
timely review and investigation of allegations of resident 
neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident property. 
As pointed out in the preamble to the proposed rule, 
while the State is free to delegate to other State agencies 
the adjudicatory functions described in sections 
1819(g)(1)(C) and 1919(g)(1)(C) of the Act, we fully expect 
State survey agencies to retain ultimate responsibility for 
compliance with these statutory requirements. If a State 
uses an agency which is not part of the State survey agency, 
the State survey agency cannot be absolved of its 
responsibility to properly document complaints and take 
required certification action with respect to a facility's 
participation in either the Medicaid or Medicare programs. 
In keeping with this responsibility, we are 
strengthening the rules under  488.335(a) by cross 
referencing  488.332, which specifies that the State survey 
agency retains responsibility for the investigation process 
and requiring the State survey agency to have a means of 
communicating information among appropriate entities if 
other State agencies are involved in the investigation of 
these complaints.

In response to the above comments we are adding a new 
requirement that State survey agencies consider all 
complaints of resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation 
of resident property as a potential reflection on a 
facility's compliance with Medicaid and/or Medicare 
participation requirements. This new requirement is at 
 488.335(h). (The provisions in  488.185 (g) and (h) of 
the proposed rule are revised and combined in  488.335(g) 
and are discussed later in this preamble.) 


Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that the words, ``by 
an individual used by the facility'' be added to paragraph 
(a) of this section as it requires the State to review all 
allegations of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of 
resident property. Commenters pointed out that the 
suggested text is found in the Act and the preamble to the 
proposed rule. 


Response:

 We are revising and expanding  488.335(a), 
and in doing so, incorporating the comment. This paragraph 
now specifies that the State reviews all allegations of 
resident abuse and neglect and misappropriation of resident 
property. The State also follows the procedures of 
 488.332. We are adding that, if there is reason to 
believe, either through oral or written evidence, that an 
individual used by the facility to provide services to 
residents could have abused or neglected a resident or 
misappropriated a resident's property, the State must 
investigate the allegation. We also now specify in this 
section that the State must have written procedures for the 
timely review and investigation of these allegations. 


Comment:

 Several commenters mentioned that the proposed 
rules do not specify a timeframe for initiation of an 
investigation nor a time limit on the length of an 
investigation of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of 
resident property. 


Response:

 Our intent in writing this rule was to not be 
too prescriptive of State investigation processes. However, 
manual instructions to State survey agencies specify a 
timeframe for situations of immediate jeopardy in which they 
should initiate complaint investigations. 
We chose not to regulate the time in which a State must 
complete its investigation of these types of complaints. We 
thought a specific time limit could, in some instances, 
compromise the outcome of the investigation. 


Comment:

 Some commenters suggested that the rules 
specify a timeframe in which the State must notify an 
individual when there is reason to believe that the abuse, 
neglect, or misappropriation of resident property did occur. Also, some suggested that we notify the administrator
or 
owner of the facility employing such person, or both. 

Also, some commenters suggested that we include in the 
notice to the accused person the consequences of the hearing 
determination or waiving the right to a hearing. 


Response:

 We do not accept the comment to send a notice 
to the individual implicated in an allegation of resident 
neglect or abuse or misappropriation of resident property 
before the State has conducted an investigation. To do so 
could possibly jeopardize the outcome of the investigation 
and in some cases would be premature as the investigation 
might find the allegation unsupported. However, we are 
revising the final rule at  488.335(c) to require that a 
State must notify the individual implicated in the 
allegation and the current administrator of the facility in 
which the incident occurred, in writing within 10 working 
days of its preliminary determination, which is based on 
oral or written evidence and its investigation, that 
resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident 
property occurred. This timeframe was selected to provide 
timely notice to the individual involved and yet, give 
States sufficient time to provide such notice. We are also 
revising the final rule to reflect that this notice to the 
individual includes the consequences of a hearing finding 
and of waiving the right to a hearing. We are adding that 
the notice includes a statement to inform the accused 
individual of the right to be represented by an attorney at 
the individual's own expense. 


Comment:

 We received several comments suggesting that 
we establish, by regulation, a more extensive ``due process'' 
appeal mechanism for facility employees accused of neglect, 
abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's property.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>

Response:

 We recognize the importance of the need for a 
fair and impartial hearing whenever an individual used by 
the facility is accused of resident neglect or abuse, or 
misappropriation of a resident's property. However, we 
recognize that all States have administrative procedure acts 
which allow for resolution of disputed cases of this nature. 
Thus, we chose to allow the need for these appeals to be 
addressed by State law. 


Comment:

 Some commenters felt the provision to allow 
120 days for States to conduct hearings of staff accused of 
neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's property 
was excessive and suggested other dates, while other 
commenters felt the 120 day period did not allow sufficient 
time for a State's administrative process to complete the 
hearing. 


Response:

 While we agree that a person accused of 
resident neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of a resident's 
property is entitled to swift determination of the accusation, we believe States must be given reasonable time in

which to schedule and conduct the hearing process under 
their administrative procedure acts. Our experience with 
other related State hearings indicates that 120 days is a 
reasonable timeframe for scheduling and completing these 
appeals. 


Comment:

 Several commenters suggested we modify the 
rules so they specify who should be notified when a person 
accused of neglect, abuse, or misappropriation of a 
resident's property waives the right to a hearing or when a 
State hearing finds that such an individual did, in fact, 
act as accused. In addition, some commenters suggested we 
specify timeframes for such reporting. 


Response:

 In response to these comments, we are 
rewriting  488.335(f) and combining paragraphs (g) and (h) 
into (g) to clarify the reporting process and to include 
timeframes for reporting. We are specifying that the State 
survey agency, which may not delegate this responsibility, 
must report in writing the finding that an individual 
neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated a 
resident's property within 10 working days of the finding 
to: the individual; the current administrator of the 
facility in which the incident occurred; the administrator 
of the facility currently employing the individual, if 
different; the licensing authority for individuals other 
than nurse aides; and the nurse aide registry. For nurse 
aides, these findings must not only be reported to the nurse 
aide registry but must be included in the nurse aide 
registry within 10 working days of the finding in accordance 
with  483.156(c)(iv)(D).

Comment: 

We received comments suggesting that if an 
allegation was found to be untrue, that accusation be 
expunged from the nurse aide registry. 


Response: 

An allegation of resident abuse or neglect or 
misappropriation of resident property that is not 
substantiated would not be entered on the nurse aide 
registry. Only a finding of resident abuse or neglect or 
misappropriation of resident property would be entered on 
the nurse aide registry. Section 483.156(c)(1)(iv) 
specifies the particular information that the registry must 
contain with regard to any finding by the State survey 
agency of abuse, neglect or misappropriation of property. 
This information includes documentation of the State's 
investigation (including the nature of the allegation and 
the evidence that led the State to conclude that the 
allegation was valid), the date of the hearing and its 
outcome (if a hearing was requested), and a statement by the 
individual disputing the allegation (if the individual 
chooses to make one). The rule also provides that this 
information must be included in the registry within 10 
working days of the finding and must remain in the registry 
permanently unless the finding was made in error, the 
individual was found not guilty in a court of law, or the 
State is notified of the individual's death. 


Comment: 

We received several comments regarding the 
nurse aide registry. Commenters offered suggestions for the 
contents of the registry, its availability to the public and 
action taken as a result of substantiation of abuse, neglect 
or misappropriation of property. 
One commenter suggested that the report of findings 
provision include notifying the appropriate law enforcement 
authorities in those cases where a crime has been committed. 
Another commenter suggested that HCFA offer guidance to 
facilities concerning the treatment of employees who are 
awaiting the resolution of a complaint. 


Response: 

These specific comments fall outside the 
purview of this regulation on the survey, certification and 
enforcement of skilled nursing facilities and nursing 
facilities. However, a discussion of these and other 
related issues can be found in a final rule titled Medicare 
and Medicaid; Requirements for Long Term Care Facilities and 
Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluation Programs, 
published September 26, 1991 in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 
FR 48880. 


Comment: 

Several commenters suggested that every 
investigation seek to identify facility practices which led 
to the neglect, abuse or misappropriation of resident 
property.

<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00131 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

We believe that every investigation does seek 
to identify facility practices which led to the resident 
neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident property 
and this is evidenced by the guidance currently provided to 
the States in manual instructions. These guidelines include 
the general procedures for conducting complaint 
investigations and stipulate that, if significant problems 
are identified during an initial assessment or other 
observations, the scope of the review is expanded as 
necessary. The procedures also specify that when the team 
is investigating allegations of substandard care, they are 
to evaluate not only the care of the individuals involved in 
the allegation, but also to evaluate the facility's patterns 
of related care. Also, noncompliance identified during the 
survey is recorded on the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan 
of Correction (HCFA-2567) and a plan of correction is 
requested. When the facility is not in substantial 
compliance as a result of the deficiencies identified, 
enforcement actions could include the imposition of 
alternative remedies or termination of a facility's provider 
agreement. 


Comment: 

A few commenters suggested that in those cases 
where neglect was found and determined to be caused by 
factors beyond the control of the individual, the State 
agency must impose sanctions upon the facility or document 
why such sanctions are inappropriate. 


Response: 

We do not accept this suggestion to add a 
regulatory requirement that obligates HCFA or the State to 
impose sanctions where resident neglect was found and 
determined to be caused by factors beyond the control of the 
individual. Regardless of the cause of the noncompliance, a 
facility is not relieved of its responsibility to correct 
its deficiencies. This responsibility assures that 
residents consistently receive quality health care in a safe 
environment and it exists whether or not a remedy is 
imposed. However, there are instances in which a remedy 
will be imposed due to the egregious nature of the 
deficiency and to encourage prompt compliance. Conversely, 
there are situations in which a remedy might not be 
necessary because the facility corrected the practice which 
led to the abuse. For example, firing an employee who 
neglects a resident or residents could immediately correct 
that deficiency. 
We do not accept the suggestion to incorporate into the 
regulation a provision that would require documentation for 
those cases in which a remedy is not imposed. We are not 
required by the Act to document why sanctions are not 
imposed and to require this through regulations would impose 
a significant workload burden because, as stated above, 
there are many cases in which deficiencies are corrected and 
remedies are not imposed. 


Redesignation of Subpart F 


As noted earlier, a new Subpart D of part 488, 
consisting of   488.201-488.211, became effective on 
August 31, 1992, shortly after this proposed rule was 
published on August 28. Consequently, we must designate 
Subpart F, which was to consist of   488.200-488.240, 
with subsequent numbers. To assist the reader, we are 
publishing the new table of contents for Subpart F, with 
designations of the proposed rule shown in parenthesis. In 
the following discussions, we refer to the sections as 
renumbered, with the proposal's identification included only 
if distinction is necessary.

Section 488.401 Definitions 





It was brought to our attention that the term ``immediate 
family'' also appears in subpart E as well as subpart F. 
Therefore, in the final regulation we are moving the 
definition of ``immediate family'' to subpart E,  488.301, 
but we are stating the comments and responses below. 





Comment: 

A few commenters believe that the definition 
of ``immediate family'' should be expanded to include niece, 
nephew, and domestic partner. 





Response: 

We have not accepted this suggestion. 
Section 1004, part 1, of the Provider Reimbursement Manual 
defines ``immediate family'' for Medicare purposes. The 
commenters offered no compelling argument as to why any 
individual should be added to the definition of immediate 
family. In fact, we are amending our definition to be 
consistent with the definition found in the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual by deleting ``spouse of grandparent or 
grandchild.'' 





Comment: 

Some commenters pointed out that the 
definition of ``immediate jeopardy'' should be located in 
subpart E instead of subpart F because the term is first 
introduced in subpart E. 





Comment: 

We agree with the commenters. In the final 
rule, we have relocated the definition of ``immediate 
jeopardy'' from proposed  488.201 in subpart F to  488.301 
in subpart E. However, since commenters concerned with 
responses regarding the definition of immediate jeopardy 
will first look in this section, we have retained the 
comments and responses below. 





Comment: 

We received numerous comments about HCFA's or 
the State survey agency's ability to assign resident rights 
and/or physical environment violations at higher severity 
levels. These commenters believe that any deficiency could 
be egregious enough to be considered ``moderate harm'' or 
``immediate jeopardy.'' 





Response: 

We agree with these commenters and are 
allowing violations of any participation requirement, 
including resident rights and physical environment, to be 
assessed at any degree of seriousness. 





Comment: 

Many commenters wanted clarification regarding 
cases in which termination actions for immediate jeopardy 
would be applicable. 





Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 1819(h)(4), 
1919(h)(1)(A), 1919(h)(3)(B)(i), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act 
specifically state that termination of participation for a 
facility is possible with any determination of noncompliance 
where the State or the Secretary finds this noncompliance 
immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of the 
residents. For example, immediate jeopardy to resident 
health or safety may exist, but is not limited to, the 
presence of one of more of the following: 
 Insect or rodent infestation indicative of food 
contamination or the possible spread of contagion; 
 Failure to control infections as evidenced by the 
presence of facility-acquired infections; 
 Patient abuse or poor resident care, including; 

+ Instances of malnutrition or dehydration that are 
unrelated to the resident's condition and are a result of 
patient care; 
+ Neglect by the staff with the result that residents are 
often left lying in urine, feces and other waste; 
 Drug or pharmaceutical hazards that directly affect 
resident health and safety, such as: 
+ Excessive drug errors or mishandling of drugs; 
+ Failure to provide medications as prescribed; 
+ Failure to monitor drugs as evidenced by lack of 
ordered laboratory work, failure to take vital signs as 
indicated by drug regimen, and lack of other nursing 
monitoring practices; 
+ Gross mishandling of drugs such as leaving drug trays 
unattended and available to residents and visitors. 
+ Administration of drugs by unqualified staff; or 
+ Administration of experimental drugs without the 
informed consent of the resident (or responsible party). 
This list is not to be interpreted as all-inclusive, but 
rather as examples of what may be construed as immediate 
jeopardy situations warranting termination. 





Comment: 

Other commenters were unclear about how the 
phrase ``at any time'' constitutes ``immediate threat.'' 





Response: 

We agree that it is unclear and are removing 
the phrase in  488.401. 





Comment: 

Some commenters believe the definition in 
 442.2 conflicts with the proposed definition of immediate 
jeopardy.

Response: 

We agree that these definitions are in 
conflict. However, the definition in  442.2 will no longer 
apply to nursing facilities and is being revised to reflect 
this change. We are maintaining two separate definitions of 
immediate jeopardy because of the different regulations 
applicable to ICFs/MR and SNFs or NFs. 





Comment: 

Some commenters suggested striking references 
to the scope and severity scale and inserting the phrase 
``creates imminent danger.'' Other commenters recommended 
that immediate jeopardy should represent the most severe or 
life threatening violation. 





Response: 

We agree with the commenters and we have 
removed references to the scope and severity scale from the 
definition of immediate jeopardy. We are redefining 
immediate jeopardy to encompass all situations that pose 
actual or potential life threatening harm, death, serious 
injury or impairment. Therefore, a life threatening 
situation or imminent danger will inevitably be considered 
immediate jeopardy. 





Comment: 

Many commenters were concerned that the 
definition of immediate jeopardy pertains to only physical 
harm and not emotional harm. 





Response: 

We agree with the commenters that significant 
emotional as well as physical harm may be considered 
immediate jeopardy. Every determination of the seriousness 
of a deficiency includes the consideration of whether a 
resident has failed to achieve his or her highest 
practicable physical, mental, or psychosocial function. 





Comment: 

Many commenters expressed the need for us to 
clarify the definition of ``new admission'' to indicate 
whether or not residents transferred to the hospital, with 
the intention of returning, are considered new admissions. 
They are concerned that if denial of payment for new 
admissions is imposed, those transferred residents will not 
be covered if they return to the facility. 





Response: 

New admission is described within  442.2 as 
well as  488.401. We believe these descriptions are 
sufficient and further clarification is not necessary. 





Comment: 

Some commenters suggested that the definition 
of ``plan of correction'' be amended to require the facility 
to identify the systemic underlying problem, make 
restitution to the affected resident or residents, contain 
measurable outcomes for all quality of care deficiencies, 
and require the facility to take further measures to ensure 
future compliance. 





Response: 

The purpose of a plan of correction is to 
identify and address the underlying problem or problems for 
the facility. Individual residents have other legal means 
at their disposal to seek restitution. It is impracticable 
to develop model thresholds for each and every plan of 
correction as each situation is different and is evaluated 
accordingly. Plans of correction are geared toward 
prospective compliance to ensure the underlying causes of 
cited deficiencies do not recur. As it is virtually 
impossible to afford retroactive restitution to residents 
who have been injured or have been deprived of their rights, 
we have not accepted these suggestions. 





Comment: 

Many commenters wanted to have a definition of 
``highest practicable well-being.'' 





Response: 

The phrase ``highest practicable well-being'' 
was established in sections 1819(b)(2) and 1919(b)(2) of the 
Act. We believe the conspicuous absence of a definition 
demonstrates that the Congress recognized the impossibility 
of establishing a single definition of this phrase, as every 
resident, and his or her particular needs and abilities, 
must be evaluated individually. 





Comment: 

Some commenters wanted a definition of ``repeat 
deficiency.'' 





Response: 

The Act, in section 1819(h)(2)(B) and 
1919(h)(3)(C), specifies that incrementally more severe 
fines must be imposed for repeated or uncorrected 
deficiencies. Repeated deficiencies are described in 
 488.438 as deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of 
requirements found at the last survey, subsequently 
corrected, and found again at the next survey. 





Comment: 

A few commenters wanted a definition of 
``distinct part.'' 





Response: 

``Distinct part'' is defined in sections 2110 
and 2762 of the State Operations Manual. As it is beyond 
the scope of this regulation, we do not believe it is 
necessary to place this definition in these regulations. 





Comment: 

Some commenters wanted various other terms 
defined or clarified. 





Response: 

We define terms in regulations only if the 
use of those terms, within the regulation, has a different 
application than that which is accepted in common English 
usage.

Section 488.402 General Provisions. 


 



Comment:

 We received a number of comments from the 
health care industry, from consumer organizations, and from 
professional groups regarding the purpose of the regulations 
as set forth in proposed  488.202. The consensus of those 
who commented on paragraph (a) was that protecting residents 
from ``actual or potential harmful outcomes resulting from 
deficiencies'' is but one of many purposes of the 
regulations. Other purposes commenters suggested we include 
were to_ 

 Deter noncompliance; 

 Punish noncompliance through the use of appropriate 
sanctions; 

 Ensure correction of deficiencies for residents whose 
care is deficient; 

 Encourage sustained compliance; and 

 Protect patient rights. 


 Two commenters suggested we change paragraph (a) of 
proposed  488.202 to read, ``The purpose of remedies is to 
encourage prompt, rapid compliance with program requirements 
at the minimum level that will achieve correction so as to 
protect residents from actual or potential outcomes 
resulting from deficiencies.'' They said that, ``The Congress 
made it clear that a purpose of enforcement remedies is to 
render the time period between identification of 
deficiencies and 

correction

 (emphasis in original) as short 
as possible. This intent precludes punitive measures and 
promotes the least disruption to facility operation. Based 
on Congressional intent, general consensus now exists that 
the enforcement process should be corrective, not punitive, 
and that enforcement remedies should be set at the minimum 
level required to achieve the desired correction. 
Successively stricter measures would be used as needed for 
failure to correct.'' 


 Finally, one commenter said that ``prompt, rapid,'' is 
redundant. 


 

Response:

 A number of these comments suggest to us that 
there is some confusion between the purpose of these 
remedies and the expected outcomes of the regulations. 
Therefore, in order to be absolutely unequivocal, we are 
revising  488.402(a) to read, ``The purpose of remedies is 
to ensure prompt compliance with program requirements.'' 


 

Comment:

 Two commenters suggested that the last 
sentence of proposed  488.202(b)(1) be revised to read, 
``Survey findings are reported to the State and HCFA which 
will make recommendations for corrective action.'' Their 
rationale was that the determination of remedies to fit a 
particular deficiency or deficiencies should be made by an 
objective party in the survey agency or HCFA who did not 
survey the facility. 


 Another said that the same sentence should be revised to 
state, ``Survey findings are reported to the State or HCFA, 
as appropriate, with recommendations for corrective action.'' 
Still another said that we should clarify the fact that the 
survey findings are reported with recommendations for 
remedies, and one commenter said that our proposed paragraph 
(b)(1) appears to exclude the possibility of imposing 
remedies based on HCFA's paper review of State survey agency 
findings. 


 Two commenters suggested a new paragraph (b)(1) to read 
substantially as follows: 


 (b) Requirement for State enforcement plan. 


 (1) The State and HCFA shall develop a plan for imposing 
intermediate remedies. The plan shall_
(i) Vary remedies with the scope and severity so that more substantial remedies are imposed for more serious 
deficiencies; 


 (ii) Assure that the State and HCFA minimize the time 
between identification of violations and final imposition of 
remedies; 


 (iii) Assure that remedies serve goals of requiring 
immediate correction of deficiencies, protecting residents, 
correcting deficiencies for specific residents who are 
harmed, punishing violations and deterring violations; 


 (iv) Include rules and policies about when and how 
various sanctions are imposed and when remedies are imposed 
singly or in combination; and 


 (v) Develop procedures to solicit the active 
participation of residents in the enforcement process, 
including permitting residents to participate in any formal 
proceedings the State offers to providers to contest 
imposition of an intermediate remedy. 


 The two commenters who made this suggestion also said 
that enforcement under the reform law is not a collection of 
free-standing remedies that States and the Secretary apply 
on an ad hoc basis; enforcement under the law requires 
enforcement agencies to have a systematic way of making 
decisions to apply sanctions. They cite the Institute of 
Medicine (IoM) report, issued in March 1986, that says that 
guidelines on when to initiate sanctions are necessary for 
effective State enforcement. The commenters also cite the 
October 9, 1992 final settlement of 

Valdivia

 v. 

California 
Department of Health Services

 which reads in part: 


 The enforcement system shall: 


 A. Define the purposes of the system and of the 
remedies;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00135 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

B. Set forth guidelines for appropriately assessing 
monetary penalties and other intermediate remedies (in 
lieu of or in addition to termination) allowed under 
Federal requirements; 


 C. Identify guidelines for approving and monitoring 
plans of correction; 


 D. Define the role of the complaint investigation 
process in the comprehensive enforcement system; 


 E. Encourage and promote use of intermediate sanctions, 
as appropriate, rather than termination, to achieve the 
purposes of the comprehensive enforcement system; 


 F. Identify mechanisms to better inform the public as 
to actions taken by the State against facilities that 
are not in compliance with Federal Requirements of 
Participation; 


 G. Identify the factors to be considered in determining 
which remedies may or must be imposed, assuring that 
more substantial remedies are imposed for more serious 
deficiencies. 


 Finally, two of these commenters suggested that HCFA 
specify that one of the bases for the imposition of remedies 
be interfering with the work of a survey team, monitor, 
and/or temporary manager. 


 

Response:

 We agree that it would be more accurate to 
say that survey findings are reported with recommendations 
for remedies, and we are making that change in this final 
rule. We do not, however, believe that either the IoM study 
or OBRA '87 calls for an inflexible cookbook approach to 
enforcement. As noted in the comment, the IoM study speaks 
of establishing ``guidelines,'' and we believe that this term 
connotes that there be a range of options available to the 
Secretary and the States (including the option not to impose 
any remedies). In sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87, the 
intent to provide a flexible range of options is clearer 
still. Those sections amended sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) 
of the Act at several places to reflect this intent. For 
example, the Act now provides: 

 ``*
 9*
 9* the Secretary may impose any of the remedies 
described in subparagraph (B).'' (1819(h)(2)(A)(ii)); 

 ``Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as 
restricting the remedies available to the Secretary *
 9*
 9*'' 
(1819(h)(2)(A)); 

 ``The Secretary may take the following actions***'' 
(1819(h)(2)(B)); and 

 ``The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an 
amount not to exceed $10,000 *
 9*
 9*.'' (1819(h)(2)(B)(ii)). 


 Further evidence of the need to retain flexibility in the 
choice of remedies is found in the House of Representatives 
Committee on the Budget report (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th 
Cong., 1st Sess. 472 (1987)) that accompanied OBRA '87. It 
states that, ``the Committee amendment would specify a broad 
range of sanctions for use by both the Secretary and the 
States.'' The committee report goes on to say that, ``The 
Committee emphasizes that the remedies specified under the 
amendment are not exclusive, and should not be construed to 
limit the use of other remedies that may be available to 
either the States or the Secretary under State or Federal 
law.'' It is clear that flexibility was the statutory 
intent. Therefore, in order to ensure this intended 
flexibility, we have set forth minimum remedies for 
deficiencies according to their seriousness and offered 
several additional optional ones. 


 We agree, for the most part, with the thrust of the 
final settlement in 

Valdivia,

 and are making revisions to 
the relationship between deficiencies and remedies which 
reflect aspects of the final settlement of that case. 
However, these revised policies are not appropriate for 
paragraph (b), which is intended only to succinctly set 
forth the basis for the imposition of remedies, and not the 
outline for the entire enforcement process. Rather, we have 
specified the linkage between deficiencies and remedies 
imposed at  488.408, Selection of remedies. 


 We do not believe that proposed  488.202(b)(1) excludes 
the possibility of imposing remedies based on ``HCFA's paper 
review of survey agency findings.'' Since HCFA's ``paper 
review'' is itself based on survey findings, it is clear that 
remedies may be imposed as a result. 


 Finally, in response to the commenters who suggested 
that HCFA specify that one of the bases for the imposition 
of remedies be interfering with the work of a survey team, 
monitor, and/or temporary manager, there is authority at 
section 1128(b)(12) of the Act to exclude a facility based 
on its failure to grant access to the Secretary or to the 
State survey agency, and we believe this includes not only a 
survey team, but a monitor. Our regulations at  488.415 
set forth what happens if a facility does not relinquish 
control to a temporary manager. 


 Based on the above discussion, we are revising 
 488.402(b)(1) to state that in every instance of 
noncompliance, one or more remedies are imposed based on 
deficiencies found during surveys conducted by HCFA or by 
the survey agency. We are deleting paragraph (b)(2) because 
we believe that manual issuances are the most appropriate 
places for procedural information of this sort.

Comment: 

Two commenters suggested that we set forth at  488.402(b)(2) the principle that termination of provider agreements
is a measure taken only as a last resort when the imposition of intermediate remedies has failed to correct the deficiencies.
One commenter recommends that paragraph (b)(2) be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose
one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies.

Finally, one commenter said that OBRA '87 stated that when deficiencies constitute an immediate and serious threat
to residents' health and safety, neither HCFA nor the States have any discretion with regard to remedies. Rather,
the commenter said that, in such cases, HCFA or the States must impose either temporary management or a provider agreement
termination.



Response: 

We agree that termination of provider agreements is a serious measure, but not that it is a ``last resort'' in the strictest
sense. While we believe that the Congress wrote into the law the wide array of alternative remedies to encourage their
use, the Act does not require that in every case the States or the Secretary may not choose provider agreement termination
until alternative remedies have been used. We believe that the Act's alternative remedies offer States and the Secretary
a valuable opportunity to redress a wide variety of facility shortcomings through means that will promote quick correction
without having to exclude the facility from program participation, and it is our expectation not only that serious
consideration will be given for such opportunities when there is facility non-compliance, but that they will be used
far more frequently than they have in the past. It would be an entirely erroneous impression of the Act, however, to
conclude that it deprives States and the Secretary from exercising discretion to choose 

any 

remedy, including termination, whenever they determine it appropriate to do so. The comment suggesting that the
proposed paragraph (b)(2) be amended to state that the survey agencies should be allowed to impose one or more remedies
for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies is inappropriate; the number of remedies that may be imposed is covered
in the proposed  488.202(c). We will discuss this comment in connection with others on that paragraph.

It is true that, when no immediate jeopardy exists, the Congress stated that the State or the Secretary may impose termination
or may impose one or more intermediate sanctions against the provider, or may impose both, and that this is in contrast
to the specific measures that must be imposed when immediate jeopardy exists. However, it does not follow that the
State, rather than the Federal government, should have the ability and the obligation to specify when and how each
remedy is to be applied. The Committee report that accompanied OBRA '87 clearly states:






* * * it is the responsibility of the Secretary to take the enforcement measures necessary to assure
compliance by Medicaid facilities with the requirements of participation as well as to assure that State enforcement
activities are adequate to protect the health and safety of residents. To enable the Secretary to discharge this responsibility,
the committee amendment would greatly expand the remedies available to the Secretary under current law.

* * * [I]f both the State and the Secretary decide that remedies other than termination are appropriate,
the Secretary's selection of alternative remedies, and not those of the State apply. (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Cong.,
1st Sess. 475-7 (1987)).






Moreover, section 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act specifies that the Secretary shall provide, through regulations, guidance
to States in establishing remedies.

However, when there is disagreement between HCFA and the State regarding enforcement action, the disagreement is
resolved in accordance with the policy set forth in  488.452(d). For example, paragraph (d) says that when HCFA
or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, the
additional or alternative remedies will also apply when_

 Both HCFA and the State find that a NF has not met all the participation requirements; and

 Both HCFA and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists.

In this way, the sanction(s) proposed by the State can take effect.

Based on the above discussion and the need to make conforming changes with other provisions of the regulation, we are
revising  488.402(b)(2) to indicate that the State or HCFA may apply one or more of the remedies specified in
 488.406 instead of terminating the provider agreement, or in addition to termination procedures, to continue
until the effective date of the termination or until substantial compliance is achieved, and, in some cases, until
the State or HCFA is assured that substantial compliance can be maintained.



Comment: 

As stated above, one State said that  488.402(b)(2) should be amended to state that the survey agencies should
be allowed to impose one or more remedies for each deficiency or cluster of deficiencies. The State's rationale is
that the proposed paragraph (c) would restrict both HCFA and the States in their efforts to encourage prompt corrective
action, and to protect residents' health and safety. Another commenter said the application of a separate remedy
for each deficiency seems unduly harsh. A remedy or set of remedies should be imposed relating to the entire universe
on deficiencies cited. Still another said that one incident should trigger the citing of no more than one remedy.

Two commenters said that there is no statutory basis for paragraph (c). Other commenters asked for clarification,
suggesting that we use examples, limits, and further guidelines to ensure consistency. Of particular concern to
many was the fear that, absent these guidelines and limits, providers might incur multiple sanctions for single deficiencies
or for multiple deficiencies arising from a single act or incident. Some suggested that HCFA and the State be directed
to consider whether a facility's deficiencies are ``clustered'' or ``bundled'' (we used the term ``interrelated''
in the proposed rule) or scattered throughout the facility in deciding which remedy(ies) to impose in particular
situations.

A number of commenters wanted us to specifically set forth in regulations exactly which sanctions should be imposed
for each type of possible deficiency or group of deficiencies.

One State expressed concern about the potentially large number of separate follow-up visits required to verify corrections
of the deficiencies under each remedy. ``For example,'' it said_






If separate civil monetary penalties are imposed for several deficiencies, or groups of deficiencies, it would be
expected that deficiencies would be corrected on different dates and that the facility would insist on immediate
followup on each deficiency or group of deficiencies in order to immediately end the daily monetary penalty. Additionally,
a follow-up would be required at 90 days after the survey to determine if denial of payments would be required under
[the proposed] 488.212(a)(3), and another followup would be required at six months to determine if termination is
required under [the proposed] 488.212(a)(4).






Finally, one commenter wanted us to insert the words, ``Subject to the provisions of this subpart,'' at the beginning
of the paragraph, and another wanted us to define interrelated deficiencies as deficiencies caused by or resulting
from the same action or occurrence.



Response: 

Sections 4203 and 4213 of OBRA '87 and subsequent related legislation were enacted partially because of the Congress'
recognition that the Secretary and the States needed more flexibility in enforcing regulations pertaining to Medicare
SNFs and Medicaid NFs, and, therefore, more choices of enforcement actions. The selection of a particular remedy
is based on the nature of noncompliance and the remedy (or remedies) that either HCFA or the Medicaid agency believes
is most likely to achieve correction of the deficiencies. We believe that this approach best fulfills the Congressional
mandate to ``promote compliance with the requirements of participation and assure high quality care for nursing
facility residents'' (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 472 (1987)). In some instances, the most effective
remedy may be two or more remedies. Furthermore, section 1919(h)(1) (A) and (B) of the Act clearly states that this
is the case. The first reads in part, ``* * * the State * * * may provide * * *
for one or more of the other remedies,'' and the second, ``* * * the State may provide for one or more of
the remedies.'' Consequently, we are revising  488.402(c) to clearly state that more than one remedy may be
considered appropriate for noncompliance for each deficiency. However, it may also be appropriate for one remedy
to be imposed for multiple deficiencies that constitute noncompliance, and the revised regulation reflects this
policy as well. In any case, the choice of one or multiple remedies for each deficiency constituting noncompliance
is part of the decision making process. The actual imposition of a remedy or remedies is imposed on a facility for noncompliance
as a whole, with participation requirements. We are deleting the limitation in the proposed paragraph (c) that, for
a single remedy for all deficiencies to be imposed, the deficiencies must be interrelated and subject to correction
by the same remedy. This change offers more flexibility to the State survey agencies and to HCFA, and is in keeping with
the statute.

Further, setting forth specific sanctions to be applied for each deficiency constituting noncompliance or a group
of deficiencies constituting noncompliance would defeat the whole purpose of providing maximum flexibility to
both the Secretary and to the States. We are adopting certain minimum sanctions that will be imposed according to how
serious the noncompliance is, but beyond that, there is enough flexibility to tailor the remedy or remedies to the
specific case at hand.

The statutory authority for  488.402(c) is found at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act. We have discussed
this statutory authority in both the proposed rule and elsewhere in the preamble of this final rule.
The matter of a potentially large number of follow-up visits is a possibility. If it materializes, State survey agencies
and possibly HCFA's regional offices may require additional resources. We will be closely monitoring implementation
of these regulations to determine the resources needed for this task. However, not every deficiency will require
or even merit a separate revisit for certification of substantial compliance. As stated above, sometimes several
deficiencies will lead to the imposition of only one remedy. Moreover, even if different remedies can be traced to
different deficiencies, the survey agency is under no obligation to make multiple revisits. The noncompliance which
led to the imposition of remedies is due entirely to facility performance. The survey agency is not responsible for
the noncompliance and is under no obligation to spend valuable resources on multiple revisits. Furthermore, remedies
are imposed for noncompliance in a facility, rather than for deficiency ``a'' or ``b'' or ``c,'' etc. The survey agency
is generally obligated to revisit only when the facility makes a credible allegation of compliance with all requirements
and, in some cases, no revisit is required even then.
Finally, we are not adding the phrase, ``Subject to the provisions of this subpart,'' at the beginning of paragraph
(c) because we believe it to be unnecessary. Since we are revising this final rule to allow HCFA or the State to impose
one or more remedies for all deficiencies constituting noncompliance whether they are interrelated or not, there
is no need to define ``interrelated deficiencies.''
For the reasons given directly above, we are revising  488.402(c) to provide that HCFA or the State may apply
one or more remedies for each deficiency constituting noncompliance, or single or multiple remedies for all deficiencies
constituting noncompliance.


Comment: 

A number of commenters said that they opposed our proposed exemption of deficiencies with scope and severity levels
of 1 from the requirement for a plan of correction. The consensus of these commenters was that all deficiencies should
require a plan of correction. As one commenter remarked:



While we understand that it is inappropriate to punish or sanction a facility for an isolated, minor deficiency, the
government should ask facilities to correct such problems and there should be a public record of the facility's plan
to do so. Since the regulations and the reform law require compliance with all requirements, there cannot be any exclusions
from completing plans of correction. Plans of correction are a management tool for both the facility and the regulators,
not a penalty or punishment.



Two commenters said the exception should be retained, but only if HCFA applies a ``substantiality factor'' to the
determination of what constitutes a deficiency. By ``substantiality'' they meant that nothing would be cited as
a deficiency unless it is 

not 

an isolated or occasional occurrence or unless it has a significant impact on resident rights or quality of life. If
this were the case, they said, then all deficiencies should require a plan of correction.
One commenter asked, ``Why cite a deficiency at scope and severity level 1?''
Regarding the issue of approval of the plans of correction, one commenter suggested that HCFA approve all plans of
correction. Another suggested we add the following specific language:



HCFA will or the survey agency must approve the plan of correction if it is reasonably calculated to result in substantial
correction of the deficiency within a reasonable time. Neither HCFA nor the survey agency may disapprove a plan of
correction because the facility denies the existence of the deficiency, if the plan otherwise meets the criteria
specified by this paragraph. The facility may submit an amended plan of correction at any time, and HCFA will or the
survey agency must approve the amended plan if it meets the criteria specified in this paragraph. A facility's submission
of a plan of correction does not constitute an admission that the deficiency exists.



Finally, one commenter said that there is a need for clearer plans of correction, and another said that the plans need
to be more specific and focus on care issues.


Response: 

We agree that all deficiencies should require either a plan of correction or an agreement to correct, and are revising
this final regulation at  488.408 (``Selection of remedies.'') accordingly. One commenter expressed the
rationale for this succinctly: ``* * * the government should ask facilities to correct [deficiencies]
and there should be a public record of the facilities' plan to do so.''
We do not accept the suggestion that the regulations specify that HCFA will or the survey agency must approve the plan
of correction if it is reasonably calculated to result in substantial correction of the deficiency within a reasonable
time. We have discussed the meaning of substantial compliance elsewhere in this preamble. As for the terms ``reasonably
calculated'' and ``reasonable time,'' it has been our experience that putting general language such as this in regulations
is not useful. Plans of correction are considered on a case-by-case basis by both the States and by HCFA because circumstances
vary greatly from facility to facility. To state in the regulations that HCFA and the States have a moral and legal responsibility
to be reasonable in their dealings with providers would be to belabor the obvious; there is no need for such a pronouncement.
One of the commenters who proposed that plans of correction be required for all deficiencies made the observation
that some plans of correction do nothing more than complain about the law, the surveyor, or the circumstances, without
ever describing how the violation will be corrected. We agree and would only add that it is highly probable that facilities
submitting these plans considered them to be ``reasonable,'' and extremely improbable that these plans would be
acceptable to HCFA or the State.
Finally, we agree that plans of correction must be clear and specific, but believe that there is no need to state this
in regulations.

Comment: 

Two commenters suggested that, in addition to cross-referring to  488.234 of the proposed rule (redesignated
as  488.452, ``State and Federal disagreements involving findings not in agreement in situations where there
is no immediate and serious threat''), we should refer the reader to proposed  488.212(a) (``Action when there
is no immediate and serious threat''), and to  488.232 of the proposed rule (redesignated as  488.450,
``Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies'').


Response: 

We believe this to be unnecessary. We try, to the greatest extent possible, to avoid redundancy in regulations. When
trying to determine what to do when there is State and Federal disagreement, it is most likely that the reader will consult
 488.452.


Comment: 

Another commenter suggested that the text of our proposed  488.202(e) be revised to state, ``If the State and
HCFA disagree on the decision to impose remedies when HCFA has performed a validation survey, the disagreement is
resolved in accordance with [proposed]  488.234.''


Response: 

Not allowing HCFA to impose remedies unless and until it has performed its own validation survey would, in most cases,
significantly lengthen the amount of time between the facility's being cited for a deficiency and the time when a remedy
would be imposed. This would not fulfill the intent of the Act, which states that criteria as to when and how each of the
remedies is to be applied ``shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and
final imposition of the remedies * * *'' (sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act). In
any event, the Act does not limit the Secretary's ability to make findings exclusively through the use of validation
surveys. The Act says only that the Secretary may impose sanctions if he or she ``finds'' noncompliance. There may
be occasions, for example, when the Secretary may choose to impose sanctions based on a State agency survey. We have
therefore concluded that the Act did not intend that the Secretary exercise his or her oversight authority only through
Federal onsite validation surveys. Nonetheless, in some cases it will only be possible to draw conclusions about
facility compliance through onsite surveys. Moreover, sections 1819(g)(3)(B) and 1919(g)(3)(B) of the Act require
the Secretary to conduct validation surveys for at least 5 percent of the State survey agency's standard surveys,
as long as the 5 percent equals at least 5 facilities. Therefore, many times the Secretary's enforcement decisions
will arise as a result of Federal validation surveys. However, this will not always be the case.
For the reasons listed immediately above, we are making no revisions to proposed  488.202(e).


Comment: 

Some members of the health care community said that the proposed 2-4 and 15-day periods are inadequate to allow
facilities a fair opportunity for correcting deficiencies. In addition, commenters suggested that HCFA_
 Specify whether the days are calendar days or business days;
 Specify that the time frames for correction will not begin until the facility receives the notice, rather than
when notice is sent;
 Specify that the notice must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested or by personal delivery, and
that the State must give the facility notice in the same manner; and
 Provide an expedited hearing process to safeguard the facility's ability to continue its business and protect
its residents from wrongful government action. This measure must be taken, the commenter said, due to the short notice
we proposed to give in the case of immediate and serious threat.
Other commenters said that the time frames we proposed are too long. One of these commenters expressed serious concern,
noting that the Act clearly requires that immediate action be taken to remove the jeopardy in immediate and serious
threat situations. This commenter urged that no notice be given before the imposition of a sanction in these cases,
and suggested that, in nonimmediate and serious threat situations, 5 days notice should be given. Another said that,
in many cases, it is obvious that the remedy should be imposed immediately. This consumer organization asked why a
State survey agency should ever have to delay initiating monitoring visits to a facility or why a facility with widespread
quality of care problems should be allowed to admit new residents for 15 days after such problems are discovered. Other
commenters cited the possible continuance of ``roller coaster compliance'' unless we shorten the time frames. ``Roller
coaster compliance'' refers to the facility practice of coming into compliance only long enough to stave off an impending
remedy, then reverting to noncompliant activities or practices until the next time the deficiencies are cited, when
the cycle begins all over again.
Other commenters said that our proposed time frames do not adequately protect residents, referring to monitors as
an example. One said that in a case of jeopardy, the State might feel it necessary to have a monitor in the facility as
the survey team is leaving. Waiting two days without outside scrutiny may be too long under some circumstances.

Two commenters said that, in the case of civil money 
penalties, notice before an effective date is meaningless, 
since the fine may be imposed for a past violation that has 
already been corrected. 
One commenter said that the ``not more than four days'' 
notice in  488.402(f) conflicts with  488.410, and another 
that paragraph (f) conflicts with  488.330(e)(1)(i) and 
(ii). Another said that the clause, ``* * * the remedy could be 
imposed anytime after the minimum 2 day notification period, 
but not later than the 10th day after the last day of 
survey,'' is confusing. 
Finally, one commenter suggested that residents and 
their representatives be notified of enforcement actions and 
their implications at the same time the nursing home is 
notified. Two other commenters said that States should be 
required to compile, at least monthly, a list of facilities 
against which they have taken adverse action and imposed 
sanctions. They suggested that this listing be sent to 
newspapers, to the State long-term care ombudsman, to the 
State protection and advocacy agency, to acute care 
hospitals, and to public and private agencies that regularly 
make referrals of individuals to nursing facilities. They 
also suggested that States be required to develop poster 
notices for each intermediate remedy, and require facilities 
to post the notice in a prominent place. 


Response: 

We are revising  488.402(f) to specify that 
the time frames given are calendar days, and that they begin 
when the facility receives the notice, but in no event will 
the effective date of the enforcement action be later than 
20 days after the notice is sent. We are not accepting the 
suggestion that the notices be sent via certified mail, with 
return receipt requested. This would preclude a valid 
notice sent via other means, such as telefax, telegram, 
commercial overnight delivery services, or other means that 
may be faster. This becomes an especially important 
consideration in the case of immediate jeopardy 
deficiencies. 
The commenter who asks for an expedited hearing process 
due to the short notice alleging immediate jeopardy seems to 
be suggesting that the hearing take place before the 
effective date of a sanction to safeguard the facility's 
ability to continue its business and protect its residents 
from wrongful government action. In the case of immediate 
jeopardy, this would mean a hearing would have to be held as 
early as the first 48 hours after the survey. It is 
entirely possible that, when a survey uncovers such 
jeopardy, the State or HCFA may immediately set an effective 
date at the minimum required time after notice, that is, 2 
days. It is virtually impossible to set up a hearing this 
quickly, and expanding the time between the notice and the 
effective date of a remedy to make it possible to hold a 
hearing before the effective date would not be in the best 
interests of the residents. The whole point of a short time 
frame is to safeguard the lives and the safety of residents 
by taking immediate action. As discussed at proposed 
 488.180 (now designated as  488.330), Certification of 
compliance or noncompliance, it is not necessary to hold a 
hearing before the effective date of termination to 
adequately protect a facility's right to due process. 
As noted above, we received comments saying our time 
frames were too short, and others saying that they were too 
long. While we are mindful of the Act's requirement that 
the Secretary take immediate action in the case of immediate 
jeopardy (sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act), 
and to minimize the time between the identification of 
violations and final imposition of the other remedies 
(sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(B) of the Act), we 
have chosen not to shorten them, except for the same day (if 
necessary) installation of a State monitor in the case of an 
immediate jeopardy. We believe that, for other available 
remedies when there is an immediate jeopardy deficiency, the 
facility should be allowed at least 2 days before imposition 
of sanctions. This is because we believe that even in cases 
of immediate jeopardy, providers are entitled to some notice 
before the imposition of sanctions. We believe that, in the 
case of non-immediate jeopardy, we should not allow any less 
than 15 days for similar reasons.

We chose not to set the minimum amount of notice 
required any higher than 2 days in the case of immediate 
jeopardy because the longer immediate jeopardy persists, the 
greater the likelihood that actual harm or even death may 
result or continue. We have, for the reasons cited in the 
paragraph immediately preceding determined that a facility 
be given no less than 2 days before imposition of sanctions. 
Besides, it has been our experience that, as a practical 
matter, it takes longer than 2 days to complete termination 
proceedings once they are begun. It is our belief that we 
have struck a fair balance between giving facilities fair 
notice and a reasonable chance to correct deficiencies and 
fulfilling our responsibility to safeguard the health or 
safety of residents. 
We have chosen 15 days in the case of nonimmediate 
jeopardy by carefully weighing the same considerations. It 
is important to understand that we are bound by Federal law 
to minimize the time between the identification of 
violations and final imposition of remedies. While sections 
1819 and 1919 of the Act do not require giving specific 
notice before the imposition of remedies, constitutional 
principles of due process generally do require such a notice 
of agency adverse action. On the other hand, neither the 
Act nor the Constitution require that providers have the 
opportunity to correct deficiencies before sanctions are 
imposed. In other words, there is a need for prior notice, 
but not an entitlement on the providers' part to an 
opportunity to correct deficiencies. This policy, we 
believe, satisfies due process concerns of providers. As we 
have said, the only exception is the immediate imposition of 
a State monitor when there is an immediate jeopardy 
situation, because, above all else, it is our responsibility 
to protect the lives of residents. The facility will not be 
required to pay the salary of the State monitor; nor will 
the State monitor have managerial authority to obligate 
facility funds. (That authority is reserved for the 
temporary manager who could be installed a couple of days 
later.) The State monitor can be appointed immediately, 
while other sanctions are pending during notice periods to 
protect residents. With respect to civil money penalties, 
we do not believe that any notice is required before HCFA or 
a State advises a facility that noncompliance has occurred 
and that a penalty is to be imposed. As the statute clearly 
suggests, civil money penalties may be imposed for past 
periods of noncompliance even if a facility is currently in 
compliance. Notice is required, however, before a civil 
money penalty can be 

collected, 

and the regulations call for 
exactly this procedure. Like any other commercial 
enterprise, nursing homes must structure their debits and 
credits around their cash flow. We believe that notifying a 
facility that it must pay a civil money penalty instantly is 
unfair, unrealistic, and not in accordance with the basic 
principles of due process. 
In this final rule, we are removing the provision 
requiring a maximum of 4 days notice before the imposition 
of a sanction in  488.402(f). We may impose a remedy for 
immediate jeopardy, as  488.410 allows, as long as we give 
the facility at least 2 days' notice before the imposition 
of the remedy and no more than 23 days from the last day of 
the survey to remove the jeopardy or be terminated. In 
actual practice, the facility is notified that there is an 
immediate jeopardy deficiency as soon as the survey has been 
completed. It is only the official notice of the imposition 
of a remedy that may not be sent until later, as long as it 
is received by the facility at least two days before the 
effective date of the remedy.

As a result of our review of these comments, we are not 
making final proposed  488.180(e)(1)(i), Certification of 
compliance or noncompliance, because it appears to conflict 
with  488.402(f). 
As proposed, we are providing in  488.325(f), that the 
State must provide the State's long-term care ombudsman with 
any report of adverse actions specified at  488.406 imposed 
on a facility. We believe that this provision will keep 
residents informed about each enforcement action. Whatever 
additional publicity States may wish to give notices of 
adverse action is their decision. 
We are also revising paragraph (f) to note the 
exceptions in notification requirements for civil money 
penalties and restructured it to clarify them. 



Section 488.404 Factors To Be Considered in Selecting Remedies 



We received comments on proposed  488.204, as well as 
on our solicitation of comments in the preamble to the 
proposed rule, about the scope and severity measures; 
specifically, we asked for comments on how scope and 
severity values were described and how they were to be 
assigned. We will address all of the comments we received 
on scope and severity in this section of the preamble. 


Comment: 

The majority of commenters did not comment on 
the scope scale. Several commenters expressed support for 
using scope and severity scales to determine the enforcement 
response to facility noncompliance. Other commenters 
opposed using these scales. Of those opposed, some believed 
that the scales, absent any measurable criteria, introduce 
another opportunity for surveyor inconsistencies to occur. 
Others thought the scope and severity level definitions 
were too broad and vague to be applied consistently by 
surveyors, allowing too much government discretion in the 
selection of remedies, while one commenter believed that the 
determination of remedies should be left to the judgment of 
the survey agency. 
A few commenters argued that the scales were impractical 
because they were either too complex or prescriptive and 
left no room for surveyor judgment. 
Several commenters argued that the use of scope and 
severity scales conflict with Congressional intent to 
eliminate a hierarchy of participation requirements. They 
contend that by ranking the seriousness, that is, 
importance, of a facility's deficiencies, the scope and 
severity scales foster the belief that some requirements are 
more important than others. 
One commenter questioned why the scope and severity 
scales were being put into regulation. This commenter 
believed that codifying the criteria used for determining 
remedies is inappropriate and will invite additional legal 
challenges by nursing home providers dissatisfied with 
severity and scope level determinations. 
One commenter was concerned that the scope and severity 
scales failed to provide enough regulatory guidance on the 
exact criteria that will be used in making remedy 
determinations to ensure that the enforcement response is 
appropriate to the nature of the noncompliance. 
We received a variety of proposals for reconfiguring the 
scope and severity scales from provider organizations, State 
governments and consumer advocate organizations. 
One consumer advocate organization proposed a scope and 
severity scale with three tiers of severity (immediate 
jeopardy, substandard quality of care, and other 
violations), while retaining the definition of scope as we 
proposed. 
This proposal called for a plan of correction for all 
level 1 deficiencies (other violations) regardless of scope 
and a mandatory civil money penalty for scopes of 3 and 4. 
Additionally, the proposal specified that the State or HCFA 
must impose a directed plan of correction if the violation 
is repeated. All other remedies could be imposed at the 
option of the State or HCFA.

The second tier (substandard quality of care) would 
require a civil money penalty, public notice, a plan of 
correction and, at the State's option, any other remedy. If 
repeated, the State or HCFA would require a State monitor 
and a directed plan of correction. There were additional 
mandatory remedies imposed at higher scope levels. 
The third tier (immediate jeopardy) would require the 
statutorily mandated temporary management and physician and 
nursing home administrator licensing board notice, as well 
as a denial of payment for new admissions and a plan of 
correction. 
Another organization also proposed three severity levels 
(Actual harm, impairment or death; potential harm, 
impairment and death; and negative outcome). The scope 
levels were also pared down to three levels (isolated, 
occasional and widespread/pattern). Substandard quality of 
care would be defined as a severity of 2 with a scope of 3 
in quality of care and all of severity level 3. For non-immediate jeopardy, this proposal would require termination

in 180 days from the last date of survey unless compliance 
is achieved during the correction period. For immediate 
jeopardy, termination would take effect in 23 days if no 
temporary manager is appointed or accepted. This proposal 
would not require any mandatory fines but rather, would 
leave the choice of remedy to the State or HCFA. Other 
statutorily driven remedies have also been included in the 
proposed plan. 
One State organization proposed a matrix which had five 
severity levels (harm or death; negative outcome non-staff 
action; negative outcome staff action; negative outcome 
likely; and no negative outcome). As in some other 
proposals, the scope levels remained as we had provided in 
the proposed rule. Under this plan, no remedies would be 
imposed for severity level of 1 and scope of 1 or severity 
level of 1 and scope of 2 or severity level of 2 and scope 
of 1. A plan of correction would be required for a severity 
and scope of 1-3, 1-4 and 2-2, respectively. A civil money 
penalty would be imposed for a severity and scope of 2-3 and 
2-4. No fine would be imposed for a scope of 1, even if a 
deficiency is at the severity of 3 or 4. Denial of payment 
for new admissions would only be imposed for severity levels 
of 4 and 5 (except severity 4 and scope of 1). This plan 
also would exempt facilities from any remedies in certain 
situations where new requirements had not been disseminated 
to nursing homes. 
Another State organization proposed a scope and severity 
scale using the four scope levels defined in our proposed 
rule, but defining the severity levels differently. The 
four severity levels would be defined as level 4_life 
threatening harm or death; 3_actual harm; 2_potential 
harm; and 1_no harm or likelihood of harm. Severity and 
scope of 1 would have no remedies imposed. Severity level 
of 1 and scope of 2 and severity of 2 and scope of 1 or 2 
would have no remedy imposed the first time the deficiency 
was cited, but the State or HCFA would impose a directed 
plan of correction if the same deficiency(ies) was found at 
the next survey. This plan also requires the State or HCFA 
to choose between a denial of payment for new admissions or 
a civil money penalty for severity levels of 3 and 4. 
Another State disagreed with our use of the term 
immediate jeopardy relative to the scales because it 
believes that the term, as described for the scales, carries 
no connotation of immediacy and is not equivalent to the 
language ``likely to cause at any time'' we had proposed in 
the definition of the term in  488.201 of the proposed 
rule. Also, the State questioned our definition of 
substandard quality of care in relationship to severity and 
scope. It believed that substandard quality of care should 
not apply to one or two residents but should reflect 
deficient patterns of care, policies or procedures present 
in or used by the facility. The State recommended that HCFA 
provide that a finding of substandard quality of care may be 
made (but is not required) for scope levels of 1 and 2 and 
severity levels of 3 and 4. 
Several commenters suggested that severity levels 3 and 
4 should be redefined. Specifically, these commenters found 
virtually no difference in the application of remedies in 
the two levels. Other commenters believed that a potential 
for life threatening harm should not be an immediate 
jeopardy finding subject to harsher remedies.

Many commenters disagreed that facilities be furnished 
with a separate summary of all level 1-1 deficiencies rather 
than receiving notice of them on the official deficiency 
statement. They believed that it would be confusing to have 
a facility's deficiencies recorded, in parts, between two 
separate documents, as well as harder to track repeat 
deficiencies at the next standard survey. 
Many commenters made specific recommendations of 
required remedies for various levels of severity and scope. 
Some suggested that HCFA or the State only impose a plan of 
correction at the lower scope and severity levels, while 
other commenters wanted HCFA to mandate civil money 
penalties and other remedies. 
Many consumer advocates expressed concern that the 
proposed scope and severity scales did not represent the 
intent of the Congress to make resident rights and physical 
environment requirements equivalent to quality of care 
requirements. They contend that the way the scales are 
currently written, resident rights and physical environment 
deficiencies would never rise above severity level 2. 
A few commenters believe that the scope and severity 
scales should be predicated on a statistical analysis of 
probability and suggest that this could be done by health 
care professionals who could factor into the scales the 
predisposition of a given individual to a particular 
incident. Many commenters asked that the ambiguous terms 
used within the level descriptions be defined, for example, 
how many cases constitute ``in a number of cases.'' One 
commenter suggested that a numerical or percentage 
determination be made to clarify the terms, for example, 1-3 
instances = isolated, or less than 17 percent occurrences = isolated. 
One commenter suggested that the scope scale include 
only three levels, combining the proposed levels 3 and 4 
because there was no distinction for the remedies. Another 
commenter observed that the scope scale level descriptions 
were written in terms of the number of times that the 
surveyors made a particular observation, and contended that 
while this approach may be appropriate for certain types of 
problems, it is not for others. For example, when surveying 
for life safety code compliance, what scope would be 
assigned to a total sprinkler system failure? This problem 
is a single observation, but it is one that affects every 
resident in the facility. This commenter, therefore, 
suggested that if we are to accurately reflect the extent of 
the deficiency, then scope should be based on the number of 
residents who are affected by the deficient practice. 
Overall, many commenters feared that the scope and severity 
scales, as proposed, give the enforcing agency virtually 
unlimited discretion in selecting remedies. They contended 
that the proposed scheme does not limit imposition of the 
most onerous remedies only to the most serious deficiencies 
and they, therefore, suggest that a prescriptive approach be 
developed for correlating deficiencies and remedies. 


Response:

 Historically, the enforcement system was 
based on a hierarchical set of requirements called 
conditions of participation, standards, and elements. Each 
condition of participation included groups of standards, and 
standards were made up of separate elements. Enforcement 
was based on the level of the requirement for which a 
deficiency was cited. For example, condition-level 
deficiencies in a SNF resulted in the initiation of 
termination procedures or a denial of payment for new 
admissions. However, if only standard-level deficiencies 
were found, only a plan of correction was required. Since 
the Congress has expressly eliminated the use of 
hierarchical requirements in nursing homes, we needed an 
organized way to determine how serious a facility's 
deficiencies are, as well as a consistent approach to guide 
enforcing agencies in making enforcement decisions.

We believe that we have implemented the Congress' 
mandate to abandon our pre-OBRA hierarchical requirements 
and to develop a system capable of detecting and responding 
to deficiencies in any participation requirement. The 
enforcement scheme provided in this final rule is built on 
the assumption that all requirements must be met and 
enforced and that requirements take on greater or lesser 
significance depending on the circumstances and resident 
outcomes in a particular facility. In addition, we wish to 
emphasize that measuring the seriousness of deficiencies is 
only for the purpose of determining the enforcement response 
most appropriate for specific degrees of noncompliance. 
In order to grant the statutory flexibility given to 
HCFA and the States to design their own enforcement 
approaches (with guidance from the Secretary), we are 
providing a modified enforcement scheme to be used to assess 
the seriousness of deficiencies and then used to select an 
enforcement response. The scheme requires that specified 
factors be considered by HCFA or the State to assess the 
seriousness of a facility's deficiencies, and it correlates 
seriousness to specific enforcement responses. However, 
with the exception of the immediate jeopardy level, the 
enforcing agencies may exercise the flexibility to design 
their own methods of interpreting and applying the 
assessment factors to the identified deficiencies. 
Historically, determinations of immediate jeopardy to 
resident health or safety have been made by HCFA and the 
States in accordance with guidance provided in Appendix Q of 
the State Operations Manual. We conclude that there is no 
compelling reason for States to redefine this level of 
noncompliance. The enforcing agencies may also exercise 
their statutory authority to determine whether an 
alternative remedy is or is not preferable to termination. 
In determining the seriousness of Life Safety Code (LSC) 
deficiencies, States are encouraged to apply the Fire Safety 
Evaluation System (FSES), which is Appendix C of the 1985 
edition of the LSC. Since the FSES is an equivalency system 
based on point values, it is possible to utilize the system 
to document the seriousness of deficiencies on a 
quantitative basis in accordance with the revised 
enforcement matrix. Once the seriousness of the 
deficiencies is determined and the decision to impose 
alternative remedies instead of, or in addition to, 
termination, HCFA or the State must make its remedy 
selection from the remedy category associated with the 
specific level of noncompliance. This correlation is 
provided in  488.408 of this final rule. 
This approach has the added benefit of promoting 
national consistency because all systems will be considering 
the same initial assessment factors, and the remedy choice 
will then be based on the nature of the noncompliance and 
the corrective action most likely to achieve correction and 
continued compliance. In other words, we developed, for use 
by the States and by HCFA, an organized and consistent 
method by which to first, determine how serious a facility's 
deficiencies are, and second, to select an enforcement 
response from a specified remedy category linked to that 
degree of noncompliance. 
We believe that the enforcement scheme we are providing 
in this final rule for HCFA and the States to use in rating 
deficiencies and selecting remedies satisfies a variety of 
concerns posed by the former scope and severity scale and 
the proposed rule in general. Under the proposed rule, we 
set out two scales, one for scope and one for severity, that 
HCFA and the States were to apply in determining which 
remedy to apply once deficiencies were identified. While 
the rule provided some definition for each of the levels of 
scope and severity, HCFA and the States were essentially 
free to determine what constituted a ``sufficient'' number of 
``repeated observations'' in concluding whether or not a 
``pattern'' of deficiencies could be said to exist. 
In the final rule, we have removed the scope and 
severity scales, as such, and have replaced them with a set 
of criteria that must be used (should a decision be made to 
impose alternative remedies at all) to select an enforcement 
remedy. Specifically, while the enforcement scheme in this 
final rule is conceptually the same as the former scope and 
severity scales, it differs from that approach in numerous 
significant ways: 
 It leaves to the judgment of both HCFA and the States 
whether to impose alternative remedies at all, regardless of 
the seriousness of a facility's deficiencies. 
 It incorporates the concept of substantial compliance, 
whereby deficiencies found which constitute no more than a 
potential for minimal harm are not sanctioned. 
 With the exception of immediate jeopardy, a State may 
use its own method for interpreting terms that describe the 
relative frequency or seriousness of deficiencies as long as 
it is consistent with the guidance presented in the 
regulation.

 It correlates, to a greater extent than in the proposed 
rule, specific enforcement categories from which an 
enforcement response must be selected with specified degrees 
of noncompliance. 

 It can be applied to physical environment deficiencies, 
as well as to all others, and it should relieve commenters' 
fears that resident rights violations and physical 
environment deficiencies could not be considered as serious 
deficiencies. 

 Providers will have a clearer idea of the enforcement 
consequences they could be subject to for specific degrees 
of noncompliance because, in  488.408, we have correlated 
enforcement categories with levels of noncompliance. 

The establishment of these remedy categories will 
provide regulatory guidance to HCFA and the States in 
selecting remedies and will necessitate that States and HCFA 
clearly define the seriousness of cited deficiencies in 
order to select an appropriate remedy. 

We have not accepted any of the commenters' proposed 
revisions to the scope and severity scales for inclusion in 
the modified enforcement scheme in this final rule. After 
reviewing the proposals, we concluded that, while the 
terminology may have been different, all of the proposals 
were conceptually the same as the scales that were published 
in the proposed rule. In addition, those commenting 
provided no evidence (for example, success data) 
to indicate that their respective proposed enforcement 
systems would be more effective than the scales we published 
in the proposed rule. We, therefore, have not adopted any 
of the commenters' proposals in place of the enforcement 
model we are presenting in this final rule. In addition and 
equally noteworthy, we spent considerable time meeting with 
various groups representing the nursing home industry, State 
agencies and consumer organizations to discuss and seek 
input on the various approaches to restructure and refocus 
the survey and enforcement processes. The resulting 
approach was presented in the notice of proposed rulemaking 
as well as in what has been carried over into this final 
rule. 

In response to concerns that repeated 1-1 deficiencies 
(now referred to as isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the 
State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential 
for minimum harm) would be hard to monitor on subsequent 
surveys, we note that, while such deficiencies are not cited 
on the official deficiency statement and are not sanctioned, 
their existence is maintained in the official provider file 
along with the official deficiency statement. The separate 
listing of these deficiencies is also accessible to the 
surveying agency and disclosable to the public. 

While we intend that the enforcement scheme provide 
internal guidance to States and to HCFA, we are including it 
in the regulations to provide the public, and particularly 
regulated facilities and facility residents, with full 
disclosure as to how enforcing agencies will determine 
appropriate remedies for providers that have been found out 
of compliance with Federal participation requirements. 



Comment:

 One commenter wanted a remedy to be imposed 
for insufficient nurse staffing. 



Response:

 The law requires that nursing homes meet all 
participation requirements. Should noncompliance with nurse 
staffing requirements be identified, either during an 
extended survey or when a waiver of RN and/or licensed 
nursing staffing has been requested or granted, the facility 
would be subject to an enforcement response from HCFA or the 
State, just as it would be for other instances of 
noncompliance. 



Comment:

 Some commenters wanted to remove the 
distinction between initial and secondary factors in 
 488.404 (proposed at  488.208) believing that the 
secondary criteria are equally important as the initial 
assessment.

Response:

 The secondary factors are not less important; 
they just come later in the process of selecting an 
appropriate remedy or remedies. However, we are replacing 
the word ``secondary'' with the word ``other'' to avoid any 
further confusion. The first step is to assess the 
seriousness of the deficiency(ies), including the presence 
or absence of immediate jeopardy, to determine the minimum 
recommended categories of remedies to impose, as well as the 
suggested optional categories from which to choose. The 
other factors (that is, the relationship of one deficiency 
to other deficiencies, and the facility's prior compliance 
history in general and specifically with reference to the 
cited deficiencies) assist in making choices from among all 
remedies available in any of the categories applicable to 
specific deficiencies. 



Comment:

 Other commenters want the compliance history 
of the facility to remain secondary because facilities with 
a change of ownership and/or personnel may not be able to 
otherwise emerge positively due to poor compliance in the 
past. It was suggested that we change  408.404 (proposed 
at  488.208) accordingly. 



Response:

 We did not revise the regulations text to 
reflect this suggestion. A facility's prior compliance 
history should be considered regardless of a change in 
ownership. A facility is purchased ``as is.'' The new owner 
acquires the compliance history, good or bad, as well as the 
assets. While we agree that after consideration of the 
facility's compliance history, HCFA or the State may 
conclude that such history is no longer a valid predictive 
factor of the facility's ability to achieve and maintain 
compliance (for example, following a change of ownership 
where the new owner ``cleans house'') the burden of proof is 
on the new owner to demonstrate that poor past performance 
no longer is a predictive factor. 



Comment:

 Other commenters wanted additional factors to 
be considered in addition to those outlined in  488.404 
(proposed at  488.208). The suggestions for additional 
factors are: 

 Whether the deficiency or deficiencies are directly 
related to resident care; 

 The corrective, long-term compliance, resident 
protective, and non-punitive outcomes sought by the agency; 

 The facility's degree of culpability; 

 The accuracy, extent, and availability of facility 
records; 

 The facility's financial condition; 

 Any adverse effect that the remedy would have on the 
health and safety of facility residents; 

 Whether there has been a change in ownership or 
operation of the facility; 

 The facility's action to correct the deficiency prior 
to the conclusion of the survey. 



Response:

 While we are not expanding  488.404 to 
include these additional factors, there is nothing to 
preclude HCFA or the State from considering any other 
factors they believe to be relevant in the decision-making 
process. We are, however, revising  488.404(b) to clarify 
that the other factors that HCFA and the State may consider 
include, but are not limited to, only those factors listed. 
Because we do not want to limit valid assessment 
considerations unnecessarily, we do not desire to provide an 
all-inclusive list. We realize that it is impossible to 
predict every factor that would have a bearing on every 
particular case. The two factors that we have included in 
the regulatory model have a direct bearing on the 
determination of the most appropriate remedy or remedies. 
We have explained above how the interrelationships among 
deficiencies can impact the decision to impose one as 
opposed to several remedies. The second factor, the 
facility's prior compliance history, is pertinent because 
sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 1919(h)(2)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(C) of 
the Act provide for increased penalty amounts for 
uncorrected or repeated noncompliance. Moreover, sections 
1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act require the 
imposition of the denial of payment remedy for repeated 
substandard quality of care. 



Comment:

 One commenter didn't believe that surveyors 
should make binding decisions regarding remedies, but rather 
this authority should be retained by the surveyors' 
supervisor in order to promote centralization as well as 
consistency in decision making.

Response:

 Surveyors do not have the authority to make 
binding enforcement determinations; rather, either HCFA or 
the State makes binding enforcement determinations in 
accordance with criteria at  488.452. 


Section 488.406 Available Remedies 


While analyzing the comments for this section, we again 
reviewed the provisions of the Act to ensure conformance in 
the final regulation. In doing so, we noted that proposed 
 488.206(c) did not include the remedies of civil money 
penalties, temporary management, and closure of the facility 
and transfer of residents, or their equivalents, in the 
listing of available remedies. We have also clarified that, 
regardless of what other additional remedies a State may 
have approved, the State must establish, at a minimum, those 
specified remedies, or an approved alternative to a 
specified remedy, that is, termination, State monitoring, 
denial of payment for new admissions, closure of a facility 
by the State in emergency situations and/or transfer of 
residents, civil money penalties, and temporary management. 
We are correcting this oversight in this final regulation. 
In addition, during the process of reviewing and 
analyzing comments, we added another remedy. This remedy, 
directed in-service training, is described in the discussion 
of  488.425. 
Also, since the proposed  488.228, ``Alternative or 
additional State remedies'', contained virtually the same 
information as this section, we are eliminating the proposed 
 488.228 and moving the remaining non-duplicative 
provisions to this section. All comments received in 
response to proposed  488.228 are being included and 
addressed below. 


Comment:

 One of the major concerns expressed throughout 
the comments was that it should be possible to address many 
or most instances of facility noncompliance through a 
traditional plan of correction. Several commenters 
indicated that plan of correction should be added to the 
list of possible remedies. 


Response:

 A plan of correction is a minimum requirement 
for any facility with deficiencies other than those isolated 
deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no 
actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, and, as for 
other providers and suppliers, it is not considered an 
enforcement remedy. Therefore, while we are clarifying the 
regulation to require that a facility complete and submit a 
plan of correction each time deficiencies are noted (other 
than those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State 
determines constitute no actual harm with a potential for 
minimal harm), we are not adding plan of correction to the 
listing of available remedies. 


Comment:

 Many commenters expressed concerns that the 
proposed remedies are punitive rather than corrective in 
nature, excessively burdensome in relationship to the 
deficiencies, too harsh or that they will direct the focus 
away from resident care, thereby having a negative effect on 
long term care. Some commenters stated that the remedies do 
not allow for one time digressions from a facility's history 
of compliance. Others believed that the proposed remedies 
would threaten job security for nursing home staff or the 
security of facility residents. 


Response:

 As indicated in response to the previous 
comment, many commenters assumed that it was not possible to 
have a plan of correction as the only corrective measure 
required in a facility, even when the deficiencies were of a 
low degree of seriousness. In this final regulation, we 
acknowledge that a traditional plan of correction may be the 
only measure needed to correct deficiencies in some 
facilities which have only lower level deficiencies. While 
we believe that using plans of corrections in this fashion 
should alleviate some of the concerns expressed by the 
commenters, we do not accept the notion that the use of more 
severe remedies for more severe deficiencies is excessive. 
There can be little question that the Congress was concerned 
about what it concluded was an unsatisfactory enforcement 
scheme prior to nursing home reform. As a result, it wrote 
into the law a series of remedies that it expects to be used 
should circumstances at individual facilities warrant. The 
driving force behind the legislation in this context was to 
provide the Secretary and the States with the authority to 
aggressively enforce the Act's new requirements in a way 
that would discourage facility noncompliance that the 
Congress believed to be widely evident between surveys, and 
thereby, to encourage lasting compliance. The design of 
these enforcement rules provides for incrementally more 
severe remedies as cited noncompliance is more egregious. 
We do not believe that an enforcement approach styled this 
way is harsh or excessive.

Comment:

 Six commenters suggested that the regulation 
include a remedy which would allow a ban on all admissions 
to a facility, regardless of the resident's source of 
payment. Three commenters further indicated that this 
remedy should be mandatory in cases involving immediate 
jeopardy. 


Response:

 We cannot accept these suggestions. The Act 
does not provide the authority to ban admissions for 
residents whose source of payment is other than Medicare or 
Medicaid. The Act does provide for the remedies of denial 
of all payment for SNFs and NFs by the Secretary and for 
denial of payment for all new admissions for SNFs by the 
Secretary, and for NFs, by the Secretary or the States. The 
proposed rule included denial of payment for all new 
admissions in certain diagnostic categories or requiring 
specialized care, but we have not included that remedy in 
this final rule for the reasons discussed under ``Denial of 
Payment'' later in this preamble. We believe that these 
remedies, along with the other available remedies for 
noncompliance, should be sufficient to promote a shift from 
noncompliance to substantial compliance. 


Comment:

 Two commenters stated that the option of 
closing the facility should be available for SNFs and not 
just for those facilities that participate as NFs or 
SNF/NFs. 


Response:

 For SNFs, HCFA has termination as an option 
for remedying noncompliance. While HCFA can terminate a 
SNF's Medicare participation, it cannot revoke a facility's 
license to operate within a State. Therefore, actual 
closures of facilities and transfers of residents are 
remedies which are options only for those facilities for 
which the State is the enforcing agency because the State 
also has licensing authority; closures of facilities are 
license related actions. 


Comment:

 One commenter proposed that off-site 
monitoring be added to the list of available remedies. 


Response:

 We are not accepting this suggestion. 
Enforcement remedies are designed to motivate providers to 
achieve and maintain compliance with participation 
requirements. The motivation is provided by the nature of 
the various available enforcement remedies that either 
require some action to be taken by the provider or that 
involve financial consequences directly or indirectly to the 
provider. Since off-site monitoring would be performed by 
the State rather than imposed on the facility, and since 
there would be no responsibility and, therefore, no 
incentive for a facility response, we conclude that this 
type of monitor is not an enforcement remedy to be imposed 
against facilities with deficiencies. 


Comment:

 One commenter proposed the addition of State 
and Secretarial authority to order the hospitalization of 
residents in cases involving immediate jeopardy, if the 
facility is unable or unwilling to respond to the residents' 
needs. 


Response:

 We do not believe an additional remedy is 
needed in order to respond to this commenter's concern. As 
temporary management will be imposed in those cases where 
immediate jeopardy is identified in a facility that will not 
be terminated immediately, control of the situation, 
including determinations as to the care of individual 
residents, will be shifted away from the facility's own 
management until the jeopardy is removed. Should the 
facility fail to relinquish control to the temporary 
manager, termination will result and residents will be 
transferred to facilities that are able to provide care in a 
manner consistent with certification requirements. 


Comment:

 One commenter proposed that public notice be 
included as an available remedy. 


Response:

 Public notices are already required by 
regulation for any SNF termination. Public notices are also 
allowed, but not required (unless the State has its own 
public notice requirement), for NFs that will be subject to 
termination. 
We do not believe that the regulation should expand the 
use of public notices as a remedy for noncompliance by 
including them in this section's listing. Public notices 
are frequently costly, and they do not always serve the 
intent of notifying the widest possible audience of a 
facility's noncompliance. Further, facilities are already 
required to post the availability of the results of their 
surveys on their premises. Accordingly, we are not adopting 
this suggestion in the final regulation.

Comment: 

A few commenters indicated that the 
prohibition of nurse aide training and competency evaluation 
programs (NATCEPs) is a penalty which should be included in 
the listing of available remedies. 


Response: 

The prohibition of a NATCEP is predicated on, 
among other things, the existence of a nurse staffing 
waiver, the fact that a facility has been subject to an 
extended or partial extended survey, or the imposition of an 
adverse action, including termination of the provider 
agreement. The enforcement remedies, on the other hand, are 
the consequences of facility noncompliance once deficiencies 
have been identified through the survey process. While the 
disapproval of a NATCEP is automatic when criteria set forth 
in the Act are met, the imposition of remedies is a matter 
requiring some discretion on the part of HCFA or the State. 
It is possible for a facility with a nurse staffing 
waiver to be surveyed and have no deficiencies identified or 
have no deficiencies found which cause the facility to be 
out of compliance. In these cases, an enforcement action 
would not be in order, even though other provisions of the 
Act and regulations would require that a prohibition of a 
NATCEP be imposed. Further, it would be possible for a 
facility with no nurse staffing waiver, which had not been 
subject to an extended or partial extended survey, to have a 
civil money penalty imposed as a remedy for deficiencies 
identified. In this latter case, the civil money penalty is 
the enforcement remedy, and not the prohibition of a NATCEP, 
which is an automatic statutory consequence of the civil 
money penalty being imposed. 
Because we believe that the Act, as well as regulations 
published on September 26, 1991, separately address how the 
State arrives at the disapproval of a NATCEP as opposed to 
how it or HCFA determines that an enforcement action is in 
order, we are not adopting these comments in the final 
regulation. 


Comment: 

One commenter indicated that denial of payment 
for new admissions for certain diagnostic categories is too 
difficult to implement or monitor. Another stated that it 
is too broadly defined and that it was not the intention of 
the Act to modify remedies included in the Act. 





Response: 

The first comment is discussed in detail 
under ``Denial of Payment'' later in this preamble.
Regarding the comment that the Act does not allow for 
modifications of its listed remedies, we point to the 
provisions of the Act at sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 
1919(h)(2)(A), 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C), all of 
which indicate that remedies other than those specified in 
the Act are allowed. 


Comment: 

Two commenters asked that the proposed 
available remedy of denial of payment for new admissions for 
certain diagnostic categories be amended to ensure that it 
not promote discrimination against residents a facility does 
not want to admit. Both indicated that a directed plan of 
correction should be required in these situations, and one 
comment further stated that the directed plan of correction 
should direct the facility on how to regain the capability 
to care for residents with the designated diagnoses. 


Response: 

This issue is discussed in detail under 
``Denial of Payment'' later in this preamble. 


Comment: 

Five commenters indicated that HCFA should 
specify in the regulation the criteria by which the 
Secretary will determine whether a State's alternative or 
additional remedies are as effective in determining 
noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the remedies 
specified in the Act. Other commenters insisted that any 
alternative or additional remedies must be made available 
for public comment before adoption. 


Response: 

We agree that there is a need for uniformity 
in the process which is used to approve State remedies which 
are alternative or additional to those included in the 
regulation. While we will prepare manual instructions that 
will address how these reviews and approvals should be 
processed, we believe such information is not appropriate 
for the text of the regulation itself since it would be 
impossible to contemplate the vast array of alternatives 
that States might propose. The Act does not require and 
HCFA will not require specific public notice procedures that 
limit State prerogatives in the State plan amendment 
process.

Comment: 

One commenter indicated that States should be 
able to develop and implement additional or alternative 
remedies unless HCFA can demonstrate that the States' 
remedies are not as effective as the HCFA remedies. 


Response: 

We cannot adopt this comment. The Act 
provides, at section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii), that the State must 
demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that the 
alternative or additional remedies it proposes are as 
effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting the 
noncompliance as those included in the Act. To shift the 
burden of proof to HCFA would be contrary to the Act's clear 
instruction. 


Comment: 

One commenter indicated that any State 
remedies approved as alternative or additional remedies 
should apply to SNF/NFs as well as NFs, unless HCFA takes a 
different action based on a validation survey. 


Response: 

The determination of whose remedies prevail 
in a dually participating facility is made in accordance 
with section 1919(h)(7) of the Act and codified at  488.452 
of this final rule. 


Comment: 

One commenter indicated that the final rule 
should clarify and refer to the relationship of these rules 
to the sanctions available under section 1128 of the Act and 
to how the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) actions will 
have an impact on enforcement actions taken under this 
regulation. 


Response: 

The provisions of sections 1819(h) and 
1919(h) of the Act, for which HCFA takes action, and the 
provision of section 1128 of the Act, for which the OIG 
takes action, are two independent sources of enforcement 
authority that are triggered by separate considerations. 
Section 1128 of the Act contains mandatory and permissive 
exclusions which are, for the most part, applied in cases of 
individuals and entities who have been charged with or 
convicted of certain types of behavior (such as fraud and 
abuse, and obstruction of investigation) under Federal or 
State law. Section 1128 does not generally apply to cases 
of facility noncompliance, which are covered under sections 
1819 and 1919 of the Act that specify survey and enforcement 
provisions. Section 1128A is cited in sections 1819 and 
1919 to give guidance on the imposition of civil money 
penalties which will be imposed in accordance with common 
statutory provisions by HCFA and OIG for their respective 
purposes. If a case happens to involve both noncompliance 
and fraud, abuse or obstruction of investigation, each 
agency has the authority to take separate action, 
independently of the other. 


Comment: 

Commenters from several States indicated that 
their States had effective remedies that should be adopted 
without change. One commenter stated that HCFA approval of 
alternative or additional remedies should not be required. 


Response: 

The Act gives the States the option of 
requesting that HCFA authorize the adoption of existing 
State remedies. The regulation follows the Act, which 
leaves the decision to request the adoption of these 
remedies up to each State. However, the Act provides that 
HCFA approval is necessary and that the State must bear the 
burden of proof that any alternative or additional remedies 
are as effective as the remedies specified in the Act. 


Comment: 

Several commenters were concerned that the 
State's ability to impose alternative remedies instead of 
termination was impaired by the proposed provision that 
would require the repayment of the Federal share of the 
Medicaid payment (FFP) if the correction of the deficiencies 
was not made in accordance with the approved plan and 
timetable. These commenters said that the regulations 
should allow States to enter into agreements under which the 
facilities would agree to repay States, which would then 
repay the Federal government FFP if compliance was not 
achieved according to the approved plan. 


Response: 

Neither the Act nor the proposed or final 
regulations prevent the States from entering into agreements 
with facilities to repay States if the facility fails to 
adhere to its plan of correction. The Act is silent on this 
issue. Therefore, it follows that the States have the 
option to consider such agreements with facilities. Many 
facilities may find such agreements preferable to 
termination.

Comment: 

One commenter stated that the authority to 
implement alternative or additional remedies should rest 
within the single State agency. 


Response: 

The Act gives the States the authority to 
elect alternative or additional remedies through the use of 
the Medicaid State plan process. Medicaid regulations at 
 431.10 specify that a single State agency administer or 
supervise the administration of the State plan. In most 
States, the Medicaid agency is the single State agency that 
implements the current transitional enforcement remedies 
against Medicaid facilities. In some States, enforcement 
remedies, such as civil money penalties, are implemented by 
the survey agency. We believe that States should retain the 
flexibility to organize their enforcement activity as they 
deem necessary as long as the organizations meet Medicaid 
regulations. 


Comment: 

One commenter believed that every State should 
implement the same penalty system. 


Response: 

We cannot accept this suggestion because the 
Act permits the States to elect alternative or additional 
remedies if they can demonstrate that the alternative or 
additional remedies are as effective as the remedies 
specified by the Act. Further, section 1919(h)(2)(A) of 
the Act provides that the State shall specify criteria, as 
to when and how each remedy is to be applied, the amount of 
any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be 
used in the imposition of such fines. 


Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the final rule 
include a list of remedies other than termination which HCFA 
finds acceptable. 


Response: 

Such a list is provided at  488.406(a) and 
(b). 


Section 488.408 Selection of Remedies


The comments we received on this section, as it was 
proposed, which relate to the factors considered when making 
remedy determinations, have already been included and 
addressed in our discussion of  488.404 of this preamble. 


Comment: 

Some commenters were uncertain about how the 
``determination'' of remedies in  488.404 and the ``choice'' of 
remedies in  488.408 differ. 


Response: 

We are retitling   488.404 and 488.408 to 
``Factors to be considered in selecting remedies'' and to 
``Selection of remedies,'' respectively, and are revising the 
content of both sections as a result of the revision to the 
criteria for selecting among enforcement options as 
discussed earlier in this preamble. After the survey team 
has determined that a deficiency or deficiencies exist, it 
is required to determine the seriousness of the violations. 
The factors that HCFA and the States must and may consider 
in determining the seriousness of a facility's deficiencies 
can be found at  488.404. The optional process of 
determining the most appropriate enforcement action is 
described at  488.408, which correlates the level of 
noncompliance with a required and/or optional category of 
remedies. 


Comment: 

A few commenters wanted HCFA to include a 
statement from the preamble of the proposed rule that 
asserts ``the more pervasive or severe the facility's 
shortcomings, the more severe the penalty.'' 


Response: 

We agree with the commenters, and are 
providing such a linkage in the revised  488.408. 


Comment: 

Some commenters wanted HCFA to explain the 
purpose of intermediate sanctions. 


Response: 

The purpose of an intermediate sanction (or 
alternative remedy) is to motivate providers to achieve and 
maintain substantial compliance before termination becomes 
necessary. Prior to OBRA '87, the term ``intermediate 
sanction'' was limited to a denial of payment for new 
admissions. Sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act specify 
that remedies for noncompliance are to be imposed in lieu 
of, or in addition to, the remedy of termination of a 
facility's participation in the programs. This legislation 
expanded the range of alternative remedies for the Secretary 
and the State to use as an incentive for correction and as a 
way that might avoid termination of the provider agreement. 


Comment: 

A few commenters wanted to revise  488.408 to 
require that HCFA and the State make appropriate remedy 
selections, but not select a specific remedy solely to 
punish the facility. 


Response: 

Alternative remedies are designed to motivate 
providers to comply quickly with the requirements of 
participation. While some providers may view the remedies 
as punishment, our first responsibility is to protect the 
health and safety of the residents. We are interested in 
motivating providers to achieve and maintain compliance 
with health and safety requirements so that they may 
continue to provide quality services to the residents. 
Accordingly, the selection of an enforcement action is based 
on that which is most likely to elicit a prompt response 
from the facility to achieve and maintain compliance before 
termination becomes necessary. We believe the proposed 
change does not significantly add to the process of 
selecting remedies; therefore, we are not incorporating it 
in the final regulation. 


Comment: 

A few commenters wanted a definition of 
``clusters of deficiencies'' included in  488.408, which 
deals with the initial assessment of the seriousness of 
deficiencies. Other commenters wanted instruction on which 
deficiencies are cited as a cluster versus those 
deficiencies cited individually. 


Response: 

We have removed the reference to clusters in 
this final rule because we do not want to limit the 
discretion HCFA and the States have been given by the 
statute to make enforcement decisions. We believe that the 
relationship between and among deficiencies is inherent in 
remedy determinations and should be made on a case-by-case 
basis. While we do not intend to include instructions in 
this final rule on which deficiencies would be treated 
individually and which would be consolidated, we will offer 
examples in the HCFA Regional Office Manual and the State 
Operations Manual of how deficiencies could be grouped 
together. 


Comment: 

We received many general comments about how 
HCFA should be more specific in its guidance on selecting an 
appropriate remedy. This guidance must help determine the 
criteria for the selection of remedies and must require the 
use of specific remedies for particular deficiencies. Some 
of these commenters suggested a scope and severity scale 
linked with specific remedies at specific levels.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

While we agree with the above commenters 
advocating more guidance on the selection of remedies, and 
have developed an enforcement scheme capable of doing just 
that, we are bound by the statutory provisions giving HCFA 
and the States some discretion in designing their own 
schemes within a Federal framework. Therefore, we are 
providing the method by which facility deficiencies, 
including physical environment deficiencies, will be 
measured, and we are linking specific categories of remedies 
with certain levels of noncompliance. We are revising 
 488.408 accordingly. 


Comment: 

Many commenters believe that level 1-1 
deficiencies, now referred to as isolated deficiencies which 
HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with 
a potential for minimal harm, must be cited and a plan of 
correction required. Additionally, these commenters urge 
that every deficiency should be cited before leaving the 
facility. They believe that unless each deficiency is 
cited, important patterns of repeat noncompliance can be 
missed. 


Response: 

We disagree. As we stated in the preamble to 
the proposed rule, providers must be aware that they are 
responsible for complying with all participation 
requirements. Notifying the facility of this level of 
deficiency acknowledges that a problem could potentially 
occur if the deficiency is permitted to go uncorrected. 
While no formal plan of correction is required for this low 
level deficiency and no remedy is applied, correction is 
necessary nevertheless. 
The exit conference focuses primarily on the most 
serious preliminary findings by the surveyors. While the 
survey team documents its observations relative to the 
survey, the surveyors' findings are not official until the 
provider receives the official deficiency statement. 


Comment: 

Many commenters commended HCFA for prohibiting 
facilities from challenging the choice of remedy or 
remedies. These commenters assert that giving the facility 
the right to challenge the existence of deficiencies 
adequately protects their rights. A few commenters agreed 
that the choice of the remedy should not be appealable but 
that the scope and severity of a deficiency should be. 
Other commenters believed providers should be permitted to 
formally appeal both the existence of a deficiency as well 
as challenge determinations of scope and severity and the 
remedy imposed. 


Response: 

The most important issue on which to grant an 
appeal is the existence of deficiencies which lead to a 
remedy. We are requiring that such an appeal before an 
administrative law judge be offered, and that dispute 
resolution procedures be applied first, at the request of 
the provider. 
Providers have the opportunity to appeal certifications 
of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy but, with 
the one exception noted below, do not have the opportunity 
to appeal either the level of noncompliance or the 
enforcement choice made by HCFA or the State. We have 
reached this conclusion for several reasons. First, as a 
general matter, whether HCFA or a State chooses one remedy 
or another to address facility noncompliance is a matter 
that we believe is a prosecutorial prerogative of the 
government, not with the provider of services. It is an 
inherent function of government in this context to make 
choices as to which kind of enforcement action will best 
achieve prompt compliance so that residents face 
noncompliant conditions for as short a time as possible. 
Second, in the case of provider agreement terminations, 
even if a facility were able to successfully contest a 
conclusion that immediate jeopardy exists, the agency could 
still proceed with the termination action since the agency's 
authority to bring such an action is not limited to 
immediate jeopardy cases, but may span all noncompliant 
facility behavior. As has been agency policy for many 
years, the determination of what remedy to seek is beyond 
challenge in light of the government's fundamental necessity 
to protect the welfare of facility residents as 
expeditiously as possible. This is especially the case with 
respect to provider agreement terminations since residents 
may be at considerable risk even where there is no immediate 
jeopardy. 
Third, in the case of most alternative sanctions, the 
regulations are structured so that whether a facility's 
noncompliance falls in category 1 or category 2, HCFA and 
the States have complete discretion to choose from either 
category. Thus, even if a facility were able to 
successfully demonstrate that the agency had erred in its 
conclusion that the noncompliance belonged in category 1, 
that fact would be irrelevant since noncompliance in 
category 1 could still trigger the same remedy. Only a 
showing that the facility was in substantial compliance 
would enable the facility to avoid sanctions, and it is this 
issue that we agree must be subject to challenge. 
Fourth, with respect to the imposition of temporary 
management, a facility facing this remedy would have the 
opportunity to argue during informal dispute resolution that 
the agency had erred in concluding that immediate jeopardy 
existed. Should it succeed in making this showing, the 
remedy would not be imposed. On the other hand, should the 
facility fail to convince agency officials that the 
noncompliance was of a lesser nature, the facility would 
face temporary management well before it could more formally 
challenge the agency finding of immediate jeopardy. Thus, 
even if the facility ultimately prevailed in a hearing in 
proving that its noncompliance posed less than immediate 
jeopardy, the facility's appeal would not be effective since 
the remedy would have already been imposed and the facility 
would either have achieved substantial compliance or been 
terminated by the time of the hearing. 
For this reason, we considered whether, in light of this 
sequence of events, facilities should be given a prior 
hearing in temporary management cases, but concluded that 
would completely undermine the purpose of this remedy which 
is to resolve the most serious noncompliance in the shortest 
possible time frame. This is particularly the case when 
facilities facing such remedies have available to them an 
informal means to contest agency action prior to the 
imposition of the remedy and when, ultimately, it is the 
facility's choice to accept temporary management rather than 
face termination. Accordingly, we concluded that in the 
balancing of interest of facilities and residents in such 
cases, the interests of residents must take precedence.

Only in the case of civil money penalties could we see 
the necessity of allowing facilities the opportunity to 
challenge the level of noncompliance since the amount of 
these penalties hinges upon discrete levels of noncompliance 
rather than noncompliance as a whole. Thus, it may be 
legally significant to a facility facing a $10,000 per day 
civil money penalty to be able to prove that its 
noncompliance belonged in category 2, rather than category 
3, since in category 2 the largest civil money penalty 
available to HCF or a State would be $3,000 per day. 
Accordingly, we are revising the rules to allow a facility 
to challenge the level of noncompliance when a successful 
challenge on this issue would affect the amount of a civil 
money penalty that HCFA or a State could collect. 
We believe that a provider's burden of upsetting survey 
findings relating to the level of noncompliance should be 
high, however. As we indicated in the proposed rule, 
distinctions between different levels of noncompliance, 
whether measured in terms of their frequency or seriousness, 
do not represent mathematical judgments for which there are 
clear or objectively measured boundaries. Identifying 
failures in a facility's obligation to provide the kind of 
high quality care required by the Act and the implementing 
regulations most often reflect judgments that will reflect a 
range of noncompliant behavior. Thus, in civil money 
penalty cases, whether deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy, 
or are widespread and cause actual harm that is not 
immediate jeopardy, or are widespread and have a potential 
for more than minimal harm that is not immediate jeopardy 
does not reflect that a precise point of noncompliance has 
occurred, but rather that a range of noncompliance has 
occurred which may vary from facility to facility. While we 
understand the desire of those who seek the greatest 
possible consistency in survey findings, an objective that 
we share, the answer does not lie in designing yardsticks of 
compliance that can be reduced to rigid and objectively 
calculated numbers. Survey team members and their 
supervisors ought to have some degree of flexibility, and 
deference, in applying their expertise in working with these 
less than perfectly precise concepts. For these reasons, we 
have revised the regulations to require an administrative 
law judge or appellate administrative review authority to 
uphold State or HCFA findings on the seriousness of facility 
deficiencies in civil money penalty cases unless they are 
clearly erroneous. 


Comment: 

A few commenters believe it is not sufficient 
to simply state that the choice of a remedy is not 
appealable and recommend that the regulation explicitly 
state that HCFA will not look behind or ``second guess'' the 
State's selection of remedy or remedies. 


Response: 

We cannot accept these comments as sections 
1919(h)(6) and (7) of the Act specify the means to resolve 
any disagreement between the State and the Secretary 
regarding noncompliance or enforcement action. 


Comment:

 Some commenters wanted sanctions imposed upon 
the facility for interfering with the survey team, monitor 
or temporary manager. 


Response:

 Section 1128(b)(12) of the Act permits the 
Secretary to exclude SNFs from Medicare and to direct that 
NFs be excluded from Medicaid for failure to grant access to 
the applicable survey agencies performing survey and 
certification functions in accordance with sections 1864(a) 
and 1902(a)(33)(B) of the Act. Failure to grant access can 
certainly be regarded as interference with the activities of 
State agency personnel. However, interference with the 
temporary manager is different. Sections 488.410 and 
488.438 specify that if the facility does not agree to the 
conditions under which the temporary manager is imposed, the 
facility may refuse to relinquish control to the temporary 
manager, and, in so doing, opt for termination. 


Comment:

 One commenter wanted HCFA to include a ``sole 
community provider exception'' to allow States to oversee the 
operations of noncompliant facilities with uncorrected 
deficiencies in rural areas, where the closure would result 
in hardship to the residents and the community. 


Response:

 States have the authority to oversee (appoint 
a State monitor) any noncompliant facility, regardless of 
the location. However, if the commenter wants a provider in 
a rural area to be exempted from correcting deficiencies, we 
do not have the authority to grant such an exception. 
Waiver authority requirements are provided at  483.70 and 
at  483.30(c) and (d), relative to the Physical Environment 
and Nursing Services participation requirements, 
respectively, and then only when specified conditions are 
met.

Section 488.410 Action When There Is Immediate Jeopardy 



In conducting our review of the provisions of the regulation for conformance with the Act, we noted that the Act uses
``immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety'' to describe those situations in which immediate corrections
must be achieved and immediate enforcement action must ensue, while the text of the proposed rule refers to such situations
as ``immediate and serious threat.'' We have attempted to modify the terminology used in the final regulation to consistently
reflect the language of the Act. 



Comment: 

Many commenters stated that the 23-day timeframe for termination is not included in the Act, that it is too short and
that it does not allow adequate time for corrections. Some suggested that other timeframes, such as 45 days or 90 days,
be used, while others indicated that the 23-day clock should not start until the facility has been given a chance to
undertake corrections. 



Response:

 While the 23-day timeframe is not specified in the Act, HCFA has for many years used a 23-day timeframe for addressing
immediate jeopardy situations encountered in other provider and supplier types. In fact, the enforcement procedures
which were in effect for long term care facilities prior to the implementation of OBRA '87 provisions called for processing
termination actions within 23 calendar days when immediate and serious threat to patient health or safety was documented.
In these cases, if the immediate and serious threat was resolved before the end of the 23 calendar days, the termination
action was lifted entirely, or if the threat was removed but other serious deficiencies remained, the termination
date was extended to allow the facility additional time to correct the remaining deficiencies. 

Our experience in processing noncompliance actions against other facilities and against long term care facilities
(both before and after OBRA '87 implementation) whose deficiencies constitute immediate jeopardy indicates that
23 calendar days is a reasonable amount of time for proper notice to the facility and to the public, as may be required.
Further, it provides the facility sufficient time to react to the immediate jeopardy without unnecessarily lengthening
the amount of time the facility's residents are at risk because of the situation or situations which constitute the
immediate jeopardy. 

While we appreciate the concerns expressed by the commenters, we are not amending the 23-day timeframe in the final
regulation. 



Comment:

 Another group of commenters believed that the 23-day timeframe is too long and that, for facilities in which immediate
jeopardy is identified, the requirement should be that corrections be initiated immediately. 



Response: 

The 23-day timeframe is not the amount of time the facility has to begin making corrections. Rather, it is the maximum
amount of time available to the facility to resolve the immediate jeopardy. It begins on the last day of the survey.
A facility is ordinarily advised of the existence of immediate jeopardy at the conclusion of the survey which identified
the immediate jeopardy. Most facilities in this situation that want to remain in the Medicare or Medicaid program
will begin to make corrections immediately. Even for those that do not begin making corrections on their own, some
time must be allowed for provision of proper notices, as required by regulation, and/or the appointment of temporary
management. In consideration of these factors and the fact that it is also possible for the enforcement process to
be completed in less than 23 calendar days, we are not adopting these comments in the final regulation. 



Comment: 

Some commenters asked that the regulation be amended to clarify that 23 calendar days is the maximum amount of time
which a facility will be given to resolve a finding of immediate jeopardy, whether or not temporary management is utilized.
One commenter said that the facility should be given an additional 23 days beyond the termination date during which
a temporary manager would be utilized to attempt to achieve compliance. 



Response:

 We have accepted the first comment. We agree that 23 calendar days is the maximum time allowed for a facility with immediate
jeopardy to resolve the jeopardy. It is not possible for a facility to first be given 23 calendar days to correct deficiencies
pending termination followed by another period of time during which temporary management is utilized in an attempt
to regain compliance. 



Comment: 

Some commenters cited the 23-day timeframe as a disincentive for the use of temporary management as an alternative
remedy. 



Response:

 We do not believe that use of the 23-day timeframe is a disincentive for use of temporary management based on the seriousness
of deficiencies identified at this level as well as the need to take immediate corrective action. 



Comment:

 A number of commenters indicated that the facility should not be given the opportunity to refuse temporary management.




Response: 

As noted in the comments and responses for  488.415, facilities will not be offered a formal choice of whether
to accept or refuse temporary management. When HCFA or a State chooses to implement this remedy, a temporary manager
will be installed unless the facility refuses to relinquish control to the temporary manager, in which case, immediate
termination will be sought. 



Comment: 

A few comments indicated that there should be an immediate ban on admissions to the facility, large civil money penalties
and/or immediate assignment of a State monitor for these cases.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response: 

While the Act does not allow for bans on all 
admissions under these or any other circumstances, it is 
possible for the State or HCFA to impose State monitoring as 
an additional remedy. While large civil money penalties are 
also allowed, they may not be as likely to result in 
immediate corrections, since they may not be collected until 
the facility has the opportunity for a hearing. 


Comment: 

Several commenters believed that the 
regulation as proposed does not promote the use of 
alternative remedies in situations involving immediate 
jeopardy and argued that this approach does not follow the 
spirit of OBRA '87. 


Response: 

The Act makes a clear distinction between how 
cases involving immediate jeopardy will be handled as 
opposed to how all other cases will be handled. The Act 
requires immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct 
the deficiencies through the use of temporary management or 
termination, or both. While it allows for the use of other 
remedies which are in addition to temporary management or 
termination, it is clear that the penalty for a facility 
with noncompliance which constitutes immediate jeopardy is 
intended to be swift and severe. The regulation reflects 
the intent of the Act; therefore, the use of alternative 
remedies in addition to temporary management is allowed but 
not stressed for immediate jeopardy situations. 


Comment: 

Several commenters asked for a better 
definition of immediate and serious threat. Others 
indicated that the scope and severity scale, as issued for 
comment in the proposed rule, would lead to many more 
instances of immediate jeopardy than are now being 
identified. 


Response: 

In response to the many comments received 
regarding the proposed scope and severity scale, we are 
amending the definition of immediate jeopardy in the final 
regulation (see  488.301). In making decisions on the 
existence of immediate jeopardy, HCFA and the States will 
continue to refer to the traditional guidance on this 
subject which is contained in Appendix Q of the State 
Operations Manual. 


Comment: 

One commenter pointed out that the proposed 
regulation does not address who will prevail (HCFA or the 
State) about whether or not immediate jeopardy exists in a 
facility, and asked for clarification. 


Response: 

HCFA always has the option of reviewing the 
State's compliance determination and making its own decision 
based on the survey agency's survey findings. It is not 
necessary for HCFA to conduct its own survey of a facility 
in order to make a decision as to whether immediate jeopardy 
does or does not exist. Whether HCFA's decision is based on 
its own survey or on a review of the State's findings, the 
decision as to whether or not immediate jeopardy exists is 
made pursuant to section 1919(h)(5) of the Act. 
Specifically, the determination of immediate jeopardy, 
whether it is the survey agency's or the Secretary's, will 
prevail. 


Comment: 

One commenter asked that the facility and not 
the State be responsible for notifying attending physicians 
and licensure boards, as outlined in   488.410(e) and 
488.325(h). 


Response: 

As indicated in sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 
1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act, Disclosure of Results of 
Inspections and Activities, the responsibility for this 
notification lies with the State; it may not be redelegated 
to the facility. 


Comment: 

One commenter asked that we clarify 
 488.410(e) to indicate that the notice should go to the 
licensing authority of the nursing home administrator. 


Response:

 We agree, and this comment is reflected in 
the final regulation. 


Comment: 

Two commenters asked that the text of 
 488.410(c)(2)(i) be amended to indicate that the use of 
temporary management is for the purpose of correcting the 
deficiencies that resulted in a finding of immediate 
jeopardy. 


Response: 

We are not adopting these comments, as we 
believe they would provide for a more narrow interpretation 
than the Act specifies at sections 1819(h)(4) and 
1919(h)(5). These sections state that the appointment of a 
temporary manager shall be for the purpose of removing the 
jeopardy and correcting the deficiencies. Further, as 
indicated in the comments and responses for  488.415, 
temporary management will be removed when the facility is 
terminated, or when HCFA or the survey agency has determined 
that the facility is in substantial compliance and has the 
management capability to ensure continued substantial 
compliance with all requirements. Consistent with sections 
1819(h)(2), 1919(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act, temporary 
management would not necessarily end as soon as deficiencies 
causing the immediate jeopardy have been corrected. 


Comment: 

Four commenters indicated that HCFA should 
adopt a procedure utilized in Louisiana, whereby a facility 
may request sanctions other than a temporary manager and the 
request may be granted if the State determines that an 
adequate plan to correct has been devised by the facility 
and the State can monitor the implementation of the 
facility's plan. 


Response: 

As presented, this procedure does not appear 
to meet the requirements of the Act which call for immediate 
action to remove the immediate jeopardy through termination 
or appointment of temporary management, or both. It would 
appear that the proposed procedure would allow something 
similar to a directed plan of correction and State 
monitoring to replace termination or temporary management as 
the remedies for immediate jeopardy cases. Such a policy 
would constitute a violation of the Act. 


Section 488.412 Action When There Is No Immediate Jeopardy 




Comment:

 Many commenters said that the requirement for 
the State or the facility to repay funds received from the 
Federal government if corrective action was not taken in 
accordance with the approved plan of correction conflicts 
with HCFA's intent to promote the use of alternative 
remedies. 


Response:

 Comments regarding the State and facility 
repayment provision of  488.412(a) will be answered in our 
discussion of proposed  488.232 (redesignated as  488.450, 
Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies). 


Comment: 

Several commenters objected to the requirement 
that a denial of payment for new admissions be imposed if 
any deficiency remains uncorrected 90 days after the survey. 
They believed that it is illogical to cut off funds after 90 
days because the funds might be needed to make the 
corrections. Other commenters said that the regulations 
should allow continued participation with substantial 
compliance because the 100 percent compliance is impossible 
to achieve. Still other commenters made the following 
points: 
 Major physical environment deficiencies may take longer 
than 90 days to correct; 
 The regulations should permit an appeal of the decision 
to deny payments for new admissions;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 It is unclear whether mailing time is included in the 90 days and whether an appeal stops the action; and 

 It is unclear whether there is notice to the public regarding the remedy at the 90th day. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(2)(D) and 1919(h)(2)(C) of the Act stipulate that the Secretary or the State, respectively, must
impose a denial of payment for new admissions if the facility is not in compliance 3 months after the date that the facility
was noncompliant, regardless of the requirement that is deficient. In answer to the commenter who raised the issue
of substantial compliance, we are revising  488.412(c) to require a mandatory denial of payment for new admissions
when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months after the last day of the survey. Therefore, if a facility
is in substantial compliance, it would not be subject to the mandatory denial of payment for new admissions remedy,
or the denial of payment remedy would be lifted if it had already been imposed. Substantial compliance is discussed
in detail earlier in this preamble. The fact that physical environment deficiencies may take longer to correct than
others is an example of facility noncompliance which may not be wholly corrected after the completion of the 6-month
continuation of payment period, but which could be considered substantial compliance if corrective action had progressed
in accordance with the approved corrective action plan and timetable. With respect to the other points raised by the
commenters,  488.330(e) (3) and (4) specify that a facility may appeal the certification of noncompliance
leading to the denial of payment remedy;  488.330, paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2)(ii) specify that, except
for civil money penalties, a pending appeal will not stop the action. Mailing time is included within the 3 months because
the 3 months constitutes a statutory limit. There are neither statutory nor regulatory public notice requirements
with regard to the denial of payment remedy. 



Comment: 

A great many individuals and organizations commented upon the requirement at proposed  488.212(b) which specifies
that, although deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 are considered deficiencies, remedies or plans of
correction are not required as long as corrections are achieved by the 90th day. Commenters' views varied widely as
illustrated by the following_ 

 There should be no deficiency if the scope and severity level is 1; 

 If no plan of correction is required there is no apparent reason for requiring correction in 90 days; 

 A follow-up visit should not be required if the scope and severity level is 1; 

 If deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 are to be treated differently than other deficiencies,
then a new term should be used for them, such as findings; 

 Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should be given to the facility on a separate document and not
be disclosable to the public; 

 Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should receive a plan of correction and be disclosable to the
public; 

 Deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 should not receive either a plan of correction or a remedy if
substantial compliance is achieved; 

 There is no such thing as an isolated problem. Excusing certain deficiencies as inconsequential sets a disturbing
precedent for the health care industry; 

 All deficiencies must be corrected; 

 No deficiency should be found unless there is a quality of care issue; 

 There doesn't appear to be a way for HCFA to track deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 without a follow-up
visit; 

 HCFA should clarify when a citation becomes a ``repeat deficiency.'' Remedies should be imposed in cases of
repeated noncompliance only after a facility is found, after three standard surveys, to have furnished substandard
care; 

 A recurrence of a deficiency with a scope and severity level of 1 should be upgraded to a scope and severity level
of 2; 

 The regulation at proposed  488.212(b)(3) should specify continued noncompliance rather than recurrence;


 The regulation at proposed  488.212(b)(1) should read ``both the severity level and the scope level
are 2'' rather than 1; 

 The regulation at proposed  488.212(b)(3) should impose a civil monetary penalty and one or more other
remedies; 

 HCFA should provide guidelines regarding what is an acceptable plan of correction; 

 If a deficiency with a scope and severity level of 1 recurs, HCFA or the State should impose a directed plan of
correction or State monitoring; and 

 The lack of appeal rights on recurring deficiencies with a scope and severity level of 1 will put the State at
risk of increased informal administrative hearings, because of the requirement that remedies be imposed. 



Response: 

The issue of deficiencies at a severity and scope level of 1 are discussed under  488.408 of this preamble. 

We are retaining the definition of deficiency at  488.301. A deficiency is failure to meet a participation requirement.
All deficiencies, with the exception of those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute
no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, will be displayed on the HCFA-2567, Statement of Deficiencies
and Plan of Correction, and will require a plan of correction to be tracked by the State survey agency. All deficiencies,
including those isolated deficiencies that HCFA or the State determines constitute no actual harm with a potential
for minimal harm, will be disclosable to the public. However, these low level deficiencies will not be recorded on
the HCFA-2567 and will not precipitate any enforcement action. We conclude that this approach is reasonable
and practical from both the provider's and the consumer's perspective. To react to low level deficiencies with the
same degree of concern as to those that are more serious is not rational. We believe that providers and consumers will
agree that deficiencies which constitute no actual harm with no more than a potential for minimal harm, and which bear
no relationship to poor care or negative resident outcomes should not detract from actionable noncompliance. 



Comment: 

Many commenters suggested modifications to the use of the scope and severity scales for selection of remedies at proposed
 488.412(c). The following comments and suggestions were made: 

 Proposed paragraph (c)(3), (now paragraph (b)(3)), should read ``If HCFA or the State determines the existence
of substandard care, the State must notify * * *''; 

 Expand proposed paragraph (c)(3), to include deficiencies in quality of life, nurse staffing, and resident
behavior and facility practices;

 For deficiencies with a severity level of 2, civil money penalties should be required using scope and severity
to determine the size of the fine and other remedies should be applied according to  488.408; 

 Provision should be made for remedies for deficiencies not in the area of quality of care with a severity level
of 2 and scope level of 3 or 4; 

 A variety of specific schemes were proposed for correlating each of the scope and severity levels to specific
types of remedies; and 

 Non-life threatening deficiencies should be exempted from remedies and fines. 



Response: 

As noted earlier, we addressed these issues under  488.408 of this preamble. Also, in response to the many comments
we received advocating a clearer correlation between levels of noncompliance and types of remedies imposed, we are
making extensive revisions to the scope and severity grid published in the proposed rule. We are, in fact, correlating
categories of remedies to various categories of noncompliance. A revised grid appears below. 

















Section 488.414 Action When There Is Repeated Substandard Quality of Care 



While analyzing the comments for this section, we again reviewed the provisions of the Act to ensure conformance in
the final regulation. Through this process, we noted that this section does not address the portions of the statutory
provisions at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act that specify that the denial of payment and monitoring
must continue until the facility has demonstrated that it is in compliance and that it will remain in compliance. Accordingly,
we are modifying this provision to specify that the mandatory denial of payment and State monitoring imposed for the
finding of substandard quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys must continue until the facility has
demonstrated that it has achieved substantial compliance and can maintain substantial compliance over the period
of time specified by HCFA or the State. 

We further noted that the remedy described in section 1819(h)(2)(B)(i) of the Act can be either denial of payment for
all Medicare residents or denial of payment for all new Medicare admissions in a facility. In recognition of this fact,
the regulation is being amended to reflect this distinction. 

Finally, because the provisions of the Act were in effect prior to the effective date of this regulation, we have had
actual experience processing enforcement actions for facilities with substandard quality of care noted in three
consecutive standard surveys. Our experience pointed out the need for further clarification in this section in two
respects. One of these related to the handling of actions against facilities whose type of program participation
changed during the period of time spanned by the three consecutive standard surveys, and the other related to whether
remedies could be avoided through an allegation of compliance or actual corrections which followed the finding that
there had been repeated substandard quality of care.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00159 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In reviewing actual cases, we concluded that the 
determination of repeat substandard quality of care in a 
certified facility should be made without regard to the type 
of program participation involved; that is, any standard 
surveys conducted in the facility for Medicare, Medicaid or 
both should be considered. Since the survey process is the 
same for both Medicare and Medicaid participating 
facilities, there is no reason to consider the facility's 
type of program participation in the determination of 
whether repeated substandard quality of care has occurred. 
These issues are being clarified in  488.414. 
We also concluded that sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 
1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act indicate statutory intent that 
specific remedies be imposed any time substandard quality of 
care is repeatedly noted. Further, the Congress 
specifically provided the authority for continuation of 
these remedies after compliance has been achieved. The 
Congress' specific description of how this type of 
noncompliance must be dealt with clearly sets it apart from 
the handling of other cases. Therefore, we have concluded 
that a facility's allegation of compliance or actual 
attainment of compliance following the third consecutive 
standard survey which found substandard quality of care will 
not stop the imposition of the denial of payment or State 
monitoring. The remedy may be lifted when the facility has 
demonstrated its ability to maintain substantial compliance 
to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State. This point is 
also being clarified in this section of the regulation. 


Comment:

 A number of commenters asked for a clearer 
definition of ``substandard care.'' Some asked whether 
substandard care and substandard quality of care are one and 
the same. Others pointed out that sections 1819(h)(2)(E) 
and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act specify that action is to be 
taken based on the provision of substandard quality of care. 


Response:

 We are changing the regulation to match the 
Act and indicate that this provision will apply when 
substandard quality of care is identified. For the purpose 
of this provision, substandard quality of care is defined in 
 488.301. 


Comment:

 Several commenters requested that the word 
``standard'' be inserted between ``consecutive'' and ``surveys.'' 
They pointed out that the proposed regulation does not match 
the wording of the Act at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 
1919(h)(2)(D), both of which specify that the substandard 
quality of care must be identified in three consecutive 
standard surveys. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters. We are 
amending this section to indicate that the repeated 
substandard quality of care must have been noted through 
three consecutive standard surveys. Standard surveys are 
those described in  488.305. 


Comment:

 Four commenters asked for a clearer 
definition of repeated noncompliance. Two commenters 
indicated that repeat noncompliance should be defined as 
actual repeats of the same problem and the content of the 
deficiency and not just a repeat of a deficiency at the same 
tag number. 


Response:

 Sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of 
the Act clearly indicate that action must be taken when 
repeat noncompliance in the form of substandard quality of 
care is identified. The Act does not narrow the scope to 
specify that the basis for finding substandard quality of 
care in a facility must be identical from one standard 
survey to the next or for all three of the consecutive 
standard surveys considered in making the determination that 
repeated substandard quality of care has occurred. 
Accordingly, we do not believe that the regulation should 
more narrowly define what constitutes substandard quality of 
care for the purpose of this provision. 
The regulation is being modified to clarify that action 
must be taken any time any deficiencies which constitute 
substandard quality of care are identified in the last three 
consecutive standard surveys. This provision will be 
applied solely on the basis of the repeated finding of 
substandard quality of care, and no attempt will be made to 
determine whether the substance of the noncompliance or the 
exact tag numbers for deficiencies which constitute 
noncompliance were repeated.

Comment:

 One commenter stated that a facility's 
performance on surveys which were conducted prior to the 
effective date of this regulation should be counted in the 
determination of whether there is repeated noncompliance. 


Response:

 We agree with this comment. The survey 
process specified in the OBRA '87 provisions was effective 
for all surveys conducted on or after October 1, 1990. Even 
though the implementation of the corresponding enforcement 
provisions was not concurrent, any standard survey completed 
on or after October 1, 1990 must be considered in the 
determination of whether there is repeated noncompliance 
that resulted in substandard quality of care. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that to be consistent 
with the intent of the Act to have facilities maintain 
compliance, regulations should require that facilities 
maintain compliance with the deficient requirement after 
correction. The commenter recommended requiring termination 
if a facility corrects the deficiency, but then falls out of 
compliance with the same requirement during the same 
correction period. 


Response:

 The Act provides that when a facility has 
had findings of substandard quality of care on three 
consecutive standard surveys, the Secretary or the State 
must impose a denial of payment and a State monitor. In 
addition, sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D) of the 
Act require that the denial of payment for new admissions 
and State monitor remedies must remain in force until the 
facility not only achieves substantial compliance but 
demonstrates that it can maintain substantial compliance. 
As we have explained earlier, substantial compliance 
constitutes compliance for the purpose of imposing or 
lifting a remedy, as well as issuing a certification of 
compliance. 
We do not foresee the situation described by the 
commenter as a problem. If a facility has corrected a 
deficiency, or is at least considered to be in substantial 
compliance, any remedy(ies) in effect would be lifted as 
well as compliance certified. We would not normally revisit 
a facility after compliance has been certified unless there 
is a complaint or some other impetus. If, at some later 
date after compliance has been certified, the facility is 
found to have a recurrence of the same deficiency that 
causes the facility to be out of substantial compliance, 
either a new continuation of payment period would begin, or 
termination (or cessation of FFP payments) would occur, 
depending on the seriousness of the noncompliance. However, 
any termination would be based on the fact that the facility 
was not in substantial compliance with sections 1819 (b), 
(c), and (d) and 1919 (b), (c), and (d) of the Act by the end 
of the correction period, and not on the fact that the 
noncompliance was repeated. We have not adopted the 
commenter's suggestion to terminate a facility solely on the 
basis of repeated noncompliance. 



Section 488.415 Temporary Management 





Comment:

 One commenter asked that we clarify the term 
``disciplinary action'' and state that the temporary manager 
must not have been found guilty of misconduct by any 
licensing board or professional society, and another 
commenter recommended that HCFA maintain a national registry 
of nursing home administrator disciplinary actions. 


Response:

 To avoid confusion surrounding the 
interpretation of ``disciplinary action,'' we will not use the 
term in the requirement at  488.415(b)(2) as we did in 
 488.215(b)(3) of the proposed rule. Instead, we are 
structuring the provision to read that the temporary manager 
must ``not have been found guilty of misconduct by any 
licensing board or professional society in any State.'' We 
agree that it may be beneficial to have a misconduct 
registry for nursing home administrators, and we intend to 
examine the feasibility of developing one. 


Comment:

 Many commenters recommended that we include 
requirements that the temporary manager must have had no 
adverse ties to the problem facility, and must not have been 
fired from the facility in the past. Another commenter 
proposed that we include a requirement that the temporary 
manager have had no business or professional relationship 
with the facility for a minimum of 3 years prior to his or 
her appointment to operate the facility. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters that the 
individual chosen to be temporary manager must not have been 
recently employed by the facility to be managed. We believe 
that an individual's previous employment relationship with a 
facility could positively or negatively prejudice that 
individual in his or her present dealings with the facility. 
Therefore, we are incorporating into the regulation, at 
 488.415(b)(4), a requirement that the temporary manager 
must not currently serve, or, within the past 2 years, have 
served as a member of the staff of the noncompliant 
facility. This requirement is similar to the requirement 
for surveyors, which we believe is appropriate, since 
effective evaluation is a necessary tool of both surveyors 
and temporary managers and requires their objectivity.

Comment: 

One commenter asked how prior competency will be judged. Various commenters suggested that prior competency be defined
by a minimum of one year of continuous experience as administrator of a long term care facility, by demonstrated expertise
and experience in the operation of a nursing facility similar to the one the temporary manager is needed to manage,
or by demonstrated experience in temporary management. Another commenter suggested that a measure of competency
be whether the temporary manager served within the past 10 years as the administrator of a facility which furnished
substandard quality of care. 



Response: 

As explained below, we are no longer requiring that the temporary manager be a licensed nursing home administrator
or demonstrate prior competency as one. Because the skills and experience a temporary manager must have to correct
deficiencies will vary on a case by case basis, HCFA and the State need to have the flexibility to appoint whoever is
most suitable without the constraints of overly prescriptive eligibility requirements.

When it happens that an individual interested in becoming a temporary manager is or has been a nursing home administrator,
the compliance histories of the facilities managed by him or her will be reviewed. We will provide in manual instructions
that there be such a review because we agree with the commenter that it would be inappropriate to appoint as a temporary
manager an administrator who has had difficulty maintaining facility compliance in the past. 



Comment: 

A number of commenters believed that the temporary manager should not be a current competitor of the facility, have
ownership interest in a competitor, or have been recently employed by a competitor. Commenters were concerned that
these individuals would gain an unfair competitive advantage if appointed temporary manager. 



Response: 

We appreciate this concern, and we and the State will attempt to select temporary managers who are not affiliated with
competitors of the facilities to be managed when the pool of temporary manager candidates allows. However, the purpose
of imposing temporary management or any other remedy is to achieve and maintain substantial compliance with Federal
requirements. When the only temporary manager candidate likely to accomplish this goal is affiliated with a competitor
of the problem facility, HCFA and the State will necessarily consider that affiliation to be subordinate to the administrator's
competency. If the facility feels more threatened by compromised competitiveness than it does by termination of
its provider agreement, it has the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager selected by HCFA
or the State, and subject itself to the possibility of termination instead. 



Comment: 

One commenter was concerned that persons interested in acquiring a financial interest in a facility would be motivated
to serve as that facility's temporary manager in order to gain a competitive edge in later negotiations. The commenter
asked that we prevent this possibility by precluding through contract with the temporary manager the purchase or
other acquisition of the facility for a fixed period of time after completion of the temporary manager's responsibilities.




Response: 

We do not have the authority to restrict a temporary manager's future business activities. If the facility to be managed
has reason to believe that the temporary manager chosen by HCFA or the State would use the financial information he
or she would acquire in the facility to the facility's disadvantage, the facility may raise this concern to HCFA or
the State, and HCFA or the State may attempt to locate a temporary manager that is more acceptable to the facility. Should
a temporary manager acceptable to the facility not be located, the facility may exercise its right to refuse to relinquish
control to the temporary manager and face termination of its provider agreement. 



Comment: 

One commenter proposed that the temporary manager should neither have been an employee of, nor have been associated
with an employee of HCFA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any State licensing or survey agency. 



Response: 

We do not believe that a past affiliation with the aforementioned organizations would reduce a temporary manager's
objectivity or effectiveness in any way. On the contrary, it is likely that the temporary manager would be more knowledgeable
about Medicare and Medicaid participation requirements after having had exposure to the agencies that set and enforce
the Medicare and Medicaid requirements, and we expect that the facility at which the temporary manager is imposed
would benefit from this knowledge. 



Comment: 

A couple of commenters believed that the State must compile and update a list of people or organizations that meet the
qualifications of temporary manager, and they asked that this list be available for public inspection. Another commenter
proposed that the State or HCFA maintain a list of substantiated complaints or allegations concerning the performance
of temporary managers.

Response: 

We will not require that States catalogue complaints made against temporary managers, but will allow them to process
complaint information in the way that they determine is most effective. Neither will we require the States to compile,
update, and release a list of those qualified to be temporary managers. Because we have no authority to require the
release of individuals' qualifications or other assignments, a list of temporary managers would contain no criteria
by which facilities would be able to evaluate the candidates, and would be of little value. Moreover, HCFA and the State
are not obligated to seek facility approval of temporary managers. It is neither the facility's responsibility nor
right to select a temporary manager. (See additional response below.) 



Comment: 

A few commenters recommended that we allow a State or a team of people to qualify as a temporary manager. They believed
that nursing guidance and expertise would be needed in addition to administrative supervision in order to remedy
serious deficiencies. 



Response: 

Because a temporary manager has the authority to hire additional staff, it is possible for him or her to assemble what
would be in essence a temporary management team. When the temporary manager determines that successful correction
of a facility's deficiencies requires knowledge and skills in addition to his or her own, he or she may engage the specialists
necessary. 


We have no statutory authority to require State survey agencies to make their staff available to function as temporary
managers. Their role involves survey, certification, and monitoring, rather than the management (albeit temporary)
of nursing homes. 



Comment: 

Several commenters asked that facilities be able to participate in the selection of the temporary manager. One recommended
that the governing board of the facility be responsible for placing the temporary manager at the facility, and others
requested that facilities be able to object to a particular temporary manager once selected by HCFA or the State. 



Response: 

The choice of a temporary manager will be made either by the State or by HCFA and will be based on the recommendation of
the State survey agency. The State survey agency's geographic proximity to the providers it surveys and its knowledge
of available and competent managers in the area place it in the best position to recommend a temporary manager. Because
facilities have the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager, no facility will be forced to submit
to a temporary manager that it objects to, and it may decide to subject itself to the possibility of termination instead.




Comment: 

Certain commenters were concerned that the qualifications for a temporary manager will be hard to meet. A few commenters
suggested that HCFA and the State be given latitude to appoint as temporary manager any qualified person, such as a
registered nurse with nursing home experience, instead of having to appoint a licensed nursing home administrator.




Response: 

We agree that a nursing home administrator's license is not the only valid indicator of an individual's fitness to
serve as temporary manager. Certain combinations of educational and vocational achievement may also signify administrative
competency. We are, therefore, amending paragraph (b)(1) and deleting paragraph (b)(2) of  488.215 as they
appeared in the proposed rule to allow an individual who does not hold a nursing home administrator's license to serve
as temporary manager if the State determines that he or she is qualified to oversee correction of deficiencies on the
basis of experience and education. Because this change should expand the pool of qualified temporary manager candidates,
it should reduce the number of terminations caused by inability to locate a temporary manager, a clear benefit to both
providers and residents. 



Comment: 

One commenter believed that the State should be required to conduct an orientation session for people on the list of
qualified temporary managers. That session would cover topics such as situations warranting the appointment of
a temporary manager, and the responsibilities and authority of a temporary manager.

Response:

 We agree that a temporary manager would not 
be able to do his or her job effectively without being 
oriented to the task, and will direct the State survey 
agencies in our State Operations Manual to provide an 
orientation, the form of which shall be determined by them. 



Comment:

 Many commenters requested that we impose an 
enforceable limit on the salary of the temporary manager, 
and a large number of those recommended that we use the 
prevailing salary limit set forth in the preamble to the 
NPRM. Other commenters proposed that we require 
compensation for the temporary manager to be set at a rate 
sufficient to attract people with the necessary 
qualifications, and they recommended that we not limit the 
salary of the temporary manager to the rate mentioned in the 
preamble. These commenters were concerned that it would be 
unlikely to draw the expertise needed. 
A few commenters requested that we identify who will 
determine the salary of the temporary manager, and certain 
of those asked whether it will be negotiable. Another 
commenter asked if the facility will be obligated to provide 
benefits to the temporary manager. 



Response:

 After reviewing the comments we received, 
we have concluded that the salary limit put forth in the 
preamble to the proposed rule would not be in the best 
interests of facilities or their residents because it would 
make it difficult to attract qualified temporary managers. 
The temporary managers that are available are sometimes 
located long distances from the facilities which need them, 
and unless the salary offered is sufficiently attractive, it 
will not induce individuals to temporarily upset their 
normal routines and accept the challenge of managing a 
severely deficient facility. If temporary managers cannot 
be secured, we will have no choice but to proceed with 
termination. In order to avoid this result and promote the 
use of temporary management as an alternative remedy, we 
will give facilities the flexibility to exceed the salary 
floor specified below if the State is otherwise unable to 
attract a qualified temporary manager and the facility 
considers a higher payment preferable to termination. The 
salary of the temporary manager must be at least equivalent 
to the prevailing salary paid by providers in the facility's 
geographic area for positions of this type, plus the 
prevailing cost of certain additional allowances. The 
additional allowances will include costs that would have 
reasonably been incurred by the provider if the temporary 
manager had been in an employment relationship, such as the 
cost of a benefits package, prorated for the amount of time 
the temporary manager is working in the facility. The 
facility will also be responsible for any other costs 
incurred by the temporary manager in furnishing services 
under such an arrangement or as otherwise set by the State. 
Because the State is in a better position than HCFA to 
determine the prevailing salary and other employment related 
costs of a nursing home administrator within what the State 
considers to be the facility's geographic area, it will be 
responsible for setting the salary/benefits floor of the 
temporary manager and for determining whether or not it is 
necessary to exceed it. The State may consult with a 
provider while it determines the appropriate salary, but we 
will not require that the salary of the temporary manager be 
negotiable. 



Comment:

 One commenter asked what would happen if a 
facility agreed to temporary management, but then failed to 
pay the salary. 



Response:

 We are considering requiring that facilities 
pay the salary of the temporary manager before the remedy 
begins, which would eliminate the need for a recoupment 
strategy. Until a decision is made, the mechanism that is 
currently used to recover Medicare and Medicaid funds from 
facilities which have been overpaid will be used to collect 
money from any facilities that owe the salary of the 
temporary manager. The amount owed would be withheld from 
future amounts due to the facility from HCFA or the State. 
Because Medicare and Medicaid payments may continue for up 
to 30 days after termination, salaries may be recouped even 
when they are owed by terminated facilities. 



Comment:

 A large number of commenters disagreed with 
the provision that the temporary manager's salary be paid by 
the facility. A few commenters stated that the money spent 
on temporary management would be better spent by the 
facility on its own improvements. Certain commenters 
complained that a lack of sufficient funds is often what 
leads to noncompliance, and so they were concerned that this 
remedy would be worthless without additional funding. A 
number of commenters argued that a facility's inability to 
pay for temporary management should not preclude its use as 
a remedy. 
Many commenters recommended that the temporary 
manager's salary be paid out of a fund composed of civil 
money penalties collected by the State, and certain 
commenters cited 42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(2)(A)(ii) (section 
1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act) as establishing the authority 
to do so. Other commenters believed that States should be 
required to use funds collected through imposition of civil 
money penalties to cover the costs of correcting 
deficiencies incurred by the temporary manager, but only if 
the facility cannot afford to pay these costs itself. 
Certain commenters believed that the facility and its 
operators should be liable to the fund for reimbursement of 
expenses. One commenter recommended that the States should 
be authorized to impose liens on the facility and other 
assets of the corporate entity until the facility reimburses 
the fund. Another commenter believed that the States should 
be charged with the duty of using all available collection 
methods afforded by law to recoup expenditures from the 
fund. 
One commenter noted that 42 U.S.C. 1396r(h)(2)(E) (section 
1919(h)(2)(e) of the Act) provides that temporary management 
costs are legitimately payable administrative expenses of 
the State. Therefore, this commenter and others believed 
that the temporary manager's salary and the costs that he or 
she incurs while managing the facility should be borne by 
the State and reimbursed under the State's Medicaid 
reimbursement system.

Other commenters were in favor of obligating facilities 
to bear the cost of temporary management, and several asked 
that we state that the cost of temporary management is not 
an allowable expense for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. 
One commenter recommended that the salary payment be funded 
by the facility but routed to the State which would deliver 
the payment to the temporary manager. The commenter was 
concerned that direct facility payment would undermine the 
objectivity of the temporary manager. 


Response:

 We will continue to require that facilities 
pay the salary of the temporary manager, and we will not 
deem this cost to be an allowable expense for Medicare or 
Medicaid reimbursement. We believe that to do otherwise 
would undermine our enforcement efforts to motivate 
corrective action and encourage sustained substantial 
compliance. If we relieved facilities of their 
responsibility for bearing the costs of correcting serious 
deficiencies, we would be providing them with a clear 
disincentive to remain in substantial compliance. We also 
believe that providing the services of a temporary manager 
without charging for them would be an inappropriate response 
to a facility's failure to meet the responsibility it 
assumed upon entering the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs 
to meet participation requirements. A noncompliant facility 
must be held accountable for breaches of responsibility; 
therefore, it (and not HCFA or the State) should bear the 
cost of the temporary management it has incurred. 
Because responsibility for paying for the cost of the 
temporary management is one condition of the remedy, a 
facility's unwillingness to pay will be considered a failure 
to relinquish control to the temporary manager, and will 
cause the facility to be subject to the possibility of 
termination instead. A facility's inability to pay for the 
cost of the temporary management will have the same result. 
A provision has been added at paragraph (c)(4) to indicate 
this. The conspicuous absence of consideration of a 
facility's financial condition as a statutory criterion for 
imposing temporary management (as opposed to its inclusion 
as a criterion for determining the amount of a civil money 
penalty) implies that the Congress did not intend for it to 
be a factor in imposition of the remedy. Consequently, we 
are also compelled to proceed with action to terminate those 
facilities that are unable to assume the cost of the 
temporary management. 
We do not believe that our position conflicts with the 
statutory references cited by certain commenters. Section 
1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act states that funds collected by 
a State as a result of imposition of civil money penalties 
shall be applied to the protection of the health or property 
of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the 
Secretary finds deficient, including maintenance of 
operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies 
or closure. A temporary manager does not maintain operation 
of a facility. Rather, it is the facility ownership that is 
responsible for sustaining facility operations. If the 
State assumes control of a facility after it has been 
abandoned by its ownership, then it would be appropriate for 
the State to use civil money penalty funds to pay the 
expenses of maintaining the abandoned facility. 
We also believe that commenters misinterpreted the 
provision of the Act found at section 1919(h)(2)(E). This 
section states that the reasonable expenditures of a State 
to provide for temporary management shall be considered for 
Federal payment purposes to be necessary for the proper and 
efficient administration of the State plan. We believe this 
refers to the resources necessary to locate, orient, guide, 
and monitor the temporary manager, and does not include the 
cost of the temporary manager's service itself. When a 
facility pays for the temporary manager, we believe that it 
would be unnecessarily circuitous to route the salary 
payment to the State before delivering it to the temporary 
manager, and disagree that direct payment would compromise 
the temporary manager's objectivity. A facility would not 
be able to use the temporary manager's salary as leverage to 
influence his or her actions because a facility could not 
effectively keep the salary from the temporary manager. The 
temporary manager would be paid even if the facility 
attempted to withhold his or her salary because HCFA or the 
State could recoup the amount owed to the temporary manager 
from payments later made to the facility. Therefore, we are 
requiring that the facility pay the salary of the temporary 
manager directly, and are modifying the provision at 
 488.415(c) to reflect this. 


Comment:

 A large number of commenters believed that 
facilities should not be given the opportunity to refuse 
temporary management. Commenters were concerned that 
facilities would reject temporary management if given the 
choice, thereby subjecting residents to continued 
substandard quality of care, promoting facility 
terminations, and exposing residents to relocation trauma.

Commenters proposed various ways for HCFA and the State to obviate facility consent when appointing a temporary manager.
One suggestion was that we appoint the temporary manager subject to court order. Another recommendation was that
we administratively appoint the temporary manager in accordance with the State's police power. Additional commenters
proposed that we set limits on the duration of the temporary management (for example, restricting the appointment
to two weeks), the circumstances under which the manager would be appointed, and the funds that the manager could spend
in order to make the administrative appointment binding.

Other commenters proposed not only that facilities be required to accept temporary management, but that HCFA and
the State be required to impose temporary management in immediate jeopardy situations without a choice between it
and termination.



Response: 

We agree that facilities should not be offered a formal choice of whether to accept or reject temporary management
because we believe that more facilities will exercise the right to refuse if it is explicitly offered. Therefore,
once HCFA or the State has determined that temporary management is the optimal enforcement response, we will expect
the facility to accept it, and we will proceed with the appointment of the temporary manager without requesting facility
consent to do so. However, facilities will have the right to refuse to relinquish control to the temporary manager
since the administrative process precludes us from forcing providers to relinquish control. A facility's refusal
will initiate termination. While we realize that, in effect, the right of refusing to relinquish control to the temporary
manager is tantamount to the prerogative of rejecting temporary management, we believe that the new arrangement
will encourage the use of the remedy. We are amending   488.410, 488.415, and  488.456 to delete
references to a facility's choice of accepting or rejecting the remedy.

We cannot force a facility to relinquish control to a temporary manager because, ultimately, participation in the
Medicare or Medicaid program is voluntary under the Act, and we have no authority to compel a facility to stay in the
program should it, for its own reasons, choose to withdraw. We will not seek judicial action to impose temporary management
because the Act does not require that judicial intervention be a prerequisite for imposing this remedy.

We do not believe it is appropriate to rest appointment of temporary managers upon the State's police power as described
in State law. First, the Act does not suggest that this be the case. Second, this remedy is one imposed under the Act,
not State law. Ultimate authority for this remedy lies, accordingly, in the Medicare and Medicaid laws and ought not
look to State law without some indication by the Congress that it expected this to be the case.

A facility's refusal to relinquish control to the temporary manager will cause HCFA or the State to proceed with action
to terminate the facility's program participation. We share commenter concern about the protection of the health
and safety of residents when termination proceedings have been initiated. Consequently, we will allow a State monitor
to be imposed at all facilities that have failed to relinquish control to a temporary manager in cases of immediate
jeopardy, and also at those facilities for which no temporary manager could be located. The monitor will notify HCFA
or the State when the absence of temporary management subjects residents to substantial risks, and HCFA and the State
may then opt to take additional enforcement action.

We note that the Act does not require that temporary management be imposed when there is immediate jeopardy. Sections
1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act give HCFA and the State the option of using temporary
management and/or termination to respond to a situation that immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of residents.
In certain cases, facility shortcomings may be so severe and the likelihood of a temporary manager being able to successfully
remove them so small, that HCFA or the State may decide that resident interests would be better served by terminating
the facility and relocating the residents than by continuing to subject the residents to substandard conditions
that are unlikely to improve. Because we believe there are situations where termination is more appropriate than
temporary management, we do not accept the suggestion that HCFA and the State be required to impose a temporary manager
in lieu of termination in cases of immediate jeopardy.



Comment: 

Numerous commenters requested that we restructure the relationship between the facility and the temporary manager.
Certain commenters believed that the temporary manager should act in a consultant capacity, and not as a replacement
for the facility administrator. Others felt that the temporary manager should work under the control of the facility's
governing body, and that we should require the temporary manager to consult with the governing body when developing
the plan of correction. Another commenter favored giving the temporary manager legal but not financial control of
the facility.

Many other limitations on the temporary manager's authority were proposed. A number of commenters believed that
the temporary manager should not be able to make employment decisions, and they recommended that we require the temporary
manager to obtain approval from HCFA, the State, or the facility's governing body before hiring or firing facility
employees. Other commenters proposed that there be limits on the expenditures the temporary manager can make in order
to correct deficiencies, and they suggested that the regulation require that the temporary manager obtain the consent
of the provider to spend beyond those limits. Another group of commenters requested that we limit the time period for
which the temporary manager may legally commit or obligate the facility, and asked that we require the temporary manager
to seek facility approval before entering into long term contracts. A few commenters recommended that facility ownership
be able to appeal to the State to stay the actions of the temporary manager, and another requested that the facility
have the right to object to the temporary manager's business practices.



Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii) and 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act specifically provide that the temporary manager
is to oversee the operation of the facility and assure the health and safety of the facility's residents while improvements
are made to bring the facility into compliance. Further, once the facility relinquishes authority to the temporary
manager, the Act prohibits the removal of the temporary manager until the Secretary or the State has determined that
the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance, assuming that the Secretary or State
does not decide to terminate the facility before that time. We believe that implicit in the reason that the Act authorizes
temporary management is the assumption that the facility's management staff lacks the capability to bring the facility
into compliance. Therefore, the temporary manager needs to have the authority to completely manage the entire facility
with enough autonomy to remove any immediate jeopardy and/or correct deficiencies. Imposing the limits proposed
by commenters would handicap the ability of the temporary manager to make the necessary corrections, and thus jeopardize
the successful completion of the temporary manager's mission.

We believe that requiring that the governing body of the facility be allowed to become involved in the decision making
process after it has demonstrated that its management skills are deficient would defeat the purpose of the remedy.
The temporary manager may find it useful to consult with facility officials, but the extent to which the temporary
manager interacts with the facility's management is at his or her discretion. This does not mean that we will deny the
facility the opportunity to object to the actions of the temporary manager, or that we will force the facility to submit
to the temporary manager's reform agenda against its will. At any time the governing body of the facility is not in agreement
with the decisions or actions of the temporary manager, it may advise the owner or corporate official with appropriate
authority to refuse to continue with the remedy. Such action would, of course, subject the facility to the possibility
of termination instead.

Comment:

 Many commenters believed that facilities should have recourse to HCFA or the State to express concerns regarding
the administrative competency of the temporary manager. One commenter was worried that providers would not have
the opportunity to lodge a complaint about the temporary manager before his or her services ended.

Certain commenters proposed that HCFA and the State monitor the performance of the temporary manager and replace
any manager whose performance is unsatisfactory. Another commenter asked that a provider be able to replace the temporary
manager if the provider can demonstrate that the manager is incapable of correcting deficiencies or is jeopardizing
or impairing the facility's continued operation.



Response:

 HCFA and the State survey agency will monitor the actions of the temporary manager, and we expect the facility to do
the same. We encourage an open dialogue with providers and invite them to communicate to HCFA or the State on an ongoing
basis any concerns that they have with the decisions of the temporary manager. If HCFA or the State is dissatisfied
with the performance of the temporary manager, we may respond by providing the temporary manager with remedial guidance
or by replacing him or her with an alternate. However, if these actions are not possible or prove unsuccessful, we will
have no choice but to remove the temporary manager and proceed with termination of the facility's provider agreement.
The most appropriate and practical response will vary, and it will depend upon factors such as the availability of
an alternate or the amount of time remaining in the 23 days after the last day of the survey allotted for removal of the
immediate jeopardy when the temporary manager is imposed in an immediate jeopardy situation.



Comment:

 One commenter asked that providers be allowed a time period to demonstrate an ability to correct deficiencies if,
because of a temporary manager's incompetence, deficiencies have not been corrected timely.



Response:

 A temporary manager's failure to correct facility deficiencies does not absolve a facility of its responsibility
for generating corrections to those deficiencies, and if deficiencies are not corrected or the immediate jeopardy
is not removed timely, the facility will be terminated. HCFA and the State are not required to provide facilities with
additional time to come back into substantial compliance, but we are obligated to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries
and Medicaid recipients receive the quality care to which they are entitled.



Comment:

 Many commenters requested that we clarify the fiduciary responsibility of the temporary manager. One commenter
asked that we designate the temporary manager as a fiduciary of the facility, and stated that by doing so we would empower
the facility to protect its interests through established legal principles governing the relationship of fiduciaries
to their charges. Other commenters believed we should stipulate that the temporary manager has a responsibility
to maintain confidentiality of facility information, and obligations to act in the facility's best interests and
ensure that the facility's financial resources are properly managed while he or she works to bring the facility into
compliance. Additional commenters asked that we require the temporary manager to conduct himself or herself in a
professional manner and to act in a manner reasonably calculated to correct deficiencies and protect the facility's
residents.



Response:

 The temporary manager has a responsibility to further the enforcement efforts of HCFA or the State in an effort to protect
the facility's residents, and not a duty to serve the facility. HCFA or the State commissions the temporary manager
to correct deficiencies identified in the facility's operation, and we expect the temporary manager to exercise
sound financial judgment and discretion while executing his or her duty. Likewise, we assume that the temporary manager
will conduct himself or herself in a professional manner and act in the facility's best interests. However, we will
not explicitly require these standards in the regulation. These terms could not be meaningfully defined because
appropriate definitions for them would vary with the circumstances of each temporary management assignment.

Comment:

 A great number of commenters asked that the temporary manager be held liable to the owner or governing body of a facility
for gross negligence, intentional acts and omissions, unexplained shortfalls in facility funds, and breaches of
fiduciary duty. Certain commenters proposed that HCFA, the State, or the temporary manager be required to secure
a bond before overseeing operation of a facility, and others requested that HCFA or the State indemnify the facility
for harmful consequences arising from the temporary manager's actions or omissions. Another felt that HCFA or the
State should be identified as the temporary manager's employer for liability purposes.



Response:

 We expect facilities to monitor the performance of the temporary manager, and if they have any apprehensions about
his or her performance, they may have the remedy discontinued. Neither HCFA nor the State can force a facility to relinquish
control to the temporary manager. Because it is the facility that decides to continue to yield to the temporary manager,
neither HCFA nor the State will assume liability for the facility's decision. However, the facility does have the
right to seek from the temporary manager any redress available under State laws relating to liability and fiduciary
responsibilities.



Comment:

 A few commenters asked whether the temporary manager will have a contract.



Response:

 All of the actions needed to remove immediate jeopardy and correct deficiencies at a facility may not be readily apparent
at the outset of the temporary management; therefore, it would be imprudent to delineate the specific duties and authorities
of the temporary manager in contract form. The temporary manager must have the autonomy to take whatever steps are
necessary to bring the facility into substantial compliance and ensure resident health and safety. Shortsighted
contract provisions could prove restrictive and thus impede the temporary manager's progress.



Comment:

 One commenter was concerned about the effect that the appointment of a temporary manager would have on a facility's
liability insurance rates.



Response:

 It would be more appropriate for a facility's insurer to address this issue. Should a facility find that the imposition
of a temporary manager will cause the cost of its liability insurance to rise, this increase would be one of the factors
that the facility would have to consider when evaluating the benefits and costs of relinquishing control to a temporary
manager.



Comment:

 One commenter asked that the temporary manager be authorized to not honor pre-existing leases, mortgages or contracts
if their costs are excessive or if the contracts are otherwise unconscionable.



Response:

 The temporary manager does not have the authority to selectively meet the financial obligations of the nursing home.
That is, the temporary manager can not choose to pay some bills and not others, because he or she disagrees with the wisdom
of the permanent facility management having assumed those financial obligations previously. It is the temporary
manager's role to manage all aspects of the facility's operation, including its finances.



Comment:

 One commenter believed that it would be problematic to bring temporary managers into county facilities because those
facilities are subject to many restraints on hiring and the expenditure of funds set by county commissioners. Other
commenters were concerned about whether the temporary manager would respect a facility's union agreements and contracts.

Response: 

We recognize that a temporary manager in a 
public facility may be constrained in ways that he or she 
would not be in other facilities. We expect the temporary 
manager to work within any limitations under which the 
facility operates and to abide by union agreements and 
contracts. (See above response.) 


Comment: 

One commenter asked whether HCFA or the State 
would sanction a temporary manager who fails to rectify an 
immediate jeopardy situation within 23 days. 


Response: 

A failure to rectify an immediate jeopardy 
situation may be more indicative of the magnitude of a 
facility's deficiencies than the competency of the temporary 
manager, and neither HCFA nor the State will penalize 
automatically a temporary manager when his or her efforts 
failed to remove the immediate jeopardy. However, if HCFA 
or the State believes that the temporary manager was 
deficient in his or her duty, then that individual may be 
penalized to the extent that he or she is excluded from 
consideration for future temporary management assignments. 


Comment: 

Several commenters asked that we limit the 
duration of the temporary management. Many recommended that 
the temporary manager be discontinued when the immediate 
jeopardy is removed or when compliance with the requirements 
that triggered the temporary management is achieved. 


Response: 

Temporary management will be removed when 
the facility is terminated, or when HCFA or the State has 
determined that the facility is in substantial compliance 
and has the management capability to sustain substantial 
compliance. The temporary management might end when the 
immediate jeopardy has been removed and deficiencies have 
been corrected, but it would not have to. It would be 
premature to discontinue the temporary management before 
HCFA or the State is confident that the facility will not 
relapse into noncompliance. Effective enforcement involves 
promoting sustained substantial compliance, and we are 
revising  488.454, ``Duration of remedies'' to reflect this. 


Comment: 

One commenter recommended that HCFA or the 
State be able to continue special actions taken by the 
temporary manager which are necessary to protect resident 
health, welfare or safety. Facility management would 
request termination of the special conditions once it could 
show that they are no longer necessary. The commenter 
believed that this policy would ensure that the facility 
doesn't deteriorate when the temporary management ends. 


Response: 

 Neither HCFA nor the State will discontinue 
temporary management and restore control of a facility to 
its own management unless it is convinced that the facility 
is capable of and committed to sustaining substantial 
compliance. We do not believe an additional regulatory 
provision is necessary to ensure this result. 


Comment: 

Several commenters were opposed to the use of 
temporary management, and proposed alternatives to it. One 
commenter suggested that, instead of using temporary 
management in immediate jeopardy cases, HCFA require the 
non-compliant homes to hire consultants approved by HCFA to 
correct deficiencies. Another commenter proposed that HCFA 
itself create and train teams to act in an advisory 
capacity. A few commenters asked that temporary management 
be eliminated and replaced by State monitoring. Another 
commenter requested that we allow facilities to devise their 
own plans of correction to remove immediate jeopardy and 
have the State agency monitor implementation instead of 
imposing temporary management. 


Response: 

Temporary management is authorized by 
sections 1819(h)(2)(B)(iii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii), and 
1919(h)(3)(C)(iii) of the Act, and HCFA and the States are 
required to establish and implement it: we may not exclude 
it as an enforcement option. Sections 1819(h)(2)(A)(i), 
1919(h)(1)(A), and 1919(h)(5) of the Act specifically 
require that temporary management be used in immediate 
jeopardy situations when provider agreement termination is 
not sought. 
The Act provides that the temporary manager is to 
oversee the operation of a facility and assure the health 
and safety of the facility's residents while improvements 
are made to bring the facility into compliance. Therefore, 
we conclude that the Act intends the temporary manager's 
role to be more than that of just a monitor of the progress 
made by the facility or a consultant to management, and we 
believe that inherent in the Act's rationale for 
establishing temporary management is the assumption that the 
facility's management staff lacks the capability to bring 
the facility into compliance. It would be insufficient to 
substitute the use of a consultant or monitor for the 
appointment of a temporary manager, because a consultant or 
monitor would not have the authority to completely manage 
the entire facility as a temporary manager does. Only a 
temporary manager has a role active enough to substitute for 
the facility management, whose deficient skills or practices 
would impede correction of deficiencies and protection of 
the residents' health or safety.

Comment: 

One commenter wondered how availability of 
temporary managers would affect the use of this remedy. 


Response: 

In cases of immediate jeopardy, if a 
temporary manager cannot be located within 10 days of the 
last day of the survey, HCFA or the State is required to 
proceed with action to terminate the facility's program 
participation in order to protect the health or safety of 
the residents. To safeguard residents when this takes 
place, we will allow a State monitor to be imposed who will 
notify HCFA or the State if residents are being subjected to 
substantial risks and need to be transferred from the 
facility. If a temporary manager cannot be located for a 
situation which does not immediately jeopardize the health 
or safety of the residents, HCFA or the State has the 
flexibility to impose another type of remedy which it 
believes will best motivate the facility to achieve 
substantial compliance. However, if temporary management is 
the most logical alternative remedy, and a temporary manager 
cannot be located, HCFA or the State has the authority to 
terminate the provider agreement. We do not believe that 
the imposition of temporary management in lieu of 
termination is a provider right. Rather, it is an 
accommodation to the provider if, in the judgment of HCFA or 
the State, it will lead to substantial compliance and there 
are competent temporary managers available in the given 
geographic area. 


Comment: 

A few commenters requested that States be 
able to appoint a trustee or a receiver in lieu of a 
temporary manager if they have State laws that provide for 
these enforcement actions. 


Response: 

Many States have developed laws in 
accordance with State licensure authority that provide for 
sanctions similar to temporary management. The States use 
these sanctions, such as receivership and trusteeship, to 
enforce compliance with State licensure requirements. 
Section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act also gives the State 
the authority to use these measures when enforcing 
compliance with Federal Medicaid participation requirements, 
if the State can demonstrate to HCFA's satisfaction through 
a State plan amendment that trusteeship or receivership is 
as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting 
deficiencies as the remedy of temporary management. 
Therefore, if HCFA approves the State plan amendment 
establishing trusteeship or receivership as a remedy, a 
trustee or receiver may be used by a State as an acceptable 
alternative to a temporary manager when the State takes the 
enforcement action. The State may use the alternative 
remedy both when a temporary manager is required in cases of 
immediate jeopardy, and when one is selected as the most 
appropriate enforcement response in non-jeopardy cases. 


Comment: 

One commenter asked that we state the 
conditions under which temporary management will be imposed. 


Response: 

Other than the provisions in the law 
requiring temporary management in situations that 
immediately jeopardize the health or safety of residents, 
specific criteria for imposing temporary management in other 
types of situations would be impossible to develop. The 
decision of HCFA or the State to impose a temporary manager 
will be based on the deficiencies found at the time of 
survey coupled with other factors that exist at the facility 
at that particular point in time. For example, a facility 
might identify a deficiency before the State survey agency 
does and attempt to correct it. Although we could not 
dismiss the facility's failure to prevent the deficiency, 
neither would we ignore the administrative competence that 
the facility demonstrated by identifying and attempting to 
address the deficiency on its own initiative. We would 
consider both factors when selecting the appropriate remedy. 


Section 488.417 Denial of Payment for All New Admissions 


Upon our review of comments and evaluation of the 
underlying statute, we noted that we did not make it clear 
in the proposed rule that the authority of the Secretary to 
deny payment to a facility is limited to Medicare 
facilities. In the case of Medicaid facilities, the State 
may deny payment to the facility and HCFA may deny payment 
to the State for all Medicaid residents in the facility. A 
related issue is the question of who must be satisfied that 
a facility has achieved and will remain in substantial 
compliance after the facility has been cited for repeated 
instances of substandard quality of care so that payments 
may resume. Section 1819(h)(2)(E) says that it is the 
Secretary for Medicare, and section 1919(h)(2)(D) says that 
it is the State for Medicaid. 


Comment: 

One commenter said that this remedy should be 
imposed only in cases posing a hazard to the residents or in 
cases when their rights are compromised. 


Response: 

We consider this remedy to be appropriate 
for both the cases in which we have designated it may be 
used and the cases in which we designate it must be used. 
We believe that it will be one of our most effective 
remedies because it will strongly motivate facilities to 
come into and remain in compliance.

Comment:

 Some commenters said that the denial of 
payment for certain diagnostic categories set forth at 
 488.217(b) of the proposed rule would be ineffective, and 
lead to discrimination against individuals whose care may be 
more costly. This, they said, would be in violation of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1974 and of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1991. 


Response:

 We believe that these arguments are 
convincing, and to prevent facilities from using the 
provision as a means to discriminate, we have deleted it in 
this final rule. 


Comment:

 Many commenters said that this remedy as 
written is too broad and subject to too much interpretation, 
particularly with respect to the meaning of the terms 
``adequate care,'' ``diagnostic categories,'' ``certain specified 
diagnoses,'' ``substandard quality of care,'' and ``new 
admission.'' Some said that residents who go to the 
hospital, then directly back to the facility, should not be 
considered to be ``new admissions.'' 


Response:

 ``Substandard quality of care'' has been 
defined in  488.301. ``New admission'' has been defined at 
 488.401 and the definition already contained the statement 
that residents admitted before the effective date of the 
denial of payment and taking temporary leave are not 
considered new admissions, nor subject to the denial of 
payment. Since we have deleted the proposed  488.417(b), 
no definitions for those terms need be provided. Finally, 
the term ``adequate care'' does not appear in the regulations 
text at  488.417. When it appears elsewhere in this 
regulation, it has the ordinary dictionary meaning. 


Comment:

 One facility offered criteria for imposing 
denial of payment for all new admissions based on a scope 
and severity scale of its own design, and suggested we say, 
at  488.417, that denial of payment for all new admissions 
will be in effect only until the date the facility is 
certified to be in substantial compliance. 


Response:

 We received several suggestions for revising 
our scope and severity scales, and the enforcement scheme 
that we have established at  488.408 (``Selection of 
remedies.'') reflects some of these suggestions. Neither a 
denial of payment nor any other remedy will be imposed at a 
facility in substantial compliance, as defined at  488.401. 
Once a denial of payment is imposed, it will be lifted when 
the facility achieves substantial compliance (and is capable 
of maintaining it, if necessary). This policy is set forth 
at paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as well as at 
 488.454 Duration of remedies. 


Comment:

 One commenter, in setting forth regulation 
text for proposed  488.217, said that_
 Denial of payment should be imposed, not only for 
any deficiency which remains uncorrected within 90 calendar 
days after the last day of survey identifying the 
deficiency, but for any deficiency which remains 
substantially uncorrected within that time period as well; 
 If the facility can supply documentation that 
substantial compliance was attained on a date preceding that 
of the revisit of the survey team, the denial of payment 
only remains in effect until the date that substantial 
compliance was actually reached; 
 Denial of payment for all new admissions should last 
only until the facility has ``substantially corrected'' the 
deficiencies; 
 Denial of payment should not take effect until either 
HCFA or the State has provided notice to the facility and 
the public of the impending action. Public notice shall be 
provided by publication in a newspaper of general 
circulation in the county where the facility is located; 
(Another commenter agreed that denial of payment should not 
take effect until notice has been provided, and also said 
that HCFA should set forth regulations requiring States to 
give notice to facilities before denying payment for all new 
admissions.); and 
 When payments resume, this too should be announced to 
the public in the same way as the denial notice. 


Response:

 We agree that denial of payment for all new 
admissions should last only until the facility is in 
substantial compliance. Because the final rule reflects the 
adoption of a substantial compliance standard, a denial of 
payment for new admissions, like other sanctions, will only 
be applied should a facility fail to meet that standard. 
Thus, under sections 1819(h)(2)(d) or 1919(h)(2)(C) of the 
Act, that facility must face a denial of payments for new 
admissions. Similarly, if, within 3 months of the survey 
that first identified deficiencies, the facility is 
successful in achieving substantial compliance, the denial 
of payments will be lifted as required by sections 
1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act. If the facility does 
not come into substantial compliance by 3 months after the 
last day of the survey, denial of payment will be imposed 
until substantial compliance is achieved or until the 
facility is terminated. 
We also agree that, except in the case of the mandatory 
denial of payment for substandard quality of care identified 
in three consecutive standard surveys, if the facility can 
supply documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey 
agency that it was in substantial compliance, and was 
capable of remaining in substantial compliance, if 
necessary, on a date preceding that of the revisit, the 
remedies terminate on the date that HCFA or the State can 
verify as the date that substantial compliance was achieved. 
(This is further discussed in connection with a comment on 
 488.454.) In the case of repeated substandard quality of 
care, the Act requires that the denial of payment (and State 
monitor) remain in place until the facility is in compliance 
and can demonstrate that it will remain in compliance. 
We agree that facilities should receive notice of 
remedies before they are imposed. Notification requirements 
are found at  488.402(f), and need not appear again at 
 488.417. The commenter cited section 1919(h)(2)(A)(i) of 
the Act as rationale for HCFA promulgating regulations 
setting forth procedures for States to use in informing the 
general public about remedies. We do not agree that the Act 
requires HCFA to promulgate regulations regarding how States 
must go about notifying the general public. 


Comment:

 Some commenters said that the remedy denial 
of payment for specific categories of residents to be used 
if the surveyor finds that the facility is not currently 
able to provide adequate care for these individuals, or 
determines that caring for such individuals would adversely 
affect care provided to other residents, was not one of the 
remedies provided in OBRA '87. 


Response:

 We are deleting the provisions for denial of 
payment for specific categories of residents from this final 
rule because, as we stated at the beginning of this section, 
we believe that this remedy could lead to inequities. 


Comment:

 A number of commenters expressed concern over 
whether survey agency revisits would be timely enough to 
ensure the prompt resumption of payments as soon as the 
facility corrects its deficiencies.

Response:

 We are revising this final rule to state 
that deficiencies are considered to be corrected when a 
survey team revisit confirms that they have been corrected, 
or when a facility provides evidence satisfactory to HCFA or 
the State survey agency, which can be verified without an 
on-site visit, that the deficiencies have been corrected 
before the revisit or before the credible evidence was 
submitted. In addition, sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) 
of the Act allow for lifting the denial of payment for new 
admissions when the facility achieves substantial 
compliance. (Please see the discussion regarding 
substantial compliance under the comments pertaining to 
 488.454 in this final rule, Duration of remedies.)


Comment:

 Two commenters suggested that, instead of 
denying payment for all new Medicare and/or Medicaid 
admissions when warranted, we impose a ban on all new 
admissions to a facility, regardless of the source of 
payment. They said that if we use this remedy, we should 
pair it with a directed plan of correction requiring the 
facility to take steps to restore capacity to provide a full 
range of NF/SNF services. 


Response:

 We cannot accept this suggestion since the 
Act does not give us the authority to regulate payments that 
may be made to facilities by private paying residents. 


Comment:

 Three commenters suggested that we add to 
proposed  488.217 (a)(2) and (b)(2) a sentence stating, ``No 
retroactive payments will be made when a ban on all new 
admissions is lifted.'' The rationale is that, if facilities 
know they will receive payments later, they may admit those 
residents they choose and thus cover the short term cash 
flow problem. They say that this would lessen the 
effectiveness of the sanction. 


Response:

 We agree in principle, and, for purposes of 
clarification, we are revising the suggested sentence to 
state, at  488.417(e), that no retroactive payments will be 
made for any new admissions to the facility for the period 
between the date the remedy was imposed and the date that 
HCFA or the State determines that the facility achieved 
substantial compliance. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that 
 488.417(a)(1)(i) be revised to state that HCFA or the 
State may impose a denial of payment for new admissions if a 
deficiency remains uncorrected after 90 calendar days (as 
opposed to within) of the last day of survey identifying the 
deficiency. As worded in the proposed rule, the mandatory 
sanction would have been imposed if a deficiency had existed 
at any time during the 90 days. 


Response:

 We agree with the intent of the comment, and 
although we are no longer referring to 90 days but to 3 
months as the Act does, we are making this revision. 
(Please note that the proposed  488.217(a)(1)(i) is now 
redesignated as  488.417(b)(1).) 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that HCFA deny payment 
for all new admissions after the second consecutive survey 
which documents that substandard care is being provided. 
The rationale is that this would be more in keeping with the 
purpose of remedies, that is, encouraging rapid compliance 
with the program requirements. Another commenter suggested 
that denial of payment for new admissions be a mandatory 
remedy when there are widespread substandard quality of care 
violations or when there is a pattern of substandard quality 
of care violations.

Response:

 While the Act, at section 1819(h)(2)(E) 


requires

 denial of payment for new admissions or for all 
Medicare residents, and, at 1919(h)(2)(D) 

requires

 that 
denial of payment for new admissions be imposed after the 
third consecutive standard survey that shows substandard 
quality of care, it 

permits 

the imposition of this sanction 
anytime that noncompliance is found. 



Comment:

 One commenter said that provisions should be 
made for the protection of Medicare beneficiaries or 
Medicaid recipients, or both, admitted to a facility while 
the payment ban on new admissions is in effect. To protect 
such individuals, the commenter said, providers should be 
prohibited from seeking payment from residents or third 
parties for any care furnished during a period in which the 
providers were denied payment for new admissions. 



Response:

 This provision is already in the Act at 
section 1866(a)(1)(A) for Medicare and at section 
1919(c)(5)(A) for Medicaid. Additionally, 42 CFR 447.15 
obligates providers to accept Medicaid payments as payment 
in full. 



Comment:

 One commenter said that, in order for this 
remedy to be effective, the duration must be such that there 
is some assurance that compliance will be sustained. 



Response:

 In the strictest sense, regardless of the 
nature of the deficiency, and regardless of the remedy 
imposed, there can be no guarantee that substantial 
compliance will continue once the survey team leaves. We 
can only impose reasonable sanctions and make periodic on-site inspections to ensure compliance. However, when
HCFA or the State denies payment for instances of repeated substandard quality of care, we do, at paragraph (c) of this
section, state that the sanction is not lifted until_ 

 The facility is in substantial compliance; and 

 HCFA or the State survey agency believes that it will 
remain in substantial compliance. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested we amend this section 
to state that a denial of payment for all new admissions 
will take effect on the date the facility receives the 
notice of the remedy. 



Response:

 Notification requirements are at 
 488.402(f). Section 488.402(f)(1) states that, except when 
the State is taking the action for a non-State operated NF, 
HCFA gives the provider notice of the reasons for, and the 
effective date of, the remedy. Paragraph (f)(2) states 
that, for all remedies specified in  488.406, the notice 
must be given at least 2 calendar days before the effective 
date of the remedy in immediate jeopardy situations, and at 
least 15 calendar days before the effective date in 
non-immediate jeopardy situations. We believe that this is 
equitable. Nursing homes are businesses, some of them very 
large businesses. They have payrolls to meet, suppliers to 
pay, buildings and equipment to maintain, and similar 
overhead. An ``effective immediately'' notice would not be 
reasonable. 



Comment:

 One commenter said that  488.417(a)(1)(i) is 
inconsistent with  488.412(b)(3). Section 488.417 says, at 
paragraph (a)(1), that HCFA or the State may deny payment 
for new admissions, and, at (a)(1)(i), that HCFA will and 
the State must deny payment for new admissions if any 
deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar days after 
the last day of survey identifying the deficiencies. (Since 
 488.412(b)(3) bears no direct relationship to 
 488.417(a)(1)(i) and  488.412(a)(3) does, we believe that 
the commenter meant to cite the latter, which says that if 
any deficiency remains uncorrected within 90 calendar days 
after the last day of survey, HCFA will and the State must 
deny payment for new admissions.) 



Response:

 While   488.417(a)(1)(i) and 488.412(a)(3) 
overlap, they are not inconsistent because a certain amount 
of overlapping has been purposely written into this final 
rule for ease of reference on the part of those who will use 
it. As previously, noted, we have amended the regulations 
text to reflect a 3 month timeframe to comport with the Act.

Comment:

 One commenter asked if there was any 
difference between ``all new admissions'' in  488.417(a) and 
``new admissions'' in  488.417(a)(1). 



Response:

 There is no difference. We are revising the 
regulations text to conform to the section's title. 



Comment:

 Some general comments we received on the 
provisions in this section of the proposed rule were as 
follows: 

 They are unjustifiably severe; 

 Providers can not comply with them in all cases because 
some deficiencies take more than 90 days to correct; and 

 They are unnecessary. 



Response:

 At HCFA's request, the Institute of Medicine 
(IoM), which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, 
conducted a study of the policies and regulations governing 
the certification of nursing homes participating in Medicare 
and Medicaid. Its report, issued in March 1986, cited the 
urgent need for enacting statutory provisions extending the 
remedies available to HCFA and the States in enforcing 
compliance with nursing home regulations. A General 
Accounting Office (GAO) study (``Medicare and Medicaid: 
Stronger Enforcement of Nursing Home Requirements Needed'' 
(July 1987)) also concluded that penalties short of 
decertification of nursing homes are needed to deter 
noncompliance. HCFA's operating experience also bears this 
out. Traditionally, if facilities were unable to correct 
deficiencies within 90 days of the survey date, their 
provider agreements would have been terminated by the 90th 
day. We, along with the IoM, GAO, and the Congress believe 
that these regulations are necessary, are not unduly harsh 
or severe, and that it is possible for providers to comply 
with them. Furthermore, the denial of payment for new 
admissions is not only authorized by the Act, but required 
by the Act in certain circumstances, such as when 
noncompliance remains after 3 months or when substandard 
quality of care has been cited in three consecutive standard 
surveys. 



Section 488.418 Secretarial Authority to Deny All Payment 



Upon our review of comments and evaluation of the 
underlying Act, we noted that we did not include a section 
in the proposed rule explicitly stating the Secretary's 
authority to deny all payment to a facility. Under section 
1819(h)(2)(B) of the Act, if a facility has not met a 
requirement, the Secretary may deny payment for all Medicare 
residents. Under section 1819(h)(2)(E), the Secretary is 
required to deny payment for all current Medicare residents 
or for all Medicare new admissions if a SNF, on three 
consecutive standard surveys has been found to have provided 
substandard quality of care.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00175 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under section 1919(h)(3)(C)(i) of the Act, the Secretary 
may deny payments for all current Medicaid residents but 
this denial authority is exercised against the State, not 
the facility. Only with respect to State-operated 
facilities may the Secretary take action directly against a 
facility because section 1919(h)(3)(A) expressly provides 
such authority. 
We are adding new  488.418 to make explicit this 
authority. We provide that, if a facility has not met a 
requirement, in addition to the authority to deny payment 
for all new admissions as set forth at  488.417(a), HCFA 
has the authority to deny any further payment to the 
facility for all Medicare residents and to deny further 
payment to the State for all Medicaid residents. 
Under paragraph (b) of new  488.418, if the facility 
achieves substantial compliance, HCFA resumes payment to the 
facility or the State prospectively from the date that it 
verifies as the date that substantial compliance has been 
achieved, except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) 
of this section. 
If payments to the facility or the State resume, no 
payments will be made for the period between the date the 
remedy was imposed and the date that HCFA verifies as the 
date that substantial compliance was achieved. This is the 
case with both denial of payment for all new admissions as 
well as with denial of payment for those already residing in 
the facility. 
Should HCFA or the State find that the facility was in 
substantial compliance before the date of the revisit, or 
before HCFA or the survey agency receives the credible 
evidence of such compliance, the remedy must be lifted as of 
the date that substantial compliance was achieved, as 
determined by HCFA. The exceptions to this rule occur when 
the denial of payment remedy is imposed for repeat instances 
of substandard quality of care. The remedy is not lifted 
until substantial compliance is achieved and HCFA believes 
that the facility will remain in substantial compliance. 


Section 488.422 State Monitoring 




Comment:

 Some commenters expressed concern that the Act 
did not provide for State monitoring. 


Response:

 We disagree. The statutory authority for 
State monitoring is implicit for cases of repeated 
noncompliance (see sections 1819(h)(2)(E)(ii) and 
1919(h)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act with cross references to 
sections 1819(g)(4)(B) and 1919(g)(4)(B) of the Act for 
Medicare and Medicaid respectively). 


Comment:

 Some commenters asked in what instances the 
remedy of State monitoring is to be applied. 


Response:

 The Act requires State monitoring in cases of 
repeated noncompliance. That is, if a facility, on three 
consecutive standard surveys conducted under sections 
1819(g)(2) and 1919(g)(2) of the Act has been found to have 
provided substandard quality of care, State monitoring is to 
be imposed. Otherwise, State monitoring may be considered 
as an optional remedy. 


Comment:

 Several commenters raised questions as to how 
funding for State monitors would be met. Some suggested 
that costs for monitoring be borne by the facility and not 
be an allowable cost for reimbursement. 


Response:

 We believe the costs of State monitoring 
should be part of the survey and certification process and, 
therefore, should be considered by the State survey agency 
in planning its annual Medicare and Medicaid workload. The 
budgeted amounts for these activities are approved by HCFA 
as part of the annual survey and certification budget 
process. 


Comment:

 A few commenters suggested that we prescribe 
the role of the State monitor in the final rule. 


Response:

 We do not wish to prescribe the role of the 
State monitor; however, we have clarified language in the 
final rule describing in general terms the purpose of the 
State monitor. The State monitor oversees the correction of 
cited deficiencies and ensures that residents are protected 
from harm. Any more specific description of State monitor 
roles and responsibilities will be addressed in manual 
instructions to the State survey agency. 


Comment:

 Some commenters expressed concerns regarding 
the length of time State monitoring would continue. Several 
commenters suggested that the State survey agency retain the 
ability to monitor ongoing conditions in the facility until 
the State survey agency or HCFA determines the serious 
condition(s) have been corrected. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters. State 
monitoring remains in place at least until HCFA or the State 
survey agency determines that the provider is in substantial 
compliance with the requirements of participation. In the 
case of State monitoring imposed for repeated substandard 
quality of care, the sanction will stay in place until the 
facility has demonstrated to the Secretary or the State 
survey agency that it will stay in substantial compliance. 
At this time, any serious deficiencies must have been 
corrected to the point where the facility is in substantial 
compliance. 


Comment:

 We received several comments suggesting we 
write qualifications for a State monitor in the final rule. 


Response:

 Because of the broad spectrum of situations 
in which State monitoring might be used, we choose not to 
expand the current language in  488.422(a).

Comment:

 Some commenters suggested we mandate State 
monitoring be used whenever a facility is undergoing 
termination or closure. 


Response:

 While we agree with commenters that 
installing a State monitor would be appropriate in a 
termination or closure situation, we will not require the 
States to use this remedy in all such cases. 


Section 488.421 Directed Plans of Correction 




Comment:

 Some commenters wanted us to define a directed 
PoC as a facility-initiated PoC which the State or HCFA 
orders the facility to implement. Commenters reasoned that 
making this change would allow States to use directed PoC 
more efficiently and effectively since facilities' governing 
bodies will generally be more capable of drafting viable 
plans of correction based upon knowledge of facility 
resources. One commenter wanted to amend proposed  488.224 
to read as follows: ``HCFA, or the State (or the temporary 
manager with HCFA or State approval) has the responsibility 
to develop a plan of correction * * *''. Another commenter 
believed that when the State or HCFA orders (or directs) a 
facility to comply with the directed PoC, the State or HCFA 
have more authority to require the facility to revise any 
aspect of the PoC which is not acceptable. The commenter 
further suggested that the imposition of a governmentally 
created PoC on a facility raises questions of the 
government's and the facility's respective liabilities if 
the plan does not correct the deficiencies. 


Response:

 Defining a directed PoC as a facility-initiated plan which HCFA or the State orders or directs a 
facility to implement would be virtually identical to the 
way we have always defined a traditional PoC. The 
traditional PoC is a requirement when any deficiency is 
cited, except for isolated deficiencies where no actual harm 
has occurred and there may be potential for minimal harm. 
The exception to this is if a directed PoC is used as a 
remedy. The directed PoC can be used by itself for 
deficiencies which cause no actual harm. We also disagree 
that a PoC developed by the facility would give the State 
survey agency or HCFA any more authority than one developed 
by the State survey agency, HCFA, or a temporary manager. 
We do not believe that to say ``HCFA * * * has the 
responsibility'' adds anything to the meaning of this 
section. Although it may be true that the facility's 
governing body may be more familiar with a facility's 
resources, developing a directed PoC does not rest solely on 
this knowledge. For the reasons stated above, we are not 
accepting these suggestions. 
With respect to the commenter's point that a 
governmentally-initiated PoC could raise a question about 
the State's or HCFA's liability if the directed PoC does not 
correct deficiencies, we do not guarantee that any remedy 
will necessarily result in facility compliance. The 
directed PoC, as well as other remedies prescribed, are 
developed and recommended based on the professional judgment 
of State or HCFA staff and their consideration of which 
remedy(ies) would promote prompt achievement of compliance. 
If a remedy does not result in a facility achieving 
compliance, another remedy may be imposed to safeguard the 
health or safety of nursing home residents. This other 
remedy could be an additional remedy from the same category, 
or, if the deficiencies have been exacerbated, a remedy or 
remedies from a higher category, including termination. 
However, HCFA and the State will usually impose alternative 
remedies prior to terminating a facility. 


Comment:

 Other commenters wanted us to amend  488.424 
to specify situations where a directed PoC would be 
mandatory. These commenters asked that a directed PoC be 
used when the following deficiencies are identified. 
 Violations of admission requirements; 
 Violations of Sarrassat requirements concerning notice 
of Medicare coverage and rights to demand billing; 
 Violations of transfer prohibitions and bed hold 
requirements; 
 All cases of violations of individual rights; and 
 Care problems of specific, identifiable individuals.

Commenters further suggested that the directed plans of correction must be developed by qualified health care professionals
in consultation with the State survey agency. 



Response: 

We are rejecting this suggestion for several reasons. Mandating a directed PoC for certain deficiencies would limit
HCFA or the State's choice of remedies and would run counter to the thrust of the Act which encourages the flexible application
of enforcement options. Also, requiring a remedy for specific deficiencies would be inconsistent with the requirements
associated with other remedies. We also do not want to prescribe in regulations which staff people must develop the
directed PoC, but opt to give HCFA or State the flexibility to decide who will carry out this function. We expect that
the State survey agency would develop the directed PoC, but the State would be responsible for officially notifying
the facility of the remedy. However, in manual instructions, we will provide guidance in this regard by including
examples of deficiency situations and corresponding directed PoCs which are appropriate in terms of content and
the staff person responsible for development. 



Comment: 

One commenter urged HCFA to require that directed PoCs include specific corrective action to protect individual
residents who suffered harm when those residents are clearly identifiable. Another commenter wanted the rule amended
to provide that all PoCs are to make an injured resident or residents ``whole,'' whenever possible, and that the facility
be required to take specific steps to ensure future compliance. The commenters offered, as an example, a facility
which improperly denies a resident his or her bed hold rights. The commenters believed that in this example the directed
PoC must require that the facility honor the resident's statutory right to return to the next available bed. Commenters
feared that without such a requirement, the directed PoC will be nothing more than a facility's promise not to do it
again. 



Response: 

Requiring in regulation that a facility make a resident whole whenever a resident has been injured or has been deprived
of his or her rights would be virtually impossible. In many instances where irreparable harm has occurred this would
be an unattainable goal. Although HCFA and the State survey agency consider the unique circumstances of a facility
and the results on residents when developing a directed PoC, any PoC is based on prospective compliance. The principle
behind a PoC is to ensure that the underlying cause of cited deficiencies does not recur. The purpose of the PoC is not,
however, a checklist of past violations which must retroactively be corrected. In the example cited, if a facility
denied a resident a bed through improper application of a bed hold policy, the resident would probably have to be admitted
to another facility. Prescribing in the directed PoC that the resident would be eligible to be readmitted to the facility
when the next bed became available would be pointless since he or she, being unable to wait, would probably already
be placed in another home. We have not accepted this comment to mandate that the directed PoC include resident specific
reparations. 



Comment: 

One commenter recommended the use of a directed PoC for substandard quality of care findings with a scope of 3 or 4 and
for repeat substandard quality of care findings at a scope of 1 or 2 and for all other repeated violations. 



Response: 

We are not accepting this suggestion. Based on numerous public comments, we have reconfigured the scope and severity
grid without numerical values, and are offering it in this preamble as one example of how a State could determine what
remedies to impose in noncompliant facilities. Additionally, we have developed recommended categories of remedies
for ranges of deficiencies. The directed PoC is a remedy which can be used for any deficiency and may be the only remedy
used for lower level deficiencies. We do not intend to require a directed PoC for substandard quality of care findings
but rather leave that option to the enforcing entity. Nor do we mandate the use of directed PoCs for repeat deficiencies.
The law provides for denial of payment, State monitoring, and increased civil money penalties in certain cases of
repeated noncompliance and those are the only enforcement actions related to repeat deficiencies that we have required
in these regulations. 



Section 488.425 Directed In-Service Training 



On the basis of our review of issues raised by commenters and our reevaluation of our statutory authority, we are including
in the final rule a provision for the imposition of a directed inservice training program. After several years of experience
with implementing the OBRA '87 provisions, we have come to a greater realization that some compliance problems are
a result of imperfect knowledge on the part of the health services staff relative to state-of-art practices and resident
outcome expectations. For example, we know that incontinence and decubitus ulcers are not an inevitable result of
old age and immobility. The incidence and/or prevalence of these conditions in a particular long-term care facility
may be the result of general lack of knowledge about the prevention and treatment of these conditions, and a lasting
change may be produced in that facility by a directed inservice training program. 

We also believe that a directed inservice training program may be particularly effective in reducing reliance on
chemical restraints. Two studies have been instructional on this point. The first, entitled ``A Randomized Trial
of a Program to Reduce the Use of Psychoactive Drugs in Nursing Homes'' by Dr. Jerry Avorn and colleagues (

New England Journal of Medicine; 

Vol. 327 No. 3; July 16, 1992, pages 168-173), demonstrates that a fairly intensive training program for the
medical, as well as, all three shifts of the nursing staff (including aides) can bring a dramatic reduction in the use
of psychoactive drugs without adversely affecting the overall behavior and level of functioning of the residents.


Another study was entitled, ``Reducing Antipsychotic Drug Use in Nursing Homes: A Controlled Trial of Provider Education,''
by Dr. Wayne Ray and colleagues at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine published in the 

Archives of Internal Medicine; 

Vol. 153; March 22, 1993, pages 713-721. This study applied a formalized training program to teach nursing personnel
how to manage the most prevalent behavioral symptoms experienced by aged individuals in nursing homes. Common behavioral
symptoms such as catastrophic reaction, yelling and screaming, fighting, wandering, etc. are addressed in this
study, and non-drug interventions are described. The training program led to a 59 percent reduction in the use of antipsychotic
drugs over the control facility, and a 31 percent reduction in physical restraints over the control facility.

We would invite facilities to use inservice programs conducted by sources with an in-depth knowledge of the area(s)
which require specific training so the positive change is achieved and maintained. We would also encourage facilities
to use programs developed by well established centers of geriatric health services education and training. These
centers include, but are not limited to, schools of medicine or nursing, Area Health Education Centers, and centers
for aging. These centers should have established programs in geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry. We only recommend
to the facility where it can obtain its inservice training program. The ultimate test of the training program will
be in the outcome of care achieved by the facility after completion of the training program. If the resident's care
circumstance has not improved after training, the facility, upon resurvey by the State agency, will be subject to
stronger sanctions. We also require that the payment for the directed inservice training is the responsibility of
the facility. 



Section 488.426 Closure or Transfer of Residents, or Both 





Comment: 

Several commenters said that HCFA should give more guidance on when closure of a facility and/or transfer of residents
are appropriate. Others were concerned because the regulations did not set out procedures for State transfer of residents.
A few commenters said that closures should be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the proposed  488.240.
Some commenters insisted that closing a facility should only be a last resort when alternative methods have failed
or the physical plant is unsafe. Other commenters said HCFA should include a definition of the term ``emergency''
in the regulations. 



Response: 

The closure of a facility and/or transfer of the residents are measures of last resort that are taken only in an emergency
situation. These actions are rare, but most States have had experience with such actions. Most States have a relocation
plan that outlines the circumstances under which the plan will be put into effect and the procedures to be followed.
Because of this, we believe it would be unnecessary to mandate procedures for States to follow in cases of closure or
transfer of residents. The Act places the responsibility for closure and/or transfer upon the States and proposed
 488.240, the content of which is now incorporated into  488.426, requires any transfers to be orderly.
We do not believe that any greater procedural specificity is required in Federal regulations. We also do not believe
that it is necessary to define ``emergency.'' We define words only if their definitions will have a narrower application
than definitions commonly found in dictionaries. That is not the case for the use of the word ``emergency'' in this
regulation. 



Comment: 

Some commenters insisted that a temporary manager be appointed to oversee the transfers whenever large numbers of
residents are involved. Other commenters believed that States should be required to get a court order before closing
a facility or transferring residents. 



Response: 

We do not agree with these comments. We believe the States should retain the flexibility to implement emergency relocation
plans according to the circumstances of each case. The States have the knowledge and experience to choose the optimum
combination of procedures to handle each unique situation. Obtaining a court order could delay the implementation
of the relocation plan in an emergency situation and would add nothing to the process. The same can be said about the
imposition of a temporary manager, because it is the State that is experienced in closure and/or transfer of residents'
situations, not necessarily a temporary manager. 



Comment: 

One commenter noted that the Act at section 1919(h)(5) cross references the transfer of residents to sections pertaining
to facility-initiated transfers and discharges. Consequently, the final rule must require States to set up procedures
which include written notice, involvement of ombudsmen and orientation procedures. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act, which make reference to a resident's rights upon transfer, speak to
them as they relate to the ``safe and orderly transfer of the residents * * *'' We believe that whatever
appeal rights individual residents have when the facility in which they reside faces termination bear only on the
appropriateness of the transfer plans for those individuals and not the correctness of the government's decision
to terminate the facility's provider agreement. For example, an individual may disagree with the nature or location
of the facility to which he is slated for transfer and could challenge such a decision under the appeals process provided
by sections 1819(e)(3) and 1919(e)(3) of the Act.

There is no evidence in the Act or the legislative 
history that the Congress intended to vest nursing home 
residents with the right to challenge the correctness of the 
decision to take enforcement measures against the facility. 
That decision lies with either the Secretary or the State 
and is subject to challenge by the facility, not the 
residents. There is no reason to believe that the Congress, 
in drafting these provisions, had as its objective the 
overturning of the Supreme Court's decision in 

O'Bannon

 v. 


Town Court Nursing Center

, 447 U.S. 773 (1980), and we 
cannot presume that 

O'Bannon

 has been overturned by 
indirection. 
Moreover, the plain implication of the transfer and 
discharge provisions in sections 1819(c) and 1919(c) of the 
Act is that their focus is on actions that may face an 
individual resident of a facility rather than 

all

 of a 
facility's residents. Thus, subsection (c)(2)(A) speaks to 
a transfer or discharge for the 

resident's

 welfare or for 
the health of 

individuals

 in the facility. These imply 
individualized determinations, not the kind of facility 
determination that automatically subjects the entire 
Medicare or Medicaid patient population to forced removal 
from the facility. 
Additionally, when describing the documentation 
requirements for discharge or transfer, the Act (in the 
paragraph immediately following the listing of permissible 
grounds for such actions) speaks to the necessity for 
documentation to appear in the resident's clinical record 
and often times to be entered by the resident's physician. 
We know, however, that decisions to terminate a facility's 
provider agreement are made by either the Secretary or the 
State, not by residents' physicians. Thus, it would seem 
that the kind of transfer appeals referred to in sections 
1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2) of the Act do not encompass issues 
that are central to the provider agreement termination, but 
rather decisions affecting the fate of an individual 
resident that may be made by his or her physician. 
We believe that sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of 
the Act give the Secretary and the States discretion in how 
to apply the transfer notice and appeal provisions of 
sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2). The Act's enforcement 
provisions require that the transfer of residents whose 
facility faces termination be done in a manner ``consistent 
with'' the provisions of subsection (c)(2). Had the Congress 
intended that there be strict adherence to the Act's 
transfer provisions, it could easily have specified that 
they be followed precisely. Use of the phrase ``consistent 
with,'' however, implies a less rigorous standard that 
permits the Secretary and the States to make judgments as to 
how to best accommodate the notice provisions, for example, 
while not compromising the effectiveness of the termination 
action. Thus we believe residents should receive as much 
notice as possible of their impending transfer as long as 
the notice period does not further compromise their quality 
of care. 


Comment:

 A few commenters mentioned that the proposed 
regulation improperly references proposed  488.206(c). 


Response:

 The reference to proposed  488.206(c) has 
not been included in the final rule as  488.426 has been 
revised to include closure and transfer of residents in NFs 
and SNF/NFs. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the term 
``Medicaid facility'' be changed to read ``Medicaid certified 
facility `` so as not to give the false impression that a 
facility must be 100 percent Medicaid in order for these 
provisions to apply. 


Response:

 The term ``Medicaid facility'' is commonly 
used to designate Medicaid certification, regardless of 
whether or not the entire facility is occupied by Medicaid 
eligible patients. 



Proposed  488.228 Alternative or Additional State 
Remedies (now incorporated in  488.406) 
Proposed  488.230 Civil Money Penalties 



In the final rule, we are redesignating proposed 
 488.230 as the following sections: 








Comment:

 We received many general comments regarding 
civil money penalties. A few commenters who supported this 
provision of the regulation stated they believed in a swift 
and certain fine structure which is mandatory in nature and 
imposed directly on ownership. 



Response:

 We appreciate the support of these commenters 
who realize that civil money penalties can be an effective 
remedy to encourage prompt compliance with participation 
requirements as well as to promote the continued rendering 
of quality health care in a safe environment. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that we prohibit the 
recoupment of fines through rate increases.

 Several other commenters believed civil money 
penalties do not work, are not the answer, serve no purpose 
or are an insult to professionals. 



Response:

 We do not agree with these comments. We have 
the statutory responsibility to do what is necessary to 
promote the continued health and safety of residents in long 
term care facilities. We cannot say at this point that 
civil money penalties do not work. We can say the 
Congress perceived the effectiveness of this remedy and 
included it among the other remedies established to 
encourage prompt compliance with participation requirements. 



Comment:

 A few commenters stated that civil money 
penalties are not necessary, as there is an extensive list 
of available remedies. 



Response:

 We agree that there are many available 
remedies that can be used. We are including at  488.404 
the factors to be considered when selecting the most 
effective enforcement remedy. OBRA '87 included revised and 
expanded authority for the enforcement of the Federal 
participation requirements for long-term care facilities 
which allow State and Federal governments to choose the most 
effective remedy to encourage rapid compliance with 
participation requirements. We do not agree with the 
statement that civil money penalties are not necessary, 
because using civil money penalties as a remedy provides 
another enforcement option for addressing the unique 
characteristics of each case of facility noncompliance. 



Comment:

 A few commenters said that civil money 
penalties are not fair and must be reasonable and realistic. 



Response:

 The ranges in the amounts of the civil money 
penalties are commensurate with the level of SNF or NF 
noncompliance and, we believe, permit penalties to be 
imposed in a fair, reasonable and realistic manner. In 
fact, the higher and wider range of fines ($3,050 to $10,000 
per day) is reserved for immediate jeopardy deficiencies, 
even though these deficiencies account for a very small 
minority of the cases of noncompliance. 



Comment:

 Several commenters expressed concern that 
civil money penalties will drive up the cost to the taxpayer 
and increase the government's debt. 



Response:

 Increased cost to taxpayers as a result of 
civil money penalties is possible if civil money penalties 
are imposed on publicly funded facilities. To the extent 
that such a provider's operation is characterized by 
deficiencies, and costs are excessive, financial burdens are 
imposed on the taxpayers. However, the money collected from 
penalties does not increase the Federal debt as it is 
returned to the Medicare Trust Fund or is earmarked for the 
protection of the health or property of Medicaid residents. 
Therefore, money is indirectly returned to the taxpayers' 
benefit. 



Comment:

 Several commenters expressed the concern that 
civil money penalties could cause small, independent, 
primarily Medicaid supported, rural facilities to be closed 
down, possibly displacing residents from their community 
home. 



Response:

 We reject this argument. Sections 
1819(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act state 
that the Secretary or the State 

may

 (emphasis added) impose 
a civil money penalty. A civil money penalty need not be 
imposed in every situation. The Act provides the Secretary 
and the State the authority to choose a remedy which 
corresponds to the unique characteristics of each case. In 
addition,  488.438 states that a facility's financial 
condition is a factor considered in determining the amount 
of the civil money penalty. 



Comment:

 Several commenters are concerned that the 
imposition of civil money penalties could detract from 
resident care or redirect funds that could be used to 
continue to improve care.

Response:

 We do not accept this comment. First, the 
money that is collected from civil money penalties is either 
transferred into the Medicare Trust Fund or is earmarked for 
the protection of Medicaid residents' health or property. 
Second, as soon as substantial compliance is achieved, civil 
money penalties are discontinued. Therefore, the facility 
is in control of how much money it ultimately is responsible 
for paying; that is, the sooner it corrects deficiencies, 
the less penalties it will pay. 



Comment:

 A professional organization commented that the 
proposed section on civil money penalties does not reflect 
all of the points discussed by the Institute of Medicine in 
its study, 

Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes

 
(1986). The Institute of Medicine envisioned civil money 
penalties as a valuable enforcement tool which could be 
applied in amounts appropriate to the seriousness, duration 
and repeat occurrence of the violation. It recommended 
prompt, short hearings on the imposition of the remedy, that 
fines be large enough to be more costly than the violation, 
and that fines be versatile enough to be used to correct 
minor violations, as well as to immediately punish life 
threatening violations. 



Response:

 We believe the regulatory provisions for 
civil money penalties encompass the above referenced points 
from the Institute of Medicine. The only point of departure 
is the suggestion with regard to promptness. Section 1128A 
of the Act requires that a hearing be provided to a provider 
that properly requests one before HCFA collects a civil 
money penalty. Section 1919(h)(8) of the Act requires the 
State to offer a hearing before collecting a civil money 
penalty. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the civil money 
penalty system be changed to a monetary award program. 
Facilities in compliance with the regulations would be 
rewarded. This would lead to improved resident care and 
provide an incentive for the employees. 



Response:

 We do not accept this comment. Provisions 
for civil money penalties are located in sections 
1819(h)(2)(B)(ii), 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) and 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) 
of the Act as part of an enforcement process. They are 
options that the Secretary and the State may exercise when 
SNFs and NFs are not in substantial compliance with 
participation requirements. Removing civil money penalties 
as an enforcement option and substituting a monetary reward 
system would not reflect the law as written. For 
participants in the Medicaid program, the State may 
separately establish a program to reward, through public 
recognition or incentive payments, or both, providers that 
provide the highest quality care. This reward provision is 
specified at  488.303 of this rule. 



Comment:

 Several State civil monetary penalty systems 
were submitted with the comments on the proposed rule for 
review. Different commenters recommended that HCFA adopt 
and/or evaluate these civil money penalty systems. 



Response:

 Before developing regulations for civil money 
penalties, we met with the nursing home industry, consumer 
groups and government entities to obtain input in the 
development of the proposed rule. In addition, we reviewed 
a variety of State civil money penalty systems. We do not 
believe we have sufficient data at this time to justify 
abandoning the system we developed in the proposed rule in 
favor of another or to cause us to consider any State's 
program to be more effective than the civil money penalty 
system in the regulation at this time. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested changing ``HCFA or the 
State may impose * * *'' to ``HCFA or the State shall impose * * *'' 
at proposed  488.230(a)(1). The commenter's rationale is 
that if facilities are required to pay for every instance of 
noncompliance, compliance would be maintained and additional 
funds could be used to support critical areas, such as, Long 
Term Care Ombudsman Programs. 



Response:

 The regulation reflects the corresponding 
provisions of the Act. The Act permits HCFA's and the 
States' discretion in the imposition of this enforcement 
remedy. The Federal government cannot require the States to 
use this remedy in every instance of noncompliance, nor must 
it choose this remedy itself in every instance of 
noncompliance. 



Comment:

 Another commenter suggested that HCFA 
interpret its authority to include the delegation of the 
imposition of civil money penalties to the States for 
Medicare purposes when HCFA determines that it is 
appropriate. The commenter also suggested the State could 
recommend a civil money penalty, HCFA could monitor the 
State's performance in this area and funds collected could 
offset State costs in performing this task.

Response:

 The Act does not permit the Secretary to 
delegate the authority to impose a civil money penalty on a 
Medicare participating facility to the State. Section 
1819(h)(2) of the Act charges the Secretary, upon the 
recommendation of the State, with the authority to impose 
remedies. HCFA's decision to monitor a State's performance 
does not hinge on the imposition of civil money penalties. 
Further, any civil money penalties collected under Medicare 
will be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. 



Comment:

 A few commenters are concerned that the 
proposed definition of deficiency will make any failure to 
comply, no matter how small, subject to a fine. 



Response:

 We agree with the commenters' concern that, 
as described in the proposed rule, very minimal deficiencies 
could be subject to civil money penalties. As a result, we 
revised the rule and developed enforcement action categories 
which correspond to the seriousness of the deficiencies. 
These enforcement action categories are described at 
 488.408, Selection of remedies. 

Also, as discussed previously in this preamble, we are 
accepting the commenters' implicit suggestion to incorporate 
the concept of substantial compliance as a standard SNFs and 
NFs must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs. Using the standard of performance of substantial 
compliance for these providers ensures virtual compliance 
with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b), (c), and 
(d) of the Act because the type of deficiency tolerated 
under a substantial compliance standard is very limited. We 
are defining substantial compliance at  488.301. We 
consider substantial compliance to satisfy a facility's 
obligation to meet requirements. Therefore, facilities in 
substantial compliance adequately protect the health and 
safety of nursing home residents and will not be subject to 
a civil money penalty. 



Section 488.430 Basis for Imposing Penalty





Comment:

 Several commenters were confused and requested 
that we clarify the number of days of noncompliance between 
two certifications of compliance at proposed 
 488.230(a)(2). 



Response:

 We revised this paragraph of the rule and 
redesignated it as  488.430(b). It now provides that HCFA 
or the State may impose a civil money penalty for the number 
of days of past noncompliance since the last standard 
survey, including the days of immediate jeopardy. We 
believe that this revision implements sections 1819(h) and 
1919(h) of the Act, which state that if a facility meets the 
requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d), but as of a 
previous period did not meet such requirements, a civil 
money penalty could be imposed for the days in which the 
facility was not in compliance with the requirements. We 
believe this statutory provision permits a civil money 
penalty to be imposed whenever there is past noncompliance 
with the participation requirements between standard 
surveys. The following example illustrates one application 
of this provision: A facility had a survey on July 1, 1993, 
and it was in substantial compliance with all of the 
participation requirements. During the orientation tour at 
the next survey, June 15, 1994, surveyors observed 
questionable infection control procedures. This observation 
prompted the surveyors to further examine records and the 
facility's infection control program. This examination 
indicated that the facility was out of compliance with 
infection control requirements ( 483.65) from October 15 to 
October 30, 1993. However, at the time of the June 15, 
1994, survey, the facility was again in substantial 
compliance with participation requirements. The number of 
days of noncompliance would be 16, which is the number of 
days between (and including) October 15 and October 30. 
This noncompliance existed for 16 days, but it did not exist 
at the time of either survey. 

Although we may have discretion with respect to the 
selection of remedies to address noncompliance that is 
corrected by the time of a survey, it is likely that we 
would give serious consideration to civil money penalties in 
such cases. The Act, at sections 1819(h)(1) and 1919(h) (1) 
and (3), expressly authorizes the impositions of these 
sanctions even if, at the time of the survey, the facility 
is in substantial compliance. 



Comment:

 Another commenter suggested incorporating 
language which says, ``HCFA or the State may impose a civil 
money penalty for the number of days of noncompliance 
between two certifications of compliance if the deficiency 
was at a severity level of 4 and the facility could have 
prevented it.'' 



Response:

 We do not accept this suggestion. Adding 
this language narrows the authority of the Secretary and the 
State. Limiting this enforcement authority could allow 
noncompliance to go unsanctioned. We see no justification 
for narrowing this authority. 



Comment:

 A consumer organization specifically 
recommended we clarify proposed  488.230(a)(2) to say, ``the 
penalty accrues as of the first day that noncompliance 
existed in a previous period.'' Resident records or resident 
witnesses with corroboration would be sufficient evidence to 
determine noncompliance. 



Response:

 In this final rule, we are revising this 
paragraph to provide that HCFA or the State may impose a 
civil money penalty for the number of days of past 
noncompliance since the last standard survey, including the 
number of days of immediate jeopardy. It is evident in this 
situation the civil money penalty could be imposed for all 
of the days of noncompliance. We do not accept the 
suggestion to incorporate into the regulation what specific 
evidence must be used to determine noncompliance, as each 
situation of noncompliance is unique. 



Comment:

 Several commenters recommended that the word 
``impose'' be changed to ``collect'' at proposed 
 488.230(a)(2), since the Act authorizes the use of civil 
money penalties for past noncompliance that has been 
corrected. 



Response:

 While it is true that the Act specifies that 
a civil money penalty may be imposed for past noncompliance 
that has been corrected, it is not necessarily true that a 
civil money penalty will be collected in every case. For 
instance, if a facility prevails at a hearing, a civil money 
penalty will not be collected. Accordingly, we are not 
adopting this recommendation. 



Comment:

 A provider organization suggested that we 
expand proposed  488.230(b) by adding, ``(2) HCFA will not 
and the State may not impose a civil money penalty on a 
facility that is being terminated or is under temporary 
management or a denial of payment for all new admissions, 
except for a denial of payment under paragraph (a)(1) of 
[proposed]  488.217.''

Response: 

The purpose of all remedies is to protect 
residents against inadequate care and to motivate providers 
to promptly comply with the participation requirements so 
they may continue to provide quality services. Sections 
1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act specify that the State or 
HCFA may impose multiple sanctions to achieve these 
purposes. Limiting the authority of the Secretary and the 
State, as suggested by this comment, would reduce the 
ability of the Secretary and the State to tailor remedies to 
fit each unique situation of noncompliance, particularly 
those situations in which multiple remedies are warranted. 
If HCFA or the State chooses to impose a remedy, the 
procedures set forth in   488.404 and 488.408 of this rule 
are followed to determine the most appropriate remedy or 
remedies. 



Section 488.432 When Penalty Is Collected 





Comment: 

Many commenters questioned the proposed 
provisions of  488.230(b) which stated that HCFA will not 
and the State may not impose a civil money penalty while the 
facility has a hearing pending on the imposition of a 
remedy. A few commenters recommended that the word ``impose'' 
be changed to ``collect'' at  488.230(b). Commenters wanted 
more information about: 

 When a fine begins; 

 Whether a fine is assessed for the days between the 
survey date and the hearing date, or only for days after the 
hearing date; 
 Whether there is a conflict between  488.230(b) and 
 488.230(i) of the proposed rule. 

The commenters' recommendations included: 
 Stop the assessment of civil money penalties on the 
date that a formal hearing is requested. If the appeal 
outcome upholds the remedy then the civil money penalty is 
imposed retroactive to the date that the appeal was 
requested. 
 Permit the States and HCFA to impose but not collect a 
civil money penalty during the pendency of any hearing. The 
penalty would accumulate during the appeal until the 
deficiency is corrected or the appeal is decided; and 
 Do not stop the clock from running on a civil money 
penalty while the appeal is pending, as this can insulate 
noncompliant facilities against the imposition of these 
penalties. 



Response: 

We are revising redesignated  488.432 to be 
more specific and discuss when penalties are collected. We 
say that, when a facility requests a hearing on the 
noncompliance which led to the imposition of the civil money 
penalty, HCFA or the State will not initiate collection of 
the penalty until a final administrative decision is 
rendered which upholds the determination of noncompliance. 

If a facility does not request a hearing within the time 
period for requesting a hearing, collection of the penalty 
will begin when the facility achieves substantial compliance 
or is terminated. If a facility waives its right to a 
hearing in writing within 60 days of the date of the notice 
of intent to impose the penalty, collection is initiated 
when the facility achieves substantial compliance with the 
participation requirements or is terminated. This section 
now references  488.440, which discusses the accrual of the 
civil money penalty and computation and notice of the amount 
due, and  488.442, which discusses when payments for civil 
money penalties are due. 



Comment: 

A commenter stated the proposed regulation 
does not permit the survey agency to impose a remedy for a 
second deficiency found as a result of a complaint survey 
until a pending hearing on a deficiency cited from a 
previous survey is concluded. 



Response: 

This regulatory provision does not compromise 
the ability of the Secretary or the State to impose another 
remedy if one is warranted for a second situation of 
noncompliance before a final administrative decision is 
concluded on the first situation of noncompliance which has 
led to the pending imposition of a civil money penalty. 
However, if a civil money penalty is the preferred remedy 
for the second instance of noncompliance, as it was for the 
first, it will not be collected until the final 
administrative decision supporting its imposition is 
concluded. In this case, the State or HCFA could increase 
the civil money penalty amount if the noncompliance found 
later creates a situation of immediate jeopardy. If the 
second situation of noncompliance results from repeated 
deficiencies, HCFA or the State would increase the civil 
money penalty. However, the noncompliance found at a later 
time may warrant a remedy other than a civil money penalty 
which could be imposed before there is a final 
administrative decision on the first situation of 
noncompliance.

Comment: 

We received many comments stating that the 
proposed process will precipitate prolonged appeals without 
civil money penalties ever being assessed. 



Response: 

The Act requires that an administrative 
appeal be provided before civil money penalties are 
collected. Even a prolonged appeals process does not 
eliminate the civil money penalty unless the facility 
prevails at the hearing. For example, if a provider 
achieves substantial compliance by the time of the appeal, 
the correction is only relevant from the standpoint of the 
number of days the penalty applies. The fact that a 
facility achieves substantial compliance before the hearing 
does not eliminate the need for the hearing. If the 
facility does not prevail in the hearing, the civil money 
penalty is collectible for each day of noncompliance. 



Comment: 

Commenters endorsed incorporating a variety of 
ideas into the final rule to discourage frivolous appeals, 
including the following: provide for the accrual of 
interest pending appeal at a rate fixed by the State, 
stipulate that attorney fees will not be paid and are not an 
allowable cost if the appeal is unsuccessful, and, as stated 
in the Institute of Medicine Report, deny payment of 
provider fees for unsuccessful appeals of survey related 
costs. Another commenter requested the rule be revised to 
include that facilities not be allowed to claim on State or 
Federal income taxes civil money penalties and legal 
expenses upheld on appeal. 



Response: 

We do not support these revisions. It would 
not be fair practice to assess interest on a civil money 
penalty before the provider knows the outcome of the hearing 
on the imposition of that penalty. To charge interest for 
the time period during which a hearing is pending would be 
tantamount to punishing the provider for exercising its 
right to have an administrative hearing, as provided for in 
sections 1128A(c)(2) and 1919(h)(8) of the Act. Regarding 
the comments about attorney fees, other provider costs and 
income taxes, these payment issues are not addressed in the 
Act and are beyond the scope of this regulation. 



Section 488.434 Notice of Penalty





Comment: 

One commenter asked for further clarification 
of HCFA notice of penalty and State notice of penalty 
provisions of the regulation. 



Response: 

We revised the content of  488.434 to be 
more specific regarding the notice of intent to impose the 
penalty. The rule now states that, when HCFA proposes to 
impose a civil money penalty, it would deliver or send to 
the provider written notice of its intent to impose the 
penalty. The notice would include reference to the 
statutory basis for the penalty; the nature of the 
noncompliance; the amount of the penalty per day of 
noncompliance; any factors specified in  488.438(f) that 
were considered when determining the amount per day of the 
proposed penalty; the date the penalty starts accruing; when 
the penalty will stop accruing; when collection of the 
penalty will be made; and instructions for responding to the 
notice. These instructions would include a specific 
statement of the facility's right to a hearing and the 
implications of waiving a hearing. 

The rule now states that, when the State imposes a civil 
money penalty in the case of any non-State operated nursing 
facility, the State must notify the facility in accordance 
with State procedures; however, the State's notice must be 
written and it must include, at a minimum, the information 
specified in the HCFA notice of penalty as stated above. 



Comment: 

A few commenters were concerned about 
implementation of civil money penalties if HCFA could not 
issue the notice in a timely manner. 



Response: 

Although HCFA and the State will proceed 
quickly to issue notice of the imposition of the civil money 
penalty, its imposition does not hinge on specified 
notification timeframes. The notice of the imposition of 
the penalty is not required before a civil money penalty can 
start to accrue, since the Act permits the imposition of 
civil money penalties for past violations that have been 
corrected, and the penalty may start accruing as early as 
the date the facility was first out of compliance. For 
these reasons, in  488.402, we exclude the civil money 
penalty remedy in the discussion of the notification 
requirements when remedies are imposed.

Comment:

 One provider organization recommended revising the notice of penalty section to specify that the State sends the
notice via certified mail in all cases except State operated facilities and other facilities when HCFA is imposing
the penalty based on a validation survey. This comment also listed specifics to be included in the notice.

Another commenter recommended that the notification requirements HCFA uses when it imposes the civil money penalty
must also be the minimal standards applied to the State, instead of allowing the State's notice to be prepared in accordance
with State's procedures.



Response: 

We are not accepting the suggestion that the notice be sent via certified mail because this would preclude sending
a valid notice via other means, such as telefax, telegram, commercial overnight delivery services, or other means
that may be faster. In fact, for these reasons we are revising this section of the rule to eliminate the requirement
that the notice be sent by mail with a return receipt requested. Also, to have the State send the penalty notice to Medicare
participating facilities and to dually participating facilities, as the commenter suggests, would be inappropriate
as HCFA provides notices for Medicare facilities.

We accept the comment to require that the contents included in the HCFA notice of penalty be contained in the State notice
of penalty. Accordingly, as stated in a previous response, we are revising redesignated  488.434 to provide
that the State must notify the facility in accordance with State procedures for all non-State operated NFs when the
State takes the action; however, the State's notice must be written and must include, at a minimum, the information
specified in redesignated  488.434(a). This revision is consistent with existing policy in prescribing the
content of State notices in Medicaid provider termination cases and other Medicaid and AFDC matters.



Section 488.436 Waiver of Hearing; Reduction of Penalty Amount





Comment:

 We received many comments opposing the facility's opportunity to have a 35 percent reduction in the civil money penalty
if the facility waived its right to a hearing. Commenters said that this provision is inappropriate in the regulatory
process, not reflective of Congressional intent, insulting, tantamount to blackmail and plea bargaining and without
statutory basis for offering a bonus to providers who waive their appeal rights. Some commenters objected to the 35
percent reduction if a facility waives its right to a hearing because they felt a justified penalty should be imposed
without any compromise or reduction. Another commenter stated that, if the penalties reflect the deficiencies,
then reducing the penalty amount makes the penalty lose some of its deterrent value. One commenter was concerned that
the waiver of hearing provision, as written, may induce HCFA or the State to inflate the penalty. Then, if the penalty
is reduced 35 percent because of the waiver, the fine amount is the amount it would have been before the reduction.

A commenter agreed with this regulatory provision on waiver of a hearing and stated that this is appropriate since
informal conflict resolution can be used to eliminate misunderstandings or deficiencies that are not supported
by the evidence.



Response: 

The 35 percent reduction in the civil money penalty afforded providers for waiver of right to appeal is based on a State
model ( 488.436). Providers are free to reject the option to waive the right to a hearing. The intent behind this
regulatory provision is to encourage facilities to carefully consider their position in terms of substantial compliance,
as well as the costs they will incur in litigating the matter, before tying up already overburdened hearing resources.

Also, if we are not confronted with the administrative costs of litigation, we believe we should consider offsetting
civil money penalty amounts accordingly. On its face, these waiver provisions could seem to lessen the deterrent
value of the civil money penalty. However, a 35 percent reduction of a $10,000 per day civil money penalty leaves a penalty
amount of $6,500 per each day of noncompliance, and this is a significant deterrent to continued noncompliance.

We disagree with the comment that the waiver provision may induce HCFA or the State to inflate the penalty because the
per day amount of the civil money penalty will be determined before the facility would have the opportunity to exercise
its option to waive a hearing. This is because the notice of the intent to impose the penalty includes the amount of the
penalty per day of noncompliance, as well as the option to waive the hearing.

Regarding dispute resolution, we appreciate the support of this commenter and agree that dispute resolution is an
appropriate vehicle afforded the provider to address survey finding issues. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that the waiver should not permit the facility to deny the existence of the deficiency for the
purpose of determining whether repeat violations exist.

Response:

 The opportunity to waive the right to a hearing and consequently receive a 35 percent reduction in the amount of the
civil money penalty does not permit the facility to deny the existence of deficiencies for any purpose, nor will waiver
of the right to a hearing remove the deficiencies from the facility's record. When a facility waives its right to a hearing,
it is in effect not contesting the deficiency. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested replacing 

may 

with 

must

 as alternative language indicating that, ``HCFA or the State 

must

 reduce the civil money penalty.'' A few commenters stated that the language used in the preamble regarding proposed
 488.230(e) renders the reduction in the penalty mandatory, and the language used in the regulation text is
permissive. 



Response:

 We erred in the proposed text. We accept the suggestion and intended to require that, when a facility requests a waiver
of a hearing in writing, within the 60 day timeframe, HCFA or the State reduces the civil money penalty amount by 35 percent,
and we are revising the final rule accordingly. We are also adding a paragraph to specify that, if the facility does
not waive its right to a hearing, in writing, within 60 days from the date of the notice of intent to impose the penalty,
the civil money penalty is not reduced. We believe the specified timeframe gives the provider ample opportunity to
decide whether or not to exercise its option to waive a hearing. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that allowing a reduction in the amount of the civil money penalty will necessitate that States
develop and implement complicated and costly accounting systems for recordkeeping and reporting purposes. Another
commenter suggested that the collection of civil money penalties will be very confusing and they would rather have
lower penalty amounts than the opportunity for a 35 percent reduction. 



Response:

 Less litigation as a result of the waiver of hearing provision more than compensates for the recordkeeping and reporting
necessary to implement the 35 percent reductions in civil money penalties. We are striving not only to reduce litigation
costs but also to reduce the considerable investment of time necessary to prepare for and participate in a hearing.
Imposing lower fine amounts instead of allowing the 35 percent reduction for a waiver is not in keeping with the reasons,
as stated above, for having this provision. 



Comment:

 A few commenters requested that the reduction of the civil money penalty amount when a facility waives its right to
a hearing be 50 percent. Another suggestion was permitting a reduction of up to 35 percent. One commenter recommended
the percent reduction be 10 percent and only available upon prompt payment. 



Response:

 We believe that 35 percent is reasonable and appropriate, based on our review of an existing State model, and it approximates
the savings we believe are possible by not litigating these cases. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the waiver of appeal rights submitted be written and that 50 percent of the civil money
penalty be paid within 15 days from the date of notification. 



Response:

 We accept the suggestion that the waiver be in writing and have made this revision in the final rule. We do not accept
the suggestion that 50 percent of the penalty be paid within 15 days from the date of the receipt of a request to waive
appeal rights. If a facility waives its right to request a hearing in accordance with the provisions specified in  488.436,
and subsequently receives a 35 percent reduction in the amount of the penalty owed, we do not believe it is necessary
to also offer the facility the opportunity to pay only 50 percent of the civil money penalty at that time. To accept partial
payments of a civil money penalty creates an unnecessary recordkeeping system and detracts from the financial incentive
to motivate compliance which civil money penalties were intended to create. Also, we specified in the regulation
that the entire penalty is payable on the due date, and that date would be 15 days after receipt of the waiver request
if the facility has achieved substantial compliance with the requirements or the facility has been terminated. However,
if the facility has not achieved substantial compliance or been terminated when the waiver request is received, the
civil money penalty would continue to accrue until the facility achieves substantial compliance or is terminated.
The due dates for civil money penalties are specified in  488.442.

Comment: 

A few commenters proposed that the number of 
days in which a facility may request, or waive the right to, 
a hearing be changed. The alternatives were 10, 20 or 30 
days. 



Response: 

We do not accept the commenters' 
recommendations to change the number of days in which a 
facility may request or waive its right to a hearing. The 
existing 60 day timeframe to request a hearing has been 
effective in accommodating the needs of the government to 
move quickly in situations of noncompliance without unduly 
compromising the due process considerations of the provider. 
It often provides sufficient time to the facility to resolve 
disagreements prior to the initiation of costly litigation 
or, failing resolution of disagreements, adequate time to 
prepare for a hearing. To adopt a shorter timeframe, as 
suggested by the commenters, could compromise these 
opportunities. 



Comment: 

A couple of the commenters offered the 
following alternative text for proposed  488.230(e): ``The 
facility must pay the civil money penalty that was imposed, 
less 35 percent, and correct the deficiencies for which the 
civil money was imposed, within 10 days of receipt of the 
notice. This waiver of hearing is called settlement.'' 



Response: 

We do not accept these comments. We believe 
these suggestions do not allow a facility enough time to 
make a decision regarding whether to waive or request a 
hearing. 



Section 488.438 Amount of Penalty 





Comment: 

Several commenters supported the ``two tier'' 
civil money penalty system as enunciated in proposed 
 488.230(f)(1). 



Response: 

We appreciate the support of these commenters 
for this regulatory provision. 



Comment: 

Many commenters believed that the civil money 
penalty fines of up to $10,000 a day are excessive and 
exorbitant. A few comments stated that the range is too 
broad and would create inconsistency on a national level. 
Some commenters said that imposing civil money penalties for 
non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies is severely punitive and 
``overreacting'' and they should only be imposed in severe, 
life threatening or repeated situations. 



Response: 

The Act allows a maximum civil money penalty 
of $10,000 per day of noncompliance. By designating the 
highest two thirds of the civil money penalties as the 
immediate jeopardy range, we believe we have developed a 
system for the States to use under which relatively few 
facilities will be subject to a maximum penalty. We expect 
that the higher penalties will seldom be imposed, because 
situations involving immediate jeopardy occur far less 
frequently than those with no immediate jeopardy. 
Furthermore, the range of civil money penalties for 
immediate jeopardy cases is broad enough to allow us the 
flexibility to impose the maximum civil money penalty in 
only the most egregious cases and some lower amount within 
the range for other situations of immediate jeopardy. We 
believe penalties imposed in the immediate jeopardy range 
are justified because residents are in life threatening 
situations, and we want to motivate the facility to 
immediately correct deficiencies. We set the amounts of the 
penalties within the two ranges to allow consideration of 
the unique characteristics of each situation of 
noncompliance. It is inappropriate to refer to a 
``consistent'' application of civil money penalties because 
each situation of noncompliance and the factors that affect 
the amount of the civil money penalty are unique for each 
facility. 



Comment: 

Several commenters stated that the civil money 
penalty system appears to duplicate existing State systems 
and doubled fines could financially destroy facilities. A 
few commenters asked that the proposed rule be amended to 
allow States to use their civil money penalty system when 
they have demonstrated that their system is effective. 



Response: 

The Medicare and Medicaid programs are 
separate and distinct from State licensure programs. It is 
possible that a civil money penalty could be imposed under 
the State licensure program as well as under the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs; however, there is no reason to assume 
that the penalties would be doubled.

A State can use its licensure civil money penalty system for Medicaid purposes when it has demonstrated its effectiveness
in accordance with  488.406. These provisions state that alternative State remedies for facilities participating
in Medicaid may be imposed if the State demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective
in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as the HCFA remedies. 



Comment: 

A few commenters recommended that civil money penalties be significantly reduced, because if a facility receives
a civil money penalty of $5,000 or more, that facility loses its ability to train nurse aides. 



Response: 

As stated above, the $10,000 per day civil money penalty limit is established in the Act. While the Act gives the State
and the Secretary the discretion to impose a penalty as high as the limit, we will not, as a matter of policy, lower civil
money penalty amounts in specific cases to preclude facilities from losing their ability to train nurse aides. If
a civil money penalty of $5,000 or more is imposed on a facility, it is indicative of the fact that an egregious situation
of immediate jeopardy exists. In this case, we believe the facility's ability to continue to train nurse aides is compromised
and the facility should lose approval of its nurse aide training and competency evaluation program. However, as we
have already stated, we anticipate that the higher penalties will seldom be imposed, as situations involving immediate
jeopardy occur far less frequently than those with no immediate jeopardy. 



Comment: 

One commenter recommended revising proposed  488.230(f)(2) to specify that a civil money penalty may not be
one of the alternative remedies imposed when a facility does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of
payment and HCFA will or the State must terminate a provider's agreement. Also, the commenter recommended that neither
HCFA nor the State may impose more than four penalties against a facility on the basis of a single survey and the maximum
total penalty amount that may be imposed against a facility during any twelve-month period is five hundred dollars
per licensed or certified bed. 



Response: 

The Act does not preclude the imposition of a civil money penalty remedy as an enforcement option when the facility
does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment or is terminated. In fact, section 1919(h)(7)
of the Act discusses the special rules applicable when other remedies additional or alternative to termination are
imposed. Concerning the specified amount of the penalty that can be imposed per licensed or certified bed during a
specific time period, the Act does not specify such a limitation, and utilizing these limitations would unnecessarily
restrict the authority of the Secretary and the State to tailor a civil money penalty remedy to the specific situation
of noncompliance. However, the Act does set dollar limitations for each day of noncompliance. Therefore, the Act
contemplates that all deficiencies will be aggregated for the purposes of determining the number of days of noncompliance
(as opposed to the number of deficiencies). 



Comment: 

A few commenters requested that we clarify if survey agencies may exceed the specified penalty ranges when a facility
alleges compliance but a revisit by HCFA or the State finds noncompliance. One commenter recommended that the penalty
be doubled in this situation even if it exceeds the penalty limit. Another commenter suggested replacing 

may 

with 

shall 

at proposed  488.230(f)(3) so that this section reads, ``HCFA or the State shall increase the daily penalty
if the facility alleges compliance * * *.'' 

One commenter disagreed with  488.230(f)(3) concerning HCFA's or the State's ability to increase the daily
penalty if the facility alleges compliance but a revisit finds noncompliance. The commenter recommended including
an objective and quantifiable basis for increasing such penalties or deleting this regulatory provision. Another
commenter suggested increasing the civil money penalty when a facility alleges completion of its plan of correction,
but a revisit finds the facility has not completed its plan. 



Response: 

As noted above, we are revising redesignated  488.438 to provide that a civil money penalty would be decreased
to the lower range of penalty amounts if a revisit determines that the immediate jeopardy is removed but the noncompliance
continues. However, if the noncompliance, that continues constitutes repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory
grouping of requirements, the civil money penalty would be increased, as specified in sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and
1919(h)(2)(A) and (h)(3)(C) of the Act. A civil money penalty could be increased to the upper range of penalty amounts
if deficiencies for which a lower level penalty amount was imposed have become sufficiently serious to pose immediate
jeopardy. We are also revising  488.438 to provide that civil money penalties are increased, even if a new penalty
amount exceeds the range for nonimmediate jeopardy, when deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements
for which a civil money penalty was imposed are repeated. 

We cannot accept the suggestion to increase a civil money penalty if a facility does not follow its plan of correction.
When a remedy is lifted for a facility, it is based on that facility's substantial compliance with the requirements,
not on the facility's adherence to its plan of correction. The health or safety of a resident could be jeopardized by
a situation in which a plan of correction was followed but the facility was still not in substantial compliance with
the participation requirements.

Comment: 

One commenter stated that there is no provision in the regulation which would prohibit daily penalties from mounting.
This commenter added that this is not reflective of the Congressional intent behind sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4)
of the Act, which says that a finding to deny payment terminates when the State or Secretary finds that the facility
is in substantial compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d). 



Response: 

A facility can always stop the accrual of a civil money penalty by correcting the situation that caused the noncompliance.
With regard to all remedies, we received many comments recommending that the standard of substantial compliance
with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b), (c), and (d) of the Act be incorporated into the rule as an acceptable
measure of compliance. As discussed previously in this preamble, we accept this comment and we will lift remedies
imposed for noncompliance when a facility is in substantial compliance with sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b),
(c), and (d) of the Act. 



Comment: 

A few commenters requested we add, at proposed  488.230(f), that interest accrues on all penalties not settled,
at the credit card rate, from the date of citation. 



Response: 

We do not accept this comment. Redesignated  488.438 discusses the base amount of the civil money penalties.
We do not think it is appropriate to incorporate the interest rate in this section. A discussion of interest follows
in redesignated  488.442. 



Comment: 

One commenter suggested that when noncompliance could financially benefit a facility, the amount of the penalty
should never be less than twice what the State or HCFA can reasonably assume to have been the savings to the facility,
as a facility should never believe it is in its financial self-interest to violate the law. This commenter also said
that HCFA and the State should have access to any data (employee salaries, fees, supply costs, etc.) that will provide
necessary information to determine the amount of the penalty. 



Response: 

We do not agree. First, it would be beyond the scope of this rule to require the State to determine or for HCFA to try to
determine when noncompliance would financially benefit a facility. Moreover, to provide that civil money penalties
be twice the presumed savings incurred by the facility would be to establish an arbitrary requirement that would unnecessarily
complicate using civil money penalties as an enforcement option. 

A facility that perceives it is in its financial self interest to violate the law commits a grave error as it could face
termination of its provider agreement for noncompliance. 



Comment: 

A few commenters recommended that all minimum penalty amounts specified at proposed  488.230(f) and the ``per
day'' modifiers in the regulation be deleted to permit the Secretary or the State more discretion when imposing civil
money penalty amounts. 



Response: 

We do not accept these comments. The minimum penalty amount is set at $50 because we believe that any lesser amount would
not be a remedy for any provider. The $50 minimum penalty amount also corresponds to the imposition of civil money penalties
in increments of $50; this process was designed for purposes of simplicity of implementation. 

The Act specifies that a civil money penalty may be imposed for each day of noncompliance. We believe that removing
references to ``per day'' alters the clear instructions specified in the Act. Furthermore, the Secretary and the
State always have discretion to impose or not to impose a civil money penalty, since the law states that a civil money
penalty 

may

 be imposed for each day of noncompliance. 



Comment: 

Many commenters responded that the factors used to determine the amount of the civil money penalty are too broad and
will promote inconsistency. A commenter posed that these factors are subjective, not uniform, and therefore, are
challengeable in a court of law. A few commenters suggested removing the factors used to determine the amount of the
civil money penalty from the final regulation while a few said that HCFA and the State should be required to give due
consideration to the information provided by the facility.

Many commenters were generally negative in response to 
using the facility's financial condition as a factor 
affecting the amount of penalty and offered the following 
arguments about this policy: 
 It is not equitable; 
 It would result in inconsistent civil money penalties 
for the same deficiency; 
 Poorly managed and/or not-for-profit facilities should 
not be excused or pay a lower civil money penalty; 
 It discriminates against facilities that are more 
solvent; 
 It is inappropriate if the facility can not appeal the 
amount of the penalty; 
 Neither the Secretary nor the States have adequate 
information to evaluate a facility's financial condition; 
 It would be difficult to apply objectively and would 
require an audit of the facility; and 
 The regulation does not clarify how financial 
information is obtained, who evaluates this information and 
if it will be available promptly. 
Another commenter requested that we remove a facility's 
financial condition as a factor and consider instead the 
location of the facility and the percent of Medicaid or 
Medicare patient days relative to the total patient days of 
the facility. 
A few commenters suggested including the facility's 
degree of culpability as a factor in determining the amount 
of the civil money penalty as mentioned in the preamble of 
the proposed rule. 


Response:

 In determining the amount of the penalty, 
section 1128A of the Act, which is incorporated by reference 
into sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act, requires the 
Secretary to consider specific matters and also provides 
authority to take into account any other items relevant to 
the penalty determination. We are requiring the State to 
also consider these specific matters to make Medicare and 
Medicaid requirements equivalent for SNFs and NFs. The 
specific matters the Secretary and the State must take into 
account, as stipulated in section 1128A of the Act, include 
the facility's degree of culpability, history of prior 
offenses and financial condition. Therefore, we cannot 
remove financial condition as the commenters suggested, and 
we are revising redesignated  488.438(f) to include the 
facility's degree of culpability, which was inadvertently 
omitted from the proposed regulatory text. 
We explain in  488.438 what we mean by ``culpability'' in 
the context of provider certification. Section 1128A 
authorizes civil money penalties for criminal or quasi-criminal acts, such as, false claims or claims for charges

in excess of those permitted by law. The intent of the 
individual who commits one of these acts plays a prominent 
role in determining the amount of the civil money penalty. 
For example, if this individual submits a false claim while 
under the influence of drugs or the individual has a 
psychiatric condition, that person's culpability for 
submitting false claims may be reduced. 
The enforcement provisions for civil money penalties in 
sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) incorporate section 1128A of 
the Act and require a consideration of a facility's 
culpability in determining the amount of the civil money 
penalty. However, this consideration is not limited to 
situations in which a provider ``intends'' for a situation of 
noncompliance to exist. In fact, a facility is culpable if 
noncompliance causing harm or placing a resident at risk of 
harm is intentional or is a product of neglect, indifference 
or disregard. While a facility's culpability for serious 
noncompliance is a factor in the determination of the amount 
of the civil money penalty, the absence of culpability is 
not a factor, as a facility is always fully responsible for 
the health and safety of its residents. 


Comment:

 One commenter asked that we specifically 
define ``history'' as used at proposed  488.230(g)(1). 
Another commenter suggested that the facility's history of 
prior compliance only include the period of operation under 
the current owners. 


Response:

 Information concerning a facility's history 
of noncompliance, as discussed with regard to 
 488.438(f)(1) of the final rule, is maintained in the 
State survey agency, the HCFA regional office and the Online 
Survey Certification and Reporting system (OSCAR). The 
OSCAR system can provide facility specific reports from the 
four most recent surveys. We do not accept the comment that 
the facility's history of prior noncompliance only include 
that of the current owner because when a change of ownership 
occurs, all Medicare penalties and sanctions are 
automatically assigned to the new owner or owners with the 
exception of the two year restriction on Nurse Aide Training 
and Competency Evaluation Programs (which is explained later 
in this preamble).

Comment:

 Several commenters suggested that we provide 
that if a facility wants its financial condition considered 
it must fully disclose all financial information. 


Response:

 As stated above, it is a statutory 
requirement that a facility's financial condition be 
considered as a factor to determine the amount of the civil 
money penalty. We do not specify in the regulation what we 
will examine in determining the facility's financial 
condition, because these factors are unique for each 
facility. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the 
facility to furnish the information it believes 
appropriately represents its financial status. We consider 
a facility's financial condition in conjunction with the 
other factors specified in the rule when determining the 
amount of a civil money penalty, because it is not our 
intent to put facilities out of business, and the amount of 
the civil money penalty is determined on a case by case 
basis. 


Comment:

 We received a suggestion to remove the 
facility's financial condition as a factor in determining 
the amount of the civil money penalty but to permit the 
facility an opportunity to negotiate a payment schedule if 
it can demonstrate that the civil money penalty would cause 
financial hardship after the assessment and final 
adjudication of a civil money penalty. 


Response:

 We do not accept this comment. First, as 
previously stated, it is a statutory requirement to consider 
a facility's financial condition as a factor in determining 
the amount of the penalty. Second, to negotiate a payment 
schedule based on the facility's financial condition after 
the assessment and final adjudication of a civil money 
penalty would not be necessary since the facility's 
financial condition has already been considered in the 
determination of the penalty amount. 


Comment:

 Many commenters submitted examples of existing 
State civil money penalty systems which assigned a specific 
dollar amount per bed to each scope and severity level or 
assigned a maximum daily fine amount for each scope and 
severity level. Another commenter asked that we clarify 
that there will not be a correlation between the number of 
beds and the amount of the civil money penalty. 


Response:

 We are revising   488.404 and 488.408 to 
correlate the seriousness of the deficiencies with the 
selection of remedies when HCFA or the State chooses to 
impose a remedy. (See explanation at  488.404, Factors to 
be considered in selecting remedies and  488.408, 
Selection of remedies.) Civil money penalties may be used 
for deficiencies constituting immediate jeopardy. Civil 
money penalties may also be used for deficiencies which 
constitute no actual harm but have a potential for more than 
minimal harm; or for deficiencies that constitute actual 
harm. 
We do not accept the comment suggesting assigning a 
dollar amount per bed because the regulation, in accordance 
with section 1128A of the Act, requires a consideration of a 
facility's financial condition in the determination of the 
civil money penalty amount. We assume that a primary reason 
some States compute civil money penalty amounts based on the 
number of beds is to take into account the financial 
condition of facilities, that is, the larger facilities 
would be presumed to have a greater availability of cash 
than the smaller facilities. This is not necessarily the 
case, and even if it were a valid consideration in some 
cases, to take this relationship into account would be to 
consider financial condition twice. Nor have we assigned a 
specific dollar amount for each degree of seriousness.

While we have assigned ranges of penalties to immediate 
jeopardy and non-immediate jeopardy, we have not refined the 
figures further. We believe that this allows for the 
additional discretion on the part of HCFA or the State to 
assign a penalty amount once the facility's financial 
condition and other factors have been considered. 


Comment:

 A commenter asked how the terms scope, 
severity and duration of noncompliance used at proposed 
 488.230(g)(3) will be defined. 


Response:

 In response to the concern raised by this 
commenter, we are revising redesignated  488.438(f). We 
are replacing the phrase, ``The scope, severity, and duration 
of the noncompliance'' with, ``The factors in section 
488.404.'' The factors specified in  488.404 address the 
assessment of the seriousness of deficiencies and include 
assessing the scope, severity and duration of the 
noncompliance in more specific terms. 


Comment:

 A commenter suggested the specific category of 
the unmet requirement be a factor in determining the amount 
of the penalty. Another commenter asked that we explain the 
difference between ``health and safety requirements'' and 
``administrative requirements'' as stated in  488.230(g)(4) 
of the proposed regulation. We also received many 
recommendations to revise this regulatory provision to 
require that HCFA or the State consider whether the 
requirements with which the facility is out of compliance 
are health and safety requirements, residents' rights, 
quality of life or failure to attain the highest practicable 
functioning or administrative requirements when determining 
the amount of the civil money penalty. 


Response:

 After considering the above comments, we are 
eliminating this provision because we believe that the 
factors inherent in this provision are reflected in revised 
 488.438(f), which now requires the consideration of the 
factors contained in  488.404 when determining the amount 
of the penalty. These factors include consideration of 
whether the facilities' deficiencies constitute: no actual 
harm, with a potential for minimal harm; no actual harm, 
with the potential for more than minimal harm that is not 
immediate jeopardy; actual harm that is not immediate 
jeopardy; or immediate jeopardy to resident health or 
safety. These factors also require considering whether the 
deficiencies are isolated, constitute a pattern or are 
widespread. A consideration of these factors includes 
considering the specific type of unmet requirement. 


Comment:

 A few commenters recommended that civil money 
penalties be mandatory for all substandard quality of care 
deficiencies, immediate jeopardy situations and repeated 
deficiencies at their proposed severity level 1 and scope of 
3 or 4. A few other commenters who proposed a new scope and 
severity grid suggested that we modify the civil money 
penalty provisions to reflect the grid that they proposed. 
One commenter suggested doubling the civil money penalty for 
repeated deficiencies, and another suggested simply 
increasing the penalty for repeated deficiencies. Other 
commenters requested that we add a description of civil 
money penalties that would include a flat, one time fine 
for:

 Single deficiencies regardless of the severity; 
 Deficiencies with a starting point that cannot be 
determined;
 Repeated deficiencies; and 
 Deficiencies where the State finds it more difficult 
to document continuous noncompliance.



Many commenters suggested requiring that civil money 
penalties be imposed at specific scope and severity levels. 




Response:

 We do not accept these recommendations. 
Requiring that civil money penalties be imposed for specific 
types of deficiencies would be inconsistent with the Act 
which provides that civil money penalties 

may 

(emphasis 
added) be imposed for each day of noncompliance. The 
Secretary does not have the authority to require the States 
to impose civil money penalties where the Act gives States' 
discretion. While the Secretary could implement a policy by 
which each specific degree of seriousness would 
automatically precipitate civil money penalties at specific 
amounts, such a policy would undermine the Secretary's 
flexibility to tailor enforcement action to the exact nature 
of deficiencies in specific facilities. As a matter of 
policy, we will limit the use of civil money penalties to 
more serious deficiencies. Civil money penalties are 
included as a remedy choice when the seriousness of the 
deficiencies is such that Category 2 or Category 3 remedies 
would be applicable, as specified in  488.408, Selection of 
remedies.

In cases of repeated or uncorrected deficiencies, 
imposing a flat, one time civil money penalty for these 
deficiencies would ignore the statutory requirement to 
provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe 
fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies as specified 
in sections 1819(h)(2)(B), 1919(h)(2)(A), and 1919(h)(3)(C) 
of the Act. While we are providing in redesignated 
 488.438 that penalties are increased for repeated 
deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of 
requirements, we do not accept the recommendation to double 
the fines because mandating the magnitude of the increase 
would detract from the kind of flexibility the Congress gave 
to the Secretary and the States. With regard to uncorrected 
deficiencies, we may propose to increase a civil money 
penalty for those cases in which a lower level penalty 
amount was imposed should those uncorrected deficiencies 
become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy. 


To assign a flat, one time fine to a single deficiency 
regardless of its seriousness does not take into 
consideration the factors included in section 1128A of the 
Act and specified in  488.438 of this final rule, and 
ignores the fact that the Act mandates that a civil money 
penalty, when imposed, be computed for each day of 
noncompliance. The Act contemplates the imposition of civil 
money penalties for whatever period HCFA or the State 
determines the noncompliance exists. 


Comment:

 A commenter asked if the hearing officer makes 
the assessment decision on the amount of the civil money 
penalty. 


Response:

 As previously stated, when a facility 
requests a hearing on the noncompliance which led to the 
imposition of the civil money penalty, HCFA or the State 
will not initiate collection of the penalty until a final 
administrative decision is rendered which upholds the 
determination of noncompliance. Upon further analysis, we 
are adding a paragraph to redesignated  488.438 to explain 
the reviewability of the civil money penalty that is imposed 
on a SNF or NF for noncompliance with participation 
requirements. We now specify that in any case in which an 
administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher 
administrative review authority) finds that the basis for 
imposing a civil money penalty exists, as described in 
 488.430, the administrative law judge or State hearing 
officer (or higher administrative review authority) may not: 
set a penalty of zero or reduce a penalty to zero; review 
the exercise of discretion by the Secretary or the State to 
impose a civil money penalty; or consider any factors in 
reviewing the amount of the penalty other than those 
specified at  488.438(f). In other words, when the 
administrative law judge or State hearing officer (or higher 
administrative review authority) finds noncompliance 
supporting the imposition of the civil money penalty, he or 
she must remedy it with some amount of penalty consistent 
with the ranges of penalty amounts established in  488.438. 
This provision is consistent with other provisions specified 
in this rule to motivate a SNF's and NF's compliance with 
participation requirements in which we state that these 
providers have the opportunity to appeal certifications of 
noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy. This 
provision is also consistent with section 1128A(d) of the 
Act, which requires that specific factors be considered in 
determining the amount of any penalty. 


Section 488.440 Effective Date and Duration of Penalty





Comment:

 We received many comments on the effective 
date of the civil money penalty. Some commenters 
recommended that the effective date: 
 Be stayed if a hearing is requested; 
 Begin on the date an appeals decision is issued; or 
 Begin on the date the facility receives notice of the 
proposed penalty. 
A commenter recommended that no civil money penalty be 
imposed if the facility is in compliance by the effective 
date of the notice. 

Many commenters advocated that this regulatory section 
be changed to require that the effective date of the civil 
money penalty be the date when the deficiency began as can 
be documented by the surveyors. They said that the 
effective date provision of the proposed rule: 
 Implies a ``grace period'' for providers to correct 
deficiencies; 
 Is inconsistent with OBRA '87; 
 Contradicts  488.230(a)(2) of the proposed rule; 
 Undermines the States' ability to use civil money 
penalties; and 
 Defeats the deterrent effect of this remedy and the 
goal of encouraging prompt compliance.

Response: 

We are revising redesignated  488.440 after thoughtful consideration of the many comments received. We are
changing the heading of paragraph (a) to read, ``When penalty begins to accrue.'' This phrase is more appropriate
in the context of a civil money penalty since this penalty cannot be collected until the provider has an opportunity
for a hearing if one is requested; however, it can begin to accrue before the hearing. Also, this revision includes
the accrual of the civil money penalty for past days of noncompliance since the last standard survey which are corrected
by the time of the current survey as provided in the Act at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h). Revised paragraph (a) now provides
that the civil money penalty may start accruing as early as the date that the facility was first out of compliance, as
determined by HCFA or the State. To stay the accrual of the penalty if a hearing is requested, to start the accrual when
a hearing decision is made, or to begin the accrual on the date of the notice, as the commenters suggest, would allow
noncompliance to continue without a remedy being imposed and would not be implementing the remedy as the Congress
intended. This intent is clearly stated in the Committee report that accompanied OBRA '87: 




* * * the Committee amendment would expressly allow a State to impose civil money penalties for each
day in which a facility was found out of compliance with one or more of the requirements of participation, even if the
facility subsequently corrected its deficiencies and brought itself into full compliance. This, in the Committee's
view, is essential to creating a financial incentive for facilities to maintain compliance with the requirements
for participation. The Committee amendment would set no upper limit on the amount of these penalties and would allow
States to increase the amounts in cases of repeated noncompliance. States could impose civil money penalties prior
to a hearing. 

* * * the Committee amendment would create an incentive for facilities to maintain compliance with
all of the requirements of participation by authorizing the Secretary to impose and collect civil money penalties
for each day a facility is out of compliance even though the facility may subsequently bring itself back into full compliance.
(H.R. Report No. 391, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 473-6 (1987)). 




Moving the date when the penalty can accrue to be as early as the date of the noncompliance permits noncompliance to
be sanctioned promptly and addresses the concerns of the commenters who said that the effective date in the proposed
rule implied a ``grace period'' for providers to correct deficiencies before a civil money penalty was imposed and
undermined the States' abilities to use this remedy. We expect that in virtually all cases, the civil money penalty
would start accruing from the date of the noncompliance. The only exception could be those cases in which the survey
identifies the noncompliance but there is undue delay before HCFA or the State notifies the provider of the imposition
of the penalty. However, the provider would receive a second notice before the collection of the civil money penalty,
as explained in  488.440. 



Comment: 

A commenter recommended deleting proposed  488.230(i)(6) (redesignated as  488.440(g)), which provides
that, in the case of immediate and serious threat deficiencies, HCFA will or the State must terminate the provider
agreement on the 23rd day after the appointment of temporary management if the threat remains. 



Response: 

We do not accept the suggestion to delete this provision because we believe it is important to specify the situations
that affect the accrual of civil money penalties. However, we are revising redesignated  488.440(g) to specify
that termination occurs within 23 days after the last day of the survey if immediate jeopardy remains, and the daily
accrual of civil money penalties stops on that day. 



Comment: 

Many commenters suggested that the regulation incorporate a provision assuring prompt revisits by HCFA or the States
to evaluate compliance based upon a facility's allegation of compliance, because several commenters stated that
survey teams often are not prompt in the follow-up process. Others asked if civil money penalties accrue when a revisit
is not timely. Several commenters asked that we clarify if there must be on-site revisits by the State to verify reports
by facilities. One commenter requested revisits be within a specified timeframe and another specified a 10 day timeframe
in which revisits must be conducted. One commenter recommended that civil money penalties be suspended immediately
(until the survey team can revisit) when authorities receive notification through certified mail that deficiencies
have been corrected.

Response: 

While we understand the concern expressed by the commenters that surveyors conduct prompt revisits to confirm substantial
compliance, the fact remains that when a SNF or NF participates in the Medicare and/or Medicaid program, that facility
agrees to maintain substantial compliance with the participation requirements. When a civil money penalty or any
other remedy is imposed upon a SNF or NF, it is because it has not maintained substantial compliance with these requirements,
and we want to motivate corrective action. While HCFA and the States will try to revisit the facility in as timely a fashion
as possible, when a revisit is necessary to verify substantial compliance, neither HCFA nor the States will be constrained
by a specified timeframe in which to conduct these revisits. Nor will HCFA or the States suspend a penalty until a revisit
can be conducted. The revisit would not be necessary if the SNF or NF had met its commitment to remain in substantial
compliance with the participation requirements. Therefore, it is the provider's poor performance that has generated
the need for a revisit. Moreover, timeframes for revisits can vary from State to State and within a State due to geographical
variations and available personnel.

Hence, in those cases in which an on-site revisit is determined necessary to verify that the SNF or NF has come back into
substantial compliance with participation requirements, civil money penalties may accrue from as early as the date
the facility was first out of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date of the revisit which finds
substantial compliance. Or, the civil money penalty may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out
of compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date substantial compliance was achieved as documented
by written credible evidence submitted to, and accepted by, HCFA or the State before an on-site revisit, but which,
in certain situations, must be confirmed by an on-site revisit. 

Sometimes an on-site revisit is not necessary to establish that a facility has come back into substantial compliance;
in those cases, the civil money penalty may accrue from as early as the date the facility was first out of compliance,
as determined by HCFA or the State, until the date for which there is written credible evidence of substantial compliance
which is acceptable to HCFA or the State without the on-site visit. In these cases, there is no reason to ``assure''
the timeframe of a revisit as stated by a commenter. In response to the concerns and questions of the commenters, we
are revising  488.438(h) to provide for the policies expressed above. 



Comment: 

Several commenters asked what documentation will be acceptable to HCFA or the State as credible evidence as stated
in proposed  488.230(i)(7) (redesignated as  488.440(h)). 



Response: 

In order to appropriately respond to each unique situation of noncompliance, HCFA or the State will evaluate written
credible evidence on a case by case basis. HCFA and the State have the discretion to determine what constitutes written
credible evidence. For example, a survey may determine that a facility's furnace is broken constituting a deficiency
for violating a Physical Environment requirement by its failure to maintain all essential mechanical, electrical
and patient care equipment in safe operating condition ( 488.70(c)(2)). In such a case, the facility may buy
a new furnace, have it installed, and submit the receipt to the State or HCFA as written credible evidence of substantial
compliance. If this written credible evidence is accepted by HCFA or the State, the accrual of the civil money penalty
would stop as of the date substantial compliance was achieved. 

Sometimes substantial compliance can be achieved before an on-site revisit and the retroactive substantial compliance
date can be verified with an on-site revisit. For example, during a closed record review (which is an examination of
the records of discharged, transferred or deceased residents), it may be determined that a facility was not recording
the reason for transfer or discharge in the residents' clinical records. This would be a violation of a requirement
under Admission, Transfer and Discharge Rights set forth at 42 CFR 483.12. Since it would be inappropriate to send
residents' records in the mail as evidence of correction, a revisit would be necessary. During the revisit on May 30,
1994, documentation confirms that the facility came into compliance with this requirement on May 10, 1994, 20 days
before the revisit. Since the revisit confirms compliance with this requirement as having occurred on May 10, 1994,
the accrual of the civil money penalty for the facility could be from as early as the date the facility was first out of
compliance as determined by HCFA or the State until the date for which the revisit established that substantial compliance
was achieved, which would be May 10, 1994 in this example. 

There are other cases in which documentation cannot confirm the correction of noncompliance, and in these cases an
on-site revisit is necessary. For example, one of the requirements for Infection Control is that personnel must handle,
store, process and transport linens so as to prevent the spread of infection as specified in  483.65. If a deficiency
is cited for a violation of this requirement and a civil money penalty is imposed, submitting written documentation
would not confirm the correction of the violation. An on-site revisit to observe personnel behavior is necessary
in this case to confirm that the facility is, in fact, back in substantial compliance with this regulatory provision.

Comment: 

One commenter stated that fines should accrue until a follow-up survey confirms compliance. This commenter said
proposed  488.230(i)(7) should be revised because it rests on a clause rejected by OBRA '87 that paper review
cannot adequately determine compliance. The commenter also said that if a facility requests a survey and is found
out of compliance, the facility would be held liable for the costs of the survey.


Response: 

We do not accept this comment. First, we are not suggesting that written credible evidence submitted to HCFA or the
State can confirm substantial compliance in every situation. We are well aware that not every deficiency can be determined
to be corrected by written evidence as not every requirement is related to a written record. OBRA '87 did increase the
number of outcome oriented requirements and reduce the number of paper compliance requirements; however, it did
not eliminate all paper compliance requirements. The examples used in the discussion of the comment above describe
situations in which written credible evidence can confirm substantial compliance. When we can confirm substantial
compliance without an on-site revisit, valuable resources can be conserved, creating a savings for the taxpayer.
We do not accept the comment to charge the facility for the costs of the survey when it alleges substantial compliance
but is found to be noncompliant at a revisit. The Act does not include the imposition of a survey charge as an available
remedy.


Comment: 

A commenter asked how a facility will notify the State when it has corrected the noncompliance.


Response: 

When a facility has corrected the noncompliance, it may notify the State in whatever manner it feels is most appropriate.
For instance, in certain situations written credible evidence sent through the mail will be the best method of notification.
In other cases a telephone call to request an on-site revisit will be the most appropriate method of notification.


Comment: 

A commenter asked how penalties will be computed during the interim when a facility believes it is in compliance and
a survey team, upon revisit, disagrees.


Response: 

While a revisit is pending, the penalties continue to accrue at the rate originally specified by HCFA or the State.
However, HCFA or the State may propose to increase the daily penalty if a facility with nonimmediate jeopardy deficiencies
alleges compliance, but on a revisit, HCFA or the State finds that the facility's deficiencies have become sufficiently
serious to pose immediate jeopardy.
When a facility disagrees with the decision made at the time of the revisit, this disagreement could be resolved through
the administrative hearing process. HCFA has authority to settle cases at any time prior to a final administrative
decision for facilities in which HCFA's enforcement action prevails. The State has authority to settle cases at any
time prior to the evidentiary hearing decision for all cases in which the State's enforcement action prevails. These
provisions are specified in redesignated  488.444. However, a civil money penalty would not be computed and
collected until substantial compliance is verified, HCFA's or the State's decision of noncompliance is upheld after
a final administrative decision, the facility waives its right to a hearing, or the facility is terminated.


Comment: 

One commenter suggested adding a new provision to require that follow-up surveys be conducted within 10 days of the
facility notifying the State or HCFA that it has substantially corrected deficiencies. The penalty is terminated
on the date the facility provided the notice if the deficiencies are substantially corrected at the time of the revisit
or the 10 day period for a revisit has elapsed and the revisit has not occurred. If a revisit determines the scope and
severity of the deficiencies has changed, the penalty amount is adjusted and the penalty is effective on the date of
the facility's notice.


Response: 

We cannot accept this comment in total. However, as previously explained in this preamble, we are accepting the commenters'
suggestion to incorporate the concept of substantial compliance into the regulation as the standard providers must
meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs as SNFs or NFs. Consequently, a remedy is lifted when deficiencies
lessen to the point that the facility is in substantial compliance.
The amount of the civil money penalty is increased to reflect repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping
of requirements. The civil money penalty may be increased for a facility that has deficiencies, which, after imposition
of a lower level penalty amount remain uncorrected and, in fact, become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy.
The civil money penalty would be shifted to the lower range of penalty amounts for a facility which had immediate jeopardy
deficiencies if the immediate jeopardy is removed. However, if the noncompliance that continues after the immediate
jeopardy is removed constitutes repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements, the civil
money penalty would be increased in accordance with  488.438(d)(2) of this final rule. In a previous discussion,
we clarified the reasons why we will not be constrained by a specified timeframe to conduct on-site revisits or suspend
a penalty until we can revisit and the date when the penalty begins to accrue.

Comment: 

One commenter suggested that at proposed  488.230(i) we provide for the accrual of interest.


Response: 

We are revising redesignated  488.440 to require that the notice of the penalty amount due include a statement
of the interest rate so that a provider is aware of the interest rate applicable if the penalty is not paid on the due date.
Redesignated  488.442(c), which discusses the collection procedures for civil money penalties, specifies
how the rate of interest is computed. Redesignated  488.442 Due date for payment of penalty.


Comment: 

Several commenters proposed changing the date when civil money penalties are due as stipulated at  488.230(j)(1)
of the proposed rule to one of the following:
 30 days everywhere the proposed rule specifies 15 days, as 30 days is more commonly used in commerce;
 30 days from the date of notification or any earlier period as provided for by State law; or
 Within 10 days of receipt of notice of penalty or within 10 days of receipt of the final hearing decision unless
the decision is appealed.


Response: 

We do not accept the recommendations of the commenters to change the due date. The due date proposed (now in redesignated
 488.442) is consistent with existing HCFA notification procedures in which we give the provider a 15 day notice
before a remedy begins, such as, in the case of the denial of payment for new admissions or termination in nonimmediate
jeopardy situations. Because we have no compelling reason to conclude that reducing the 15 days to 10 days or increasing
the 15 days to 30 days would result in a more effective enforcement process, we are not changing this policy.
However, while reviewing these comments, we realized that we did not include all of the provisions explaining when
the civil money penalty can be collected. Consequently, we are adding these provisions to redesignated  488.442(a).


Comment: 

One commenter said that a facility should not have to pay any penalty until it has fully exhausted its appeal rights,
including appeals to the appropriate State or Federal court.


Response: 

We do not accept this recommendation. We are revising redesignated  488.442(a) to make clear that the civil
money penalty is collectible when a final administrative decision is issued upholding the imposition of the penalty.
This position is in accordance with the intent of section 1128A(e) of the Act, as stated in the conference agreement.
The conference agreement provides that no penalties will be assessed nor payment prohibited until all administrative
remedies have been exhausted. (See H.R. Rept. 97-208, 97 Cong., 1st Sess. Book 2 (Conference Report) p. 950.
(1981)).


Comment: 

Many commenters supported the provision that allows the civil money penalty to be deducted from any sum then or later
owing to the facility by HCFA or the State. The commenters believe that this provision is time saving and cost effective.
A few commenters recommended only deducting the civil money penalty from any sum then or later owing by HCFA or the State
if the penalty payment is not received in full within 30 days from the date of notification. A commenter asked if HCFA
or the State will notify the facility when they plan to deduct the penalty from future monies that HCFA or the State owe
the facility.


Response: 

We appreciate the support of the commenters who agree that the amount of the penalty when determined, may be deducted
from any sum then or later that HCFA or the State owe to the facility as specified in redesignated  488.442(b).
This provision implements section 1128A(f) of the Act.
The comments to only deduct the penalty if the facility has not paid in full within 30 days and the question about notifying
a facility of a deduction are concerns that will be addressed in forthcoming manual instructions. However, a facility
is not precluded from paying the civil money penalty, when it is collectible, at any time prior to the time when the penalty
would be deducted from sums then or later owing to the facility.


Comment: 

A commenter stated that HCFA and/or the State should collect the civil money penalty after all appeal rights are exhausted
because the ability to deduct a civil money penalty, when determined, from any sum then or later owing, is unfair and
could financially cripple the facility.

Response:

 We do not accept the comment. First, a civil money penalty is not collectible until, as explained in a previous comment,
a final administrative decision is made that supports the imposition of the penalty. Second, a facility's financial
condition is one of the many factors considered in determining the amount of the penalty. It is not our intent to cause
a facility undue hardship; however, if the penalty imposed is in the upper limit of the immediate jeopardy range, we
believe it is justified, because residents are in life threatening situations and we want to motivate the facility
to immediately correct deficiencies. Finally, the Act permits that civil money penalties may be deducted from any
sum that HCFA or the State owes or will owe the facility, and since a provider has ample notice of the due date, the option
exists to pay the civil money penalty on or before the due date as opposed to the money being deducted from sums owed or
owing. 


Comment:

 Another commenter said more consistency between regulatory requirements and enforcement practice would be demonstrated
by requiring the agreement of the patient and his or her attending physician with the monetary penalty to be imposed
prior to the withholding of monies from the patient's funding source. 


Response:

 To solicit the agreement of each and every resident and his or her attending physician before the imposition of a civil
money penalty would unnecessarily delay the imposition of the civil money penalty. Also, if a facility is not motivated
to promptly correct noncompliance, due to the lengthy delay created by seeking resident and physician approval,
the health and safety of residents could be compromised for an even longer period of time. Furthermore, when a provider
enters into an agreement with HCFA or the State, or both, to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs,
it is responsible for providing the agreed upon level of care to the residents. There is no justification for asking
each resident and his or her attending physician for permission to impose a civil money penalty since the resident
is the recipient and/or the beneficiary of the program and not a party to the agreement. 


Comment:

 Many commenters suggested that the rate of interest not be negotiable as stated in the proposed rule's preamble. The
commenters said this can promote inconsistency, is unworkable and inequitable. Commenters wanted to know how the
rate will be negotiated (as stated in the proposed preamble) and who will determine this rate. 

Many commenters offered alternative language for this regulatory provision which included the following:

 Interest accrues at the credit card rate from the date of citation on all penalties not paid prior to a request
for a hearing;
 Interest is assessed at an annual rate which is 2 percent above the prime rate on the unpaid balance of the civil
money penalty beginning on the due date;
 Interest accrues from the date of the violation at the highest rate permitted by State usury laws;
 Interest is based on a national index (for example, 6-month Treasury bills); and
 The interest rate must be placed in regulation. 



Response:

 We agree that the interest rate should not be negotiable and we are revising redesignated  488.442(c) to specify
the interest rate applicable to the collection of civil money penalties. For Medicare, the interest rate is the rate
fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury and used by the Department of Health and Human Services. The rule now states that
the interest rate is the higher of either_(1) the rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into consideration
private consumer rates of interest prevailing on the date of the notice of the penalty amount due (this rate is published
quarterly in the 

Federal Register 

by the Department under 45 CFR 30.13(a)); or (2) the current value of funds rate (this rate is published annually in
the 

Federal Register

 by the Secretary of the Treasury, subject to quarterly revisions). For Medicaid, the interest rate is determined
by the State.



Comment:

 We received many comments on the collection of civil money penalties from dually participating facilities. A few
commenters were confused and asked for clarification of this regulatory provision. Commenters suggested amending
the language of the proposed rule, which says, ``the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid beds at the facility
actually in use'' by adding ``by residents covered by the respective programs * * *'' to this sentence.
Another commenter recommended the regulation say, ``the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid residents
in the facility at the time the facility receives notice of the imposition of the civil money penalty.''

Response:

 We are revising redesignated  488.442(e) to include the phrase ``by residents covered by the respective programs
on the date the civil money penalty begins to accrue.'' By including this phrase, we require that civil money penalties
collected from dually participating facilities be apportioned to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, not according
to the proportionate number of beds but proportionate to the number of residents in each program on the date the civil
money penalty begins to accrue. For example, a facility has the capacity and is certified to provide care for 50 Medicare
beneficiaries and 50 Medicaid recipients. On the date the penalty begins to accrue, 15 Medicare beneficiaries and
45 Medicaid recipients are residing in the facility and 40 beds of the 100 beds are empty. The amount of the civil money
penalty is apportioned as follows: 25 percent (15/60) of the civil money penalty would be apportioned to the Medicare
Trust Fund for Medicare beneficiaries and 75 percent (45/60) of the civil money penalty would be applied to the protection
of the health and property of Medicaid residents of facilities that the State or HCFA finds deficient.




Comment:

 Many commenters suggested alternative uses for the civil money penalties collected by HCFA or the State. Many suggested
using the civil money penalty amount to address the situation which led to the deficiency so as to protect the health
of the residents as OBRA requires. Other commenters suggested that civil money penalties collected be used to:

 Fund the State incentive program;
 Offer financial improvement grants to needy facilities;

Other commenters suggested:
 Placing the monies collected into a fund to be used by HCFA or the appropriate State agency, rather than placing
them in the State's general revenue fund;
 Depositing the monies with the State Treasurer into the Long Term Care Monitor/Receiver Fund; and
 Not using the monies to fund government administrative activities or those activities not related to resident
care.




Response:

 We cannot accept the above suggestions for the disposition of a civil money penalty imposed in accordance with sections
1819(h)(2)(B)(ii), 1919(h)(3)(C)(ii) or 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act. If the civil money penalty is used by the
facility to correct the noncompliance which led to its imposition, it is, in effect, not a remedy. While the use of the
civil money penalty to fund the State incentive program, to finance grants for needy facilities or to deposit into
the Long Term Care Monitor/Receiver Fund would be beneficial uses, the Congress has directed the use of the civil money
penalty amounts collected as specified in section 1128(A)(f) of the Act. Civil money penalties collected from Medicare
facilities are returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and, as specified at section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act and redesignated
 488.442(e). Civil money penalties collected by the Medicaid State agency, in accordance with section 1919(h)(2)(A)(ii)
of the Act, are applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State
or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities,
maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents
for personal funds or property lost (redesignated  488.442(f)). The law does not require that the money received
through civil money penalties be spent on direct patient care. In fact, the Act suggests that those funds will be spent
on administrative expenses, such as those incurred in moving patients to other facilities.




Comment:

 Many commenters support the use of civil money penalties by the State for the protection of the health and property
of the residents. A few commenters raised questions, such as:

 How the disposition of civil money penalties will be 
implemented to assure that money collected by the State is 
used appropriately; 

 What State costs are included at proposed 
 488.230(j)(6)(ii); 

 Whether a priority would be assigned to the items 
included in the State's use of civil money penalties (such 
as, relocation of residents and resident reimbursement); and 

 How resident reimbursement would be accomplished. 



Response:

 These questions raised by the commenters are 
issues that need not be addressed through the Federal 
regulatory process. The Act permits each State to implement 
its own procedures. 



Comment:

 A commenter supported the application of civil 
money penalties as specified in the regulation; however, the 
commenter was concerned that this provision conflicts with 
this party's State constitution which requires all civil 
forfeitures to be placed in the State's school fund. The 
commenter asked which provision takes precedence. 



Response:

 Medicare and Medicaid are Federal programs, 
so when a civil money penalty is collected as an enforcement 
action because a participating SNF or NF is out of 
compliance with the Medicare or Medicaid requirements, the 
Federal regulation takes precedence. 



Comment:

 A few commenters recommended amending proposed 
 488.230(j)(6)(iii) to include the reimbursement of lost 
resident property. A few commenters suggested replacing 
``including'' at  488.230(j)(6) with the words ``such as.'' 



Response:

 Section 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act specifies 
that civil money penalties collected by the State be applied 
to the protection of the health or property of residents of 
nursing facilities that the State or Secretary finds 
deficient. We believe the Congress intended that this 
include the State reimbursement of a resident for personal 
property and funds lost at the facility as a result of 
actions by the facility or by individuals used by the 
facility to provide services to residents. We are revising 
the rule accordingly. 

We accept the suggestion to replace the word ``including'' 
with the word ``such as'' in the paragraph that discusses the 
use of civil money penalties collected by the State. This 
revision does not alter the meaning of the provision, but 
does provide needed clarity. The Act, as referenced above, 
enumerates certain specified activities for which a 
collected civil money penalty may be used; however, it is 
not an exhaustive list. As long as the intended use of the 
funds may be said to relate to protecting resident health or 
property, it is not necessary that each use of the civil 
money penalty be expressly stated in the regulation. Using 
the words ``such as'' more precisely conveys the intent of 
this provision and allows the State to have flexibility in

Section 488.444 Settlement of Penalties





Comment:

 A few commenters said that the regulatory 
provision at proposed  488.230(k) does not offer guidelines 
on how civil money penalties may be settled and that there 
is no control over the States' or Secretary's discretion. 

A consumer organization commented that granting States 
complete discretion to settle cases whenever and however 
they choose undermines the effectiveness of civil money 
penalties. They added that this regulatory provision opens 
the door too wide for parties interested in not paying fines 
to make inappropriate deals with decision-makers and avoid 
responsibility for their noncompliance. 

Several commenters suggested deleting this regulatory 
provision, and a few commenters specifically suggested that 
this section be deleted in accordance with their changes 
proposed at  488.230(e) which provide for settlement in 
which a facility pays the civil money penalty that was 
imposed (less the 35 percent), and corrects the deficiencies 
which led to the penalty, within 10 days of receipt of the 
notice. 



Response:

 We cannot accept these comments. The 
authority provided HCFA or the State to settle any case at 
any time prior to a final administrative decision, as 
specified at redesignated  488.444, is consistent with 
other regulatory provisions pertaining to civil money 
penalties. Regarding the comment that this provision opens 
the door for decision makers to make deals with providers, 
we contend that the survey, certification and enforcement 
process is built on a system of integrity and implements the 
necessary controls to assure that this integrity is 
maintained. To remove this provision, as suggested by a few 
commenters, would deny providers the opportunity to promptly 
settle their cases. We believe that the suggestion to 
settle by deducting 35 percent from the civil money penalty 
if the deficiencies which led to the penalty are corrected 
within 10 days does not allow a facility enough time to make 
a decision regarding whether to waive or request a hearing. 
Moreover, the provision in redesignated  488.436 deals 
specifically with a provider waiving its right to a hearing. 
Redesignated  488.444 provides the opportunity to settle a 
case, even if the hearing right was not previously waived. 
This provision was incorporated into the regulation in the 
interest of resolving disagreements at the stage in the 
process before sizeable expenditures of time and money are 
devoted to hearing procedures. Even if a hearing had been 
requested, if, before the proceeding, all parties can reach 
agreement over the deficiencies to be corrected and the 
penalty to be paid until corrections are made, costly 
hearings procedures can be avoided. 



Comment:

 A commenter requested that press releases and 
a notice to the long term care ombudsman accompany 
settlement, and if the civil money penalty was imposed as a 
result of a complaint investigation, notice should be given 
to the complainant. 



Response:

 We do not accept this comment. Sections 
1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provide for the 
disclosure of information regarding inspections and other 
activities of skilled nursing facilities and nursing 
facilities. Survey and certification information, which 
includes but is not limited to statements of deficiencies, 
plans of correction and appeal results, is available to the 
public. The regulation at  488.325 expands disclosure to 
include among other things, notice of SNF or NF 
noncompliance and adverse action(s) imposed to the long term 
care ombudsman. Existing State survey agency procedures 
require that a notice be sent to the complainant informing 
him or her of the disposition of the allegation. We 
maintain that the present methods of disclosure used for all 
noncompliance situations provide ample opportunity for 
public awareness, and we do not believe that any additional 
benefit is derived by having separate disclosure procedures 
for those cases in which civil money penalties are used as a 
remedy (see discussion for  488.325 Disclosure of results 
of surveys and activities).

Comment: 

A provider organization recommended that 
issues that may be resolved at settlement include citation 
of a deficiency; severity and scope of the deficiency; the 
remedy imposed; exclusion of the deficiency as the basis for 
increased sanctions in the future; and exclusion of the 
deficiency or deficiencies cited on the HCFA Form-2567 as 
the basis for further enforcement action by any other agency 
or office of the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS). 


Response: 

We do not accept the suggestion to include 
in the regulation specific deficiency related issues that 
may be discussed at settlement. Providers have many 
opportunities to discuss and resolve the deficiency-related 
issues raised by the commenter before the settlement of the 
civil money penalty would occur. Providers have the 
opportunity to question survey findings during the survey, 
at the exit conference, while awaiting receipt of the 
official deficiency statement, upon receipt of same, and 
through ongoing dialogue with the State and HCFA regional 
offices. Also, all States must have a dispute resolution 
process as required by  488.331 of this rule to enable 
providers to discuss perceived discrepancies in the survey 
process. While the existence of a deficiency may arise at 
settlement discussions, it is unnecessary to mention it or 
any other of the above issues which are predicated on the 
existence of deficiencies and which may arise. Moreover, we 
have no authority, as the commenter suggests, to exclude a 
deficiency in the present but increase the enforcement 
action if it is repeated in the future.



Section 488.450 Continuation of Payments to a Facility With Deficiencies 



Virtually everyone who commented vehemently disagrees 
with this proposed section. Consumer groups oppose this 
section because, they believe, it forces HCFA or the State 
to terminate a facility's provider agreement rather than to 
impose alternative remedies. State organizations disagree 
with the provision that the State must agree to repay FFP 
for Medicaid facilities rather than the facility agreeing to 
repay (as stipulated for Medicare). Providers argue that 
the proposed rule is too strict, because repayment of 
Federal funding would begin the day that the State survey 
agency identifies deficiencies rather than when HCFA or the 
State imposes remedies when facilities do not correct 
deficiencies. Providers also believe that asking for an 
agreement to repay Federal funds for deficiencies at low 
scope and severity levels is harsh. 


Comment: 

Several commenters believed that proposed 
 488.232, as redesignated at  488.450, will force States 
to impose termination instead of alternative remedies for 
all instances of noncompliance in NFs. They based their 
belief on the provision that says that, when the State 
survey agency prefers an alternative remedy in lieu of 
termination, the State must agree to repay FFP. If the NF 
fails to correct the deficiencies during the correction 
period, the State would be liable. These commenters said, 
that because many States have no intention of entering into 
an agreement to repay FFP, the State must start termination. 
One commenter stated that if the provision remains as a 
prerequisite to the use of alternative remedies, reliance on 
termination procedures will continue. In the commenter's 
view, the end result will be more litigation, because 
providers will be placed in the unenviable position of 
having to respond to potential decertification for 
relatively minor infractions. 
Other commenters criticized HCFA's proposed rule 
because it denies the intent of OBRA to make available to 
States a range of remedies to be used as alternatives to 
termination for deficiencies of lesser severity and places 
NFs in the undesirable position of having to respond to 
decertification actions for relatively minor violations. 


Response: 

We are aware of the difficulties posed by 
the repayment provisions of sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act. As almost all commenters noted, 
these requirements constitute a significant disincentive to 
impose alternative remedies because the Act requires that 
either the facility (under Medicare) or the State (under 
Medicaid) repay the Federal government should the facility 
fail to correct identified deficiencies. 
We note, however, that sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act specify the rules that must apply 
to SNFs and NFs when the 

only 

course chosen to respond to 
the violation of certification requirements is through 
alternative remedies. We reach this conclusion because of 
the literal language of both of the provisions of the Act, 
which specifies that these remediation provisions apply when 
the State survey agency determines that it would be more 
appropriate to employ alternative means to assure compliance 
than to seek a provider agreement termination. Thus, the 
commenters are quite right that when an alternative remedy 
only is being sought, the repayment provisions of the Act 
for SNFs and NFs are inescapable.

While we see the desirability of being able to pursue 
only alternative remedies in many cases of facility 
noncompliance, the fact is that section 1919(h)(7) of the 
Act offers the availability of alternative remedies when 
coupled with an action to terminate a provider agreement 
when there would be no repayment consequences for either the 
facility or the State. In these cases, when HCFA agrees 
with the State's assessment that a provider agreement 
termination should be sought, the State's timing for the 
termination controls. If the State opts for one or more 
alternative remedies in addition to termination, those 
remedies would be applied unless the Secretary chooses to 
impose an alternative remedy. When both the State and the 
Secretary choose to impose one or more alternative remedies, 
section 1919(h)(7)(B)(ii) of the Act specifies that only the 
Secretary's remedies are imposed. As already discussed, 
when the State's decision to terminate the provider 
agreement as well as impose alternative remedies prevails, 
we do not believe the rules of section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the 
Act would govern the imposition of the alternative remedy. 

Thus, where a SNF's or NF's deficiencies do not pose 
an immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, HCFA or 
the State may opt for a ``slow-track'' termination and apply 
one or more alternative remedies in the interim period. 
Should the facility achieve substantial compliance before 
the effective date of the termination, as we would expect to 
occur in almost every case, the termination action would be 
rescinded. Should the facility fail to correct deficiencies 
by the effective date of the termination, the termination 
would proceed, but neither the State nor the facility would 
be liable to us for a repayment of funds for the time 
following the identification of deficiencies. While we are 
not suggesting that States or HCFA make a decision to 
terminate a provider agreement in all cases where facility 
deficiencies have been identified, we believe it is 
important that States, and all others affected by these 
provisions, be clear as to the consequences of using the 
various provisions of the Act. 
We have concluded that the approach we have described 
above can be applied to SNFs as well as to NFs and dually- 
participating facilities. When we have identified 
deficiencies for SNFs and seek provider agreement 
termination in accordance with section 1866(b) of the Act, 
we would not be seeking only an alternative remedy. In such 
cases, we believe the rules of section 1819(h)(2)(C) would 
not apply since the State's recommendation is for a 
termination and alternative remedies. 
We believe proceeding in the fashion we have described 
relative to all nursing homes may strike the kind of balance 
that the Congress was seeking through its placing of 
alternative remedies in greater prominence than had been the 
case before nursing home reform. Most importantly, nursing 
home residents would be protected, because the facilities in 
which they reside would have every incentive to comply 
quickly in order to have alternative remedies lifted. With 
that incentive, residents would face the unsatisfactory care 
that gave rise to the enforcement action for only short 
periods of time without facing the specter of relocating 
were termination the first remedy of choice. Second, 
States would have considerably more flexibility to impose 
alternative remedies knowing that neither they nor the 
facility will be liable to us for the repayment of funds 
should a facility, in fact, fail to achieve substantial 
compliance by the time that the termination action is 
effective. Of course, the mandatory denial of payment which 
the State or the Secretary is required to impose after the 
third month of noncompliance would not require the State for 
Medicaid or the facility for Medicare to sign an agreement 
to repay Federal funds if substantial compliance is not 
achieved. 


Comment: 

One commenter believed that the continuation 
of payments pending remediation provision should only be 
applied in situations where the Secretary and the State 
disagree about whether to terminate and the Secretary 
believes that termination should occur but the State 
believes that the facility can correct the problems. The 
commenter states:

This interpretation flows very logically from the wording of section 1919(h)(3)(D), which gives the Secretary permission
to continue payments (``The Secretary 

may 

continue payments * * *'' emphasis added). Since the Secretary has ample authority elsewhere in the
Act to pay facilities, he does not need this ``permission'' and therefore the provision would appear to be redundant.
It acquires meaning only if it is understood as making an exception to a situation where the Secretary would otherwise
be barred from making payment.





One commenter believes that sections 1919(h)(3)(D) and1819(h)(2)(D) of the Act, if not redundant, were incorporated
into the Act to constitute guidance in a situation that otherwise would make it unclear as to whether or not payment
should continue, that is, disagreement between HCFA and the State.

Other commenters noted that, ``A reasonable reading of the statute does not require the Secretary to second-guess
every determination by a State that intermediate sanctions should be attempted before resorting to termination.''
The commenters assert that the statutory provision should only apply in those very rare circumstances where the Secretary
concludes that termination is necessary, but yields to the State's recommendation that intermediate remedies be
imposed instead.



Response: 

While we agree that the Secretary has the authority to pay Medicare facilities and pay States for Medicaid facilities
in accordance with sections 1861(v)(1) and 1903 of the Act, respectively, the provisions of sections 1819(h)(2)(C)
and 1919(h)(3)(D) limit the Secretary's authority to make payments for Medicare providers and States (for Medicaid
providers), respectively. However, that is not the only situation in which there would be lack of clarity as to whether
or not payment should continue. The clearer reading and the one we have adopted is that, without this provision, a lack
of clarity would exist over whether or not payments should continue despite noncompliance with the statutory participation
requirements. Further, we do not agree that the Act provides for the scheme offered by the commenter (that is, that
we only invoke section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act if there is disagreement about termination). Such disagreements
between the State and the Secretary over termination and establishing remedies are addressed at section 1919(h)(7)
of the Act.



Comment: 

One commenter expressed the opinion that there is almost universal agreement that terminating nursing homes from
Medicare and Medicaid is harmful to residents. The commenter believed that in most terminations, residents are transferred
to other substandard nursing homes farther away from family and friends. The end result of most provider terminations
is to expose residents to relocation trauma without getting better care. Other commenters also expressed concern
over the resident's reaction to a potential termination. Commenters believed that even when a facility has come into
compliance, residents suffer from the uncertainty of their situations. Although commenters agreed with our statement
in the preamble that we see provider agreement terminations generally to be the enforcement response to the most serious
deficiencies, they believed the proposed regulation allows almost unrestricted use of termination as a sanction.



Response: 

We disagree with the commenter, who gave no evidence to support the contention that most provider terminations expose
residents to relocation trauma without getting better care. We acknowledge that there are instances in which termination
will cause some hardship to residents, but the advantages of removing residents from a noncompliant nursing home
could outweigh any disadvantages. Usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies prior to terminating
or in addition to terminating a facility in hopes that a facility will achieve substantial compliance. We believe
that in those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents
to assure that they receive the care to which they are entitled.



Comment: 

One commenter stated that section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act requires the Secretary to establish guidelines for the
approval of corrective actions requested by the States. The commenter pointed out there are no proposed rules that
address this statutory requirement.



Response: 

We will issue these guidelines in manual instructions. We do not believe including them in regulations is required
or necessary.

Comment: 

Many commenters believed that the proposed rule was so broadly worded that it could be understood to apply to every
situation where the extra time and the intermediate sanctions did not produce compliance. These commenters asked
that we revise the regulation to use the continuation of payment during remediation provision in only in the most egregious
situations where the Secretary disagrees with the State survey agency regarding termination. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act do not provide any flexibility about the seriousness of a deficiency
in applying the continuation of payment during remediation provision. Indeed because the statute in both places
makes reference to the payment limitations being triggered if a facility is ``not in compliance with 

a

 requirement of subsections (b), (c), or (d)'' (emphasis added), we believe that the Congress was focusing on any deficiency
that might cause a facility to not be in substantial compliance, not just cases of egregious noncompliance. Therefore,
we cannot accept the commenter's request. 



Comment: 

One commenter recommended that we add the following sentence at the end of proposed  488.232(a)(1)(i): ``In
considering whether it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the facility, the State
shall take into account the relative effects on the facility's residents of relocation and remaining in the facility,
including the availability of suitable alternative placements for them.'' 



Response: 

We are not adopting this recommendation because there may be instances when termination is necessary despite the
fact that it will cause some hardship to residents. As noted earlier, usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative
remedies prior to terminating a facility; however, there may be instances where this is not possible. For example,
a facility could refuse to allow access to the surveyors, or could refuse to submit a plan of correction. A facility
might also remain out of substantial compliance with requirements after an up to 6-month period allowed for correction,
at which time the Act would require termination despite hardships to the residents. 



Comment: 

Several commenters urged us to delete the provision at paragraph (a)(2) that HCFA or the State may terminate the SNF
or NF agreement before the end of a 6-month correction period if the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are
not met. Commenters believed that the Act does not authorize HCFA or the State to terminate a provider agreement if
a facility does not meet the threshold criteria (that is, the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate
to impose an alternative remedy than to terminate the facility; the State has submitted a plan and timetable for correction
approved by HCFA; and the facility, in the case of a Medicare SNF, or the State, in the case of a Medicaid NF, agrees to
repay the Federal government payments received if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved
plan of correction). Commenters believed that once a determination is made to invoke the continuation of payment
provision, a facility should not be terminated or have its Federal funding discontinued unless it is found on a subsequent
survey to present immediate jeopardy, or the 6 months expire and the originally cited deficiencies have not been corrected.
On the other hand, a few commenters recommended that we change the section to read ``HCFA or the State must terminate''
rather than ``may terminate'' as it was proposed. 



Response: 

We disagree with these commenters. First, on its face, the statute does not limit the authority of the Secretary to
deny further payments to facilities or States under these provisions to only those cases where deficiencies pose
immediate jeopardy. Rather, the statute speaks to all providers which do not meet ``a'' requirement of the Act. Second,
the States and the Secretary have plenary authority to terminate provider agreements any time there is facility noncompliance,
and sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)((D) pose no limitation on that authority. If the State survey agency does
not prefer an alternative remedy in lieu of termination to remedy noncompliance, the Act compels the Secretary to
cease payments to the facility under Medicare or the State under Medicaid. If the State survey agency prefers an alternative
remedy in lieu of termination and the other two criteria are not met, the Secretary does not have authority to continue
payments under either program. However, if the State survey agency prefers termination, we cannot preclude a State
from imposing additional remedies while the termination is pending, which can be up to six months from the last day
of the survey. Therefore, we are not accepting the commenter's suggestion that we should continue Federal funding
unless we found on a subsequent survey that deficiencies present immediate jeopardy, or the 6 months have expired
and the facility has not corrected the originally cited deficiencies. To do so would be clearly inconsistent with
the Act, as we have discussed above. Neither immediate jeopardy nor a full 6 months of noncompliance have to have occurred
in order for the State or HCFA to terminate a provider agreement.

We are also not accepting the suggestion to change HCFA 
or the State ``may'' to HCFA or the State ``must,'' since the 
text of the regulations mirrors the Act, which affords 
States and HCFA discretion in these matters.
 


Comment: 

Many commenters suggested that we delete the 
requirement that States submit the plan of correction to 
HCFA for approval in every case for which alternative 
remedies are to be imposed. Some commenters assert that 
this provision, as written, provides strong incentives to 
using termination rather than alternative remedies. They 
point out that if a State survey agency wants to impose any 
remedy other than termination, it must submit a plan of 
correction to HCFA. The commenters believed that this will 
encourage States to terminate a provider agreement rather 
than to impose an alternative remedy because the requirement 
that HCFA approve plans of correction under the continuation 
of payment provision will be administratively burdensome.



Response: 

The requirement that State survey agencies 
submit a plan of correction to HCFA as part of the 
continuation of payment provision is statutory. Sections 
1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act provide that, 
``the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective 
action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary 
approves the plan of corrective action.'' We do not have the 
authority to delegate this function to the State. However, 
we may, through manual instruction provide for a mechanism 
whereby, if the State survey agency has not received 
approval or disapproval from HCFA within a prescribed amount 
of time, we would deem the plan and timetable for corrective 
action approved.



Comment: 

One commenter believed that the Secretary 
should require States to seek HCFA approval for all plans of 
correction involving use of alternative remedies only if the 
review will be done for the purpose of determining whether 
the State has chosen its remedy strategically to achieve the 
appropriate change in facility behavior toward residents. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(2)(C)(ii) and 
1919(h)(3)(D)(ii) of the Act require that the Secretary 
approve all plans of corrective action. Moreover, the Act 
does not delve into the purpose behind approving the plans 
of corrective action (that is only reviewing the plan of 
correction to determine whether the State imposed the best 
remedy for a given situation of noncompliance.) Adding such 
a requirement to the regulation would inappropriately limit 
the authority of the Secretary. For this reason, we are not 
accepting this suggestion. 



Comment: 

One commenter believed that alternatives to 
termination should be allowed to be imposed because, without 
a distinction between level and type of deficiency, even 
minor noncompliance becomes grounds for withholding of 
Medicaid funds.



Response: 

We assume the commenter means that HCFA 
should not use the continuation of payment provision for 
minor noncompliance. As we have explained before, the Act 
makes no such distinction for minor deficiencies. 
Therefore, we have no basis to revise the rule. If the 
commenter is urging the use of remedies instead of 
termination, we believe that the enforcement scheme we have 
designed and in  488.408, which correlates specific 
enforcement responses to specific levels of noncompliance, 
provides for incrementally more severe remedies for more 
serious deficiencies. Also, as discussed elsewhere in this 
final rule, while all facility noncompliance will be 
identified, the enforcement response can range from a 
provider's commitment to correct with no remedies imposed, 
to termination of the provider agreement. Providers found 
to be in substantial compliance will not have remedies 
imposed.

Comment:

 The majority of commenters who responded to this section asked that we take out paragraph (a)(1)(iii), which requires
that States repay Federal funds paid to a nursing facility when alternative remedies are used. One organization stated
that they believe HCFA is basing the regulation on a specific statutory requirement but they believe that this issue
should be discussed before implementation of its provision in the enforcement rules. They said that they believe
that a stronger public policy rests on the use of the alternative remedies and that a facility's failure to comply should
not create a financial threat to the State. 



Response:

 First, we must point out that the repayment provision in redesignated  488.450(a)(1)(iii) is based on the Act
and pertains to facilities, in the case of Medicare SNFs, as well as to the State, for NFs, that are not in substantial
compliance. Second, we recognize that the statutory requirement for State agreement to repay FFP for NFs if facilities
do not achieve substantial compliance can be a barrier for a State survey agency choosing to impose an alternative
remedy in lieu of termination. We understand the commenters' concern that many States will not agree to repay because
a NF's achievement of substantial compliance is not wholly within the State's control. We have been studying the repayment
issue and hope to develop a legislative proposal to remedy the inherent barriers in the Act. Absent a legislative change,
we cannot eliminate the requirement that States agree to repay Federal funds in accordance with section 1919(h)(3)(D)
of the Act. Neither do we have the authority to delay the implementation of this provision without legislative intervention.
However, the Act does not prevent States from obtaining a repayment agreement from a facility. The State could obtain
the facility's repayment agreement either before or after it enters into a repayment agreement with the Secretary.
Nor does the Act require that repayment of Federal funds be made if a facility is not in compliance with Federal requirements.
If the facility does not take corrective action in accordance with its approved plan and timetable and is not in substantial
compliance at the end of the correction period, the facility (for Medicare) or the State (for Medicaid) would be responsible
for repaying Federal payments for the correction period and HCFA would stop any further payment to the facility (for
Medicare) or the State (for Medicaid) for nursing home services. If the facility followed its approved plan and timetable,
but was not able to achieve substantial compliance at the end of the correction period, the facility or State would
not be responsible for repayment of Federal funds, but HCFA would stop further payment to the facility or State for
nursing home services. If a facility does not take action in accordance with its approved plan or correction and timetable,
but is able to achieve substantial compliance, the facility or State would not be responsible for repaying Federal
funds for the correction period, and the facility could continue in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Section 1919(h)(3)(D)
of the Act provide that the State agrees to repay ``if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved
plan and timetable'' that was approved by the Secretary. Furthermore, we have explained above that alternative remedies
can be imposed in addition to termination, and in such cases they would not be subject to the requirements of section
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act.

Comment: 

Many commenters urged HCFA to delay the 
requirement for the State to indemnify HCFA for FFP 
repayment until day 90 if a facility is not in compliance 
with the requirements. Some commenters believed that the 
proposed rule eliminates any incentive for State survey 
agencies to recommend alternative remedies by imposing a 
requirement to indemnify HCFA for FFP from day one. Others 
wanted to modify the regulations so that States would not be 
required to guarantee repayment until day 90. One commenter 
believed that such a policy would be consistent with the Act 
and would ensure that facilities have the opportunity to 
make corrections. 


Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of 
the Act specify that the Secretary may continue payments 
over a period of not longer than 6 months after the 
effective date of the findings. To read ``the effective date 
of the findings'' to mean the 90th day would extend the 
correction period from up to six months and up to nine 
months. Moreover, it would greatly distort the intent and 
clear meaning of the phrase ``effective date of the findings'' 
to designate the 90th day after the findings were first 
cited as the effective date. Therefore, the period covered 
by the sections 1819(h)(3)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act 
is a maximum of six months, starting with the last day of 
the survey. Sections 1819(h)(3)(C)(iii) and 
1919(h)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act provides that the facility 
(for Medicare) and the State (for Medicaid) agree to repay 
the Federal government payments received under these 
subparagraphs if the corrective action is not taken in 
accordance with the approved plan and time period. 
Therefore, if the facility or the State must agree to repay 
money received for the period covered by section 
1819(h)(3)(C) or 1919(h)(3)(D), they must agree to repay 
money received since the last day of the survey. Therefore, 
when the State or a facility enters into a repayment 
agreement and the facility does not take action in 
accordance with its approved plan and timetable for 
corrective action or does not achieve substantial 
compliance, the State or facility would be held financially 
accountable for the period covered by the repayment 
agreement. 
We also disagree with the commenter's assertion that 
the repayment period should not start until the 90th day in 
order to give facilities more time to correct deficiencies. 
The facility is notified of its deficiencies during the 
survey, at the exit conference and then formally through the 
Statement of Deficiencies shortly after the completion of 
the survey. We believe that the beginning of the repayment 
period is irrelevant to the correction period. The facility 
has up to 6 months to take corrective action in accordance 
with its approved plan and timetable for corrective action 
or achieve substantial compliance, or both. If the facility 
does not meet that goal, the State or the facility will be 
expected to pay back the Federal funding for the period 
covered by the repayment agreement. 


Comment: 

Many commenters recommended that we delete 
redesignated  488.450(a)(1)(iii). Their comments included 
the following: 
 It is unrealistic that a State will agree to repay the 
Federal government payments received if corrective action is 
not taken in accordance with a facility's plan of 
correction; 
 The language does not fit within the concept of 
enforcement as envisioned in the Act; 
 This provision is a heavy disincentive to use 
intermediate remedies; 
 A State should not be monetarily penalized for a 
facility's failure to comply with regulations when an 
alternative remedy is chosen over termination; 
 To put the State at risk for something that is 
ultimately out of the State's control does not make for good 
public policy; and

 The provision is beyond statutory authority and should 
be left to the States as to whether or not they wish to 
recover reimbursement from the facilities for noncompliant 
actions. 
A number of commenters asked that we amend this 
subsection to explicitly permit States to enter into 
agreements with facilities to repay Medicaid funds if 
deficiencies are not corrected according to the approved 
plan of correction. Other commenters suggested that we only 
hold a State liable for repayment of Federal Medicaid 
payments to a noncompliant facility if the facility remains 
out of compliance and the State has not made full use of 
available intermediate remedies. One commenter wanted us to 
broaden the rule used for Medicare (that is, that the 
facility agree to repay) to apply to Medicaid as well. 


Response: 

Absent a legislative change, we have limited 
choices when a State survey agency finds a facility out of 
substantial compliance with Federal requirements and 
alternative remedies only are the recommended enforcement 
response. For Medicare, we must obtain an agreement to 
repay from the facility or cease making payment to the 
facility. For Medicaid, we either obtain a repayment 
agreement from the State or stop Federal financial 
participation to the State for that facility. In addition, 
the State may terminate a NF. In response to the commenter 
who worried about the State's liability for up to six months 
of FFP, the Act does not prevent States from securing an 
agreement to repay from the facility before agreeing to 
repay monies to the Federal government. In fact, during the 
transition period between when the new nursing home 
requirements became effective and the effective date of the 
final survey process and enforcement rules, some States have 
obtained agreements to repay from facilities before signing 
agreements to repay to HCFA. However, we will not 
explicitly include in regulation that States are permitted 
to enter into repayment agreements with facilities, nor will 
we broaden the rule for Medicare to apply to Medicaid. The 
State has the discretion to determine whether repayment 
agreements between it and the Medicaid facilities would be 
beneficial. 
We also are not accepting the recommendation to only 
hold a State liable for the repayment of Federal funds if 
the State had not made full use of available alternative 
remedies. Accepting this recommendation would limit the 
Secretary's ability to implement the provisions of section 
1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act. 


Comment: 

One commenter suggested that we replace ``of 
the determination of noncompliance by'' with ``that the 
facility's provider agreement is terminated by'' at 
 488.432(b). 


Response: 

The amended language suggested by the 
commenter substantially alters the meaning of this section 
and, if accepted, would be contrary to the Act. Sections 
1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act permit the 
Secretary to continue payments pending remediation if the 
State, for Medicaid, and the facility, for Medicare, meet 
certain criteria. If the State agency prefers alternative 
remedies rather than termination and the criteria of section 
1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act are not met, the 
Secretary has no authority to make any payments to the 
facility from the ``effective date of the findings,'' that 
is, from the last day of the survey that found the facility 
was not in substantial compliance with the requirements of 
section 1819 (b), (c) or (d) or 1919 (b), (c) or (d) of the 
Act, or both. If termination of a facility's provider 
agreement is sought, payments continue until the effective 
date of termination, which may not be more than 6 months 
after the last day of the survey. Substituting ``that the 
facility's provider agreement is terminated by'' would permit 
more payments to the State or the facility than the Act 
allows. In fact, such a policy would be no different than 
pre-existing policies to stop Federal payments on the 
effective date of termination. For these reasons, we have 
not accepted this comment. 


Comment: 

One commenter pointed out that  488.432(c) 
allows continuation of payments for up to 6 months from the 
last day of survey. The commenter further stated that if 
HCFA intends that the government can decide to give a 
facility less than 6 months of continued payments, HCFA 
should specify clear criteria in the regulations to guide 
this decision. Because the proposed regulations do not 
contain any such criteria, the commenter suggests that we 
delete the words ``up to.'' 


Response: 

We are not accepting the commenter's 
suggestion, and we have not specified criteria as to when 
HCFA or the State would allow continued payments for less 
than 6 months. We do not want to in any way restrict HCFA's 
or the State's ability to decide, on a case-by-case basis, 
the optimal amount of time for continuation of payment for a 
particular facility. 


Comment: 

One commenter offered alternative language 
for  488.432(d) to insert ``substantially'' before ``correct.'' 


Response: 

We are accepting the spirit of the 
commenter's alternate language, and are revising 
redesignated  488.450 to say ``If the facility does not * * * 
achieve substantial compliance''.

Comment:

 One commenter stated the Act does not require that a facility correct all deficiencies; rather, the Act requires that
a facility must have taken corrective action in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.


Response:

 While we believe that a provider must be in substantial compliance by the end of the allotted correction period to avoid
a loss of Federal payments or termination, we agree with the commenter that our language could be more precise and are
revising  488.450(d) to delete the section title ``Deficiencies not corrected'' and renaming it ``Action
not taken in accordance with approved plan and timetable for corrective action.''


Comment:

 Several commenters wanted to expand the period for providing notice of payment cutoff under the six month rule from
15 to 60 days. Commenters asserted that 15 days is insufficient time for the facility to correct any remaining problems
and obtain a follow-up survey. They contend it is even less sufficient if the facility disputes the continued existence
of the deficiencies and desires a hearing on the matter.


Response:

 We are not expanding the notice period from 15 days to 60 days nor do we agree that the 15-day notice period is inadequate.
We base the 15-day notice period prior to termination on our experience with  489.53(c)(1), which sets forth
notice requirements for other providers and suppliers. Moreover, the purpose of the notice is not for a facility to
make last minute corrections, but for the government to help fulfill its duty to provide due process to facilities
before termination. Facilities generally have had notice of their noncompliance long before the 15 days prior to
termination.


Comment:

 One commenter recommended that, unless HCFA is the only party acting (that is, the State does not terminate Medicaid
participation), the State should provide the hearing and final decision. The commenter believed that if HCFA subsequently
disagrees with the State's decision, the facility should not be affected. HCFA's action would be against the State
alone, for recoupment of Federal financial participation, and should be appealed through the normal Departmental
Appeals Board (DAB) process.


Response:

 We assume this commenter is referring to a NF. When a NF's provider agreement is terminated, the appeal procedures
which apply depend on who is taking the enforcement action. If the State is terminating a NF and the Secretary is taking
no action, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 431 apply. If the Secretary exercises her authority, finds noncompliance,
and terminates the NF, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 apply. If a NF is a State-operated entity, the Secretary
always takes the enforcement action, and the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498 would apply. In the case of facilities
which participate as a NF and a SNF (dually participating facilities), where both the State and the Secretary are making
enforcement decisions on the Medicaid and Medicare agreements respectively, the appeal procedures at 42 CFR part
498 apply. Since nearly 80% of all nursing homes are dually participating, the majority of NFs will appeal their enforcement
actions through the Federal appeal procedures at 42 CFR part 498. The appeals mechanism for providers adversely affected
by the repayment provision would be the same as an appeal of noncompliance which led to termination or other enforcement
remedies, except that a State can also appeal the recoupment of FFP under a DAB hearing in accordance with 45 CFR part
16. The recoupment of Federal funds will be one of the results of the termination; however, the noncompliance which
led to termination remains the initial determination which is at issue at the hearing, and is the action on which the
recoupment of funds is predicated.

No Immediate Jeopardy

Many commenters were not aware that most of the provisions in this section are required by the Act. Most of the comments
we received concerned proposed  488.234 as a whole; therefore, we have grouped the comments under generic headings,
rather than under specific subsections. HCFA's Role in Enforcement Decisions.


Comment: 

Some commenters stated that the proposed regulations give HCFA too large of a role in enforcement decisions. 


Response: 

The regulations reflect the statutory role given to the Secretary by the Congress in the enforcement provisions of
the Act. Specifically, sections 1919(h) (5), (6), and (7) require the Secretary's involvement in enforcement decisions
with respect to Medicaid NFs should the Secretary find facility noncompliance and seek to impose either alternative
sanctions or termination or both. 


Comment: 

Several commenters stated that the Congress did not intend HCFA to make all compliance decisions on dually certified
SNF/NFs.


Response: 

HCFA does not make ``all the decisions'' on a dually certified SNF/NF. The Act itself prescribes that a finding of noncompliance,
by either the State or the Secretary, will prevail over the other agency's finding of compliance. Therefore, the Congress
decided that in cases where the agencies disagree, the finding of noncompliance becomes the effective finding regardless
of whether it is the Secretary or the State that has made the finding. In addition, the Act provides that a State's decision
to terminate prevails over HCFA's decision not to terminate, and the State's timing of a termination also prevails
over HCFA's.


Comment: 

Some commenters stated that the Congress did not intend that HCFA ``second guess'' States' decisions on every survey.


Response: 

We have no intention of second guessing the results of every State survey. Sections 1819(g)(3) and 1919(g)(3) of the
Act, however, require the Secretary to conduct validation surveys of a representative sample of SNFs and NFs in each
State within 2 months of surveys by the State survey agency. Section 1919(h)(3)(B) of the Act provides for the Secretary's
general validation authority exclusive of actual on-site validation surveys. As we stated in the proposed rule,
prior to the effective date of OBRA '87, HCFA, acting for the Secretary, monitored State surveys. OBRA '87 formalized
this process. The Congress also made explicit provision for whose enforcement approach would prevail in the case
of a disagreement between the State and HCFA. Sections 1919(h) (6) and (7) of the Act, as implemented by redesignated
 488.452, specify situations in which the State rather than the Federal government prevails, with regard to
the choice of a remedy or the timing of an enforcement action. 


Comment: 

A few commenters stated that HCFA should take enforcement action against a Medicaid provider only after a validation
survey or other on-site survey. Some wanted to change the above regulation by inserting the phrase: ``on the basis
of a validation survey'' after ``HCFA finds.'' Some commenters wanted a State's enforcement decision to be the controlling
decision because the States understand local conditions better than HCFA does. 


Response: 

We are not adopting these proposals to act only on the basis of an on-site validation survey, because they would limit
HCFA's oversight responsibility and limit HCFA's ability to protect residents' health, safety and rights. Federal
surveyors are able to review a State-prepared Statement of Deficiencies and come to an independent conclusion about
whether the deficiencies cited indicate substantial compliance or noncompliance with the statutory and regulatory
requirements. This has been a routine part of HCFA's monitoring of State survey agencies in the past. We do not think
the Congress intended to reduce these monitoring responsibilities.

Federal-State Disagreement







Comment:

 One commenter noted that under  488.452, if a State and HCFA have a difference of opinion on the deficiencies
cited, the one that finds noncompliance prevails. The commenter wondered how an administrator of the facility could
understand how to comply, if the State and HCFA could not agree on compliance/noncompliance. 



Response:

 The Act mandates that the finding of noncompliance prevails over the finding of compliance. All facility administrators
can read the Act, the regulations and the detailed guidelines that have been issued to implement the regulations.
We believe that facilities have a duty to operate in compliance at all times, regardless of whether the State and Secretary
agree that a noncompliance exists. Disagreements between the State and Secretary could be a result of different findings
between Federal and State surveys from different observations at different times, and not necessarily a disagreement
about the same set of facts. The surveys could occur 2 months apart, for example, during which time conditions at the
facility could change. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that  488.452(d)(1) appears to pose double jeopardy for nursing facilities in that compounded
remedies may be applied by both HCFA and the State agency. The commenter did not think that providers should have to
face corrective action from both agencies. Another commenter noted that in case of a Federal survey following a State
survey, two different remedies could apply; for example a State could terminate an agreement and the Secretary could
impose additional civil monetary penalties. The commenter stated that the one-time Federal survey could not consistently
or fairly evaluate the facility, and double sanctions from both agencies would not improve quality of care. The commenter
suggested that only one type of sanction be applied ``after'' the Federal and State surveyors concur on the findings.




Response:

 Section 1919(h)(7) of the Act, specifically envisions cases where a facility may face remedies at the hands of both
a State and HCFA. Section 1919(h)(7)(B) of the Act expressly sets forth the rules as to whose remedies will apply when
either or both parties are seeking to impose alternative sanctions in addition to a provider agreement termination.


We do not accept the implication that one-time Federal surveys cannot fairly evaluate a facility. Federal surveyors
are trained, just as State surveyors are, in the requirements of the Act and the regulations. Federal surveyors have
always conducted Federal monitoring surveys to monitor State survey agency performance; therefore these, statutory
requirements formalize long-standing agency practice. 



Comment:

 One commenter stated that the net effect of the regulations is that facilities will be assumed to be out of compliance.
This commenter stated that historically, facilities were deemed to be in compliance unless there were allegations
to the contrary, and that if Federal and State surveyors disagreed, another survey should be required. 



Response:

 We do not agree that another survey should be conducted whenever there is disagreement between Federal and State surveyors.
Whatever the commenter may think of the wisdom of the Act's ``tie-breaker'' rule, the Congress has been quite clear
in directing which survey decision applies when HCFA and the State disagree about compliance and remedies. We also
do not agree that facilities will be assumed to be out of compliance. Facilities are required to meet all the requirements
at all times. When a facility signs a provider agreement, the facility is agreeing to maintain compliance. The surveyors'
job is to verify that compliance. If either a Federal or State survey finds the facility to be out of compliance with
program requirements, deference must be given to that certification of noncompliance in the interest of the protection
of resident health and safety.

Preference for Intermediate Sanctions Rather than
Termination





Comment:

 Several commenters stated that the proposed regulations allow almost unrestricted use of terminations and do not
promote the use of intermediate sanctions. They wanted HCFA to revise the proposed rules to encourage and promote
the use of intermediate sanctions rather than terminations. 
Some commenters said that intermediate sanctions enable States and HCFA to promote correction of deficiencies with
incentives and pressures different from those imposed by termination or the threat of termination. They enable the
State and HCFA to move quickly against facilities with deficiencies and to target their enforcement actions to the
nature, character, and extent of the deficiencies. They quoted House Report No. 100-391(I) at 451-452,
470-497, as reprinted in 4 U.S. Code and Cong. & Ad. News, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. at 2313-271 through
2313-272, 2313-290 through 2313-296; IOM at Chapter 5 (pp. 146-170); General Accounting
Office, ``Medicare and Medicaid Requirements: Stronger Enforcement of Nursing Home Requirements Needed'' (July
1987).

Some stated that the regulations place roadblocks to the use of intermediate sanctions. They commented that  488.456
allows termination if a facility fails to submit a plan of correction, or fails to comply with a plan of correction.
They also noted that  488.406 describes other remedies as being ``in addition to termination of the provider
agreement.'' They stated that this wording makes it appear as if termination is the preferred or most common remedy.
They were also concerned that   488.410 and 488.415 make termination mandatory if a facility refuses
the appointment of a temporary manager, despite the fact that temporary management ``is not an optional remedy under
the reform law.''

These commenters were concerned that nursing home residents would be subjected to harm because of actual or threatened
terminations of their nursing homes. They stated that language in the preamble, indicating that terminations were
an enforcement response of last resort, was not reflected in the language of the regulations themselves.

Some commenters recommended that the regulations prohibit use of termination as a remedy, except in those circumstances
required under OBRA '87 or when alternative remedies have failed and the condition of the building is unsafe. They
wanted State regulators to find ways to use alternative remedies to protect residents, rather than making them homeless,
or subjecting them to the trauma of threatened termination, stating that ``If the building is safe but care is bad,
the operator should be evicted rather than the residents. Used properly, alternative remedies can be used to force
a substandard provider to sell the facility.''



Response:

 We agree that the use of alternative remedies should be encouraged. However, if a facility chooses not to submit a plan
of correction, neither HCFA nor the State survey agency has any means to determine how the facility intends to improve
conditions of inadequate care and, therefore, no clear picture for how residents will be protected. In such a case,
failure to terminate the provider agreement would be irresponsible on the part of HCFA or the State. However, if the
facility fails to comply with a plan of correction but achieves substantial compliance, we would not terminate the
facility's provider agreement. Allowing a nursing home to participate with deficiencies and with a plan of correction
represents a certain degree of risk. The nursing home's lack of success in making corrections could indicate that
the risk to the residents has not dissipated. Moreover, facilities that had a civil money penalty imposed could face
an increase in their penalty because the noncompliance was uncorrected. The responsible exercise of certification
duties requires that residents be protected, even if termination is necessary to achieve that protection.

We disagree that temporary management ``is not an optional remedy.'' It is the State's or HCFA's decision as to whether
or not to impose temporary management, whether in immediate jeopardy or non-immediate jeopardy situations. In the
former cases, there is a choice between temporary management and immediate termination. If temporary management
is not imposed, either because HCFA or the State considers that action inappropriate or because the facility refuses
to relinquish management control to the temporary manager, the Act requires that the facility's provider agreement
be terminated. We have no authority to ignore this explicit statutory requirement. In the latter cases, temporary
management is an optional remedy when facilities are found to have widespread actual harm.

We note that we have no authority to evict non-complying officers or staff of the provider, as the commenter suggests,
or to force the sale of substandard facilities.



Comment:

 Some commenters stated that we had not presented a coherent scheme for choosing remedies which are tailored to fit
the desired corrective action.

Response: 

It is our intent that both HCFA and the State apply remedies tailored to fit specific problems. We have developed an
enforcement model which correlates categories of remedies to the seriousness of noncompliance. However, with approximately
16,000 nursing homes in the United States, it is impossible to specify in regulations precise remedies to fit every
particular problem in facilities. The seriousness of the noncompliance dictate the category of minimum enforcement
action to be taken. The exact choice of a remedy or remedies from that category should be based on an evaluation of the
nature of the situation in a particular nursing home and the course of action most likely to precipitate the rapid correction
of the noncompliance.


``Pay Back Provisions''





Comment: 

Some commenters proposed interpreting the ``pay back'' provisions in section 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act as applying
only to those rare situations in which the Secretary concludes that termination is necessary, but yields to the State's
recommendation that intermediate sanctions be imposed instead. In situations in which the Secretary does yield
to the State, that action could properly be contingent on the State's promise to repay Federal funds if the intermediate
sanctions do not succeed in bringing the facility into compliance. These commenters wanted HCFA to add language giving
guidance to the States on the corrective action plans mentioned in the Act.


Response: 

We believe that the Congress intended to give facilities the chance to come into substantial compliance during a period
when only limited, alternative remedies are imposed, but that in return for this grace period, during which Federal
money is expended on noncompliant facilities, the facilities (and the State) must agree to repay the Federal money
if substantial compliance is not achieved. Because of the procedural specificity of preparing corrective action
plans, we have decided to incorporate such guidance in manual instructions.


Other Comments




Comment: 

Several commenters suggested that the State be designated the primary enforcement agency, with authority to select
and carry out remedies prior to HCFA review. They feared that enforcement would be delayed if the survey agency only
recommended to HCFA, and waited for HCFA's determination on what remedies to apply. Several commenters suggested
that we delete the requirement that State survey agencies submit the plan of correction along with suggested intermediate
sanctions, to HCFA for approval prior to imposing the intermediate sanctions.



Response: 

The Act is quite clear in its division of responsibilities between the States and the Federal government when it comes
to the enforcement of Federal certification requirements. Under the Medicare program, the State has no authority
to impose remedies as the commenter suggests. Section 1819(h) of the Act reserves all enforcement decisions to the
Secretary and permits States to make recommendations only on the basis of the surveys they do under their section 1864
agreements with the Secretary.

Under the Medicaid program, however, we agree with the commenter that in most cases it is the States in the first instance
that are responsible for enforcement decisions affecting providers of services. In either case, we believe we have
designed an enforcement model that will place a premium on swift action once noncompliance is identified by either
the State or the Secretary, and we do not anticipate delay in the implementation of decisions.



Comment: 

A few commenters wanted to add provisions that would require HCFA and the State to consider the availability of other
nursing home beds, when a termination action is considered. They wanted HCFA and the State to consider the relative
effects on the facility's residents of relocation compared to remaining in the facility.

Response: 

We are not adopting this recommendation because we believe that there may be instances in which termination is necessary
despite the fact that it may cause hardship to residents. Usually, HCFA and the State will impose alternative remedies
prior to terminating a facility, including a mandatory denial of payment for new admissions remedy imposed at the
3rd month; however, there may be instances when this is not possible. For example, a facility could refuse to allow
access to the surveyors, or could refuse to submit a plan of correction. A facility might also remain out of substantial
compliance with requirements after a 6-month period of correction, at which time the Act would no longer authorize
continued payment, despite hardships to the residents. We believe that in those cases in which termination becomes
necessary, the termination is for the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the care to which
they are entitled. 



Comment: 

A few commenters suggested that States should be allowed the discretion to develop their own enforcement systems.




Response: 

The enforcement scheme delineated at  488.408, Selection of Remedies, is a model that States must adopt. States
have the authority granted them under section 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act to specify their own criteria as to when and
how to apply each of the remedies provided by the Act. Moreover, States are authorized to develop alternative remedies,
in accordance with section 1919(h)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, and we encourage them to do so. 



Section 488.454 Duration of Remedies 





Comment: 

In the proposed rule, we said that alternative remedies would continue until HCFA or the State determines that the
facility has corrected all deficiencies, until HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement, 

and

 until HCFA discontinues FFP. This statement included a typographical error (``and'' was used instead of ``or'')
that changed the meaning of the statement. We meant to say that alternative remedies would continue until HCFA or the
State determines that the facility has corrected all deficiencies, until HCFA or the State terminates the provider
agreement, 

or

 until HCFA discontinues FFP. 

Some commenters expressed concern over when deficiencies are considered to be corrected: 

 One said that it is not clear whether compliance is considered achieved when procedures for alleviating the
problem are in place, or when the actual problem no longer exists. 

 One said that once the facility has notified HCFA that a deficiency has been corrected, penalties should be
suspended immediately until the survey team is able to return to the facility to alleviate a possible financial burden
on the facility. 

 Another said that the State should be required to do a follow-up within a specified period of time, and, if it
fails to do so, the remedy should be lifted automatically. 

A number of commenters said that the duration of alternative remedies should be linked solely to the deficiencies
that led to their imposition, not to the correction of all deficiencies. They said that consideration should be given
for significant progress and substantial compliance, suggesting that remedies should be lifted as soon as the facility
corrects all deficiencies that led to the imposition of the remedy. One commenter suggested that even if a deficiency
remains uncorrected, the remedy should be lifted if the scope and severity combination is brought down to a level that
does not authorize the remedy. 



Response: 

Sections 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act specifically state that the denial of payment sanction ends when HCFA
or the State determines that the facility is in ``substantial compliance'' with program requirements. In this final
rule, we are extending this principle to all other alternative remedies as well. The determination that the facility
is in substantial compliance may be made either through a survey team's revisit, or, through some other review, if
HCFA or the State, based on credible evidence which can be verified without an on-site visit, determines that at least
substantial compliance has been achieved. 

However, the Act, at sections 1819(h)(2)(E) and 1919(h)(2)(D), and at sections 1819(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(A)(iii)
provides for certain additional qualifications as to when remedies are lifted, and we are incorporating them in the
regulation as follows: 

 In the case of temporary management, and in the cases of denial of payment and State monitoring imposed because
of repeated substandard quality of care, the remedy continues in effect until the facility has demonstrated, to the
satisfaction of the State or HCFA, that it is in substantial compliance, and that it is capable of remaining in substantial
compliance. (See  488.414) 

In addition, with respect to the duration of all other remedies, we state in this final regulation they remain in effect
until_ 

 A revisit confirms that the facility has achieved substantial compliance; 

 The date HCFA or the State, based on credible written evidence which can be verified without an on-site visit,
determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance; or 

 HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement. 

In accordance with  488.430(i)(7), if a facility can show that substantial compliance was achieved on a date
earlier than a revisit by a survey team or before the State or HCFA receives or examines acceptable credible evidence,
the remedies cease to apply as of that date.

Comment:

 One commenter said that no alternative remedies should be imposed on facilities because it would hamper their efforts
in correcting their deficiencies. 


Response:

 The Congress enacted the various types of alternative sanctions that appear at sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the
Act with the expectation that they would be used. Drawing from the IoM study on nursing homes, which criticized the
large numbers of facilities that fluctuated between compliance and noncompliance, the Act is designed to impose
alternative sanctions swiftly once noncompliance is identified as a means of spurring facilities to correct deficiencies
more rapidly than might otherwise be the case. While this may prove costly to those facilities that find themselves
subject to such sanctions, this is a cost that the Congress obviously anticipated and concluded was necessary to assure
high quality care for program beneficiaries. 


Section 488.456 Termination of Provider Agreement 




Comment:

 Several commenters argued that the proposed regulations rely too heavily upon termination as a remedy. These commenters
feel that termination should be used as a last resort and only where other remedies have failed or where the building
is unsafe. In addition, some of these commenters want to consider the effect of termination on residents (transfer
trauma) and a few of them go further to recommend that the regulations prohibit the use of termination unless immediate
jeopardy to residents is present and only after everything else has failed. 


Response:

 One of the main goals of the proposed enforcement regulations was to increase the number of remedies available to HCFA
and the States in order to ensure compliance with the health and safety requirements. We believe that implementation
of these final regulations will accomplish that goal. While we will encourage the use of alternative sanctions, we
firmly believe that provider agreement terminations may be appropriate in certain cases of noncompliance whether
or not deficiencies pose immediate jeopardy to residents. We, too, are concerned about the potential harm to residents
when they are required to move from a facility. For this reason, the regulations are designed to provide HCFA and the
State survey agency with the ability to target noncompliance with appropriate remedies to assure compliance with
the least disruption to residents and the facility. We cannot, however, restrict the use of termination to immediate
jeopardy situations. Sections 1819(a)(3) and 1919(a)(3) of the Act require that a facility meet all of the statutory
participation requirements to be considered a SNF or a NF, respectively (in other words, participate in either Medicare
or Medicaid). While we have explained elsewhere why it is justifiable to consider substantial compliance as acceptable,
the Act does not limit the above provisions by allowing indefinite noncompliance in non-immediate jeopardy situations.
Indeed, sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act only permit continuation of Federal payments to facilities
with non-immediate jeopardy deficiencies for a maximum of 6 months, and then only if certain criteria are met. Continuation
of payment after 6 months is only permissible if substantial compliance has been achieved. Further, section 1919(h)(7)(A)(i)
reinforces the 6 months maximum for participation for a noncompliant SNF. 


Comment:

 One commenter recommended that HCFA create a conditional waiver, not to exceed two years, that would apply to all physical
environment requirements. The commenter recognized that no period of correction may exceed the 6-month limitation
but pointed out that it may be physically impossible to correct structural deficiencies within that timeframe. Such
correction may necessitate applications for bank loans and certificate of need approval; moreover, the construction
season is limited by geographical location. The commenter believed that creation of conditional waiver not to exceed
two years, for physical environment requirements, would allow facilities to continue to participate legitimately
while correcting problems that the facility cannot correct within the 6-month period. 


Response:

 We agree that some physical environment deficiencies may take longer to correct than others and that these deficiencies
may not be wholly corrected within 6 months of the last day of the survey. However, as we have discussed previously,
facilities must meet the standard of ``substantial compliance'' in order to continue participation in the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. To meet the standard of ``substantial compliance'', deficiencies must be such that they cause
no harm or potential for more than minimal harm. Although we have no desire to terminate facilities that are otherwise
providing good quality of care, we believe that facilities have had ample time to comply with these requirements.
Physical environment requirements have been in place since October 1990. Moreover, this regulation will not become
effective until 6 months after the first day of the month after the regulation is published in the 

Federal Register

, so facilities will have even more time to comply.

Comment:

 A few commenters stated that the termination notice period of 2 days was inadequate to allow a fair opportunity for
elimination of jeopardy. These commenters and others mentioned that the 2-day notice period was inconsistent with
the 23-day termination process outlined at  488.410. One commenter proposed a termination notice of 60 days
for cases not involving immediate jeopardy. The same commenter said the time period should start when the facility
receives notice of the remedies being proposed. One commenter asked how the public was to be notified of a termination
action and another felt a notice should be posted on the front door of the facility. 


Response:

 We are not accepting these comments, although we believe that there may be some misunderstanding among commenters
as to the workings of the fast track termination cycle and the notice provisions applicable to facilities facing adverse
action. In describing these procedures in the proposed rule, we were stressing the paramount significance of protecting
resident health or safety in cases where immediate jeopardy is identified during the survey process. In such cases,
the overriding concern is the removal of the threat either through immediate correction by the facility or by the transfer
of residents to other more qualified facilities following the termination of the deficient facility's provider
agreement. 
We continue to believe that the 2-day prior notice provision of the proposed rule is necessary to protect these resident
interests and we are retaining it for this reason in this final rule. Past experience with this notice provision in
the case of Medicare SNFs has demonstrated to us that it is effective. Having said this, however, we want to dispel those
fears about this provision that in all cases a provider will never have more than 2 days' notice before having its provider
agreement terminated. As described in the proposed rule, we will have in place a 23-day termination cycle in immediate
jeopardy cases. This time frame spans the maximum period of time between the last day of the survey that identified
immediate jeopardy and the effective date of the termination. Thus, in many cases, providers, which will have been
advised of the survey findings during the survey or at the exit conference, will often have ample time to remove the
conditions that gave rise to the immediate jeopardy finding. The prior notice must be given early enough so that the
termination date does not extend beyond the 23-day period should the facility fail to remove the immediate jeopardy.

Facilities facing adverse action in these cases will not be guaranteed the maximum amount of time provided by these
regulations. For those facilities whose substandard conditions warrant the quickest possible response, it is entirely
possible that the effective date of the termination action will occur sooner than the 23rd day after the survey; and
it is these facilities that will likely receive notice of the impending action against them as quickly as administratively
feasible following the survey. 
Extensive experience has demonstrated that it is possible to schedule revisits in a short time frame to verify that
the immediate jeopardy has been removed. Because of our experience that the 23-day process works, we will continue
to start the clock on the last day of the survey to ensure that jeopardy situations do not remain long uncorrected. We
see no justification for facilities to receive additional time to correct instances of immediate jeopardy. In the
same vein, we will continue to give a 15-day notice to the public and the facility in non- immediate jeopardy cases,
and a maximum of 6 months from the last day of the survey to reach substantial compliance before termination is effective.
A 15-day notice in nonimmediate jeopardy cases is a well established practice for all provider types. For both immediate
jeopardy and non-immediate jeopardy situations, the public will be notified of terminations by a variety of means;
in most instances, this will be accomplished by a newspaper notice, as is the predominant present practice. We believe
that a public notice posted on the front door of the facility would be an unnecessary affront to the facility when Federal
requirements stipulate that the survey results be made available to residents for examination in a place readily
accessible to residents and a notice of their availability must be posted (see  483.10(g)).

Comment:

 A few commenters felt that termination should not be applied if deficiencies were corrected within the delineated
timeframes. One commenter said that the timeframe for termination should be no shorter than 6 months in cases that
do not constitute immediate jeopardy. One commenter suggested that the regulation require an ``acceptable plan
of correction'' from the facility. 



Response: 

Current practice and the final regulations assure that termination will not be applied if noncompliance has been
corrected within the designated timeframes. Redesignated  488.456(b)(1) states that the facility's provider
agreement may be terminated if the facility_ 

 Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of participation; or 

 Fails to submit a plan of correction with the time specified by HCFA or the State. 

Section 488.456(b)(2) states that HCFA and the State will terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_

 Fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, if that remedy is imposed by HCFA or the State; or 

 Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment as set forth in  488.412(a)(1). 

However, the Act does not mandate an automatic 6 month period for the correction of all deficiencies; 6 months is the
outside limit permitted for correction of deficiencies that constitute noncompliance and then only when specific
statutory criteria are met. The States and HCFA must have the flexibility to choose appropriate remedies, including
termination, and timeframes appropriate to the noncompliance identified. We agree with the suggestion to revise
redesignated  488.456(b)(1)(ii) to read ``an acceptable plan of correction.'' This change is in line with
our current practice. 



Comment:

 A few commenters were concerned that the proposed regulations were unreasonable and that HCFA and the States should
have an objective, measurable mechanism to govern the enforcement procedures. Another commenter felt the new regulations
would inflate termination actions tenfold and increase the State agency workload. 



Response: 

We do not agree with these comments. These regulations are designed to encourage the selection of a particular remedy
based on the nature of the noncompliance and the likelihood of immediate and sustained compliance. It was the intent
of the Act that the availability of additional remedies will mean that HCFA and the States will use termination as a
remedy less frequently. The use of these regulations for the selection of remedies will help ensure that the selection
of remedies is consistent and appropriate. We expect that these new regulations will not cause greater expenditures
for the State agencies. However, as we said in the proposed rule, a reallocation of resources, particularly geared
to more intensive monitoring of marginal facilities may well occur. 



Comment:

 One commenter recommended amending the regulations to permit the survey agency to initiate termination actions
based upon poor compliance history. 



Response: 

The Act provides the States and HCFA with the authority to terminate facilities with poor compliance histories. Specifically,
sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act provide for State and Federal discretion as to whether or not
termination is preferable to the imposition of alternative remedies in the case of noncompliance that constitutes
non-immediate jeopardy. We expect that a facility's previous history will be a significant factor in the determination
of whether termination or an alternative remedy is preferred. However, poor history in and of itself can not warrant
termination if the noncompliance has not persisted. That is, if the provider has indicated poor performance in the
past but is in compliance in the present, there would be no basis for termination. 



Section 488.426 Transfer of Residents



After considering comments we received on proposed  488.226 and  488.240, we have decided to combine
both sections in a new  488.426. We believe this change will be less confusing as transfers for all nursing homes
can be referenced in one place. 



Comment:

 One commenter asked the following questions: If a facility is terminated, who will be responsible for placing the
residents elsewhere? If no bed is available, who will pay for the residents' care in the facility until a bed is found?
The commenter stated that the State should have the responsibilities regarding transfer and discharge (in other
words, tour of the new facility, counseling, orientation to the new facility, etc.), to avoid transfer trauma.

Response:

 Proposed  488.240, now incorporated into 
 488.426, stated that the State must arrange for the 
orderly transfer of residents when a facility is closed or 
its provider agreement is terminated. Further protection 
for residents is available in regulation. Section 489.55 
provides that payment is available for up to 30 days after 
the effective date of termination for eligible residents and 
 441.11(a)(2) states that, in the case of continuation of 
FFP for Medicaid, the Medicaid agency must make reasonable 
efforts to transfer recipients to other facilities. The 
regulation clearly gives the responsibility for orderly 
transfer of residents to the State. Each case involving the 
transfer of residents could potentially be different. We 
are, therefore, leaving it up to the State to decide, on a 
case-by-case basis, what steps need to be taken to reduce 
the risk of transfer trauma, understanding that the State's 
responsibility is to minimize the period of time during 
which residents are receiving less than adequate care. 


Comment:

 One commenter stated that a finding of 
immediate jeopardy will result in the facility's emergency 
closure and transfer of the residents. This commenter asked 
where residents would be transferred if a county or 
particular area had too few available beds? 


Response:

 The finding of immediate jeopardy will not, 
in and of itself, require States to close a facility and 
transfer Medicare and Medicaid residents. In an emergency, 
the State could transfer Medicare and Medicaid residents to 
another facility or facilities. There could be situations, 
such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, where the 
State would temporarily transfer residents to another 
facility until the facility can adequately care for its 
residents. In this case, the facility did nothing wrong. 
However, in the case of immediate jeopardy, the facility 
failed to protect the health or safety of its residents. 
For immediate jeopardy situations, the statute at sections 
1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act provides for immediate 
termination if the jeopardy is not removed, but it does not 
require the State to close the facility. However, when a 
facility is terminated for immediate jeopardy, the State has 
up to 30 days to transfer the facility's Medicare and 
Medicaid residents. Most States have a relocation plan that 
outlines the circumstances under which the plan will be put 
into effect and the procedures to be followed. These plans 
usually provide for first attempting to place residents in 
the closest facility or facilities and then attempting 
placement at increasingly distant facilities until available 
beds are found. We believe it is unnecessary to mandate 
procedures for States to follow in cases of closure or 
transfer of residents, and that no greater procedural 
specificity is required in regulations. 


Comment:

 One commenter expressed concern that after 
coming to a nursing home with the expectation of living out 
the rest of one's life there, a resident may be forced to 
move to another location because of some technicality. 


Response:

 Termination and closure of a facility are 
among several remedies available to protect the health and 
safety of Medicare and Medicaid residents. Although it is 
possible that a noncompliant facility could be terminated 
for not submitting to a plan of correction, as is required 
for continuing participation in the Medicare or Medicaid 
program, it is not likely. Most nursing homes are 
interested in participating in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs and will not risk termination based on such 
noncompliance. 


Comment:

 Several commenters requested that we place 
more requirements upon the States to assist residents, 
should a facility lose its Medicare or Medicaid 
certification. Two of the commenters, representing consumer 
organizations, believe proposed  488.240 is inadequate in 
terms of requirement specificity, and they provided a 
complete and detailed rewrite of the section. Their 
experience with closures and decertifications in the last 5 
years has led them to believe that providers and regulators 
cannot be trusted to provide a ``safe and orderly'' transfer 
process. As a result, their rewrite focuses on the 
recommendation that HCFA mandate the States to develop plans 
that provide requirements for the ``safe and orderly'' 
transfer of all residents when the State closes a facility. 

Included in the rewrite are provisions that outline 
specific residents' rights in the transfer process such as, 
determining the location of the transfer, availability of 
counseling and support, and the transferring of residents' 
possessions and trust funds. The commenters also address 
requirements for the new admitting facility, as well as 
requirements for the coordination among appropriate 
agencies, organizations and ombudsmen involved in the 
transfer process.

To ensure proper development and execution of the plan, 
the commenters recommend that we require the State to submit 
its transfer plan to HCFA for approval. HCFA, in turn, 
should assess performance under the transfer plan annually, 
during the review of the State's enforcement performance. 
The commenters end their rewrite of proposed  488.240 with 
an enforcement recommendation that if the State's transfer 
plan is found inadequate, HCFA should take actions as 
described in proposed  488.243 (b) and (c). They also 
recommend that immediate implementation of the plan be 
waived during a crisis or disaster which makes it impossible 
to fully implement a State's transfer plan. 

In addition to the detailed rewrite of the section, the 
commenters recommend that the term ``all residents'' be 
defined, because the amount of assistance residents receive 
in the transfer process is directly related to their 
Medicaid, Medicare, or private payment status. For example, 
Medicaid residents receive services such as notice of 
closing, information about care options, counseling, 
transportation, and other types of relocation assistance. 
Medicare residents are often not offered any of these 
services, and private pay residents usually receive no help 
whatsoever. One commenter suggested that it is 
inappropriate to ``require'' the transfer of residents if the 
facility has not been delicensed by the State and the 
residents choose to remain at the facility. 

Further, one of the commenters states that the preamble 
and the text of the proposed regulation differ as to which 
agency has the responsibility for transferring residents, 
with the preamble stating that the State agency must arrange 
for transfer, proposed  488.240 stating that the State has 
the responsibility, and  441.11(a)(2) stating that the 
Medicaid agency does. 



Response: 

We believe the commenters inadvertently 
transposed proposed section numbers  488.234 (b) and (c) as 
there are no proposed sections  488.243 (b) and (c). We 
appreciate these very thorough and specific comments and the 
amount of effort that went into them. Although there are 
valid considerations in the suggested rewrite of this 
section, some of them may be impossible for the States to 
implement. We, therefore, choose not to impose such 
stringent requirements on the States. Existing regulations 
at  483.12(a) provide numerous procedural safeguards 
regarding the transfer and discharge of residents. In 
addition, the States are already required by sections 
1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act to provide for the 
orderly transfer of residents when a facility is terminated 
or closed, and at sections 1819(c)(2) and 1919(c)(2) of the 
Act, to provide notice of transfer at least 30 days in 
advance in most cases. We agree that proposed  488.240, 
now incorporated into  488.426, which uses the words ``all 
residents,'' may be overly broad and we are revising that 
section to specify that only Medicare and Medicaid residents 
are affected by this section. We accept the suggestion that 
the term ``orderly transfer'' be amended to ``safe and orderly 
transfer'' to maintain consistency with the language of 
sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act. Since 
sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) address immediate 
jeopardy terminations, we cannot accept the comment that it 
is appropriate to allow any Medicare or Medicaid residents 
to remain in a facility that is being terminated for such 
serious situations. To do so, would put these residents in 
jeopardy and would be clearly contrary to sections 
1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act. 

The following addresses what one of the commenters 
perceives as conflicting information regarding 
responsibility for the orderly transfer of residents. The 
preamble did indeed state that the survey agency is 
responsible for arranging for transfers, while proposed 
 488.240 (now incorporated into  488.426) is taken 
directly from sections 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act and 
places the responsibility generally on the State. We wish 
to give the States the greatest latitude in determining 
which State agencies they will use. Therefore, it is our 
intent to rely on the broader interpretation in proposed 
 488.240 and place the responsibility on the State as 
required by the Act. Although the commenter has correctly 
pointed out that  441.11(a)(2) places the responsibility on 
the Medicaid agency, we believe that each State should be 
given the flexibility to select the appropriate agency under 
its particular governmental structure. Therefore, we are 
revising  441.11(a)(2) accordingly. 



Comment:

 This commenter stated that, in the past, the 
responsibility for arranging for the orderly transfer of 
residents to another facility whenever a provider agreement 
is terminated has been placed on the facility operator 
subject to the State's oversight. This commenter stated 
that the proposed regulations would impose substantial costs 
and uncertain legal liabilities upon the State. 



Response:

 According to existing regulations at 
 483.12(a), the State, not the facility, has had the 
responsibility in the past for numerous procedural 
safeguards regarding the transfer and discharge of residents 
and has funded such costs. Sometimes the facilities 
cooperate in the transfer of residents and sometimes they do 
not. Sometimes they have no resources with which to help. 
Therefore, the ultimate responsibility for all aspects 
relative to transfer of residents in the case of a facility 
closure lies with the State to ensure that the well-being of 
residents is protected. 



Comment:

 Another commenter agreed with the regulatory 
text but wanted us to require, in the case of provider 
agreement termination, that the State permit a resident to 
remain in a terminated facility provided the resident 
arranges to pay for his or her care and the facility does 
not close. 



Response:

 It is not necessary to require States to 
allow residents to remain in terminated facilities because 
they already have that right. If a resident prefers to 
remain in a terminated facility that is still operating, and 
is able to pay for his or her own care, that resident has 
every right to do so. The government has fulfilled its 
obligation by providing notice to residents that the 
facility's provider agreement has been terminated. This 
applies whether or not immediate jeopardy exists. The State 
is the only entity that has the authority to close or 
delicense a facility. 



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that if residents are 
transferred because a facility is terminated, we should 
require that the State provide for such transfer, at its own 
expense, and that it be held liable for its action during 
such action.

Response:

 We already require the State to transfer 
Medicare and Medicaid residents to another facility or 
facilities in immediate jeopardy terminations. In fact, for 
Medicaid residents, the State is paid up to 30 days of FFP 
for the safe and orderly transfer to another facility or 
facilities after termination. We have not accepted the 
comment that the State be held liable for its action during 
such transfer. A State's liability should come under the 
purview of State law. We have no statutory basis to hold 
States liable for such actions. Therefore, we have not 
included this provision in the regulation. 


Comment:

 One commenter, representing a State Department 
of Aging, stated that the language in the proposed rule 
regarding transfer of residents is inadequate and provided a 
list of minimum requirements for States. The twelve 
requirements listed have all been covered by the preceding 
commenters except for the following two instances. The 
commenter recommends that a facility that is being 
terminated be monitored daily and also recommends that 
ongoing counseling for residents include follow-up post- 
transfer counseling. 


Response:

 Although the suggestion that facilities in 
the process of being terminated be monitored daily is well- 
intentioned, the specifics of transfer plans are under the 
purview of the States. We are not mandating that the States 
take specific action other than that already required and it 
is unlikely they could implement this suggestion given the 
uncertainty of how long the process will take and how much 
funding they will have available. Regarding the suggestion 
that follow-up post-transfer counseling be provided to 
residents, again it is the State that determines which 
services are provided for transfer of residents. 


Informal Dispute Resolution ( 488.331) 


In the preamble to the proposed rule, we specifically 
asked for public comment about the desirability and 
feasibility of establishing a formal conflict resolution 
process whereby providers dissatisfied with survey findings 
could request a review of the deficiencies after the survey 
and prior to the formal administrative and judicial review 
processes. We also acknowledged the existence of the 
numerous informal opportunities providers currently have 
throughout the survey process to challenge survey findings: 
during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting 
receipt of the official deficiency statement, through 
dialogue with State and regional officials, and upon 
receiving the official deficiency statement. 
The term ``conflict'' resolution has been changed to 
``dispute'' resolution in this final rule to be consistent 
with terminology used in the Administrative Dispute 
Resolution Act (ADRA) of 1990 and Executive Order 12778, 
which encourage such a process. 
Many commenters believe that a dispute resolution 
process is necessary. A few do not. 


Comment:

 The majority of commenters in favor of a 
dispute resolution process contend that there is currently 
no means for providers to resolve conflicts with survey 
findings short of costly litigation. Most say that they are 
either not afforded the informal opportunities to resolve 
conflicts to which we referred in the preamble to the 
proposed rule, or that the outcome of those opportunities is 
predetermined and, therefore, of little value. Also, many 
cite the ADRA of 1990 and Executive Order 12778 which (they 
claim) direct Federal agencies to develop dispute resolution 
mechanisms in an effort to reduce costly and lengthy 
litigation. A few commenters believe such a process could 
also serve as a means to measure surveyor quality assurance. 
The majority of comments supporting a process suggested 
that HCFA mandate an informal dispute resolution process, 
while less than one-third preferred that HCFA mandate a 
formal one. Several commenters suggested that HCFA adopt 
the current dispute resolution process of a specific State, 
for example, Ohio or Louisiana. These commenters contend 
that existing programs in specific States have been 
successful in resolving conflicts about survey findings. 
Others suggested that HCFA require that each State establish 
a State-specific process, in order to give States the 
flexibility to work within their existing administrative 
framework. Commenters proposed that since most States 
already have some type of dispute resolution process, we 
need only to require that it be formalized; in other words, 
in written form and publicly recognized. Commenters also 
suggested that HCFA establish one process to be used by all 
States. These comments were presumably based on the belief 
that a single process mandated by HCFA is the most effective 
means to ensure that consistent opportunities are offered in 
a consistent manner to all nursing home providers 
dissatisfied with survey findings. The proposals we 
received for a single process varied in extent and 
sophistication and included suggestions that the dispute 
resolution process: 
 Offer resolution opportunities at specific times during 
the survey (for example, conduct daily exit conferences or 
communicate at the time a deficiency is identified), and 
cease offering opportunities beyond specific events (for 
example, after the exit conference or after the issuance of 
the deficiency statement); 
 Provide multi-tiered opportunities that could include 
monitoring of corrections and mandatory revisits;

<DOC>

<TEXT>
 

 Be limited to deficiencies at specific scope and 
severity levels; 
 Offer opportunities proportionate to the noncompliance; 
 Allow incorrectly cited deficiencies and scope and 
severity scale levels to be removed from the deficiency 
statement; 
 Require that another survey be conducted by different 
surveyors; 
 Establish local or national advisory councils, 
arbitration panels, or quality assurance committees, etc., 
comprised of specific types of individuals not previously 
directly involved in the dispute; and 
 Involve consumers and ombudsmen. 



Conversely, other commenters did not believe that a 
dispute resolution process is necessary. They said that 
providers already have numerous opportunities to refute 
survey findings throughout the survey process. Some alleged 
that an additional process would only serve to delay the 
enforcement process which would be contrary to the OBRA '87 
mandate to minimize the time between the identification of 
violations and final imposition of enforcement remedies. 
Some also believed that if such a process were in place, 
deficiencies may not be cited or, at a minimum, they would 
be cited at lower scope and severity scale levels to reduce 
the universe for challenges. 



One consumer organization argued that the regulatory 
system is not a two-party system in which the facilities and 
the State negotiate. Rather, it is a contractual 
arrangement in which the State holds the public's trust and 
acts as the public's agent to ensure that the contractees 
satisfy the arrangement. They believed that if any party 
should have ``appeal'' rights, it is the residents who should 
be able to contest survey findings that do not require 
facilities to comply with the law. They submitted, 
therefore, that instead of establishing a dispute resolution 
process for providers, HCFA should build mechanisms into the 
survey procedures to notify residents, families, ombudsmen 
and others when surveyors, during the course of the survey, 
have not yet been able to substantiate suspected problems. 
These procedures would provide an opportunity for residents 
and families to provide additional information to surveyors. 



One commenter, opposed to a dispute resolution process, 
remarked that there is currently so much interaction between 
surveyors and providers during the survey process that 
providers are actually interfering with the performance of 
the survey. This commenter suggested that a sanction be 
imposed against providers when this occurs. 



Overall, most commenters, including States, offered 
strong support for a dispute resolution process. These 
commenters were interested in resolving conflicts as early 
in the survey process as possible and prior to litigation. 
They prefer to minimize the number of issues that could 
advance to formal litigation by resolving early those 
conflicts caused by misunderstandings, miscommunication, 
oversights, etc. However, the consumer advocacy groups were 
adamant in their opposition, arguing that any additional 
process will delay the enforcement process against 
noncompliant facilities and shift focus away from resident 
care. These commenters believe that the perceived need by 
providers for a dispute resolution process must be secondary 
to the responsibility HCFA, the States, and facilities have 
to provide for the health and well-being of nursing home 
residents. 





Response

: We recognize the validity of both major 
points of view and have concluded that both perspectives 
must be addressed. 



In the Fall of 1992, we asked the States to provide us 
with a description of existing dispute resolution processes 
offered to providers who disagree with survey findings. All 
States responded. Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and Guam 
were not asked to provide their comments due to the small 
number of facilities surveyed. We discovered that all 
States currently have a dispute resolution process. 
Nevada's system of due process is required by State law. 
The other States' processes, although not legally mandated, 
are reflective of State policy and not legislation. The 
policies vary among States, and there are numerous 
differences in the details of the processes of individual 
States. 



Overall, the opportunities offered to providers by 
States to challenge survey findings can be divided into two 
basic stages: during and after the survey. All States 
offer the providers a chance for rebuttal during at least 
one of these stages; half of the States include both in the 
process. During the survey, the opportunities afforded 
providers include the chance for the provider's staff to 
interact with the survey team throughout the process and the 
specific opportunity to discuss survey findings at the exit 
conference. After the survey, many States allow the 
providers to elevate unresolved issues to survey agency 
management and/or the HCFA regional office for resolution. 
Moreover, providers in all States may record their 
disagreement with survey findings on the Statement of 
Deficiencies HCFA-2567. 



Our State Operations Manual currently requires that 
States allow facilities to interact with the survey team 
during the survey, to discuss findings at an exit 
conference, to raise unresolved issues to the survey agency 
and/or to the HCFA regional office and to record their 
disagreements with survey findings on the HCFA-2567.

As we reviewed all of the comments supporting a dispute 
resolution process, it became apparent that, while the words 
``informal'' and ``formal'' were used to distinguish the type of 
process a specific commenter preferred, many commenters, 
regardless of which word was used, preferred the same 
process. The majority of those in favor of a dispute 
resolution process have asked that it be required by HCFA. 
Since many believe that a process can be required only 
through rulemaking, most commenters, therefore, prefer a 
regulatory process. 



We note that the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act 
of 1990 and the Executive Order 12778 of October 23, 1991, 
Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195), encourage, but do not 
direct dispute resolution, as some commenters have claimed. 



We are not accepting those comments proposing that we 
adopt a specific State's process on a national level, nor 
those suggesting that each State be permitted to design its 
own process in its entirety. While we have concluded that 
all States offer some opportunity to resolve disputes, we 
have no evidence that suggests that any particular State's 
process is more successful or effective than that of another 
State. 



However, we are accepting, with modification, the 
suggestion that HCFA adopt one process to be used by all 
States. Just as participation requirements and the survey 
and certification process for nursing homes are consistent 
from State to State, so should the opportunity for providers 
to challenge survey findings. In  488.331, we are 
requiring several core elements that all informal dispute 
resolution processes must include as a minimum: 


 
The entity conducting the survey must offer nursing 
home providers the opportunity, if they request it, to 
refute survey findings beginning with their receipt of the 
official HCFA-2567 with which they disagree; 


 
Providers must be able to advance their disagreements 
to survey agency or HCFA regional office officials, or both; 


 
In no case, will dispute resolution delay the 
effective date of an enforcement action; 


 
The dispute resolution process (whether or not it 
exceeds the minimum requirements specified in this final 
rule) must be available to providers, upon their request, in 
written form. HCFA regional offices provide dispute 
resolution to providers upon request, relative to Federal 
surveys. 



We believe that specific procedural requirements that 
determine the manner in which dispute resolution proceeds, 
for example, such things as how the request is made, the 
method by which the process is conducted, and who may 
participate in the process, should be left to the individual 
States. Upon the facility's request, the State will provide 
a written summary of that State's procedures relative to the 
informal dispute resolution process. Any attempt on our 
part to codify procedural aspects of dispute resolution that 
would be applicable to all States would limit States' as 
well as providers' flexibility in utilizing and refining the 
process, as necessary, to satisfy their needs. 



To allay commenters' fears that dispute resolution 
would stall the survey process and delay enforcement action, 
we are providing in  488.331 the opportunity for providers 
to dispute survey findings upon receipt of the official 
HCFA-2567 with which they disagree, while prohibiting 
challenges by providers from postponing or otherwise 
delaying the enforcement process. In no case will dispute 
resolution delay the effective date of an enforcement 
action. Thus, while it is our hope that dispute resolution 
procedures could be completed in all cases before the 
effective date of the enforcement action, we wish to make it 
clear that where the completion of these procedures does not 
occur by that time, this will not be grounds to either delay 
the enforcement action or give providers a right to 
challenge the inadequacy of these procedures. We believe 
that to have a process that would allow for enforcement to 
be deferred pending the scheduling and completion of this 
informal appeals process is far outweighed by the needs of 
residents to face a minimum of time during which they 
receive care that does not meet the requisite health and 
safety standards. We also believe that not delaying the 
effective date of the enforcement action until the 
conclusion of the dispute resolution process will encourage 
facilities to make the kind of swift corrections the 
Congress obviously intended when it enacted nursing home 
reform. If a provider is subsequently successful, during 
the dispute resolution process, at demonstrating that 
deficiencies should not have been cited, the deficiencies 
are removed from the HCFA-2567 and any enforcement actions 
that had been imposed as a result of those cited 
deficiencies are lifted.

This dispute resolution system does not introduce 
additional requirements into the survey process; rather, it 
reinforces instructions that already exist but which have 
been applied inconsistently up to this point. Because we 
are formalizing this element of the appeals process, we are 
amending the appeals procedures at 42 CFR parts 431 and 498 
to eliminate the reconsideration process for SNFs and NFs, 
respectively. Informal dispute resolution will duplicate, 
in every pertinent way, this element of the process since it 
will provide the opportunity for providers to contest survey 
findings informally just as reconsiderations currently are 
designed to do. Accordingly, we have concluded that 
retaining the reconsideration process for SNFs and NFs would 
create redundant procedures and are amending it so that it 
applies only to other provider and supplier types. 

Regarding the comment to use dispute resolution as a 
means to measure surveyor consistency, accuracy, and 
decision-making, section 1819(g)(2)(D) of the Act requires 
the Secretary and the States, and section 1919(g)(2)(D) of 
the Act requires that States, implement programs to measure 
and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey 
results among surveyors. HCFA and the States will develop 
their own mechanisms to satisfy this requirement and may 
choose to use the dispute resolution process as a means to 
evaluate surveyor performance in this area. 

We do not agree with some commenters' characterization 
of dispute resolution as negotiation between providers and 
the survey agency, nor do we agree that a process should be 
established to notify residents and their families when 
surveyors require additional information in identifying 
deficiencies. First, dispute resolution as required in this 
final rule does not contemplate bargaining between providers 
and the survey agency; rather, it is a preliminary 
opportunity for providers to refute survey findings that 
they believe are inaccurate and to present evidence to 
support their belief. The purpose of this informal process 
is to clarify, if not eliminate, the issues that might 
otherwise lead to needless litigation and to sharpen the 
issues for an administrative law judge or State hearing 
official so that litigation, should it occur, may be less 
burdensome and costly. This may work in two ways. It may 
convince the State or HCFA officials that erroneous 
deficiencies have been cited, or it may convince providers 
that, because the State and HCFA have ample support for 
their conclusions, it would be unwise for providers to pursue 
litigation. 

Second, States enter into an agreement with the 
Secretary (HCFA), in accordance with section 1864 of the 
Act, to act as HCFA's agent for the purpose, (among others), 
of determining if a facility meets participation 
requirements. After following the survey protocol, which 
includes interviews with residents, and family members or 
legal representatives, surveyors may find that they do not 
have sufficient information to cite a deficiency. However, 
we note that whenever nursing home residents or their 
families believe that a deficient or otherwise inappropriate 
practice exists in the facility, regardless of whether a 
survey is in process, they should contact the State 
ombudsman, request a complaint investigation, or both. 

Some commenters believe that a dispute resolution 
mechanism may impact on how surveyors recognize deficiencies 
as well as how they assign scope and severity scale levels 
to cited deficiencies. First, it is important that 
commenters be absolutely clear that neither the enforcement 
scheme presented in the proposed rule nor the modified model 
in this final rule was developed for the purpose of 
identifying deficiencies. Rather, the assessment factors 
discussed under ``Factors to be Considered in Selecting 
Remedies'' of this preamble and codified at  488.404 of this 
final rule will be used (as the former scope and severity 
scale was to be used) to evaluate the seriousness of 
deficiencies already identified in order to determine what, 
if any, enforcement action is appropriate. Second, in 
response to public comment, this final rule has incorporated 
the concept of substantial compliance. This concept, which 
is discussed in detail under ``Certification of Compliance'' 
of this preamble, provides that not all deficiencies will 
result in enforcement action and should, therefore, 
eliminate resistance or hesitation of surveyors to cite 
deficiencies that they have identified for fear of provider 
disputes of lower-level assessment determinations. As we 
have stated elsewhere in this preamble, the survey process 
provides several opportunities for deficient practices or 
otherwise inadequate performance on the part of the State to 
be identified and sanctioned. Therefore, if the situation 
described by the commenters should occur, there are adequate 
statutory and regulatory mechanisms to respond to it.

We do not accept the comment that we should sanction a 
provider for interfering in the performance of a survey. We 
believe that this situation is adequately addressed in 
section 2713 of the State Operations Manual, which provides 
that surveyors may allow, or refuse to allow, facility 
personnel to accompany them during a survey. Each case is 
at the surveyors' discretion and is to be worked out with 
facility management. If it cannot be worked out, surveyors 
should contact their supervisors.



Determination of a Deficiency 



Many commenters responded to our request in the proposed 
rule for recommendations for a regulatory design that could 
accommodate the use of scope and severity scales for 
determining deficiencies. 



Comment:

 A large number of commenters recommended that 
we adopt a system for determining deficiencies similar to 
that used by the State of Ohio. The Ohio system employs the 
use of a worksheet that must be completed for each violation 
of a requirement. The worksheet evaluates violations 
against criteria such as preventability and resident choice, 
and then classifies violations based on ratings of scope and 
severity into two types. The first type is called a 
deficiency and the second, lesser violation, is called a 
finding. Both a deficiency and a finding are recorded on 
the statement of deficiencies and are disclosable to the 
public, but only a deficiency would require a remedy. To 
the extent that the State of Ohio does not use scope and 
severity scales to determine whether a violation should 
appear on the statement of deficiencies but rather to 
determine appropriate enforcement action, the Ohio 
enforcement system is similar to the one that we proposed. 

Another model proposed requires a mathematical weight 
for each tag number identified in the interpretive 
guidelines. Individual data elements would be ranked in 
descending order according to their importance in a 
regulation. The model then calls for a statistical 
computation incorporating scope to determine whether a 
deficiency exists. 

A third model submitted involves two factors in 
determining whether an observation is a deficiency. The 
first factor is preventability. Under this proposal, if 
either the negative outcome could not have reasonably been 
foreseen or if the facility could foresee the negative 
outcome and did everything reasonably possible to prevent 
its occurrence but it occurred nonetheless, a deficiency 
would not be cited, regardless of scope and severity. The 
second factor is substantiality. If a facility were 
determined to be in substantial compliance with a 
requirement, a deficiency would not exist. Scope and 
severity would be used to determine if the requirement were 
met. 

Other models that incorporate the concept of substantial 
compliance into the determination of deficiencies but that 
do not involve the use of scope and severity scales were 
also recommended. One commenter suggested that we create an 
audit form outlining the minimum requirements for long term 
care facilities, and then rate each item either a ``pass'' or 
a ``fail'' depending upon whether the requirement was 
substantially met. Another suggestion was that we calculate 
a percentage of error rate for each requirement and evaluate 
the rating against a tolerable threshold of compliance. 
Certain commenters believed that for resident outcomes to 
have significance in the survey process, negative findings 
which have no adverse impact upon the care being received by 
residents should not constitute citable deficiencies. One 
commenter recommended that we adopt the Joint Commission on 
the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' accreditation 
system which places any minor deficiencies that do not meet 
substandard care criteria on a recommendation report and 
reserves the official citations for substandard care. Other 
commenters believed that guidelines should express a 
standard of ``practicably met compliance with requirements'' 
which they asserted would be comparable to the ``highest 
practicable'' language applied to facility responsibility for 
resident care. 

Although the majority of commenters (mostly from the 
provider community) favored the use of scope and severity 
scales to determine deficiencies, a significant number of 
commenters did oppose it. Many of these were concerned that 
the use of scope and severity scales to determine 
deficiencies would violate the intent of the Act that all 
requirements be met and enforced. One commenter noted that 
the intent of the Act is to ensure that each individual's 
needs are met ``at the highest practicable level,'' not just 
at minimum standards. Others asserted that for enforcement 
to be resident centered, residents' individual problems must 
matter, and that using scope and severity scales to 
determine deficiencies would force residents to put up with 
a certain amount of misery before the facility would be 
required to address their problems.

Response: 

We are not adopting the use of scope and 
severity scales to identify deficiencies because, as 
described below, the Act imposes limitations that make it 
impractical. However, we are adopting substantial 
compliance as the standard of performance to which providers 
will be held. This is consistent with the intent of the 
Act, and will accomplish much of what the advocates of scope 
and severity scales claimed that the scales would 
accomplish. Although the thrust of nursing home reform was 
to codify a system of nursing home regulation that is 
outcome oriented, the Congress enacted a number of 
requirements that simply do not lend themselves to an 
outcome analysis. Moreover, the Act does not always lend 
itself to an analysis of whether the resident population as 
a whole was treated properly which, in our view, would be 
essential to a workable scope index. 
For example, section 1919(b)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act 
requires facilities to conduct a resident assessment no 
later than 14 days after admission. Whether a facility 
complies with this obligation, which the Act makes 
applicable to each resident, rests only on whether the 
assessment was in fact done by the date prescribed in the 
Act. Should a facility conduct an assessment on the 15th 
day after a resident's admission, that facility will have 
failed to comply with the requirement, notwithstanding the 
fact that it may have conducted timely assessments on all 
other residents, and notwithstanding the fact that there may 
have been no negative outcome for the resident who received 
the untimely assessment. In the same fashion, section 
1919(b)(7) of the Act requires that facilities having more 
than 120 beds employ a full-time social worker. Should a 
facility having 121 beds not have such an employee, that 
failure is a clear violation of the statutory standard 
regardless of whether there are any documented negative 
outcomes that resulted from this failure. There are 
numerous other examples of this type of requirement in the 
Act. 
Other requirements in the Act, as some commenters 
pointed out, focus on a facility's duty with respect to each 
resident and not its duty to perform in a certain fashion 
for the bulk of all individuals in residence. Other than 
the resident assessment requirement discussed above, section 
1919(c)(1)(A) of the Act requires facilities to protect and 
promote the rights of each resident. Should a facility, 
therefore, not perform in such a manner (as further 
described in the Act and implementing regulations) even for 
one resident, it cannot be said that the facility was not 
deficient in this area notwithstanding the fact that the 
failure was an isolated one. In the same way, section 
1919(b)(6) of the Act requires that the health care of every 
resident be under the supervision of a physician (or, at the 
State's option, other specified health care professionals). 
Here, too, a facility may not be determined to meet this 
requirement if it has successfully provided for such 
supervision for most of its residents as long as even one of 
its residents has not had the benefit of such supervision. 
This is not to say that any violation of these or other 
similar requirements ought to result in the imposition of 
sanctions of consequence. As we suggested in the proposed 
rule, and as we require in this final rule, the degree of 
seriousness of a deficiency looms large in determining the 
appropriateness of a remedy. In some of the hypothetical 
situations cited above, there may be nothing more than a 
plan of correction that is called for. The point is, 
however, that the kind of analysis that allows for the 
consideration of a deficiency's seriousness in determining 
an appropriate remedy will not always work when seriousness 
is considered to determine whether a deficiency exists. 
None of the commenters who sought the use of scales in this 
context acknowledged these issues squarely or made 
suggestions that would allow us to address this matter in a 
way that comports with the structure of the Act. 
The substantial compliance standard that we are adopting 
tolerates a reasonable degree of imperfection. Even though 
deficiencies will be cited for violations that constitute no 
actual harm and a potential for no more than minimal harm, 
these deficiencies, due to their negligible seriousness, 
will not deny a provider a certification of compliance nor 
subject a provider to a remedy. The substantial compliance 
standard should also insulate providers from the uneven 
enforcement that may result from inconsistent surveyor 
behavior, because the marginal deficiencies that surveyors 
are likely to be the most uncertain about citing are liable 
to be the deficiencies that fall into the substantial 
compliance range, and, consequently, neither a facility in 
which a situation constituting no actual harm and a 
potential for no more than minimal harm was cited as a 
deficiency nor a facility in which the same situation was 
not cited as a deficiency will be penalized. 


Comment: 

One commenter was concerned that a formal 
scope and severity scheme to determine deficiencies would 
add issues to hearings. 


Response: 

Providers have the opportunity to appeal 
certifications of noncompliance leading to an enforcement 
remedy, and if we adopted scope and severity scales for 
determining deficiencies, the commenter is correct that 
scope and severity assignments would be an integral part of 
the determination of noncompliance, and would therefore be 
subject to challenge if the deficiency led to the imposition 
of an enforcement remedy. 



Comment: 

Many commenters requested that we incorporate 
the survey guidelines into the body of survey and 
enforcement regulations. Certain commenters believed that a 
failure to do so would violate the Federal Administrative 
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, which requires that general 
notice of proposed rulemaking be published in the 

Federal Register 

when the rulemaking is substantive.

Response: 

We do not believe that the current survey 
materials are subject to the notice and comment procedures 
of the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result of 
OBRA '87, the Medicare and Medicaid law and regulations now 
contain comprehensive, detailed criteria for assessing the 
quality of care provided to Medicare and Medicaid residents, 
as well as the standards and methodology for determining 
deficiencies. The survey forms, procedures and guidelines 
merely enable surveyors to certify whether facilities are, 
in fact, complying with these binding statutory and 
regulatory requirements. These materials do not, in any 
way, add to or change these requirements and thus cannot be 
characterized as ``substantive'' rules; rather, they are a 
mixture of ``interpretive rules,'' ``general statements of 
policy,'' and ``rules of agency procedure'' within the meaning 
of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) which excludes such rules from the 
notice and comment requirements. 


Comment: 

In the course of reviewing comments, it became 
apparent that many commenters associated the use of scope 
and severity scales to determine deficiencies with results 
that do not depend on using scope and severity scales in 
this way. Many commenters were concerned that surveyors 
would not investigate extenuating circumstances surrounding 
violations of requirements unless they were required to use 
scope and severity scales for determining deficiencies. 


Response: 

This is not the case. The surveyor 
guidelines provide surveyors with a consistent structure to 
evaluate situations and analyze information prior to making 
compliance decisions. One such evaluation that surveyors 
are directed to make under certain requirements is the 
assessment of a facility's responsibility for a certain 
situation. For example, survey guidelines list situations 
where pressure sores may be unavoidable and aid surveyors in 
determining whether a resident's pressure sore was 
preventable or not. This type of guidance is provided for 
many of the resident-centered requirements. In addition, 
surveyor training courses stress ways to arrive at 
consistent and accurate conclusions as to facility 
responsibility. 


Comment: 

A number of commenters requested that we 
require surveyors to consider, when identifying 
deficiencies, whether or not the facility identified a 
violation before the survey and attempted to correct it. 


Response: 

We believe that it would be inappropriate to 
ignore a failure to prevent a negative outcome, but the 
regulation does allow the competence that the facility 
demonstrated by identifying and addressing the deficiency on 
its own initiative to be considered when enforcement action 
is selected. 


Comment: 

Certain commenters asked that we direct 
surveyors to determine whether a negative outcome is the 
result of a resident's refusal of treatment, which is a 
resident's right. 


Response: 

Whenever there appears to be a conflict 
between a resident's right and the resident's health or 
safety, we do direct the surveyor in the guidance to 
surveyors to determine if the facility attempted to 
accommodate both the exercise of the resident's right and 
the resident's health, including exploration of care 
alternatives through a thorough planning process in which 
the resident may participate. 


Comment: 

An additional factor that commenters believed 
surveyors should take into consideration when determining 
deficiencies is whether the noncompliance occurred because 
the facility was following a physician's orders. 


Response: 

We cannot allow this to be considered in the 
deficiency determination. The facility is accountable for 
providing to the resident the medical services to which he 
or she is entitled as a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, 
and it is the facility's responsibility to ensure that the 
services provided by physicians will satisfy the facility's 
obligations under the Act and regulations. The statute 
specifically contemplates a relationship between a facility 
and either the Secretary or the State in which the facility, 
in exchange for certification and payments for the care of 
program beneficiaries, commits to provide care in a manner 
consistent with statutory requirements. A facility cannot 
excuse itself from this obligation by deferring 
responsibility to an individual (the physician) with whom 
neither the State nor the Secretary has any statutory 
relationship for the purpose of maintaining compliance with 
facility health and safety standards. 


Comment: 

Many commenters were also very concerned that 
we correlate the stringency of the enforcement action with 
the seriousness of the deficiency. 


Response: 

It is not necessary to use scope and severity 
scales when determining deficiencies to ensure this result. 
We establish criteria for determining remedies in  488.408, 
Selection of remedies, and we link infractions with specific 
categories of remedial action. Under this scheme, a 
facility with a single deficiency that caused no harm is not 
treated the same as a facility with on-going, widespread 
problems that threaten resident lives. 


Comment: 

Certain commenters requested that we give 
facilities with a good history of patient care the 
opportunity to correct occasional isolated problems before 
the end of the survey so as to avoid deficiency citations 
for these problems.

Response:

 Any violation of Federal participation 
requirements must be noted and we cannot direct surveyors to 
ignore violations on account of a facility's past compliance 
record. If violations of participation requirements are 
corrected during the survey, surveyors will note the 
correction along with the citation on the statement of 
deficiencies, and this information will be considered when 
enforcement action is selected. 



Comment:

 Certain commenters believed that all 
deficiency citations made by surveyors should include what 
the negative outcome is. 



Response:

 A violation of any participation requirement 
must be considered a deficiency, even if the violation 
caused no negative outcome to occur. As discussed earlier, 
there are a number of requirements in the Act for which 
questions of outcomes are irrelevant. The deficiency 
citation will in all cases clearly identify how or why the 
requirement is or was not met and the extent of the 
deficient practice, but will only detail the impact or 
potential impact of the facility's non-compliance on the 
resident when it is appropriate. 



Comment:

 A great number of commenters complained that 
facilities do not know what is required of them until they 
are cited for deficiencies at the time of survey. They 
requested that we inform providers of the Medicare or 
Medicaid participation requirements, or both, to which they 
will be held accountable. Certain commenters specifically 
requested that we provide copies of those standards to 
facilities at no cost. 



Response:

 There is no reason why any Medicare or 
Medicaid provider should be unaware of program participation 
requirements. The requirements are public knowledge, and it 
is incumbent upon facilities that enter into Medicare and 
Medicaid agreements to familiarize themselves with the 
requirements with which they have voluntarily agreed to 
comply. Moreover, copies of the State Operations Manual 
Transmittal No. 250, which contains the interpretive 
guidelines, procedures, and forms used by surveyors to 
assess facility compliance, are available to the public for 
purchase from the National Technical Information Service. 
The address is: National Technical Information Service, 
5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161, 
(703) 487-4600. The document publication order number is PB-92-950003. 



Comment:

 One commenter recommended that violations of 
requirements be cited as they are discovered so that the 
facility can act upon them immediately. The commenter 
believed that correction should not be delayed until after 
the exit conference. 



Response:

 Because we direct surveyors to maintain an 
ongoing dialogue with facility staff, there should be few 
instances where the facility is not aware of surveyors' most 
serious concerns prior to the exit conference. We do expect 
surveyors to immediately communicate to the facility staff 
any findings that jeopardize the health or safety of 
residents, but it would be impractical for surveyors to 
advise the facility of each and every violation as it is 
identified. It could also be misleading because the 
deficiencies cited on the HCFA-2567 are not official until 
they are reviewed by supervisory personnel and the State or 
HCFA. This review could invalidate or alter some of the 
deficiencies cited by surveyors while onsite at the 
facility. 



Comment:

 Certain commenters asked that we recognize 
that a facility's failure to comply with participation 
requirements does not always occur at the time of the survey 
visit. These commenters requested that we empower surveyors 
to write citations for deficiencies that occurred before the 
survey, even if they were corrected prior to it. 



Response:

 If surveyors determine that a facility did 
not meet one or more participation requirements during a 
period preceding the survey, they may cite the deficiency, 
which may be sanctionable despite its correction prior to 
the survey. The Congress intended for past deficiencies to 
be identified and addressed. Sections 1819(h)(2)(A) and 
1919(h)(1) of the Act provide that if the Secretary or the 
State finds that a facility meets participation 
requirements, but as of a previous period did not meet such 
requirements, then the Secretary or the State may provide 
for a civil money penalty for the days for which it finds 
that the facility was not in compliance. 



Comment:

 Certain individuals believed that State survey 
agency supervisors should review the survey results and make 
the compliance determinations instead of the surveyors. 
These commenters believed that this measure would enhance 
consistent decisionmaking.

Response: 

Surveyors do not make the ultimate compliance 
decision, which is why only a draft of the statement of 
deficiencies is available to the facility at the time of the 
exit conference, if at all. The statement of deficiencies 
is reviewed by the State survey agency which makes the final 
compliance decision. 



Scope and Severity Scales 



In the preamble to the proposed rule, we requested 
general public comment about how the severity scale levels 
were described as well as assigned. We specifically asked 
for comments on the proposed construction of the severity 
scale whereby deficiencies at a severity of 3 or 4 can 
result in the same sanctions. 

All comments received in response to this section have 
been included and addressed under  488.404 of this 
preamble. 



Nurse Aide Training and Competency Evaluation Programs 





Comment: 

As mentioned elsewhere in this document, a 
number of commenters expressed concern that HCFA or the 
survey agency may decide to conduct an extended survey at 
any time for any reason. One of the reasons for this 
concern is that, under regulations at  483.151(b)(2)(iii), 
which expressly reflect the statutory requirement, when a 
facility undergoes an extended (or a partial extended) 
survey, it automatically loses approval of its Nurse Aide 
Training and Competency Evaluation Program (NATCEP) for 2 
years. 



Response: 

Our response to that particular comment was 
stated earlier in this preamble under our discussion of 
extended surveys. However, there is a closely related 
policy we would like to address here that goes beyond NATCEP 
rescission as a result of an extended survey. There are 
other circumstances described at  483.151(b)(2) that also 
trigger a 2-year prohibition on NATCEP. It has been our 
policy that the remainder (if any) of a 2-year prohibition 
on NATCEPs also applies to a new owner when the provider 
undergoes a change of ownership as defined in  489.18(a), 
Change of ownership or leasing: Effect on provider 
agreement. The implicit basis for this policy has been 
paragraph (d) of  489.18, which states that an ``assigned 
agreement is subject to all applicable statutes and 
regulations and to the terms and conditions under which it 
was originally issued * * *.'' 

This policy was explicitly set forth in the 

Federal 
Register

 (56 FR 48894) on September 26, 1991, as well as in 
State Operations Letter 91-75. The latter reads in part 
that, ``a facility subject to the prohibition on [NATCEP] 
training remains subject for two years after the event 
triggering the prohibition regardless of the change of 
ownership.'' While we have been consistent in this policy, 
we have been reexamining it within the larger context of 
drafting these regulations. We have been reexamining all of 
our policies and regulations concerning remedies to ensure 
that they are consonant with the fundamental purpose of 
remedies, which is to motivate providers to come quickly 
into compliance with program requirements. 

In the proposed rule, we spoke to the purpose of 
sanctions, saying in part that our intent is to ``deter 
violations as well as encourage 

immediate 

(emphasis added) 
response and sustained compliance.'' If the new owner of a 
provider must wait for the expiration of the remainder of a 
2-year prohibition of NATCEP that was imposed on a previous 
owner, regardless of any action he or she may take to 
correct the deficiencies that triggered the prohibition, the 
2-year prohibition on NATCEP would be unlike other remedies. 
As soon as a new owner corrects the noncompliance that led 
to the imposition of any other remedy, the remedy can be 
lifted. The exception to this is that when a facility has 
had a denial of payment imposed against it for repeated 
substandard quality of care or has been placed under 
temporary management, in addition to achieving substantial 
compliance, it must demonstrate to HCFA's or the State's 
satisfaction that it will remain in substantial compliance.

<TEXT>
 

However, it is not just the inconsistency with the other 
remedies which has led us to reexamine our policy on this 
issue. In addition, HCFA does not want to discourage new, 
capable ownership interests from improving the quality of 
care that residents receive. Investing in a NATCEP may 
enhance quality of care; to prohibit a new owner from having 
such a program would be counterproductive with the larger 
purposes of the programs. Therefore, under this regulation, 
we are changing our policy on transfer of the prohibition of 
NATCEP to a new owner to bring it into line with the 
workings of other remedies. The 2-year restriction of 
NATCEP will not apply to the new owner of a provider unless 
that new owner or organization has been the subject of an 
extended (or partial extended) survey, or is otherwise 
subject to the terms of  483.151, under its tenure. If all 
other requirements for the approval of NATCEP are met, 
including substantial compliance with all program 
requirements, the new owner may provide NATCEP. 
We have received numerous inquiries from providers as 
well as their attorneys asking what appeal rights are 
available when approval of a facility's NATCEP has been 
denied or withdrawn. While the Act does not provide for any 
formal appeals for denial or withdrawal of a NATCEP, we 
believe that providers ought to have some opportunity to 
challenge this disapproval. Therefore, we expect providers 
to appeal their NATCEP disapproval within the timeframes 
established for dispute resolution, as described in 
 488.331 of this final rule. 
We have reached this result because, notwithstanding the 
fact that the Act permits us and the State survey agencies 
to conduct extended (or partial extended) surveys for any 
reason, we are nevertheless under this regulation choosing 
to conduct such surveys only when we or a State survey 
agency determines that substandard quality of care exists. 
Just as we believe a provider ought to have access to an 
informal dispute resolution mechanism to challenge what it 
perceives to be inaccurate survey findings, we believe that 
it ought to be able to challenge the correctness of the 
State survey agency's or HCFA's determination that 
substandard quality of care existed. If successful in that 
challenge, then the factual basis for doing the extended 
survey will have been removed, and, in such cases, it would 
be inequitable to saddle the provider with the loss of its 
NATCEP when there was no factual basis for doing so. 
We are limiting the appeals of these matters to the 
informal dispute resolution process because we do not 
believe the loss of a NATCEP is a remedy of the same 
magnitude or type as other statutory remedies for which a 
more formal appeals mechanism is available. Unlike the case 
with other remedies, a facility losing its NATCEP will not, 
on that basis alone, face exclusion from the Medicare or 
Medicaid programs, nor will it face the same kind of 
deprivation that is arguably the case with respect to civil 
money penalties, denial of payment, or the imposition of 
temporary management. We believe the informal dispute 
resolution process satisfies essential elements of due 
process here, since a provider will have notice of the 
intended denial of its NATCEP and the opportunity to meet 
with agency officials to challenge the findings that gave 
rise to the denial. 


Comment: 

One commenter believed that every State should 
implement the same penalty system. 


Response: 

The Act permits the States to elect 
alternative remedies if they can demonstrate that the 
alternative remedies are as effective as the remedies 
specified by the Act. 


V. Additional Conforming Changes. 


In addition to change to our regulations identified 
above, it is necessary that we make minor, technical, 
editorial or cross reference changes to several other 
regulation sections. We are making conforming changes to: 
 Part 401 (  401.130, and 401.133), part 431 
(  431.115, 431.151, 431.152, 431.153, 431.154, 431.221, 
and 431.610); 
 Part 435 ( 435.1009); 
 Part 440 ( 440.40, 440.140, 440.150); we recodified 
 440.150 to separate NFs and ICFs/MR to make it clear which 
provisions apply to each. No substantive changes have been 
made as a result of this new section. 
 Part 441 ( 441.11); 
 Part 442 (  442.1, 442.12, 442.14, 442.15, 442.16, 
442.20, 442.30, 442.40, 442.42, 442.101, 442.105, 442.109, 
442.110, 442.111, 442.117, 442.118, and 442.119); 
 Part 488 (  488.8, 488.11, 488.14, 488.18, 488.20, 
488.24, 488.26, 488.28, and 488.50); 
 Part 489 (  489.3, 489.11, 489.12, 489.15, 489.16, 
489.18, 489.53, 489.60, 489.62, and 489.64); and 
 Part 498 (  498.1, 498.2, 498.3, and 498.5). 
 Part 498 (  498.1, 498.2, 498.3, and 498.5); we 
revised  498.3(b)(7) to exclude SNF and NF terminations. 
SNFs and NFs may appeal the noncompliance that led to a 
termination under  498.3(b)(13).

VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 


A. Introduction 


We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a regulation will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all long term care facilities are considered
small entities. However, individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. 
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any final rule
that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside a metropolitan statistical area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
As described earlier in the preamble, OBRA '87 mandated extensive revisions to the Medicare and Medicaid requirements
for nursing facilities. Under the previous system, long term care facilities were required to meet a set of requirements
called conditions of participation. Each condition of participation included groups of standards, and standards
were made up of separate elements. Enforcement was based on the level of the requirement for which a deficiency was
cited. For example, condition-level deficiencies in a SNF resulted in the initiation of termination procedures
and/or a denial of payment for new admissions. However, if only standard-level deficiencies were found, a plan of
correction was required with no further immediate sanctions. Conditions of participation later became Level A requirements,
and standards and elements became Level B requirements, as the result of a preliminary effort to dismantle the hierarchy
of requirements as mandated by OBRA '87. We revised the requirements that long term care facilities must meet in order
to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs on September 26, 1991 (56 FR 48826). These requirements focus
generally on actual facility performance in meeting residents' needs in a safe and healthy environment, as compared
to prior requirements which focused on the capacity of the facility to provide appropriate care. 
As of October 1993, there were 10,512 facilities certified for both Medicare and Medicaid (dually participating),
939 SNFs certified only for Medicare, and 4,974 NFs certified only for Medicaid. HCFA data indicate that 7.3 percent
(1,141) of all long term care facilities surveyed in 1992 were found to be deficiency-free. Facilities in full compliance
with the participation requirements would not, of course, be subject to the enforcement remedies contained in this
final rule. Six and one-half percent (1,021) of the surveyed facilities were found to have at least one Level A deficiency
and would have been subject to denial of payment for new admissions and/or termination under the former enforcement
rules. However, the number of involuntary terminations of long term care facilities for calendar year 1992 was 53
(29 SNFs/NFs and 24 NFs), less than one-half of one percent of all participating facilities. This figure demonstrates
that most of the facilities identified during a survey to have at least one serious deficiency can and do correct deficiencies
to avoid termination. The majority of the facilities surveyed (86.2 percent) were determined to have no Level A but
at least one Level B deficiency, a finding that usually would allow the facility to continue to participate for a longer
period of time while taking corrective action. 
The intent of the OBRA '87 legislation was to provide the Secretary and States with the authority to impose timely,
alternative remedies on noncompliant facilities that, under the previous enforcement process, had no incentive
to promptly correct deficiencies and maintain lasting compliance. Our proposed rule (57 FR 39278, August 28, 1992)
delineated the process we would use to survey, assess, and enforce facility compliance with all participation requirements.

It is clear that a large number of small entities will be affected by adoption of these procedures, and, as intended
by OBRA '87, a substantial number of those entities are at risk of some remedy if they are noncompliant until they make
changes in their operations to meet certification requirements. Therefore, we have prepared the following analysis
which, in combination with the rest of the preamble, is intended to conform to the objectives of the RFA. We are not preparing
a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have
a significant impact on the operations of substantial number of small rural hospitals.

B. Affected Entities 



We expect that the implementation of these final regulations will significantly influence facilities to conform
quickly with the Federal participation requirements in order to avoid remedies. We recognize that not all of the potential
effects of this final rule can be definitely anticipated, especially in view of their interaction with other Federal,
State, and local activities regarding adherence to requirements for participation in Medicare and Medicaid. In
particular, considering the effects of our efforts to improve survey and certification activities, through both
new survey procedures and instruments and the promulgation of regulations, it is impossible to quantify precisely
the future effect of all of these regulations on facilities' compliance activities or costs. We also are unable to
accurately project the frequency with which enforcement proceedings may occur in light of the options to apply a host
of remedies short of termination. 

As a result of the 27,900 comments received in response to our proposed rule, virtually every aspect of the regulation
was re-evaluated. Where warranted, changes were made and the details of those changes were discussed in detail in
the preceding section of the preamble to this rule. In response to our proposed revisions to part 431, most of the negative
comments concerned the effect on ICFs/MR of withdrawing FFP during appeals. Some commenters noted that OBRA '87 specifically
exempted ICFs/MR from its scope, and stated that it is not appropriate to change the ICF/MR rules in implementing a
law that applies to other facilities. We agree that it would be preferable to include the provisions applicable to
ICFs/MR at a later date in rulemaking focused on ICFs/MR. Therefore, we are adopting the commenters' proposals that
the 120 days of FFP continue for ICFs/MR until such rulemaking is carried out, and are leaving the existing appeals
system in place for ICFs/MR. Thus, neither ICFs/MR nor their residents will experience any impact from this final
rule. 

Also based on commenters' suggestions, we incorporate in this final rule the concept of substantial compliance as
the standard that prospective providers and existing providers must meet in order to begin or continue to participate
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. After evaluation of the comments received, and in consideration of the fact
that, as noted earlier, only 7.3 percent of all nursing homes surveyed in 1992 were deficiency-free, we believe that
total compliance with all requirements is unrealistic and, in fact, a standard that many providers or prospective
providers would find impossible to meet. We note that the statute now sets forth more than 100 requirements that facilities
have to meet in order to participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, whereas before OBRA '87, facilities had
to comply with approximately 15. With the seven-fold increase in statutory requirements, there is a greater likelihood
that facilities will be found not to meet the statutory definition of a SNF or NF. We are convinced, however, based on
experience and commenters' views, that many statutory deficiencies do not result in actual harm to residents, nor
do they constitute the potential for anything more than minimal harm. We realized that under the provisions of our
proposed rule, a facility could have been subject to the most severe remedies, including denial of payment for new
admissions, termination of the provider agreement for SNFs and discontinuation of FFP for NFs, if any deficiency,
no matter how minor, was identified at the time of the survey. We recognized that imposing a remedy in all cases would
be contrary to our intention to correlate the severity of the remedy to the seriousness of the deficiency, and would
have a negative effect on facilities and residents. Instead, this final rule provides that remedies will not be imposed
when a facility is in substantial compliance with all participation requirements. 

We are removing the scope and severity scales from the regulation and are, instead, providing assessment factors
which consider scope and severity to be used in evaluating the seriousness of deficiencies and determining whether
an enforcement response is required. We continue to believe, as we proposed, that because remedies are tailored to
reflect the seriousness of the violations, the use of the assessment factors will provide consistent remedy recommendations
and enforcement actions among all facilities. Since facilities will be aware of the correlation between the seriousness
of the noncompliance and the penalty imposed, we anticipate that remedies applied in this manner will deter violations
and encourage immediate response and sustained compliance. Based on the large number of comments we received expressing
concern over the imposition of civil money penalties, which can be imposed for past periods of noncompliance, we expect
that the regulations will have the desired effect of motivating facilities to remain in substantial compliance at
all times.

Under these final rules, a facility with isolated deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for
minimal harm will be expected to correct the deficiencies and maintain compliance. However, a formal plan of correction
is required for deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for minimal harm if the deficiencies are
widespread or if they constitute a pattern. A formal plan of correction is also required for all deficiencies that
constitute noncompliance. Facilities with deficiencies that constitute no actual harm with potential for no more
than minimal harm will be considered in substantial compliance with the participation requirements and will have
no remedy applied. We believe that the majority of the 86 percent of the facilities cited in 1992 with at least one Level
B deficiency would fall within this range. We note, however, that some noncompliance categorized previously as Level
B deficiencies could now result in remedies because of their effect on the residents.

<TEXT>
 

In response to commenters, we are requiring that States provide an opportunity for informal dispute resolution whereby
providers dissatisfied with survey findings can request a review of the deficiencies upon receipt of the official
HCFA-2567. Dispute resolution augments the various other opportunities facilities have during and after
the survey to challenge the surveyors' findings, including during the survey, at the exit conference, while awaiting
receipt of the official deficiency statement, through dialogue with State and regional officials, and upon receipt
of the official statement of deficiencies. The process we are requiring generally reflects current practice and
guidance we have consistently given States, except that here it is formally adopted as a rule. While we believe that
many formal hearings will be avoided by utilizing dispute resolution, the regulations provide facilities with the
opportunity to appeal certifications of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy, and specify the formal
administrative and judicial review processes. However, because the Act mandates that enforcement systems minimize
the time between identification of violations and the imposition of remedies, we are not requiring that hearings
be held before the effective date of the enforcement action, except in the case of civil money penalties. Facilities
facing civil money penalties may also appeal the level of noncompliance but only where a successful challenge would
affect the amount of the civil money penalty that HCFA or the State could collect. 

Because of the variety of alternative remedies now available, we believe termination will be the enforcement response
to the most serious noncompliance, and it can be avoided by facilities that are willing and able to effectively allocate
their resources to ensure substantial compliance. To the extent that those marginal facilities that are most at risk
from these provisions are able to come into substantial compliance, there may even be a reduction in the frequency
of enforcement actions. Of course, facilities will ordinarily incur some costs associated with compliance efforts.
Those costs could be significant if they necessitate substantial staffing increases or alterations to a physical
plant. Our elimination of FFP after termination of the provider agreement during the administrative hearing process
provides an incentive for facilities to comply promptly with enforcement actions, but could also add to the impact
on facilities. 



C. Effect on State Survey Process 



The impact that this final rule will have on State survey agencies' surveys must be viewed in the context of other ongoing
activities related to survey and certification. 

On October 1, 1986, HCFA implemented its new long term care outcome-oriented survey process (formerly called PACs:
Patient Care and Services Survey Process). This system shifted the emphasis away from the facility's capacity to
provide adequate care to the facility's success in providing such care. On October 1, 1990, HCFA implemented a revised
outcome-oriented survey process that includes the OBRA provision of resident rights review. Because the effective
date of this rule is July 1, 1995, training courses can be designed and offered timely to provide the State agency surveyors
and other staff with information on assessing the seriousness of deficiencies. The knowledge they gain in applying
Federal survey requirements in an accurate, consistent, and time efficient manner, should lead to improved surveys
at no increase in costs. We do not expect that assessing the seriousness of the deficiencies will add to the time needed
to conduct a survey since this process is one that surveyors have essentially engaged in for years. We do not expect
these regulations to necessitate greater expenditures on the part of State survey agencies; however, they probably
will result in a reallocation of resources, particularly geared to more intensive monitoring of marginal facilities.
Further, these regulatory changes will contribute to a shift toward more enforcement-oriented roles for State survey
agencies and surveyors. Although States will have an expanded role and increased responsibility as a result of this
final rule, they will also be given increased flexibility in carrying out their responsibilities. 

We expect some incremental costs to facilities and to States as a result of facility appeals of termination and alternative
remedies. Although we have no experience on which to predict increases in volume or cost, we believe that the increase
will be offset somewhat as some hearings will be avoided as a result of dispute resolution. The appeals process has
been thoroughly explained elsewhere in this preamble. The responses to comments illustrate the thoughtful approach
taken, with a view to minimizing burden in implementing statutory requirements. 



D. Effect on Residents 



We expect this final rule to result in improved quality of life and care for residents of long term care facilities.
Because of the various enforcement tools provided by this regulation, facilities will have more of an incentive to
remain in compliance with participation requirements. This sustained compliance will provide residents with consistent,
high quality health care. Because quality of life can be affected by a resident's sense of satisfaction with his or
her environment, the quality of care received, and the extent of control over his or her life, heightened facility
interest in maintaining substantial compliance should be perceived by residents and their families as improved
care. 

While termination of SNFs and NFs could have a significant impact on residents, especially those living in rural areas,
this final rule provides a variety of alternatives to termination for those facilities that are able to come into compliance.
To the extent that termination occurs less frequently, there would be less disruption to nursing home residents and
ensured access to needed services. In those cases in which termination becomes necessary, the termination is for
the ultimate benefit of the residents to assure that they receive the quality care to which they are entitled. 



VII. Information Collection Requirements 



Sections 4204(b) and 4214(d) of OBRA '87 provide a waiver of Office of Management and Budget review of information
collection requirements for the purpose of implementing the nursing home reform amendments.

(1) The appeal procedures specified for Medicare facilities in part 498 of this chapter apply; and 
(2) A final decision entered under the Medicare review procedures is binding for the purposes of Medicaid participation
and Medicare participation in a dually participating facility or a facility seeking to participate in Medicare and

in HCFA's imposition of alternative remedies, or if HCFA denies, or terminates the provider agreement(s) of such
a facility, and the findings and proposed remedies of HCFA prevail in accordance with  488.452 of this chapter,

of participation or conditions for coverage where the deficiencies are of such character as to substantially limit
the provider's or supplier's capacity to furnish adequate care or which adversely affect the health and safety of
patients; or 
(c) If HCFA determines that an institution or agency does not qualify for participation or coverage because it is not
in compliance with the conditions of participation or conditions for coverage, or if a provider's agreement is terminated
for that reason, the institution or agency has the right to request that the determination be reviewed. (Appeals procedures
are set forth in Part 498 of this chapter.) 
9. Section 488.26 is revised to read as follows:

(a) Additional rules for certification of compliance for SNFs and NFs are set forth in  488.330. 
(b) The decision as to whether there is compliance with a particular requirement, condition of participation, or
condition for coverage depends upon the manner and degree to which the provider or supplier satisfies the various
standards within each condition. Evaluation of a provider's or supplier's performance against these standards
enables the State survey agency to document the nature and extent of deficiencies, if any, with respect to a particular
function, and to assess the need for improvement in relation to the prescribed conditions. 
(c) The State survey agency must adhere to the following principles in determining compliance with participation
requirements: 
(1) The survey process is the means to assess compliance with Federal health, safety and quality standards; 
(2) The survey process uses resident outcomes as the primary means to establish the compliance status of facilities.
Specifically surveyors will directly observe the actual provision of care and services to residents, and the effects
of that care, to assess whether the care provided meets the needs of individual residents; 
(3) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine
compliance; 
(4) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and 
consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;

findings. 
(d) The State survey agency must use the survey methods, procedures, and forms that are prescribed by HCFA. 
(e) The State survey agency must ensure that a facility's actual provision of care and services to residents and the
effects of that care on residents are assessed in a systematic manner. 
10. Section 488.28 is revised to read as follows: 


 488.28 

Providers or suppliers, other than SNFs and NFs, with deficiencies. 


(a) If a provider or supplier is found to be deficient with respect to one or more of the standards in the conditions of
participation or conditions for coverage, it may participate in or be covered under the Health Insurance for the Aged
and Disabled Program only if the facility has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for achieving compliance
within a reasonable period of time acceptable to the Secretary. 
(b) The existing deficiencies noted either individually or in combination neither jeopardize the health and safety
of patients nor are of such character as to seriously limit the provider's capacity to render adequate care. 
(c)(1) If it is determined during a survey that a provider or supplier is not in compliance with one or more of the standards,
it is granted a reasonable time to achieve compliance. 
(2) The amount of time depends upon the_
(i) Nature of the deficiency; and 
(ii) State survey agency's judgment as to the capabilities of the facility to provide adequate and safe care. 
(d) Ordinarily a provider or supplier is expected to take the steps needed to achieve compliance within 60 days of being
notified of the deficiencies but the State survey agency may recommend that additional time be granted by the Secretary
in individual situations, if in its judgment, it is not reasonable to expect compliance within 60 days, for example,
a facility must obtain the approval of its governing body, or engage in competitive bidding.

 488.330

Certification of compliance or noncompliance. 



(a) 

General rules_

(1) 

Responsibility for certification. 

(i) The State survey agency surveys all facilities for compliance or noncompliance with requirements for long term
care facilities. The survey by the State survey agency may be followed by a Federal validation survey. 

(A) The State certifies the compliance or noncompliance of non-State operated NFs. Regardless of the State entity
doing the certification, it is final, except in the case of a complaint or validation survey conducted by HCFA, or HCFA
review of the State's findings. 

(B) HCFA certifies the compliance or noncompliance of all State-operated facilities. 

(C) The State survey agency certifies the compliance or noncompliance of a non-State operated SNF, subject to the
approval of HCFA. 

(D) The State survey agency certifies compliance or noncompliance for a dually participating SNF/NF. In the case
of a disagreement between HCFA and the State survey agency, a finding of noncompliance takes precedence over that
of compliance. 

(ii) In the case of a validation survey, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance is binding,
and takes precedence over a certification of compliance resulting from the State survey. 

(2) 

Basis for certification. 

(i) Certification by the State is based on the survey agency findings. 

(ii) Certification by HCFA is based on either the survey agency findings (in the case of State-operated facilities),
or, in the case of a validation survey, on HCFA's own survey findings. 

(b) 

Effect of certification_

(1) 

Certification of compliance. 

A certification of compliance constitutes a determination that the facility is in substantial compliance and is
eligible to participate in Medicaid as a NF, or in Medicare as a SNF, or in Medicare and Medicaid as a dually participating
facility. 

(2) 

Certification of noncompliance. 

A certification of noncompliance requires denial of participation for prospective providers and enforcement action
for current providers in accordance with subpart F of this part. Enforcement action must include one of the following:


(i) Termination of any Medicare or Medicaid provider agreements that are in effect. 

(ii) Application of alternative remedies instead of, or in addition to, termination procedures.

(ii) Except for civil money penalties, during the pendency of any hearing that may be requested by the provider of services.


(2) HCFA imposes remedies promptly on any provider of services participating in the Medicare or Medicaid program
or any provider of services participating in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs_

(i) After promptly notifying the facility of the deficiencies and impending remedy or remedies; and 

(ii) Except for civil money penalties, during any pending hearing that may be requested by the provider of services.


(3) The provisions of part 498 of this chapter apply when the following providers request a hearing on a denial of participation,
or certification of noncompliance leading to an enforcement remedy (including termination of the provider agreement),
except State monitoring: 

(i) All State-operated facilities; 

(ii) SNFs and dually participating SNF/NFs; and 

(iii) Any other facilities subject to a HCFA validation survey or HCFA review of the State's findings. 

(4) The provisions of part 431 of this chapter apply when a non-State operated Medicaid NF, which has not received a
HCFA validation survey or HCFA review of the State's findings, requests a hearing on the State's denial of participation,
termination of provider agreement, or certification of noncompliance leading to an alternative remedy, except
State monitoring. 

(f) 

Provider agreements. 

HCFA or the Medicaid agency may execute a provider agreement when a prospective provider is in substantial compliance
with all the requirements for participation for a SNF or NF, respectively. 

(g) 

Special rules for Federal validation surveys. 

(1) HCFA may make independent certifications of a NF's, SNF's, or dually participating facility's noncompliance
based on a HCFA validation survey. 

(2) HCFA issues the notice of actions affecting facilities for which HCFA did validation surveys. 

(3) For non-State-operated NFs and non-State-operated dually participating facilities, any disagreement between
HCFA and the State regarding the timing and choice of remedies is resolved in accordance with  488.452. 

(4) Either HCFA or the survey agency, at HCFA's option, may revisit the facility to ensure that corrections are made.

immediate jeopardy. The rules for appointment of a temporary manager in an immediate jeopardy situation are as follows:

(1) HCFA does and the State must notify the facility that a temporary manager is being appointed. 
(2) If the facility fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, HCFA does and the State must terminate the
provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last day of the survey, if the immediate jeopardy is not removed.
In these cases, State monitoring may be imposed pending termination. 
(3) If the facility relinquishes control to the temporary manager, the State must (and HCFA does) notify the facility
that, unless it removes the immediate jeopardy, its provider agreement will be terminated within 23 calendar days
of the last day of the survey. 
(4) HCFA does and the State must terminate the provider agreement within 23 calendar days of the last day of survey if
the immediate jeopardy has not been removed. 
(b) HCFA or the State may also impose other remedies, as appropriate. 
(c)(1) In a NF or dually participating facility, if either HCFA or the State finds that a facility's noncompliance
poses immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety, HCFA or the State must notify the other of such a finding.

(i) Take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the noncompliance through temporary management; or


(ii) Terminate the facility's participation under the State plan. If this is done, HCFA will also terminate the facility's
participation in Medicare if it is a dually participating facility. 

(d) The State must provide for the safe and orderly transfer of residents when the facility is terminated. 

(e) If the immediate jeopardy is also substandard quality of care, the State survey agency must notify attending physicians
and the State board responsible for licensing the facility administrator of the finding of substandard quality of
care, as specified in  488.325(h). 



 488.412 

Action when there is no immediate jeopardy. 



(a) If a facility's deficiencies do not pose immediate jeopardy to residents' health or safety, and the facility is
not in substantial compliance, HCFA or the State may terminate the facility's provider agreement or may allow the
facility to continue to participate for no longer than 6 months from the last day of the survey if_

(1) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the
facility's provider agreement; 

(2) The State survey agency has submitted a plan of correction approved by HCFA; and 

(3) The facility in the case of a Medicare SNF or the State in the case of a Medicaid NF agrees to repay to the Federal government
payments received after the last day of the survey that first identified the deficiencies if corrective action is
not taken in accordance with the approved plan of correction.

and the State must terminate the facility's provider agreement. 

(c) HCFA does and the State must deny payment for new admissions when a facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months
after the last day of the survey. 

(d) HCFA terminates the provider agreement for SNFs and NFs, and stops FFP to a State for a NF for which participation
was continued under paragraph (a) of this section, if the facility is not in substantial compliance within 6 months
of the last day of the survey.

Standard surveys completed by the State survey agency on or after October 1, 1990, are used to determine whether the
threshold of three consecutive standard surveys is met.

Program participation. 

(1) The determination that a certified facility has repeated instances of substandard quality of care is made without
regard to any variances in the facility's program participation (that is, any standard survey completed for Medicare,
Medicaid or both programs will be considered). 

(2) Termination would allow the count of repeated substandard quality of care surveys to start over. 

(3) Change of ownership. (i) A facility may not avoid a remedy on the basis that it underwent a change of ownership. 

(ii) In a facility that has undergone a change of ownership, HCFA does not and the State may not restart the count of repeated
substandard quality of care surveys unless the new owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State that
the poor past performance no longer is a factor due to the change in ownership. 

(e) 

Facility alleges corrections or achieves compliance after repeated substandard quality of care is identified.


(1) If a penalty is imposed for repeated substandard quality of care, it will continue until the facility has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of HCFA or the State that it is in substantial compliance with the requirements and that it will
remain in substantial compliance with the requirements for a period of time specified by HCFA or the State.

must be returned to the Medicare Trust Fund or the State, respectively. 
(e) 

Collection from dually participating facilities. 

Civil money penalties collected from dually participating facilities are returned to the Medicare Trust Fund and
the State in proportion commensurate with the relative proportions of Medicare and Medicaid beds at the facility
actually in use by residents covered by the respective programs on the date the civil money penalty begins to accrue.

(f) 

Penalties collected by the State. 

Civil money penalties collected by the State must be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents
of facilities that the State or HCFA finds deficient, such as_ 
(1) Payment for the cost of relocating residents to other facilities; 
(2) State costs related to the operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure; and 
(3) Reimbursement of residents for personal funds or property lost at a facility as a result of actions by the facility
or by individuals used by the facility to provide services to residents. 


 488.444 


Civil money penalties: Settlement of penalties. 


(a) HCFA has authority to settle cases at any time prior to a final administrative decision for Medicare-only SNFs,
State-operated facilities, or other facilities for which HCFA's enforcement action prevails, in accordance with
 488.330. 
(b) The State has the authority to settle cases at any time prior to the evidentiary hearing decision for all cases in
which the State's enforcement action prevails. 


 488.450 

Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies. 


(a) 

Criteria.

 (1) HCFA may continue payments to a facility not in substantial compliance for the periods specified in paragraph
(c) of this section if the following criteria are met: 
(i) The State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to impose alternative remedies than to terminate the
facility; 
(ii) The State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action approved by HCFA; and 
(iii) The facility, in the case of a Medicare SNF, or the State, in the case of a Medicaid NF, agrees to repay the Federal
government payments received under this provision if corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved
plan and timetable for corrective action. 
(2) HCFA or the State may terminate the SNF or NF agreement before the end of the correction period if the criteria in
paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not met. 
(b) 

Cessation of payments. 

If termination is not sought, either by itself or along with another remedy or remedies, or any of the criteria set forth
in paragraph (a)(1) if this section are not met or agreed to by either the facility or the State, the facility or State
will receive no Medicare or Federal Medicaid payments, as applicable, from the last day of the survey. 
(c) 

Period of continued payments. 

If the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are met, HCFA may continue payments to a Medicare facility or
to the State for a Medicaid facility with noncompliance that does not constitute immediate jeopardy for up to 6 months
from the last day of the survey.

(d) 

Failure to achieve substantial compliance. 

If the facility does not achieve substantial compliance by the end of the period specified in paragraph (c) of this
section, 
(1) HCFA will_

(i) Terminate the provider agreement of the Medicare SNF in accordance with  488.456; or

(iii) Discontinue FFP to the State for the Medicaid NF. 
(2) The State may terminate the provider agreement for the NF. 


 488.452 

State and Federal disagreements involving findings not in agreement in non-State operated NFs and dually participating
facilities when there is no immediate jeopardy. 


The following rules apply when HCFA and the State disagree over findings of noncompliance or application of remedies
in a non-State operated NF or dually participating facility: 
(a) 

Disagreement over whether facility has met requirements.

 (1) The State's finding of noncompliance takes precedence when_ 
(i) HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility is in substantial compliance with the participation requirements;
and 
(ii) The State finds that a NF or dually participating facility has not achieved substantial compliance. 
(2) HCFA's findings of noncompliance take precedence when_

(i) HCFA finds that a NF or a dually participating facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and 
(ii) The State finds that a NF or a dually participating facility is in substantial compliance with the participation
requirements. 
(3) When HCFA's survey findings take precedence, HCFA may_

(i) Impose any of the alternative remedies specified in  488.406; 
(ii) Terminate the provider agreement subject to the applicable conditions of  488.450; and 
(iii) Stop FFP to the State for a NF. 
(b) 

Disagreement over decision to terminate.

 (1) HCFA's decision to terminate the participation of a facility takes precedence when_

(i) Both HCFA and the State find that the facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and 
(ii) HCFA, but not the State, finds that the facility's participation should be terminated. HCFA will permit continuation
of payment during the period prior to the effective date of termination not to exceed 6 months, if the applicable conditions
of  488.450 are met. 
(2) The State's decision to terminate a facility's participation and the procedures for appealing such termination,
as specified in  431.153(c) of this chapter, takes precedence when_

(i) The State, but not HCFA, finds that a NF's participation should be terminated; and 
(ii) The State's effective date for the termination of the NF's provider agreement is no later than 6 months after the
last day of survey. 
(c) 

Disagreement over timing of termination of facility. 

The State's timing of termination takes precedence if it does not occur later than 6 months after the last day of the
survey when both HCFA and the State find that_

(1) A facility is not in substantial compliance; and 
(2) The facility's participation should be terminated. 
(d) 

Disagreement over remedies.

 (1) When HCFA or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination,
the additional or alternative remedies will also apply when_

(i) Both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not achieved substantial compliance; and 
(ii) Both HCFA and the State find that no immediate jeopardy exists. 
(2) 

Overlap of remedies. 

When HCFA and the State establish one or more remedies, in addition to or as an alternative to termination, only the
HCFA remedies apply when both HCFA and the State find that a facility has not achieved substantial compliance. 
(e) Regardless of whether HCFA's or the State's decision controls, only one noncompliance and enforcement decision
is applied to the Medicaid agreement, and for a dually participating facility, that same decision will apply to the
Medicare agreement. 


 488.454 

Duration of remedies. 


(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, alternative remedies continue until_

(1) The facility has achieved substantial compliance, as determined by HCFA or the State based upon a revisit or after
an examination of credible written evidence that it can verify without an on-site visit; or

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00267 </DOCNO>

(2) HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement. 
(b) In the cases of State monitoring and denial of payment imposed for repeated substandard quality of care, remedies
continue until_

(1) HCFA or the State determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance and is capable of remaining
in substantial compliance; or 
(2) HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement. 

(c) In the case of temporary management, the remedy continues until_

(1) HCFA or the State determines that the facility has achieved substantial compliance and is capable of remaining
in substantial compliance; 
(2) HCFA or the State terminates the provider agreement; or 
(3) The facility which has not achieved substantial compliance reassumes management control. In this case, HCFA
or the State initiates termination of the provider agreement and may impose additional remedies. 
(d) If the facility can supply documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey agency that it was in substantial
compliance, and was capable of remaining in substantial compliance, if necessary, on a date preceding that of the
revisit, the remedies terminate on the date that HCFA or the State can verify as the date that substantial compliance
was achieved. 



 488.456

Termination of provider agreement. 



(a) 

Effect of termination. 

Termination of the provider agreement ends_

(1) Payment to the facility; and 
(2) Any alternative remedy. 

(b) 

Basis for termination.

(i) Is not in substantial compliance with the requirements of participation, regardless of whether or not immediate
jeopardy is present; or 
(ii) Fails to submit an acceptable plan of correction within the timeframe specified by HCFA or the State. 
(2) HCFA and the State terminate a facility's provider agreement if a facility_
(i) Fails to relinquish control to the temporary manager, if that remedy is imposed by HCFA or the State; or 
(ii) Does not meet the eligibility criteria for continuation of payment as set forth in  488.412(a)(1). 
(c) 

Notice of termination. 

Before terminating a provider agreement, HCFA does and the State must notify the facility and the public_
(1) At least 2 calendar days before the effective date of termination for a facility with immediate jeopardy deficiencies;
and 
(2) At least 15 calendar days before the effective date of termination for a facility with non-immediate jeopardy
deficiencies that constitute noncompliance. 
(d) 

Procedures for termination. 

(1) HCFA terminates the provider agreement in accordance with procedures set forth in  489.53 of this chapter;
and 
(2) The State must terminate the provider agreement of a NF in accordance with procedures specified in parts 431 and

ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for the plant 

Poa mannii

 (Mann's bluegrass). Four extant populations containing a total of approximately 125 individuals of the species
are known to occur in the northwestern and north-central region of the island of Kauai. The species and its habitat
are threatened by goats, competition by naturalized, introduced vegetation, fire, landslides, and erosion. The
existence of few populations and individuals increases the likelihood of extinction from stochastic events and/or
reduced reproductive vigor. 



This final rule implements the Federal protection provisions provided by the Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 





Poa mannii

 was first collected by Horace Mann, Jr., and William Tufts Brigham in 1864 or 1865 in Waimea Canyon on the island of Kauai.
The name 

Poa mannii

 was published without a description (attributed to William Munro) in Seemann's 

Journal of Botany

 in 1869. The specific epithet was selected to honor one of the original collectors. Subsequently, the species was
validly published by Hillebrand (1888) in his flora.

Poa mannii 

of the grass family (Poaceae) is a perennial with short rhizomes (underground stems) and erect, tufted culms (bunched
stems) 50 to 75 centimeters (cm) (20 to 30 inches (in)) tall. The leaf sheath completely surrounds the leaf, and the
ligule (appendage at the junction of the leaf blade and sheath) completely encircles the stem, is about 0.5 millimeters
(mm) (0.02 in) long, and has a tooth about 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) long and a fringed margin. The leaf blade is up to 15 cm
(6 in) long and 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.2 in) wide, and has a rough upper surface and a hairless lower surface. The panicles
(branched flower clusters) are usually less than 5 cm (2 in) long and have primary branches 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 in) long.
The 4 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long, flattened spikelets (ultimate flower clusters) are pale greenish or yellowish brown
and usually are comprised of 4 or 5 flowers. The glumes (small pair of bracts at the base of each spikelet) are about 3
mm (0.1 in) long. The lemma (outer bract at the base of a floret) is 3 to 4 mm (0.1 to 0.2 in) long and has cobwebby hairs at
its base. The palea (inner bract at the base of a floret) is 3 to 3.5 mm (about 0.1 in) long and has a sharp, longitudinal
ridge. The reddish brown grain-like fruit is elliptical to spindle-shaped and about 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. All three
native species of 

Poa 

in the Hawaiian Islands are endemic to the island of Kauai. 

Poa mannii 

is distinguished from both 

Poa siphonoglossa 

and 

Poa sandvicensis 

by its fringed ligule and from 

Poa sandvicensis 

by its shorter panicle branches (O'Connor 1990). 



Poa mannii 

is found only on the northwestern and west-central portions of the island of Kauai. The four known populations extend
over a distance of about 10.5 by 8.5 kilometers (km) (6.5 by 5.3 miles (mi)) and are found in Kalalau, Makaha, Koaie,
and Waialae Valleys, all on State lands (David Lorence, National Tropical Botanical Garden, pers. comm., 1992).
The species was formerly found in Olokele Gulch (O'Connor 1990). Approximately 125 individuals have been observed
in the extant populations. This species typically grows on cliffs and rock faces at elevations between 460 and 1,150
meters (m) (1,510 and 3,770 feet (ft)) in lowland and montane mesic forests. Associated species include: 

Chamaesyce 

sp. ('akoko), 

Exocarpos luteolus 

(heau), 

Labordia helleri 

(kamakahala), and 

Nototrichium 

sp. in Kalalau Valley; 

Cyrtandra wawrae 

(ha'iwale) in Makaha Valley; 

Acacia koa 

(koa), 

Alectryon macrococcus 

(mahoe), and 

Antidesma platyphyllum 

(hame) in Koaie Valley; and 

Bidens cosmoides 

(po'ola nui), 

Carex meyenii, Dodonaea viscosa 

('a'ali'i), and 

Schiedea amplexicaulis 

in Waialae Valley. Threats to 

Poa mannii 

include habitat damage, trampling, and browsing by feral goats (

Capra hircus

); competition with invasive alien plants, especially 

Erigeron karvinskianus 

(daisy fleabane), 

Lantana camara 

(lantana), and 

Rubus argutus 

(prickly Florida blackberry); landslides in the steep habitat; fire; and reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction
from stochastic events due to the small number of existing populations and individuals (D. Lorence and Ken Wood, Hawaii
Plant Conservation Center, pers. comms., 1992).

Previous Federal Action 


Federal action on 

Poa mannii 

began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a
report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated
as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service published
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over two years old be withdrawn.
A one-year grace period was given to proposals already over two years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including 

Poa mannii, 

along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December
15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). 

Poa mannii 

was first included in the 1980 and 1985 notices of review as a category 1 species. Category 1 taxa are those for which
the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation
of listing proposals. In the 1990 notice of review, 

Poa mannii 

was considered a category 1* species. Category 1* taxa are those which are possibly extinct. Since the 1990 notice
of review, three previously unknown populations of the species have been discovered, and a population has been found
in an area in which the plant was formerly known. 


Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information
indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982
amendments further required all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of 

Poa mannii 

was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the
Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service
to consider the petition as having been resubmitted pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was
reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted
the final 1-year finding for this species. 


On April 7, 1993, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 18073) a proposal to list the plant 

Poa mannii 

as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information supplied by Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural
Resources unpublished reports and observations by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines 

Poa mannii 

to be endangered with the publication of this rule. 




Summary of Comments and Recommendations 




In the April 7, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment period
ended June 7, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting public comment
was published in ``The Honolulu Advertiser'' on May 12, 1993, and ``The Garden Isle'' on May 16, 1993. No letters of
comment were received.

Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered
species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to


Poa mannii

 Munro ex Hillebr. (Mann's bluegrass) are as follows:



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range



The area of Kauai in which 

Poa mannii

 is found has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present land management practices, including grazing,
deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, water diversion, and recreational development (Wagner 

et al.

 1985). Feral animals have had the greatest overall impact, altering and degrading the vegetation and habitats of
the area; feral goats currently cause the greatest damage to the area. 

Feral goats, which have inhabited the drier, more rugged areas of Kauai since the 1820s, consume native vegetation,
trample roots and seedlings, cause erosion, and promote the invasion of alien plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Feral
goats on Kauai are managed as a game species with a limited hunting season (Tomich 1986), but their numbers are large
enough to cause considerable habitat damage. 

Poa mannii

 survives only in very steep areas that are inaccessible to goats, suggesting that goat predation may have eliminated
this species from more accessible locations, as is the case for other rare plants from northwestern Kauai (Corn 

et al.

 1979). Populations of 

Poa mannii

 are affected by erosion and landslides, resulting, in part, from goat activities in surrounding areas (K. Wood, pers.
comm., 1992). 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes and excessive visits by individuals interested
in seeing rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to 

Poa mannii

 that could also promote erosion and greater ingress by competing alien species. 




C. Disease or Predation





Poa mannii 

is not known to be unpalatable to goats, which inhabit the areas where all four known populations of 

Poa mannii

 grow. Predation is a probable reason that this species is currently found only on cliff faces inaccessible to goats
(D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Predation by goats constitutes a threat to the expansion of the extant
populations of 

Poa mannii. 



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



All four populations of Poa mannii

 are located on State conservation district land, which, among other purposes, are regarded as necessary for the protection
of endemic biological resources and the maintenance or enhancement of the conservation of natural resources. Activities
permitted in the conservation district are chosen by considering how best to make multiple use of the land (HRS, sect.
205-2). Some uses, such as maintaining animals for hunting, are based on policy decisions, while others, such
as preservation of endangered species, are mandated by both Federal and State laws. Requests for amendments to district
boundaries or variances within existing classifications can be made by government agencies and private landowners
(HRS, sect. 205-4). Before decisions on these requests are made, the impact of the proposed reclassification
on ``preservation or maintenance of important natural systems or habitat'' (HRS, sects. 205-4, 205-17),
as well as the maintenance of natural resources, is required to be taken into account (HRS, sects. 205-2, 205-4).
For any proposed land use change that would occur on county or State land, that would be funded in part or whole by county
or State funds, or that would occur within land classified as conservation district, an environmental assessment
is required to determine whether or not the environment will be significantly affected (HRS, chapt. 343). If it is
found that an action will have a significant effect, preparation of a full Environmental Impact Statement is required.
Hawaii environmental policy and, thus, approval of land use, is required by law to safeguard ``* * *
the State's unique natural environmental characteristics * * *'' (HRS, sect. 344-3(1)) and
includes guidelines to ``protect endangered species of individual plants and animals * * *'' (HRS,
sect. 344-4(3)(A)). However, the species is not presently protected as an endangered species under the State's
endangered species provisions, and, despite provisions for conserving endemic resources, individual rare species
may be overlooked during consideration of other land use priorities.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence



The existence of only four populations consisting of approximately 125 individuals of 

Poa mannii

 increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor,
or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance, a disease, or predation could destroy an entire population
and a significant percentage of the known individuals of the species. In the steep areas where 

Poa mannii

 grows, erosion and landslides due to natural weathering can result in the death of individual plants as well as habitat
destruction. This process especially affects the continued existence of species or populations with limited numbers
and/or narrow ranges, such as 

Poa mannii

, and can be exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices.

Competition by alien plant species is a threat to 

Poa mannii

. Brought to Hawaii as a cultivated herbaceous plant, daisy fleabane has become naturalized in wetter regions of four
islands (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Daisy fleabane has invaded Kalalau, Koaie, and Waialae Valleys, three of the four areas where 

Poa mannii

 occurs (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). Lantana, brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant, is an aggressive, thicket-forming
shrub that can now be found on all of the main islands in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other dry, disturbed habitats
(Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Lantana threatens all known populations of 

Poa mannii

 (D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Prickly Florida blackberry, an aggressive alien species in disturbed
mesic to wet forests and subalpine grasslands on four islands, is considered a noxious weed by the State of Hawaii (Smith
1985, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Prickly Florida blackberry threatens the Kalalau and Waialae Valley populations of 

Poa mannii

 (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992).

Fire is considered an immediate threat to the rare plants of the cliff faces and valleys of the Na Pali Coast, where the
largest known population of 

Poa mannii

 occurs. Under dry conditions, human-set fires would spread rapidly and could destroy these plants, due to the strong
prevailing winds and dry fuel load on cliff ledges. Fire could destroy dormant seeds as well as plants, even on steep
cliffs (Clarke and Cuddihy 1980).

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in finalizing this rule. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking
will list 

Poa mannii

 as endangered. This species numbers only approximately 125 individuals in four known extant populations. Threats
to the continued existence of the species include habitat degradation and/or predation by goats, competition from
alien plants, fire, landslides and erosion, and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws that become
effective with this listing action. Small population size and limited distribution make the species particularly
vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because 

Poa mannii

 is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, it fits the definition of endangered
as defined in the Act.

Critical habitat is not being proposed for 

Poa mannii

 for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this final rule.



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for 

Poa mannii

. The publication of a map and precise description of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

, as required in a designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take or
vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline. The listing of this species as endangered publicizes
the rarity of the plant and, thus, can make it attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare
plants. All involved parties and the major landowner have been notified of the location and importance of protecting
the habitat of this species, which will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation
process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known natural habitat of this species. Therefore,
the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of this species.

Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Listing encourages conservation
actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible
land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that recovery plans be developed for listed species.
The requirement for Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are
discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any taxon
that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. 

Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.
If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter
into consultation with the Service. There are no known Federal activities that occur within the presently known habitat
of 

Poa mannii

. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to 

Poa mannii

, all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in
part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any endangered
plant species to/from the United States; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of
a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to
possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species
on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area
in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.
Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Section 10 of the Act and 50 CFR
17.62 also provide for the issuance of permits under certain circumstances to carry out activities involving endangered
plants that are otherwise prohibited by section 9. 

It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed
those activities that would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. Such information is intended
to clarify the potential impacts of a species' listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species' range.
The four known populations of 

Poa mannii

 occur on cliffs and rock faces located on State lands. The Service is not aware of any otherwise legal activities proposed
or being conducted by the public at this time that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section
9. Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to
the Field Supervisor of the Service's Pacific Islands Office (see 

ADDRESSES

 section). Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and general inquiries regarding prohibitions
and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,
911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063; FAX 503/231-6243).

Federal listing will automatically invoke listing under the State's endangered species act. Hawaii's endangered
species act states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to be an endangered
species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions
of this chapter * * *'' (HRS, sect. 195D-4(a)). Therefore, Federal listing will accord the species
listed status under Hawaii State law. State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying, injuring,
or possessing any listed species of plant on State or private land, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. State
law also encourages conservation of such species by State agencies and triggers other State regulations to protect
the species (HRS, sect. 195D-4 and 5). Two populations of 

Poa mannii

 occur in forest reserves, which have rules and regulations for the protection of resources. State law mandates the
development and implementation of programs concerning the conservation of biological resources, including this
endangered species (HRS, sect. 195D-5(a)). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Status for 12 Plants From the Hawaiian Islands 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for 12 species of Hawaiian plants: 

Adenophorus periens 

(pendant kihi fern), 

Bonamia menziesii 

(no common name (NCN)), 

Diellia erecta 

(NCN), 

Flueggea neowawraea 

(mehamehame), 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

(ma`o hau hele), 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

(NCN), 

Neraudia sericea 

(ma`aloa), 

Plantago princeps 

(ale), 

Sesbania tomentosa 

(`ohai), 

Solanum incompletum 

(thorny popolo), 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

(NCN), and 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

(Oahu vigna). These 12 species are found on 1 or more of the following Hawaiian Islands: Laysan, Necker, Nihoa, Niihau,
Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii. The 12 species and their habitats have been variously affected
or are currently threatened by one or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation by wild, feral,
or domestic animals (pigs, goats, deer, cattle); competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized,
introduced vegetation; habitat loss from fires; human impacts from recreational activities; and insect infestations.
Due to the small number of existing individuals and/or their very narrow distributions, these species and most of
their populations are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic
events. This rule implements the protection provisions provided by the Act for these plant taxa.

The Hawaiian archipelago includes eight large volcanic islands (Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe,
Maui, and Hawaii), as well as offshore islets, shoals, and atolls set on submerged volcanic remnants at the northwest
end of the chain (the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands). The archipelago covers a land area of about 16,600 square kilometers
(sq km) (6,400 sq miles (mi)), extending roughly between latitude 18
 50
' to 28
 15
' N and longitude 154
 40
' to 178
 70
' W, and ranging in elevation from sea level to 4,200 meters (m) (13,800 feet (ft)) (Dept. of Geography 1983).
The regional geological setting is a mid-oceanic volcanic island archipelago set in a roughly northwest to southeast
line, with younger islands to the southeast. The youngest island, Hawaii, is volcanically active. The older islands
are increasingly eroded, so that the basaltic portions of many of the northwesternmost islands (such as Laysan, Necker,
and Nihoa) are entirely submerged, and coralline atolls and shoals are often all that remain above sea level (Macdonald


et al

. 1986). The topography of the Hawaiian Islands is extremely diverse. On the younger islands, Hawaii and Maui, gently
sloping unweathered shield volcanoes with very poor soil development are juxtaposed with older, heavily weathered
valleys with steep walls, well-developed streams, and gently sloped flood plains. The older islands to the northwest
(i.e., Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai) are generally more weathered. On a typical older island, sea cliffs and large
amphitheater-headed valleys on the windward (northeast) side contrast with erosionally younger, dissected slopes
on the leeward (southwest) side (Dept. of Geography 1983). 
The climate of the Hawaiian Islands reflects the tropical setting buffered by the surrounding ocean (Dept. of Geography
1983). The prevailing winds are northeast trades with some seasonal fluctuation in strength. There are also winter
storm systems and occasional hurricanes. Temperatures vary over the year on an average of 5
  Celsius (C) (11
  Fahrenheit (F)) or less, with daily variation usually exceeding seasonal variation in temperature. Temperature
varies with elevation and ranges from a maximum recorded temperature of 
37.7
  C (99.9
  F), measured at 265 m (870 ft) elevation, to a minimum of minus 
12.7
  C (9.1
  F) recorded at 4,205 m (13,795 ft) elevation. Annual rainfall varies greatly by location, with marked windward
to leeward gradients over short distances. Minimum average annual rainfall is less than 250 millimeters (mm) (10
inches (in)); the maximum average precipitation is well in excess of 11,000 mm (450 in) per year. Precipitation is
greatest during the months of October through April. A dry season is apparent in leeward settings, while windward
settings generally receive tradewind-driven rainfall throughout the year (Dept. of Geography 1983). 
The native-dominated vegetation of the Hawaiian Islands varies greatly according to elevation, moisture regime,
and substrate. The most recent classification of Hawaiian natural communities recognizes nearly 100 native vegetation
types (Gagne and Cuddihy 1990). Within these types are numerous island-specific or region-specific associations,
comprising an extremely rich array of vegetation types within a very limited geographic area. Major vegetation formations
include forests, woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, herblands, and pioneer associations on lava and cinder substrates.

There are lowland, montane, and subalpine forest types in Hawaii, extending from sea level to above 3,000 m (9,800
ft) in elevation. Coastal and lowland forests are generally dry or mesic and may be open- or closed-canopied. The stature
of lowland forests is generally under 10 m (30 ft). Eleven species included in this ruling (

Adenophorus periens, Bonamia menziesii, Diellia erecta, Flueggea neowawraea, Hibiscus brackenridgei, Mariscus
pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps, Solanum incompletum, Spermolepis hawaiiensis

, and 

Vigna o-wahuensis

) have been reported from lowland forest habitat. Montane forests, occupying elevations between 1,000 and 2,000
m (3,000 and 6,000 ft), are dry to mesic on the leeward slopes of the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. On those islands,
as well as on Oahu, Molokai, and Lanai, mesic to wet montane forests occur on the windward slopes and summits. The dry
and mesic forests may be open- to closed-canopied, and may exceed 20 m (65 ft) in stature. Of the species in this ruling,
four (

Diellia erecta, Plantago princeps, Solanum incompletum

, and 

Vigna o-wahuensis

) have been reported from montane mesic and dry forest habitats. Montane wet forests are usually dominated by several
species of native trees and tree ferns. Three species (

Adenophorus periens, Mariscus pennatiformis

, and 

Plantago princeps

) have been reported from montane wet forest habitat. At high montane and subalpine elevations, at and above 2,000
m (6,500 ft) elevation, are subalpine forests, usually open-canopied and forming a mosaic with surrounding grasslands
and shrublands. Subalpine forests are known only from Haleakala on East Maui and from Hualalai, Mauna Kea, and Mauna
Loa on Hawaii. 

Solanum incompletum

 has been reported from subalpine forest habitat. 

Hawaiian shrublands are also found from coastal to alpine elevations. The majority of Hawaiian shrubland types are
in dry and mesic settings, or on cliffs and slopes too steep to support trees. Wet montane shrublands are typically
dominated by 

Metrosideros

 ('ohi'a). Taxa reported from native shrublands include 

Bonamia menziesii, Hibiscus brackenridgei

, and 

Sesbania tomentosa

. Hawaiian grassland types are found from coastal to subalpine settings. Coastal and lowland grasslands are known
from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii. Both 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 and 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 have been reported from native grasslands. 

The land that supports these 12 plant species is owned by various private parties, the City and County of Honolulu,
the County of Maui, the State of Hawaii (including State parks, forest reserves, natural area reserves, and Hawaiian
Home Lands), and the Federal government (including national parks, national wildlife refuges, national historic
sites, and property under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense).

Adenophorus periens

 (pendant kihi fern) was first collected by Captain Fredrick William Beechey in the 1820s or 1830s. It was not formally
described until 1974, when L. Earl Bishop published the name 

Adenophorus periens.

 Prior to its description, the names 

Polypodium adenophorus

 and 

Adenophorus pinnatifidus

 had been erroneously applied to the species represented by Beechey's specimen (Bishop 1974). 



Adenophorus periens

, a member of the grammitis family (Grammitidaceae), is a small, pendant, epiphytic (not rooted on the ground) fern.
The rhizome (prostrate stem) is covered with small dark, stiff scales 2 to 4 centimeters (cm) (0.8 to 1.6 in) long. Its
yellowish green fronds are usually between 10 and 40 cm (4 and 16 in) long and covered with hairs. The fronds have slightly
hairy stalks less than 1 cm (0.4 in) long. Each frond is comprised of oblong or narrowly triangular pinnae (divisions
or leaflets) 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long with margins that are smooth or toothed and lined with sparse hairs. The pinnae
are situated perpendicular to the axis of the midrib, with each pinna twisted such that its upper surface faces upward.
Round sori (groups of spore-producing bodies) usually develop in the central portion of the fertile frond, forming
two regular rows on each pinna. This species differs from other species in this endemic Hawaiian genus by having hairs
along the pinna margins, pinnae at right angles to the midrib axis, by the placement of the sori, and the degree of dissection
of each pinna (Bishop 1970, 1974; Hillebrand 1888; Linney 1989). 

Historically, 

Adenophorus periens

 was known from the following general areas: Halemanu on Kauai, the Koolau Mountains of Oahu, the summit of Lanai, Kula
Pipeline on East Maui, and Hilo and Waimea on the island of Hawaii (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1992a1 to 1992a6,
1992a10 to 1992a13). Currently, 

Adenophorus periens

 is known from several locations on three islands. On Kauai, one population is known from the boundary of Hono O Na Pali
Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and Na Pali Coast State Park on State land, one from Waioli on State land, and four are clustered
in the Wahiawa area over a distance of 2 sq km (0.8 sq mi) on private land (HHP 1992a15 to 1992a17; Hawaii Plant Conservation
Center (HPCC) 1991b, 1991c, 1992; Lorence and Flynn 1991). On Molokai, there is a single population of three plants
on private land at Kamakou Preserve (HHP 1992a7). On the island of Hawaii, four populations are found at Olaa Tract,
Kane Nui o Hamo Crater, Kahaualea NAR, and 2.4 km (1.5 mi) northwest of Puu Kauka on private, State, and Federal land
(L. Cuddihy, National Park Service, 

in litt.

, 1983, 1988; HHP 1992a8, 1992a9, 1992a14). The population at Kane Nui o Hamo has recently been affected by volcanic
eruptions and drought and its status is uncertain (Hugo Huntzinger, National Park Service, 

in litt.

, 1993). The statewide total of 11 current populations comprises approximately 1,280 individuals of this species;
on Kauai, there are about 63 individuals; on Molokai, there are 3; and on Hawaii, there are approximately 1,215 (L.
Cuddihy, 

in litt.

, 1983, 1988; HHP 1992a7 to 1992a9, 1992a14 to 1992a17; HPCC 1991a to 1991c; Lorence and Flynn 1991).

Adenophorus periens

 is found in 

Metrosideros polymorpha

 ('Ohi'a)/

Cibotium glaucum

 (Hapu'u) Lowland Wet Forest between 470 and 1,270 m (1,540 and 4,140 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992a7, 1992a8, 1992a14
to 1992a16). Associated species include 

Broussaisia arguta

 (kanawao ke'oke'o), 

Cheirodendron trigynum

 ('olapa), 

Dicranopteris linearis

 (uluhe), 

Freycinetia arborea

 ('ie'ie), and 

Psychotria hawaiiensis

 (kopiko) (HHP 1992a7, 1992a8, 1992a15, 1992a16). The primary threats to 

Adenophorus periens

 are habitat degradation by pigs (

Sus scrofa

); competition for light, space, nutrients, and water with alien plant species; and habitat destruction by fires.


Asa Gray gave the name 

Bonamia menziesii

 (NCN) to a plant from the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) in honor of its collector, Archibald Menzies (Gray 1862). Wilhelm
Hillebrand (1888) placed the species into the segregate genus 

Breweria

. Otto Degener (1932a, 1932b) described a new genus, 

Perispermum

, and placed 

Bonamia menziesii

 in it. He also described another species of 

Perispermum

, 

P

. 

albiflorum

. T. Myint and D.B. Ward (1968) recognized only one Hawaiian species and placed it in the genus 

Bonamia

. They recognized two varieties: variety 

menziesii

 and a new variety, 

rockii

. The current treatment (Austin 1990) recognizes only one species with no subspecific taxa. 



Bonamia menziesii

, a member of the morning-glory family (Convolvulaceae), is a vine with twining branches up to 10 m (33 ft) long that
are fuzzy when young. The leathery, oblong to oval leaves measure 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) in length and 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to
1.6 in) wide. The upper leaf surface is usually hairless or covered with sparse hairs and the lower surface is covered
with dense fuzzy hairs. The white to greenish funnel-shaped flowers, each 2 to 2.5 mm (0.08 to 0.1 in) long, are produced
singly or in clusters of three on stalks 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long with tiny bracts (modified leaves) at the base of
each stalk. Stamens usually have glandular hairs at their bases. The flower has two styles that are separate or partly
fused. The fruits are tan or yellowish brown capsules 1 to 1.5 cm (0.4 to 0.6 in) long that contain one or two oval seeds
imbedded in black pulp. This species is the only member of the genus that is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and differs
from other genera in the family by its two styles, longer stems and petioles, and rounder leaves (Austin 1990). 

Historically, 

Bonamia menziesii

 was known from the following general areas: scattered locations on Kauai, the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, scattered
locations on Molokai, and the eastern sides of Maui and Hawaii (HHP 1992b3, 1992b4, 1992b10, 1992b11, 1992b13, 1992b15
to 1992b17, 1992b28, 1992b35). Currently, 

Bonamia menziesii

 is known from 28 populations on 5 islands. On Kauai, five populations are known from Kalalau, Paaiki Valley, Mount
Kahili (all on State land), and Wahiawa drainage on private land (HHP 1992b25 to 1992b27, Lorence and Flynn 1991).
On Oahu, 

Bonamia menziesii

 is known from both the Waianae and the Koolau Mountains. In the Waianae Mountains between Kuaokala and Nanakuli, 10
populations are spread over a distance of 24 km (15 mi) on Federal, private, and State land; 8 of these populations are
clustered in the northernmost section over a distance of 8 km (5 mi) (HHP 1992b6, 1992b8, 1992b9, 1992b12, 1992b19,
1992b20, 1992b22, 1992b23, 1992b30, 1992b34). In the southeastern part of the Koolau Mountains, five populations
are found over an area of 6 sq km (2.5 sq mi) on private and State land (HHP 1992b5, 1992b14, 1992b18, 1992b21, 1992b31).
On Lanai, 

Bonamia menziesii

 is known from four scattered locations from Kanepuu to Puhielelu on private land (Garnett 1991; HHP 1992b1, 1992b2,
1992b32; HPCC 1991d). On Maui, one population is known from the western slopes of West Maui on private land and two populations
are located on East Maui on private and State land (HHP 1992b24, 1992b29, 1992b33). On the island of Hawaii, a single
population is located at Kaupulehu on private land (HHP 1992b7). The total current populations throughout the State
consist of approximately 200 individuals, with the largest populations occurring on Oahu (HHP 1992b14, 1992b21,
1992b23, 1992b30). On Kauai, there are approximately 28 plants; on Oahu no more than 150; on Lanai approximately 9;
on Maui a total of 10; and on the island of Hawaii at least 1 specimen has been collected (HHP 1992b1, 1992b2, 1992b5 to
1992b12, 1992b14, 1992b18 to 1992b27, 1992b29 to 1992b34; Lorence and Flynn 1991). 



Bonamia menziesii

 is found on steep slopes in dry to mesic forest and sometimes in wet forest between the elevation of 150 and 625 m (492
and 2,051 ft) (Austin 1990). Associated species include 'ohi'a, 

Canthium odoratum

 (alahe'e), 

Nestegis sandwicense

 (olopua), 

Pisonia

 sp. (papala kepau), and 

Sapindus oahuensis

 (lonomea) (HHP 1992b1, 1992b2, 1992b4, 1992b7 to 1992b9, 1992b18 to 1992b20, 1992b22, 1992b23, 1992b25, 1992b27,
1992b30, 1992b31, 1992b33). The primary threats to 

Bonamia menziesii

 are habitat degradation and possible predation by wild and feral ungulates (pigs, goats (

Capra hircus

), axis deer (

Axis axis

), black-tailed deer (

Odocoileus hemionus

), and cattle (

Bos taurus

), competition with a variety of alien plant species, and fire. 



Diellia erecta

 (NCN) was described by William Dunlop Brackenridge based on a specimen collected during the Wilkes Expedition in
1840 (Brackenridge 1854). He also described 

Diellia pumila

, which subsequently has been considered a depauperate form of 

D. erecta

. 

Davallia alexandri

 was published by Hillebrand in 1873. It has subsequently been considered a form of 

Diellia erecta

 with finely dissected fronds. 

Diellia erecta

 and 

Davallia alexandri

 had been placed in the genus 

Lindsaya

 by certain early authors, and 

Diellia erecta

 into the genus 

Schizoloma

. Degener and Amy B. Greenwell (1950) published the new combination 

Diellia erecta

 var. 

falcata

 for a taxon originally described by Brackenridge as 

Diellia falcata

. However, further study has established that 

Diellia falcata

 is best considered a separate species. 

Diellia erecta

 is now considered to be a species with no subspecific taxa (Wagner 1952, Wagner and Wagner 1992).

Diellia erecta,

 a member of the spleenwort family (Aspleniaceae), is a fern that grows in tufts of three to nine lance-shaped fronds,
each 20 to 70 cm (8 to 28 in) long. The fronds emerge from a 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1 in) long rhizome covered with brown to dark
gray scales. The frond stalks are reddish brown to black and smooth and glossy, 2 to 21 cm (0.8 to 8.3 in) long, and have
a few stiff scales at their bases. Each frond has 15 to 50 lance-shaped pinnae arranged oppositely along the midrib.
The pinnae are usually between 2 and 4 cm (0.8 and 1.6 in) long and 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) wide. Ten to 20 sori, which may
be separate or fused, are borne on each margin of the pinna. Each sorus is covered by an indusium (protective membrane)
that falls short of the edge of the frond and runs parallel to the edge of each pinna. This species differs from other
members of the genus in having brown or dark gray scales usually more than 2 cm (0.8 in) in length, fused or separate sori
along both margins, shiny black midribs that have a hardened surface, and veins that do not usually encircle the sori
(Degener and Greenwell 1950, Hillebrand 1888, Robinson 1912, Smith 1934, Wagner 1952).

Historically, 

Diellia erecta

 was known from the Kokee area on Kauai; the Koolau Mountains on Oahu; Pukoo, Pelekunu Valley, and Kaunakakai Gulch
on Molokai; Mahana Valley and Hauola Gulch on Lanai; scattered locations on West Maui; and various locations on the
island of Hawaii (HHP 1992c1 to 1992c3, 1992c6, 1992c8 to 1992c11, 1992c16, 1992c18 to 1992c26). Currently, 

Diellia erecta

 is only known from Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. On Molokai, there are four locations with an unknown number of individuals
at Halawa Valley, Kahuaawi Gulch, Makolelau, and Puu Kolekole on private land (HHP 1992c12, 1992c14, 1992c15; Robert
Hobdy, Hawaii State Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW), pers. comm., 1991). On Maui, there is a total of at least
38 individuals at 7 locations: 4 populations on West Maui at Iao Valley on private land, and Kanaha Stream, Manawainui
Plant Sanctuary, and Papalaua Gulch on State land; and 3 populations on East Maui at Olinda, Waiopai Gulch, and near
Makawao on State and private land (HHP 1992c4, 1992c5, 1992c7, 1992c13, 1992c17; HPCC 1990a; Joel Lau, HHP, and R.
Hobdy, pers. comms., 1992). On the island of Hawaii, there are 2 populations on State land: 1 at Honomalino with over
20 plants, and 1 at Manuka NAR with at least 1 plant (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Statewide, this species has a total of
13 populations and approximately 63 known individuals.



Diellia erecta

 is found in 

Diospyros sandwicensis

 (Lama)/'Ohi'a Lowland Mesic Forest between 210 and 1,590 m (700 and 5,200 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992c21; HPCC 1990a;
R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). Other associated plant species include 

Dodonaea viscosa

 ('a'ali'i), 

Dryopteris unidentata, Pleomele auwahiensis

 (halapepe), 

Syzygium sandwicensis

 ('ohi'a ha), and 

Wikstroemia

 sp. ('akia) (HPCC 1990a). The major threats to 

Diellia erecta

 are habitat degradation by pigs, goats, and cattle; competition with alien plant species; and stochastic extinction
due to the small number of existing individuals.

In 1912, Joseph F. Rock collected the first specimens of 

Flueggea neowawraea

 (mehamehame) from Kapua on the island of Hawaii (Rock 1913). Based on his specimens, he established the monotypic
genus 

Neowawraea,

 named for Dr. Heinrich W. Wawra, a colleague of Rock's. He named the species 

Neowawraea phyllanthoides

 because of its apparent resemblance to 

Phyllanthus,

 a member of the same family (Euphorbiaceae). Earl Edward Sherff (1939) later transferred the taxon to the genus 

Drypetes.

 W. John Hayden (1987), upon further investigation, placed the species in the genus 

Flueggea.

 Because retention of the specific epithet would result in a later homonym, Hayden chose to maintain the tribute to
Wawra in the new epithet, 

neowawraea.





Flueggea neowawraea,

 a member of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), is a large tree up to 30 m (100 ft) tall and 2 m (7 ft) in diameter with white
oblong pores covering its scaly, pale brown bark. The thin, papery, oval leaves, 4 to 14 cm (1.5 to 5.5 in) long and 2 to
9 cm (0.8 to 3.5 in) wide, are green on the upper surface and pale green on the lower surface. Plants are usually dioecious
(having separate male and female plants) with unisexual flowers lacking petals. Male flowers, on stalks less than
4 mm (0.2 in) long, have five green sepals with brownish tips. The female flowers, on stalks 1 to 2.5 mm (0.04 to 0.1 in)
long, have sepals of unequal length with irregular margins. The two-lobed stigma is positioned atop a 2.5 to 3 mm (0.1
in) long, round ovary with a nectary disk. The fleshy, round fruits, about 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter, are reddish brown
to black and contain two slightly curved seeds about 3 mm (0.1 in) long that are somewhat triangular in cross section.
This species is the only member of the genus found in Hawaii and can be distinguished from other species in the genus
by its large size; scaly bark; the shape, size, and color of the leaves; flowers clustered along the branches; and the
size and shape of the fruits (Hayden 1990, Linney 1982, Neal 1965).

Historically, 

Flueggea neowawraea

 was known from Waihii near Kapuna on Molokai, but is now presumed extinct on that island (HHP 1992d25, Hayden 1990).
This species was also known from Kealia Trail, Kahanahaiki Valley, and Pohakea Gulch in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu
(HHP 1992d5, 1992d10, 1992d33). Currently, 

Flueggea neowawraea

 is known on Kauai from Limahuli Valley, Kalalau, Pohakuao, and from the Koaie and Poomau branches of Waimea Canyon
(HHP 1992d17, 1992d18, 1992d30 to 1992d32; HPCC 1990b; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Also, three individuals (some
of which may be dead) are known from the two adjacent valleys of Mahanaloa and Paaiki, near Makaha Point, on State-owned
land (HHP 1992d9, 1992d13). Only one unhealthy individual is known from Limahuli Valley on privately owned land (HHP
1992d17). One tree is known from Kalalau and 10 from Pohakuao on State-owned land (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Sixteen
trees are known from the Poomau branch of Waimea Canyon, and 40 to 80 individuals are known from 4 scattered populations
along the Koaie branch of Waimea Canyon on State-owned land (HHP 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31; HPCC 1990b; J. Lau, pers.
comm., 1992). On Oahu, 

Flueggea neowawraea

 is currently known from 15 locations with approximately 33 individuals in the Waianae Mountains. The populations
are spread from East Kapuahikahi Gulch to Puumaialau Gulch over a distance of about 15.5 km (9.6 mi) on Federal, State,
County, and private land (HHP 1992d1 to 1992d4, 1992d6 to 1992d8, 1992d11, 1992d12, 1992d14 to 1992d16, 1992d19,
1992d20, 1992d24, 1992d26, 1992d29; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, one or two individuals are known from
Auwahi on the southwest slope of Haleakala at approximately 850 m (2,800 ft) elevation on privately owned land (HHP
1992d23). Five populations are known from the island of Hawaii in South Kona and Kau, extending over an area of about
10 by 5 km (6 by 3 mi) from Papa to Manuka, and numbering approximately 20 individuals, on State and private land (HHP
1992d21, 1992d22, 1992d27, 1992d28, 1992d34, 1992d35; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1990). A Hawaii Island population on
private land at Huehue Ranch in North Kona consists of an unknown number of individuals (Hayden 1990). Statewide,
the species totals 28 populations containing approximately 127 to 167 known individuals.



Flueggea neowawraea

 occurs in dry to mesic forest at 250 to 1,000 m (820 to 3,280 ft) elevation (Hayden 1990). Associated plant species include
alahe'e, lama, 

Aleurites moluccana

 (kukui), 

Antidesma pulvinatum

 (hame), and 

Streblus pendulina

 (a'ia'i) (HHP 1992d3, 1992d7, 1992d9, 1992d12 to 1992d19, 1992d30, 1992d31, 1992d34). The primary threat to the
continued existence of 

Flueggea neowawraea

 is the black twig borer (

Xylosandrus compactus

), that has affected all known 

Flueggea neowawraea

 plants. Other major threats include habitat degradation by feral and wild ungulates (pigs, goats, deer, and cattle),
competition with alien plant species, and fire. The small number of individuals within any population and the scattered
distribution of populations, compounded by a requirement for cross-pollination because the species is dioecious,
must be considered a serious threat.

In 1838, Asa Gray described 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

(ma`o hau hele) from a specimen collected on West Maui (Roe 1961). Then, in 1930, Edward Leonard Caum published two
varieties, 

molokaiana 

and 

kauaiana, 

based upon type specimens from the islands of Molokai and Kauai (Caum 1930). An additional variety, var. 

mokuleiana, 

was named by Sister Margaret James Roe in 1961. In 1990, David Bates recognized two subspecific taxa: ssp. 

mokuleianus 

and ssp. 

brackenridgei 

(including var. 

molokaiana

). He placed 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

var. 

kauaiana 

in synonymy with a non-Hawaiian species of 

Hibiscus, H. calyphyllus. 


Hibiscus brackenridgei, 

a member of the mallow family (Malvaceae), is a sprawling to erect shrub or small tree up to 5 m (16 ft) tall. Most plant
parts (young branches, leaves, and some flower parts) vary in the degree of hairiness. The leaves, about 5 to 15 cm (2
to 6 in) long and equally wide, have three to seven lobes but are generally heart-shaped in outline. Beneath each leaf
stalk is a pair of very thin stipules (leaf-like appendages), 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long, that fall off early in development,
leaving an elliptic scar. Flowers are borne singly or in small clusters. The petals, between 3.5 and 8 cm (1.4 and 3.1
in) long, are yellow, usually with a maroon spot in the center of the flower. Each triangular calyx lobe is reddish to
yellow, and usually has a raised, elongated gland on the midrib. Seven to 10 bracts are attached below the calyx. The
staminal column, which has anthers attached to the upper three-fourths or nearly to the base, extends beyond the petals.
The fruits are somewhat round or oval capsules 1.1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) long that have a beak-like appendage at one end.
This species differs from other members of the genus in having the following combination of characteristics: yellow
petals, a calyx comprised of triangular lobes with raised veins and a single midrib often bearing a prominent elongated
gland, 7 to 10 bracts attached below the calyx, and thin stipules 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long that fall off, leaving
an elliptic scar (Bates 1990). 



Hibiscus brackenridgei 

is currently known from Oahu, Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii; it may possibly occur on Kauai. Twelve populations are known
to exist, containing approximately 60 individuals. The two recognized subspecies are discussed separately below.


Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

was known historically from Laau Point on Molokai (HHP 1992e7), from scattered locations on Lanai, and from Pohakea
Gulch south to near McGregor Point on West Maui (HHP 1992e4, 1992e5, 1992e10 to 1992e13, 1992e15). 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

was also collected from an unspecified site on Kahoolawe (HHP 1992e17). However, the specimen is unavailable, and
the subspecies was not determined (Bates 1990). Currently, 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

consists of about 7 populations containing probably fewer than 60 individuals on State and private land on the islands
of Lanai, Maui, and Hawaii (HHP 1992e1 to 1992e3, 1992e6, 1992e9, 1992e14, 1992e16; HPCC 1990c, 1991e; J. Lau, pers.
comm., 1992). On Lanai, only five or six plants remain near Keomuku Road at 275 m (900 ft) elevation on privately owned
land (HHP 1992e14, HPCC 1991e). On West Maui, 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

is known from two populations occurring at Kaunohua Gulch and the West Maui NAR (HHP 1992e2, 1992e3; J. Lau, pers. comm.,
1992). The Kaunohua Gulch population, numbering approximately eight individuals, is found within a fenced area
of 5 to 10 sq m (55 to 110 sq ft) on privately owned land (HHP 1992e3). The West Maui NAR population, consisting of 14 individuals,
is located in the Lihau section at about 400 m (1,300 ft) elevation in lowland dry forest on 
State-owned land (HHP 1992e2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, the known populations, which extend over a
6.25 sq km (2.4 sq mi) area, number no more than 20 individuals (HHP 1992e1, 1992e8; HPCC 1990c). These populations
are near Puu o Kali between 249 and 440 m (800 and 1,450 ft) in elevation on State-owned land (HHP 1992e1, 1992e8). On
the island of Hawaii, 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

is known from two populations on State and private land: at Puu Anahulu Homesteads and Puu Huluhulu, approximately
3.5 km (2 mi) apart. These two populations contain no more than five individuals (HHP 1992e6, 1992e16; P. Q. Tomich,


in litt., 

1991; K. Wallis, 

in litt., 

1993).

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

mokuleianus 

is currently known from five populations, possibly containing as few as six to eight individuals. Undocumented observations
of this taxon have been reported from Lihue and Olokele Canyon on Kauai (Bates 1990). On Oahu, 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

mokuleianus 

was known historically from scattered locations in the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1992e18, 1992e21, 1992e22, 1992e24).
Within a 12 by 5 km (7.5 by 3 mi) area extending from Puu Pane to Kealia-Kawaihapai are three current populations (1992e19,
1992e20, 1992e23, 1992e25; HPCC 1990d). The northernmost population, consisting of three individuals and occupying
an area of 10 to 100 sq m (110 to 1,080 sq ft), is in the mountains south of the Dillingham Military Reservation at an elevation
of 170 m (560 ft) on privately owned land (HHP 1992e25, HPCC 1990d). Another population is known from two adjacent gulches
between the Dupont Trail and Puu Iki at elevations between 120 and 240 m (400 and 800 ft) (HHP 1992e19, 1992e23). This
population on privately owned land consists of three to five individuals in an area measuring not more than 0.25 sq
km (0.1 sq mi) (HHP 1992e19, 1992e23). A population of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

mokuleianus 

reported from the Puu Pane area has not been seen for more than 40 years (HHP 1992e20). 



Hibiscus brackenridgei 

occurs in lowland dry to mesic forest and shrubland from 130 to 800 m (425 to 2,625 ft) in elevation (Geesink 

et al. 

1990; HHP 1992e1, 1992e4, 1992e5, 1992e8, 1992e14, 1992e19, 1992e25). Associated plant species include `a`ali`i,
alahe`e, 

Erythrina sandwicensis 

(wiliwili), 

Reynoldsia sandwicensis 

(`ohe), and 

Sida fallax 

(`ilima) (HHP 1992e1 to 1992e3, 1992e6, 1992e8, 1992e20, 1992e23, 1992e25). The primary threats to this species
are habitat degradation and possible predation by pigs, goats, axis deer, and cattle; competition with alien plant
species; road construction; and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number
of existing individuals. 

In 1931, the name 

Cyperus pennatiformis 

was published by Georg Kukenthal based on a specimen collected from Hana on Maui (Christophersen and Caum 1931). He
also described a variety of the species, variety 

bryanii

, for plants collected from the Northwestern Hawaiian Island of Laysan. Tetsuo Koyama recombined the species under
the genus 

Mariscus 

and maintained the two subspecific taxa as subspecies (Wagner 

et al

. 1989). 



Mariscus pennatiformis 

(NCN), a member of the sedge family (Cyperaceae), is a perennial plant with a woody root system covered with brown scales.
The stout, smooth, three-angled stems are between 0.4 and 1.2 m (1.3 and 4 ft) long, slightly concave and 3 to 7 mm (0.1
to 0.3 in) in diameter in the lower part. The three to five linear, somewhat leathery leaves are 8 to 17 mm (0.3 to 0.7 in)
wide and at least as long as the stem. Each flower cluster, umbrella-shaped and moderately dense, is 4 to 15 cm (1.5 to
6 in) long and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in) wide. About 5 to 18 spikes, comprised of numerous spikelets, form each cluster. Each
spikelet, measuring about 8 to 14 mm (0.3 to 0.6 in) in length, is yellowish brown or grayish brown and is comprised of
8 to 25 densely arranged flowers. The glumes (bracts beneath each flower), which are less than twice as long as wide,
are spreading and overlap tightly. The lowest glume does not overlap the base of the uppermost glume. This species
differs from other members of the genus by its three-sided, slightly concave, smooth stems; the length and number
of spikelets; the leaf width; and the length and diameter of stems. The two subspecies are distinguished primarily
by larger and more numerous spikelets, larger achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits), and more overlapping and yellower
glumes in ssp. 

pennatiformis 

as compared with ssp. 

bryanii 

(Koyama 1990).

Historically, 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

ssp. 

pennatiformis 

was known from six populations, located on Kauai at Halemanu in Kokee State Park, on Oahu in the Waianae Mountains on
a ridge above Makaha Valley, on East Maui at Keanae Valley and Hana, and on the island of Hawaii at an unspecified location
(HHP 1992f3 to 1992f6). 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

ssp. 

pennatiformis 

also exists in cultivation at the Maui Zoological and Botanical Gardens. The cultivated plants were originally from
Nahiku, East Maui (J. Davis and R. Silva, Maui Zoological and Botanical Gardens, 

in litt., 

1978). It is not known whether the Nahiku population is still extant. The five current populations, with an unknown
number of individuals, are at open sites in mesic forests and low elevation grasslands from sea level to 1,200 m (3,940
ft) in elevation. No historical locations are known for 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

ssp. 

bryanii. 

It is currently known only from federally managed Laysan Island. This subspecies is found on the southeast end of the
central lagoon, and the west and northeast sides of the island (HHP 1992f1, 1992f2; Koyama 1990). These 3 locations
are on sandy substrate at 5 m (16 ft) in elevation and contain approximately 30 individuals (HHP 1992f1, 1992f2; Koyama
1990). Associated species include 

Cyperus laevigatus 

(makaloa), 

Eragrostis variabilis 

(kawelu), and 

Ipomoea 

sp. (HHP 1992f1, Koyama 1990). The small number of individuals and fewer than six known populations of 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

make the species vulnerable to stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor. 




Neraudia sericea 

(ma'aloa) was published by Gaudichaud in 1851 (Cowan 1949). In 1888, Hillebrand reduced it to a variety of 

N. melastomaefolia

 (

N. melastomaefolia 

var. 

sericea

). He also described a new species, 

N. kahoolawensis, 

named for a specimen collected by J.M. Lydgate on the island of Kahoolawe. In the most current treatment (Wagner 

et al. 

1990), the reduction of 

N. sericea 

to a variety of 

N. melastomaefolia 

is not accepted and 

N. kahoolawensis 

is considered a Kahoolawe population of 

N. sericea. 


Neraudia sericea, 

a member of the nettle family (Urticaceae), is a 3 to 5 m (10 to 16 ft) tall shrub with densely hairy branches. The elliptic
or oval leaves are between 4.3 and 13 cm (1.7 and 5.1 in) long and have smooth margins or slightly toothed margins on young
leaves. The upper leaf surface is moderately hairy and the lower leaf surface is densely covered with irregularly
curved, silky gray to white hairs up to 1 mm (0.04 in) long along the veins. The male flowers may be stalkless or have short
stalks. The female flowers are stalkless and have a densely hairy calyx that is either toothed, collar-like, or divided
into narrow unequal segments. The fruits are 1 mm (0.04 in) long achenes with the apical section separated from the
basal portion by a deep constriction. Seeds are oval with a constriction across the upper half. 

Neraudia sericea 

differs from the other four closely related species of this endemic Hawaiian genus by the density, length, color,
and posture of the hairs on the lower leaf surface and by its mostly entire leaf margins (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 




Neraudia sericea 

was known historically from Kamalo and near Waianui on Molokai, from Kaiholena on central Lanai, Olowalu Valley on
West Maui, the southern slopes of Haleakala on East Maui, and from an unspecified site on Kahoolawe (HHP 1992g1, 1992g3,
1992g4, 1992g6 to 1992g10). Currently, two populations of this species are known, from the slopes below Puu Kolekole
on Molokai, specifically along the bottom and lower slopes of Makolelau Gulch, and from Pohakea Gulch on West Maui
(HHP 1992g2, 1992g5, 1992g11). Both populations are on privately owned land. The Makolelau population contains
an estimated 50 to 100 individuals growing in 'Ohi'a/'A'ali'i/

Styphelia tameiameiae 

(Pukiawe) Lowland Dry Shrubland in an area of over 100 sq m (1,080 sq ft) (HHP 1992g11). The population size of the Pohakea
population is undetermined (HHP 1992g2). 

Neraudia sericea 

generally occurs in lowland dry to mesic shrubland or forest between 670 and 1,370 m (2,200 and 4,500 ft) in elevation
(HHP 1992g3, 1992g10, 1992g11; Wagner 

et al.

 1990). Other associated plant species include 'ilima, lama, 

Bobea 

('ahakea), 

Coprosma 

(pilo), and 

Hedyotis 

(HHP 1992g11). The primary threats to 

Neraudia sericea 

are habitat degradation by feral pigs and goats; competition with the alien plant, 

Melinus minutiflora 

(molasses grass); and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing
populations and individuals.

In 1826, Louis Charles Adelbert von Chamisso and D.F.L. Schlectendal described the species 

Plantago princeps 

(ale) (Rock 1920a). In 1829, 

P. queleniana 

was described by Gaudichaud. An additional species, 

P. fauriei, 

was described by H. Leveille (1911) from a specimen collected by Abbe Urbain Jean Faurie from Hanapepe Falls on Kauai.
Several varieties and forms of 

P. princeps 

have also been described. The currently accepted classification places 

P. queleniana 

and 

P. fauriei 

in synonymy with 

P. princeps 

and recognizes only four varieties: 

anomala, laxifolia, longibracteata, 

and 

princeps 

(Gaudichaud 1829, Gray 1862, Hillebrand 1888, Mann 1867, Rock 1920a, Wagner 

et al. 

1990, Wawra 1874). 




Plantago princeps, 

a member of the plantain family (Plantaginaceae), is a small shrub or robust perennial herb. Its erect or ascending
stems are hollow, about 2 to 250 cm (1 to 100 in) long, and often branched with young internodes that are more or less woolly
with reddish brown hairs. The oblong to elliptic, thick, leathery leaves are between 6 and 30 cm (2.4 and 12 in) long
and up to 5 cm (2 in) wide and are tufted near the ends of stems. The leaves have smooth or minutely toothed margins, a pointed
tip, and primary veins that converge at the base of the leaves. Numerous stalkless flowers are densely arranged in
a cluster 11 to 28 cm (4.3 to 11 in) long with each cluster on a stalk 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in) long. Each flower spreads at an
angle of nearly 90 degrees to the axis of the stalk or grows upright. The sepals are somewhat distinct and elliptic in
shape. The fruits are capsules that contain three or four tiny black seeds; the surface of the seeds is apparently covered
with a sticky membrane. This species differs from other native members of the genus in Hawaii by its large branched
stems, flowers at nearly right angles to the axis of the flower cluster, and fruits that break open at a point two-thirds
from the base. The four varieties (

anomala, laxiflora, longibracteata, 

and 

princeps

) are distinguished by the branching and pubescence of the stems; the size, pubescence, and venation of the leaves;
the density of the inflorescence; and the orientation of the flowers (Wagner 

et al. 

1990). 


The four varieties of 

Plantago princeps 

were historically found on five islands, and now occur on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and Maui. A total of 18 populations
containing approximately 300 to 1,200 individuals is currently known. The four varieties are discussed separately
below. Historically, 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

anomala 

was known from Makaleha in the Waianae Mountains on Oahu, and a ridge west of Hanapepe River on Kauai (HHP 1992i1, 1992i4).
Currently on Kauai, 4 populations with 45 individuals are known from the south rim and upper reaches of Kalalau Valley
on State land (HHP 1992i2; HPCC 1990e, 1990g, 1991g). Historically, 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

laxiflora 

was known from Waikolu, Olokui, Kamakou, and Pelekunu on the east side of Molokai; in back of Lahaina on West Maui; and
Hamakua and Kohala on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992i6, 1992i8 to 1992i11, 1992i16, 1992i17). Currently on Molokai,


Plantago princeps 

var. 

laxiflora

 is known from one population with five individuals at Kawela Gulch on private land (HHP 1992i5). On Maui, it is known
from 2 locations in Iao Valley on West Maui, and 4 locations within Haleakala National Park and adjacent Waikamoi Preserve
on East Maui on Federal and private land, totalling about 100 plants on that island (HHP 1992i7, 1992i12 to 1992i15,
1992i18; HPCC 1990h to 1990j, 1991h, 1991i).

Plantago princeps

 var. 

longibracteata

 was historically known from Hanalei, the Wahiawa Mountains, and Hanapepe Falls on Kauai, and from Kaala and the Koolauloa
Mountains on Oahu (HHP 1992i19, 1992i21, 1992i23, 1992i24, 1992i26). Currently, 2 populations are known from Kauai
at Waioli Valley and Waialeale on State land; they are estimated to contain between 130 and more than 1,000 individuals
(HHP 1992i25, 1992i27). On Oahu, two populations approximately 3.5 km (2.2 mi) apart are known from the Poamoho area
on private and State land; the number of individuals is not known (HHP 1992i20, 1992i22). Historically, 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

princeps

 was known from Nuuanu Pali and Kalihi in the Koolau Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1992i28 to 1992i30). Three current populations
of this taxon are known from Mount Tantalus in the Koolau Mountains and from North Palawai and Ekahanui gulches in the
Waianae Mountains of Oahu. Between 16 and 20 individuals are known from the Waianae Mountains. The number of individuals
at the Koolau site is not known, as it was last observed in 1948 (HHP 1992i3, 1992i28 to 1992i31; HPCC 1990f; J. Lau, pers.
comm., 1992). 



Plantago princeps

 is typically found on steep slopes, rock walls, or at bases of waterfalls from 480 to about 1,100 m (1,580 to 3,600 ft)
in elevation (Wagner 

et al

. 1990). Associated plant species include 'a'ali'i, kopiko, 'ohi'a, uluhe, and 

Dubautia plantaginea

 (HHP 1992i28; HPCC 1990e to 1990i, 1990k, 1991g to 1991i). The primary threats to 

Plantago princeps

 are habitat degradation by ungulates (pigs and goats) and competition with various alien plant species. 



Sesbania tomentosa

 ('ohai) was first described by W.J. Hooker and G.A.W. Arnott in 1836 from collections from Oahu (Degener 1937); it
was named for its silvery hairs. In 1920, Joseph F. Rock described an arborescent form of the species (

S. tomentosa 

f. 

arborea

) based on a Molokai specimen. Degener and Sherff (Sherff 1949) published a new variety, var. 

molokaiensis

, based on plants from West Molokai. Nearly 30 years later, Otto and Isa Degener elevated that variety to the specific
level (Degener and Degener 1978). At that time, the Degeners also described two new species, 

S. hawaiiensis

 and 

S. hobdyi

. In the currently accepted classification by Geesink and others (1990), 

S. arborea, S. hawaiiensis, S. hobdyi

, and 

S. molokaiensis

 are synonymized with 

S. tomentosa

. However, they note that the arborescent form of the species found on the island of Molokai probably merits formal
taxonomic recognition. 



Sesbania tomentosa

, a member of the pea family (Fabaceae), is typically a sprawling shrub with branches up to 14 m (45 ft) long but may also
be a small tree up to 6 m (20 ft) in height. Each compound leaf is comprised of 18 to 38 oblong to elliptic leaflets, each
15 to 38 mm (0.6 to 1.5 in) long and 5 to 18 mm (0.2 to 0.7 in) wide, and is usually sparsely to densely covered with silky
hairs. The flowers, in clusters of two to nine, are salmon tinged with yellow, orange-red, or scarlet, or rarely pure
yellow. The petals are between 23 and 45 mm (0.9 and 1.8 in) long, the upper pair sometimes of a lighter color than the
other petals. The calyx is about 7 to 12 mm (0.3 to 0.5 in) long. Fruits are slightly flattened pods 7 to 23 cm (2.8 to 9 in)
long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide that contain about 6 to 27 olive to pale or dark brown, oblong seeds. 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is the only endemic Hawaiian species in the genus, differing from the naturalized 

S. sesban

 by the color of the flowers, the longer petals and calyx, and the number of seeds per pod (Geesink 

et al

. 1990).

On Molokai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was known historically from Mahana on Mauna Loa, in the vicinity of the coast near Waiahewahewa Gulch, and on Molokai's
west coast at Laau and Ilio Points (HHP 1992j16, 1992j18, 1992j23, 1992j26, 1992j37). On Oahu, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was known historically from eastern Oahu at Ulupau Crater, and on the islets of Kaohikaipu and Mokulua (HHP 1992j3,
1992j6, 1992j34). This taxon was also known historically from western Oahu at an unspecified location along the Waianae
coast (HHP 1992j10). On Lanai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was known historically from scattered locations on the south half of the island and on the east slope of the island at
Kahinahina (HHP 1992j5, 1992j19 to 1992j22, 1992j42). 

Sesbania tomentosa

 was also known historically from an unspecified location on Kahoolawe (HHP 1992j24). 

Currently, there are two populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (HHP 1992j35, 1992j36). One population is on the island of Nihoa, which comprises
0.8 sq km (0.3 sq mi) and is under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service management (Depart. of Geography 1983, HHP 1992j35).
The Nihoa plants have been described as relatively common in some areas, with several thousand individuals known
(HHP 1992j35). Another population is known from Necker Island, which is only 0.2 sq km (0.1 sq mi) in area, and like Nihoa
is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (HHP 1992j36). Although there are no population estimates for Necker
Island, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is known to occur from 45 m (150 ft) elevation to the summit, growing on the tops of all hills of the main island with a few
individuals found on the Northwest Cape (HHP 1992j36). On the privately owned island of Niihau, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is known from the south tip of the island at the headland west of Kaumuhonu Bay. The size of this population has not been
determined; in 1947 at least one collection was made at an elevation of 50 m (160 ft) (HHP 1992j14). 

On Kauai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is found between Mana town and Mana Point and at Polihale State Park (HHP 1992j15, 1992j33; HPCC 1991L). The population
on State-owned land at Polihale State Park consists of about 30 individuals growing in a lithified dune area at approximately
12 m (40 ft) elevation in an area of approximately 10 to 50 sq m (110 to 540 sq ft) (HHP 1992j33). The second population
is approximately 6 km (4 mi) southwest of the Polihale State Park population, growing alongside a pond owned by the
State (HHP 1992j15). The size of the population has not been determined. On Oahu, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is currently known from 1 population of 50 to 100 individuals on State-owned land at Kaena Point (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2).
This population is primarily within the Kaena Point NAR, growing in sand dunes in a Naupaka kahakai Mixed Coastal Dry
Shrubland (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2; HPCC 1990o). However, scattered individuals are also located to the east for about
3.5 km (2.25 mi) along the north coast (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2; Woodward 

et al

. 1991). 

On Molokai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is known from the south slopes of central Molokai from Kamiloloa to Makolelau and along Molokai's northwest coast
from Moomomi to east of Hinanaulua. The 4 populations on private and State-owned land from Kamiloloa to Makolelau
total fewer than 2,000 individuals and grow in a 7 by 3 km (4.5 by 2 mi) area (HHP 1992j11, 1992j13, 1992j25, 1992j27;
HPCC 1990m, 1990n). The 3 populations from Moomomi to east of Hinanaulua consist of about 100 to 150 plants growing
on State and private land from sea level to 60 m (200 ft) elevation in a 5 by 1 km (3 by 0.5 mi) area (HHP 1992j12, 1992j28,
1992j49; HPCC 1990L). On Lanai, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is now restricted to the northern slopes of the island. This cluster of 3 populations between Paomai and Maunalei is
on privately owned land and includes at least 12 individuals growing on arid slopes (HHP 1992j17, 1992j38, 1992j39).


On Maui, 

Sesbania tomentosa

 is only known from two areas on West Maui and two areas on East Maui. On West Maui, one plant is on State-owned land below
Lihau Peak (HHP 1992j30). 

Sesbania tomentosa

 also occurs on a 6 km (4 mi) stretch of the northeast coast of West Maui, from the lighthouse near Nakalele Point to Puu
Kahulianapa (HHP 1992j31, 1992j32, 1992j43, 1992j48; HPCC 1991m). This cluster of 4 populations contains an estimated
50 to 75 individuals on land owned by the State, the County of Maui, and private individuals (HHP 1992j31, 1992j32,
1992j43, 1992j48; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On East Maui, two trees exist on privately owned land in Kamaole, but
they appear to have been planted (Winona Char, Char & Associates, 

in litt

., 1993). 

Sesbania tomentosa

 also occurs on the southeastern slopes of Pimoe cinder cone between 450 and 500 m (1480 to 1640 ft) elevation. This population
consists of 13 plants located on the Hawaii National Guard Kanaio Training Area (Sam Gon, The Nature Conservancy,


in litt

., 1993). Off the south central coast of Kahoolawe, approximately 25 to 30 individuals of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 are found on the sparsely vegetated islet of Puu Koae, which is a State-owned seabird sanctuary (HHP 1992j29).

On the island of Hawaii, 

Sesbania tomentosa 

is known from two regions of the southeast coast and two areas along the northwestern coast. On the southeastern coast
it occurs along 16 km (10 mi) of coastline between Ka Lae and Kaalela. This cluster of populations on State-owned land
contains an estimated 260 individuals growing between sea level and 25 m (80 ft) elevation, with some populations
occurring in `Ilima Coastal Dry Shrubland (HHP 1992j7, 1992j9, 1992j44, 1992j45, 1992j50; HPCC 1991j, 1991k; W.
Char, 

in litt., 

1993). The second cluster is in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and consists of scattered populations within a 19 by
8 km (12 by 5 mi) area from above Kukalauula Pali to Kahue, at elevations between 10 and 850 m (30 and 2,800 ft). This cluster
of populations on federally owned land contains at least 50 individuals (HHP 1992j4, 1992j8, 1992j40, 1992j41, 1992j46,
1992j47; H. Huntzinger, 

in litt., 

1993). On the northwestern coast, a single plant occurs at 30 m (100 ft) elevation on private land at Kaupulehua (W.
Char, in litt., 1993). The other northwest coast population is also on private land at Waiakailio, and consists of
eight plants with several seedlings at 300 m (1000 ft) elevation (W. Char, 

in litt., 

1993). The total currently known populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 on the 8 main Hawaiian islands (Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Hawaii) contain an estimated
2,000 to 3,000 individuals. In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the largest population occurs on Nihoa and consists
of several thousand individuals (HHP 1992j35). 



Sesbania tomentosa 

is found on sandy beaches, dunes, soil pockets on lava, and along pond margins (Geesink 

et al. 

1990). It commonly occurs in coastal dry shrublands and grasslands, but is also known from open 'ohi'a forests and
Mixed Coastal Dry Cliffs (HHP 1992j2, 1992j4, 1992j5, 1992j7, 1992j14, 1992j27, 1992j28, 1992j35, 1992j49). Associated
plant species include 'ilima, naupaka kahakai, 

Heteropogon contortus 

(pili), 

Myoporum sandwicense 

(naio), and 

Sporobolus virginicus 

('aki'aki) (HHP 1992j1, 1992j2, 1992j7, 1992j8, 1992j12, 1992j13, 1992j25, 1992j28, 1992j31, 1992j33, 1992j40,
1992j45, 1992j49, 1992j50). The primary threats to 

Sesbania tomentosa 

are habitat degradation caused by axis deer and cattle, competition with various alien plant species, fire, and destruction
by off-road vehicles. 

A specimen collected by David Nelson in 1779 from the island of Hawaii was described and named 

Solanum incompletum 

(thorny popolo) by Dunal (1852). In 1888, Hillebrand described two varieties of the species: var. 

glabratum 

and var. 

mauiense. 

In 1969, Harold St. John described the species 

S. haleakalaense 

based on a specimen collected by Hillebrand on the south slope of Haleakala on Maui (St. John 1969). In the latest treatment,


S. haleakalaense 

was synonymized with 

S. incompletum 

and no subspecific taxa of 

S. incompletum 

were recognized (Symon 1990). 



Solanum incompletum, 

a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), is a woody shrub up to 3 m (10 ft) tall. Its stems and lower leaf surfaces
are covered with prominent reddish prickles about 4 mm (0.2 in) long or sometimes with yellow fuzzy hairs on young plant
parts and lower leaf surfaces. The oval to elliptic leaves, 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) long and about 7 cm (2.8 in) wide, have
prominent veins on the lower surface, and are on stalks up to 7 cm (2.8 in) long. The leaf margins are lobed with one to
four lobes on each side. Numerous flowers grow in loose branching clusters with each flower on a stalk about 9 mm (0.4
in) long. The calyx and flowers generally lack prickles. The white petals form a star-shaped corolla about 2 cm (0.8
in) in diameter. The curved anthers, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, top short filaments that do not extend beyond the petals.
Fruits are round berries about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in diameter that mature from yellow-orange to black. This species differs
from others in the genus by being generally prickly and having loosely clustered white flowers, curved anthers about
2 mm (0.08 in) long, and berries 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 in) in diameter (Symon 1990).

Historically, 

Solanum incompletum 

was known from central and northeastern Lanai and from scattered locations on Maui (HHP 1992k1, 1992k2, 1992k4, 1992k10
to 1992k13; Symon 1990). According to David Symon (1990), the known distribution of 

Solanum incompletum 

also extends to the islands of Kauai and Molokai. On the island of Hawaii, 

Solanum incompletum 

was known historically from the Kohala Mountains, Kona, Puu Waawaa, Puu Ikaaka Crater, and Omaokoili (HHP 1992k3,
1992k5, 1992k7 to 1992k9). The single remaining known population is from the island of Hawaii; it has not been seen
for more than 40 years. This population is on State land at Puu Huluhulu and consists of perhaps two individuals at an
approximate elevation of 2,040 m (6,700 ft) (HHP 1992k6). Associated species include naio, 

Acacia koa 

(koa), and 

Sophora chrysophylla 

(mamane) in dry mesic forest, diverse mesic forest, and subalpine forest at elevations from 300 to 2,040 m (1,000 to
6,700 ft) (HHP 1992k1, 1992k6; Symon 1990; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The primary threats to the last remaining individuals
of 

Solanum incompletum 

are stochastic extinction and reduced reproductive vigor due to the extremely small number of existing plants, and
competition with the alien plant, 

Senecio mikanioides 

(German ivy). 



Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

(NCN) was first described by H. Wolff in 1921. In the past, this Hawaiian species had been confused with the European
plants, 

Apium echinatum 

and 

Caucalis daucoides 

(Constance and Affolter 1990, Wolff 1921). 



Spermolepis hawaiiensis, 

a member of the parsley family (Apiaceae), is a slender annual herb with few branches that grows to a height of 5 to 20
cm (2 to 8 in). Its leaves, dissected into narrow, lance-shaped divisions, are oblong to somewhat oval in outline and
grow on stalks about 2.5 cm (1 in) long. Flowers are arranged in a loose, compound umbrella-shaped inflorescence arising
from the stem, opposite the leaves. Each cluster consists of two to six flowers, with each flower on a stalk between
2 and 6 mm (0.08 and 0.2 in) long. The calyx is lacking in this species, but one to five bracts grow below the clusters of
flowers. The fruits are oval and laterally compressed and constricted at the line where the two halves of the fruit
meet. The fruits are 4 mm (0.2 in) long and 3 mm (0.1 in) wide, covered with curved bristles, and contain seeds that are
marked with longitudinal grooves beneath oil tubes that are characteristic of the parsley family. 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

is the only member of the genus native to Hawaii. It is distinguished from other native members of the family by being
a non-succulent annual with an umbrella-shaped inflorescence (Constance and Affolter 1990). 


Historically, 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

was known from Waimea on Kauai, Koko Head on Oahu, Paomai and Kahinahina on Lanai, and Kipuka Kahali' on Hawaii (HHP
1992L3 to 1992L5, 1992L8, 1992L9; H. Huntzinger, 

in litt., 

1993). Currently, six populations are known on Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and West Maui; one additional population may
exist on Hawaii. On Oahu, on State land at Diamond Head (land leased to the Department of Defense at the Diamond Head
Reservation), 10 plants were observed in 1992 during the dry season. In 1988, when the site was first visited, thousands
of plants were seen over an area less than 50 sq m (several hundred sq ft) (Wayne Takeuchi, DOFAW, pers. comm., 1992).
The population fluctuations probably reflect seasonal changes in precipitation. On Molokai, about 600 plants were
reported from Kamalo on private land within an area of less than 400 sq m (0.1 ac) (HHP 1992L6). On Lanai, 2 populations
of 

S. hawaiiensis 

are known on private land: 1 at Kapoho with 100 individuals and 1 west of Puu Manu with 50 to 100 individuals covering
an area of about 0.1 ha (0.25 ac) (HHP 1992L7; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On West Maui, 3 populations are known on State
land: 1 in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, with 60 to 100 individuals within an area of about 0.4 ha (1 ac); 1 further
east in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, with several hundred plants scattered over a distance of 0.7 km (0.4 mi);
and 1 above Lahainaluna School, with several hundred individuals spread over an area of about 0.4 ha (1 ac) (HHP 1992L1,
1992L2; HPCC 1991n). On the island of Hawaii, a collection of 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

was made at an unspecified location in 1943; it is not known whether this population still exists (HHP 1992L9).

Spermolepis hawaiiensis

 is known from various vegetation types, including 'ohi'a forests, 'A'ali'i Lowland Dry Shrubland, cultivated fields,
and pastures between about 300 and 600 m (1,000 and 2,000 ft) in elevation (HHP 1992L2, 1992L8, 1992L9; HPCC 1991n).
Associated plant species include 'ilima, 

Doryopteris

 sp., 

Gouania hillebrandii

, and the alien plant, 

Leucaena leucocephala

 (koa haole) (HHP 1992L1). The primary threats to 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis

 are habitat degradation by axis deer and competition with the alien plant, koa haole. 



Vigna o-wahuensis

 (Oahu vigna) was described by T. Vogel in 1836 from a specimen from the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (Gray 1854). In 1854,
Gray described another species, 

Vigna sandwicensis

, for which Rock later designated two varieties: var. 

heterophylla

 and var. 

sandwicensis

 (Rock 1920b). The currently accepted treatment places 

V. sandwicensis

 in synonymy under 

V. o-wahuensis 

(Geesink 

et al. 

1990). 



Vigna o-wahuensis

, a member of the pea family, is a slender twining annual or perennial herb with fuzzy stems that grows to 0.4 m (1.3 ft)
in length. Each leaf is made up of three leaflets that vary in shape from round to linear, are 1.2 to 8 cm (0.5 to 3 in) long
and 0.1 to 2.5 cm (0.04 to 1 in) wide, and are sparsely or moderately covered with coarse hairs. Flowers, in clusters
of one to four, have thin, translucent, pale yellow or greenish yellow petals about 2 to 2.5 cm (0.8 to 1 in) long. The
two lowermost petals are fused and appear distinctly beaked. The sparsely hairy calyx is 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long
with asymmetrical lobes that measure about 3 mm (0.1 in) long. The fruits are long slender pods 4 to 9 cm (1.6 to 3.5 in)
long and about 5 mm (0.2 in) wide, that may or may not be slightly inflated and contain 7 to 15 gray to black seeds less than
6 mm (0.2 in) long. This species differs from others in the genus by its thin yellowish petals, sparsely hairy calyx,
and thin pods which may or may not be slightly inflated (Geesink 

et al.

 1990). 

Historically, 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 was known from Niihau and from an unspecified location on Kauai (HHP 1992m10, 1992m16). On Oahu, this taxon was known
from between Waimanalo and Makapuu Point, the Mokulua Islets, and the Waianae Mountains (HHP 1992m13 to 1992m15,
1992m20). On Maui, 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 was known from an unspecified site on West Maui and from Makawao, Waiakoa, and Haleakala on East Maui (HHP 1992m2 to
1992m4, 1992m25). There are no currently known populations on Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, or Maui. On Molokai, 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 was known historically from the western end of the island in the vicinity of Ilio Point (HHP 1992m18). On Lanai, this
species occurred historically at scattered locations across the island's southern half (HHP 1992m5, 1992m6, 1992m8,
1992m9, 1992m17). On the island of Hawaii, this taxon was known from Mauna Loa and Kau at unspecified sites (HHP 1992m1,
1992m19, 1992m24).

Currently, a total of fewer than 100 individuals of 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 is known from 7 populations on the islands of Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Hawaii (HHP 1992m11, 1992m12, 1992m21
to 1992m23; HPCC 1991o; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Molokai, there are two populations separated by a distance of
4 km (2.5 mi). One population, south of Onini Gulch at about 850 m (2,800 ft) elevation on privately owned land, covers
an area of 18 sq m (200 sq ft) in a forestry planting of 

Fraxinus uhdei

 (tropical ash) and 

Pinus

 (pine) (HHP 1992m11). The other Molokai population of about 10 individuals is on privately owned land at Makolelau
(J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Lanai, at least one individual of 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 is known from the arid windward slopes northeast of Kanepuu above Lapaiki at about 370 m (1,200 ft) elevation on privately
owned land (HHP 1992m7, 1992m23). On the State-owned island of Kahoolawe, 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 grows between Makaalae and Lua Kealialalo at 140 m (460 ft) elevation, near the summit at about 400 m (1,300 ft) elevation,
and about 0.8 km (0.5 mi) south of Hanakanaea near ``Sailor's Hat'' (HHP 1992m21, 1992m23; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).
Only one individual is known from the population between Makaalae and Lua Kealialalo in pili grassland (J. Lau, pers.
comm., 1992). Near the summit, about 20 plants grow in a 9 sq m (100 sq ft) area with a few more plants scattered nearby
(HHP 1992m22). The size of the population south of Hanakanaea has not been determined, but at least one collection
has been made recently (HHP 1992m21). On the island of Hawaii, 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 is known only from Nohonaohae Cinder Cone on privately owned land. Ten plants are known from 'A'ali'i Lowland Dry Shrubland
within an exclosure containing pasture grass (HHP 1992m12, HPCC 1991o). 


Vigna o-wahuensis

 occurs in dry to mesic grassland and shrubland from 10 to 1,370 m (30 to 4,500 ft) in elevation (Geesink 

et al.

 1990; HHP 1992m1 to 1992m3, 1992m5, 1992m11, 1992m12, 1992m15, 1992m22, 1992m24). Other associated plant species
include 'ilima, 

Chenopodium

 ('aheahea), 

Dubautia menziesii

, and 

Osteomeles anthyllidifolia

 (ulei) (HHP 1992m11, 1992m12, 1992m23; HPCC 1991o). The primary threats to 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 are habitat degradation by ungulates (pigs and axis deer), competition with various alien plant species, fire, and
stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals.



Previous Federal Action 


Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States.
This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document,


Adenophorus periens, Bonamia menziesii, Flueggea neowawraea

 (as 

Drypetes phyllanthoides

), 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 (as 

H. b.

 var. 

brackenridgei

, var. 

mokuleianus

, and var. ``from Hawaii''), 

Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps

 (as 

P. p.

 var. 

elata

, var. 

laxifolia

, and var. 

princeps

), 

Sesbania tomentosa

 (as 

S. t.

 var. 

tomentosa

), 

Solanum incompletum

 (as 

S. i.

 var. 

glabratum

, var.

, and var. 

mauiensis

), 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 (also as 

V. sandwicensis

 var. 

heterophylla

 and 

V. s.

 var. 

sandwicensis

) were considered to be endangered. 

Diellia erecta

 and 

Plantago princeps

 (as 

P. p.

 var. 

acaulis

, var. 

denticulata

, and var. 

queleniana

) were considered to be threatened, and 

Neraudia sericea

 (as 

N. kahoolawensis

) and 

Solanum incompletum

 (as 

S. haleakalense

) were considered to be extinct.

On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. As a result
of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species, including all of the above taxa considered to be endangered or thought to be extinct, plus 

Diellia erecta 

(considered threatened). The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the
Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 
General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn.
A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including the above
taxa, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants
on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In these notices,
11 of the taxa (including synonymous taxa) that had been in the 1976 proposed rule were treated as category 1 candidates
for Federal listing. Category 1 taxa are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological
vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Other than 

Mariscus pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea 

(as 

N. kahoolawensis

), 

Plantago princeps

 (as 

P. p.

 var. 

acaulis 

and var.

 queleniana

), 

Sesbania tomentosa 

(as 

S. hobdyi

), 

Solanum incompletum 

(as 

S. haleakalense

), and 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis,

 all the aforementioned taxa that were proposed as endangered in the June 16, 1976, proposed rule were considered category
1 candidates on all three notices of review. 

Flueggea neowawraea

 appeared as 

Neowawraea phyllanthoides

 in the 1980 and 1985 notices. In the 1980 and 1985 notices, 

Sesbania tomentosa 

(as 

S. hobdyi

) and 

Solanum incompletum 

(as 

S. haleakalense

) were considered category 1* species. Category 1* species are those that are possibly extinct. 

Plantago princeps 

(as 

P. p.

 var. 

acaulis

 and var. 

queleniana

) appeared as a category 2 taxon and 

Neraudia sericea 

(as 

N. kahoolawensis

) as a category 3A species in the 1980 and 1985 notices. Category 2 taxa are those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability,
but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Category 3A taxa are those for which
the Service has persuasive evidence of extinction. Through taxonomic revisions, each of the category 1*, 2, and 3A
taxa were synonymized under category 1 taxa on the 1990 list. 

Mariscus pennatiformis 

(as 

Cyperus p.

 var. 

bryanii

) first appeared on the 1985 notice of review as a category 1 taxon. 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis

 first appeared on the 1990 notice of review as a category 1 species after it was rediscovered in 1986. 
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information
indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982
amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted
on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but
precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification
of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition
as having been resubmitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The findings were reviewed in October of
1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. The proposed rule published on September 14, 1993 (58 FR 48012)
to list 12 species of plants from the Hawaiian Islands as endangered species constituted the final 1-year finding
that was required for these species. 
Based on comments and recommendations received in response to the proposal (see Comments and Recommendations, below),
the Service now determines these 12 plant species to be endangered with the publication of this final rule. 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the September 14, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to
submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The public comment
period ended on November 15, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific
organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper notices inviting
public comment were published in ``The Maui News'' on October 7, 1993, the ``Hawaii Tribune-Herald'' on October 8,
1993, and the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on October 7, 1993. 
Comments were received from three parties: One from an individual in support of the listing of 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis,

 but offering no additional information; one from an individual in support of the listing of 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis, Adenophorus periens 

and 

Sesbania tomentosa,

 and providing information on the possible extirpation of the population of 

Adenophorus periens

 at Kane Nui o Hamo by volcanic activity and drought, and indicating that the actual number of plants of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is more than 50; the third respondent provided information on three previously
unknown populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa,

 one from the south coast of East Maui and two from the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii. The information provided
by these respondents has been incorporated into this final rule. The information received does not indicate that
any of these species are under less threat than previously thought. 


Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists of endangered and threatened species. A species
may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section
4(a)(1). The threats facing these 12 species are summarized in Table 2.

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Their Habitat or Range 



Native vegetation on all of the main Hawaiian Islands has undergone extreme alteration because of past and present
land management practices including ranching, deliberate alien animal and plant introductions, and agricultural
development (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Wagner 

et al.

 1985). The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have undergone similar alteration, but to a lesser degree. The primary
threats facing the 12 plant species included in this ruling are ongoing and threatened destruction and adverse modification
of habitat by feral animals and competition with alien plants. 

Eleven of the 12 species in this ruling are variously threatened by feral animals. (See Table 2.) Animals such as pigs,
goats, axis deer, black-tailed deer, and cattle were introduced either by the early Hawaiians (pigs) or more recently
by European settlers (all ungulate species) for food and/or commercial ranching activities. Over the 200 years following
their introduction, their numbers increased and the adverse impacts of feral ungulates on native vegetation have
become increasingly apparent. Beyond the direct effect of trampling and grazing native plants, feral ungulates
have contributed significantly to the heavy erosion still taking place on most of the main Hawaiian islands. 

Pigs (

Sus scrofa

), originally native to Europe, Africa, and Asia, were introduced to Hawaii by the Polynesian ancestors of Hawaiians,
and later by western immigrants. The pigs escaped domestication and invaded primarily wet and mesic forests and grasslands
of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and Hawaii. They presently threaten the existence of at least eight of the taxa in those
habitats. While foraging, pigs root and trample the forest floor, encouraging the establishment of alien plants
in the newly disturbed soil. Pigs also disseminate alien plant seeds through their feces and on their bodies, accelerating
the spread of alien plants through native forest (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). On Kauai, three populations
each of 

Adenophorus periens

 and 

Flueggea neowawraea

 and a single population each of 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

anomala

 and 

P. p.

 var. 

longibracteata

 have sustained loss of individual plants and/or habitat as a result of feral pig activities (HHP 1992d18, 1992i2;
J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The following numbers of populations of the plants on Oahu are threatened by pigs: 4 populations
of 

Bonamia menziesii,

 15 of 

Flueggea neowawraea,

 1 of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 ssp. 

mokuleianus,

 and 2 populations each of 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

longibracteata

 and 

P. p.

 var. 

princeps.

 On Molokai, one population each of 

Diellia erecta, Plantago princeps

 var. 

laxiflora,

 and 

Vigna o-wahuensis,

 and two populations of 

Neraudia sericea

 are also threatened by pigs. On East Maui, pigs are destroying the habitat of three populations of 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

laxiflora

 (HHP 1992i12; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On the island of Hawaii, feral pigs are a major threat to species at the following
locations: in Kahaualea NAR, Olaa Tract, and 2.4 km (1.5 mi) northwest of Puu Kauka, where at least three populations
of 

Adenophorus periens

 occur; and in the regions of Manuka and Honomalino in the South Kona District, where one or more populations of 

Diellia erecta

 and 

Flueggea neowawraea

 remain (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).

Goats (

Capra hircus

), native to the Middle East and India, were first successfully introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1792. Feral goats
now occupy a wide variety of habitats from lowland dry forests to montane grasslands on Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui,
and Hawaii, where they consume native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, accelerate erosion, and promote
the invasion of alien plants (Stone 1985, van Riper and van Riper 1982). Goats are significantly degrading the habitat
of at least five species in this rule. On Kauai, goats contribute to the substantial decline of one population of 

Bonamia menziesii,

 four populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea,

 and one population of 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

anomala

 (HHP 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31, 1992i2; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Oahu, encroaching urbanization and hunting
pressure tend to concentrate the goat population in the dry upper slopes of the Waianae Mountains, where one population
of 

Bonamia menziesii

 and two populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea

 exist (HHP 1992d15; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The goat population in the Waianae area is apparently increasing,
becoming an even greater threat to the rare plants that grow there. On Molokai, two populations of 

Diellia erecta

 in Halawa Valley and Puu Kolekole and one population of 

Neraudia sericea

 at Makolelau are presently threatened by goats (HHP 1992c12, 1992c13; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Until a few years
ago, feral goats were a major threat to rare plants in Haleakala National Park on East Maui, but because of an active
ungulate control program, the goat population was reduced to 100 by 1988. While they are no longer a significant threat,
the future ingress and reestablishment of goats are still a possibility (Lloyd Loope, National Park Service (NPS),
pers. comm., 1992) and could potentially affect the three populations of 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

laxiflora

 found in the park (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Eight individuals of axis deer (

Axis axis

), introduced to the island of Molokai in 1868, increased to thousands of animals within about 30 years (Tomich 1986).
By the turn of the century, the herds so damaged the vegetation of Molokai that professional hunters were hired to control
their numbers (Tomich 1986). By then, the native vegetation had suffered irreparable damage from overgrazing by
axis deer. They degrade the habitat by trampling and overgrazing vegetation, which removes ground cover and exposes
the soil to erosion (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Activity of deer on Molokai has resulted in loss of habitat and/or individuals
of at least six of the species. In the absence of a protective fence, axis deer continue to invade the unfenced areas
and threaten to trample the plants. On both Molokai and Lanai, the axis deer populations are presently actively managed
for recreational hunting by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources. Extensive red erosional scars
caused by decades of deer activity are evident on Lanai. The habitat of three Lanai populations of 

Bonamia menziesii

 and one population of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 ssp. 

brackenridgei

 on that island is negatively affected by axis deer (HHP 1992e1; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Two populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 at Paomai and Mahana on Lanai were last seen in the mid-1950s (HHP 1992j17, 1992j38). Those areas have long supported
axis deer, which probably pose the primary threat to those two 

Sesbania

 populations. Elsewhere on Lanai, one population of 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 above Lapaiki and one population of 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis

 at Kapoho are threatened by axis deer (HHP 1992L7, 1992m23). To control deer in what remains of Lanai's dry forests,
The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii (TNCH) is presently erecting fenced exclosures to protect populations of rare taxa
(including two populations of 

Bonamia menziesii

) that occur within Kanepuu Preserve (Heidi Bornhorst, TNCH, and J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992). Although the fence is
high enough to normally inhibit entry by deer, human pressure can force the deer to jump over the fence. On Maui, deer
damaged plants of two populations of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 ssp. 

brackenridgei

 at Puu O Kali by stripping the bark and breaking limbs (HHP 1992e1, 1992e8).

Black-tailed deer (

Odocoileus hemionus

) were first introduced to Kauai in 1961 for the purpose of sport hunting and today probably number well over 500 animals.
The deer are presently confined to the western side of the island, where they feed on a variety of native and alien plants
(van Riper and van Riper 1982). On Kauai, one population of 

Bonamia menziesii 

in Paaiki Valley and the population of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

in Paaiki and Mahanaloa valleys are threatened by black-tailed deer (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Large-scale ranching of cattle (

Bos taurus

) in the Hawaiian Islands began in the middle of the 19th century on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii. Large
ranches, tens of thousands of acres in size, developed on East Maui and Hawaii (Cuddihy and Stone 1990) where most of
the State's large ranches still exist today. Degradation of native forests used for ranching activities became evident
soon after full-scale ranching began. The negative impact of cattle on Hawaii's ecosystem is similar to that described
for goats and deer (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Stone 1985). Cattle grazing continues in several lowland regions in the
northern portion of the Waianae Mountains of Oahu: in Lualualei, where one population of 

Bonamia menziesii 

exists, and in Kaumoku Gulch, where one population of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

mokuleianus 

remains (HHP 1992b30; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Molokai, cattle ranching is slowly recovering from setbacks
caused by recent herd reductions enforced in an effort to eliminate bovine tuberculosis from domestic and feral stock.
As cattle ranching becomes reestablished on Molokai and the number of cattle increases, the threat to the rare plant
species that remain in those ranching areas will also likely increase. One population of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

located east of Moomomi Preserve grows in a grazing area. On Maui, cattle ranching is the primary agricultural activity
on the west and southwest slopes of East Maui and in lowland regions of West Maui. On both East and West Maui, one or more
populations of 

Bonamia menziesii, Diellia erecta, 

and 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

and the only Maui population of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

continue to be threatened by grazing cattle (HHP 1992c13; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The 

Flueggea neowawraea 

population and one of the 

Bonamia menziesii 

populations grow within a fenced exclosure. Although probably minimal, the possibility of cattle entering the exclosure
poses a potential threat. In the Kamaoa-Puueo and South Point regions of the island of Hawaii, cattle continue to graze
in habitat currently occupied by most of the populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

on that island (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). In addition, one population of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

and the only known population of 

Bonamia menziesii 

on that island grow in regions currently used for cattle ranching (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 
Habitat disturbance caused by human activities threatens two of the taxa. On West Maui, all-terrain vehicles have
driven over 

Sesbania tomentosa 

plants growing west of Nakalele Point lighthouse (HHP 1992j43). Continued off-road activity threatens to destroy
a significant portion of that population. On the island of Hawaii, a dirt road runs through a population of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

located in the Kamaoa-Puueo region (HHP 1992j50). Off-road activity could damage a significant portion of that population
as well. In the Puu Anahulu region on that island, a ranch road was bulldozed close to a plant of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

in 1989 (HHP 1992e6). Continued road development threatens to destroy the only known population of that taxon in the
area. 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Overutilization is not known to be a factor, but unrestricted collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes
would seriously impact the six species whose low numbers make them especially vulnerable to disturbances (

Diellia erecta, Hibiscus brackenridgei, Mariscus pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea, Solanum incompletum, 

and 

Vigna o-wahuensis

).

C. Disease and predation. 



Black twig borer (

Xylosandrus compactus

) has been cited as an immediate threat to all extant populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

(J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The black twig borer burrows into the branches and introduces a pathogenic fungus, pruning
the host severely and often killing branches or whole plants (Howarth 1985). All known plants of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

suffer slight to severe defoliation and reduced vigor due to infestations of this alien insect. 

Evidence of predation on two of the taxa by ungulates (cattle, deer, goats) is documented on Oahu, Lanai, and Maui.
On Oahu, plants of 

Bonamia menziesii 

at Lualualei grow over native vegetation and drape well below the browse line of cattle, indicating the potential
for cattle to feed on the plants (HHP 1992b30). On Lanai, axis deer are known to feed on this species, especially at Kanepuu.
Depredation of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

by goats has been observed on Lanai and Maui. Goats are known to eat the branch tips and strip the bark of the plants (HHP
1992e14). While there is no evidence of predation on the other 11 species, none of them are known to be unpalatable to
cattle, deer, or goats. Predation is therefore a probable threat to species growing at sites where those animals have
been reported (

Diellia erecta, Flueggea neowawraea, Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps, Sesbania tomentosa, Spermolepis hawaiiensis,


and 

Vigna o-wahuensis

) (See Factor A.). 



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms 



Of the 12 species in this ruling, a total of 10 have populations located on private land, 2 on County land, 10 on State
land, and 7 on Federal land. With the exception of 

Neraudia sericea 

which is restricted to private land, all of the other species occur in more than one of those ownership categories.
The known populations of these species located on Federal lands are inadequate to ensure their long-term survival.

There are no State laws or existing regulatory mechanisms at the present time to protect or prevent further decline
of these plants on private or State land. However, Federal listing would automatically invoke listing and associated
protection under Hawaii State law. 



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence 



Eleven of the 12 species are threatened by competition with one or more alien plant species. (See Table 2). The most
significant of these appear to be 

Schinus terebinthifolius 

(Christmasberry), 

Psidium cattleianum 

(strawberry guava), 

Melinus minutiflora 

(molasses grass), 

Pennisetum setaceum 

(fountain grass), 

Clidemia hirta 

(Koster's curse), 

Lantana camara 

(lantana), 

Leucaena leucocephala 

(koa haole), 

Prosopis pallida 

(kiawe), 

Toona ciliata 

(Australian red cedar), 

Cenchrus ciliaris 

(buffelgrass), 

Rubus argutus 

(prickly Florida blackberry), 

Passiflora mollissima 

(banana poka), and 

Rubus ellipticus 

(Himalayan raspberry). 

Many noxious alien plants such as Christmasberry have invaded the dry to mesic lowland regions of the Hawaiian Islands.
Introduced to Hawaii before 1911, Christmasberry forms dense thickets that shade out and displace other plants (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990). This fast-growing species is found in lowland areas of the major Hawaiian Islands (Smith 1985) and
is currently expanding its range. Christmasberry is a major component of the mesic forests of the Waianae and Koolau
Mountains of Oahu. For example, over half of the populations of 

Bonamia menziesii

, 2 of the populations of 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

princeps

, and all 15 populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

that occur on Oahu are negatively affected by this invasive plant (HHP 1992b18, 1992b22, 1992b31, 1992d3, 1992d15,
1992d16; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). In addition, one population of 

Diellia erecta 

at Halawa Valley on Molokai and one population of 

Bonamia menziesii 

on Lanai are also affected (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Maui, Christmasberry is spreading in Iao Valley and on the
south slope of East Maui (Haleakala Volcano) and is one of the primary alien plant threats to one or more populations
of 

Bonamia menziesii, Diellia erecta, 

and 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

laxiflora 

that exist there (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On the island of Hawaii, Christmasberry continues to threaten at least
two populations of 

Diellia erecta 

and 

Flueggea neowawraea 

in the regions of Manuka and Honomalino in the South Kona District (HHP 1992d34; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Strawberry guava, an invasive shrub or small tree native to tropical America, has become naturalized on all of the
main Hawaiian islands. Like Christmasberry, strawberry guava is capable of forming dense stands that exclude other
plant species (Cuddihy and Stone 1990) and is dispersed mainly by feral pigs and fruit-eating birds (Smith 1985).
This alien plant grows primarily in mesic and wet habitats and provides food for several alien animal species, including
feral pigs and game birds, which disperse the plant's seeds through the forest (Smith 1985, Wagner 

et al. 

1985). Strawberry guava is considered one of the greatest alien plant threats to Hawaii's rain forests and is known
to pose a direct threat to at least one population of 

Adenophorus periens 

and 

Bonamia menziesii 

on the island of Kauai (HHP 1992a16; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Strawberry guava is a major invader of forests in the
Waianae and Koolau Mountains of Oahu, where it often forms single-species stands. It poses an immediate threat to
6 populations of 

Bonamia menziesii

, 10 populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea

, and 1 population of 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

princeps 

on that island (HHP 1992b5, 1992b14, 1992b18, 1992b21; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Molokai, the habitat of the Halawa
Valley population of 

Diellia erecta 

is currently being invaded by strawberry guava (HHP 1992c12). On Maui, strawberry guava is beginning to invade the
habitat of one population each of 

Bonamia menziesii 

and 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

laxiflora 

on West Maui and at least one population each of 

Diellia erecta 

and 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

laxiflora 

on East Maui (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). It is also a major threat to the habitat of 

Adenophorus periens 

in Kahaualea NAR on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992a8). 

First introduced to the Hawaiian Islands as cattle fodder, molasses grass was later planted for erosion control (Cuddihy
and Stone 1990). This alien grass quickly spread to dry and mesic forests previously disturbed by ungulates. Molasses
grass produces a dense mat capable of smothering plants (Smith 1985), essentially preventing seedling growth and
native plant reproduction (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Because it burns readily and often grows at the border of forests,
molasses grass tends to carry fire into areas with woody native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985). It is able
to spread prolifically after a fire and effectively compete with less fire-adapted native plant species, ultimately
creating a stand of alien grass where forest once stood. Molasses grass is becoming a major threat to seven of the species
on four islands. In the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, three populations of 

Bonamia menziesii 

and one population of 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

princeps 

are immediately threatened by this grass. On Molokai, at least one population each of 

Diellia erecta, Plantago princeps 

var. 

laxiflora

, and 

Neraudia sericea 

and all populations of 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

on the island are also negatively affected. Molasses grass is quickly spreading throughout the dry regions of West
Maui, threatening two populations of 

Diellia erecta 

there. On Hawaii Island, a population of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is located in an area invaded by molasses grass (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Like molasses grass, fountain grass has greatly increased fire risk in some regions, especially on the dry slopes
of Hualalai, Kilauea, and Mauna Loa volcanoes on the island of Hawaii. The effects of fountain grass invasion are similar
to those discussed above for molasses grass. Fountain grass threatens the native vegetation on the leeward slopes
of Hualalai in a region where at least one population of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

and the only known Hawaii Island populations of 

Bonamia menziesii 

and 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

exist (HHP 1992m12; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).

Koster's curse, a noxious shrub native to tropical America, was first reported on Oahu in 1941. It had spread through
much of the Koolau Mountains by the early 1960s, and spread to the Waianae Mountains by 1970 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990).
It poses a serious threat to two populations of 

Plantago princeps 

var. 

longibracteata 

in the Koolau Mountains. Koster's curse is widespread in Honouliuli and threatens two populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

that occur in that area of the Waianae Mountains. This prolific alien plant has recently spread to five other islands,
including Kauai, where there are at least five small infestations totaling about 40 ha (100 ac) (Cuddihy and Stone
1990); one of these poses an immediate threat to one population of 

Adenophorus periens 

in Waioli Valley (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Lantana, a native of the West Indies, became naturalized in dry to mesic forests and shrublands of the Hawaiian Islands
before 1871 (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This shrub often forms thick cover and produces chemicals that inhibit the growth
of other plant species (Smith 1985). On Kauai, lantana is a major component of the vegetation at Paaiki Valley and Waimea
Canyon and is rapidly becoming established in Pohakuao. It poses a threat to populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

in those areas (HHP 1992d13, 1992d17, 1992d18, 1992d30, 1992d31). One population of 

Bonamia menziesii 

on Lanai and one on Maui are also negatively affected by this invasive plant (HHP 1992b1, 1992b24). 

Koa haole, a shrub naturalized and often dominant in low elevation, dry, disturbed areas on all of the main Hawaiian
Islands, threatens to degrade the habitat of six of the species. Koa haole is one of the major weeds found at Polihale
on the island of Kauai, growing in the vicinity of a population of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

(HHP 1992j33; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). In the Waianae Mountains of Oahu, koa haole is one of the primary weed threats
to half of the 

Bonamia menziesii 

populations and all of the 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

mokuleianus 

populations found in the area (HHP 1992b12, 1992b19, 1992e23; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Most of the Molokai populations
of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

and one of the Kahoolawe populations of 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

are also negatively affected by koa haole (HHP 1992j13; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Maui, koa haole poses a threat
to 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

and 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis 

in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, and is probably also a threat to 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

ssp. 

brackenridgei 

and 

Sesbania tomentosa 

elsewhere on West Maui (HHP 1992e3; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Kiawe, a deciduous thorny tree that can grow to 20 m (65 ft) in height, overshadows other plants and competes with associated
vegetation for available water and space. At Polihale, on the island of Kauai, it is the primary alien plant threat
to 

Sesbania tomentosa

. Two Molokai populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

compete with kiawe for water and space on Moomomi's beaches. The primary alien plant threat to 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

on the island of Kahoolawe is kiawe (HHP 1992m21). 

Australian red cedar is a fast-growing tree that was probably introduced to Hawaii for lumber. It is now found in many
of Hawaii's extensively planted lowland forests and has become naturalized in mesic to wet forests (Wagner et al.
1990). Today, this tree is a definite threat to at least one population of 

Bonamia menziesii 

and most of the plants of 

Flueggea neowawraea 

in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Buffelgrass forms continuous cover in dry habitats and provides excellent fuel for fire, from which it recovers quickly.
Its seeds are easily dispersed by wind (Smith 1985). Buffelgrass threatens the habitat of two populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa 

on Molokai, and at least one population of 

Vigna o-wahuensis 

on Kahoolawe (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Prickly Florida blackberry was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in the late 1800s (Haselwood and Motter 1983).
The fruits are easily spread by birds to open areas where this plant can form dense, impenetrable thickets (Smith 1985).
The Kauai population of 

Adenophorus periens

, which is located at the boundary of Hono O Na Pali NAR and Na Pali Coast State Park, is threatened by this noxious weed
(J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).

A vine in the passionflower family, banana poka was introduced to the islands in the 1920s, probably as an ornamental.
This vine is extremely detrimental to certain wet forest habitats of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. Heavy growth of this
vine can cause damage or death to the native trees by overloading branches, causing breakage, or by forming a dense
canopy cover, intercepting sunlight and shading out native plants below. An infestation of this vine is located at
Olaa Tract on the island of Hawaii, the site of one population of 

Adenophorus periens

 (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).
A recent introduction to the Hawaiian Islands, yellow Himalayan raspberry is rapidly becoming a major weed pest in
wet forests, pastures, and other open areas on the island of Hawaii. It forms large thorny thickets and displaces native
plants. Its ability to invade the understory of wet forests enables it to fill a niche presently unoccupied by any other
major wet forest weed in Hawaii. This has resulted in an extremely rapid population expansion of this alien plant in
recent years. One population of 

Adenophorus periens

 grows in Olaa Tract within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in a region where yellow Himalayan raspberry is found in
increasing numbers (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992).
There are a number of other alien plant species that pose a significant threat to populations of the plants in this ruling.


Cynodon dactylon

 (Bermuda grass) is a major threat to at least one population of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 at Moomomi on Molokai. 

Senecio mikanioides

 (German ivy), a noxious, wind-dispersed vine that forms localized mats of vegetation, is a threat to the only currently
known population of 

Solanum incompletum

 on the island of Hawaii (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). This 

Solanum incompletum

 population is fenced and protected from ungulates; however, it is not protected from German ivy. 

Syzygium cumini

 (Java plum), a large evergreen tree, is an aggressive invader of undisturbed forests (Smith 1985). It threatens to
shade out the only known populations of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 ssp. 

mokuleianus

 on Oahu (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). 

Melia azedarach

 (pride of India), a fast-growing deciduous tree that forms deep shade, grows in open dry habitats. A major infestation
of this large tree in Waimea Canyon on Kauai poses an immediate threat to individuals of 

Flueggea neowawraea

 (HHP 1992d18, 1992d31).
Fire threatens six plant species growing in dry to mesic grassland, shrubland, and forests on five islands. On Oahu,
fire is a potential threat to three populations of 

Bonamia menziesii

 and two populations of 

Flueggea neowawraea

 located adjacent to Makua Military Reservation, where current ordnance training exercises could unintentionally
ignite fires (HHP 1992b12, 1992b19, 1992b20, 1992d12; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The area has had a history of fires
that may have burned through at least one of the populations of 

Bonamia menziesii,

 and burned to within a few tens of meters of another (HHP 1992b19, 1992b20). Fire is also a threat to the following populations:
one population each of 

Bonamia menziesii

 and 

Flueggea neowawraea

 on Oahu, one population of 

Bonamia menziesii

 on Lanai, two populations of 

Sesbania tomentosa

 and one population of 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 on Molokai, all known populations of 

Vigna o-wahuensis

 on Kahoolawe, and at least one population each of 

Bonamia menziesii

 and 

Sesbania tomentosa

 on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992d12; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Of note is a population of 

Adenophorus periens

 in Kahaualea NAR on the island of Hawaii (HHP 1992a8). Tephra fallout and lava flows from Kilauea Volcano have affected
the NAR over the past several years. Wildfires ignited by volcanic activity have destroyed some of the NAR's mesic
and wet forests. In addition, tephra fallout and noxious volcanic gasses have caused extensive damage to surrounding
native forests. Such catastrophic natural events threaten to destroy the region's largest population of 

Adenophorus periens.

The small number of populations and of individual plants of six of these species (

Diellia erecta, Hibiscus brackenridgei, Mariscus pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea, Solanum incompletum,

 and 

Vigna o-wahuensis

) increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive
vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of
the individuals or the only known extant population. For example, 

Solanum incompletum

 is known from a single population on the island of Hawaii and numbers only two individuals. Two of the species have fewer
than 5 populations and 6 of the species are estimated to number no more than 100 individuals (See Table 2). All of the
species in this ruling except 

Sesbania tomentosa

 either number fewer than 20 populations or total fewer than 200 individuals. The reproductive system of 

Flueggia neowawraea

 further exacerbates the problem of limited numbers. Since each tree bears only male or female flowers, they must be
cross-pollinated from a different tree (Hayden 1990). If only a few trees flower at the same time, or if flowering trees
are too widely separated for pollination by insects, no seed will be set. The survival of small, isolated populations,
which probably are already experiencing depressed reproductive vigor, is therefore further threatened.
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
this rulemaking will list these 12 species as endangered: 

Adenophorus periens, Bonamia menziesii, Diellia erecta, Flueggea neowawraea, Hibiscus brackenridgei, Mariscus
pennatiformis, Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps, Sesbania tomentosa, Solanum incompletum, Spermolepis hawaiiensis,

 and 

Vigna o-wahuensis.

 These 12 species are threatened by one or more of the following: habitat degradation and/or predation by pigs, goats,
deer, and cattle; competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by alien plants; habitat loss from fires; human
impacts from recreational activities; and insect infestations. Six of the 12 species either number no more than about
100 individuals or are known from fewer than 5 populations. Small population size and limited distribution make all
of these species particularly vulnerable to extinction from reduced reproductive vigor or from stochastic events.
Because these 12 species are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they
fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. Therefore, the determination of endangered status for these
12 species is warranted.
Critical habitat is not being proposed for the 12 species included in this rule, for reasons discussed in the ``Critical
Habitat'' section of this rule.

Critical Habitat



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the species are determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds
that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these species. Such a determination would result
in no known benefit to the species. The species have low total populations and/or numbers of individuals and face anthropogenic
threats. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the 

Federal Register

, as required for the designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take
or vandalism and could contribute to their decline. The listing of these species under the Act publicizes the rarity
of the plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare
plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified. Protection of the habitat of the species
will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service
finds that designation of critical habitat for these species is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of these species. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Listing can encourage and result in conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, and private organizations
and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State
and requires that recovery plans be developed for listed species. The requirements for Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation
with the Service.

Two taxa are located on Federal land in a national wildlife refuge on three Northwestern Hawaiian Islands: 

Mariscus pennatiformis

 ssp. 

bryanii

 grows only on the island of Laysan and 

Sesbania tomentosa

 grows on Necker and Nihoa. The national wildlife refuge is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
On the island of Hawaii, two species (

Adenophorus periens

 and 

Sesbania tomentosa

) are located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Three populations of 

Plantago princeps

 var. 

laxiflora

 are located in Haleakala National Park on Maui. The two national parks on Maui and Hawaii are under the jurisdiction
of the National Park Service. Federal laws protect all plants on the national wildlife refuges, national parks, and
national historic sites from damage or removal. 

Five of the species in this rule occur on land owned or leased by the U.S. Department of Defense. Populations of 

Bonamia menziesii

 and 

Flueggea neowawraea

 are located in the mountains of the Lualualei Naval Reservation. No military activities currently affect those populations.
On the island of Oahu, 

Flueggea neowawraea

 is known to grow on lands owned by the U.S. Army in Schofield Barracks Military Reservation. One population of 

Hibiscus brackenridgei

 ssp. 

mokuleianus

 may possibly occur at Schofield Barracks as well. Three of the species are located on State-owned land currently leased
to the U.S. military: On Oahu, 

Bonamia menziesii

 and 

Flueggea neowawraea

 are located within Makua Military Reservation and 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis

 is located in Diamond Head Reservation, leased by the Department of Defense. Portions of Makua Military Reservation
are used by the Army and other branches of the military for ordnance training. The two species are not located inside
the impact areas or adjacent buffer zones and, thus, are not directly affected by military activities. The Army has
constructed firebreaks on the Makua Military Reservation to minimize damage from unintentional fires that occasionally
result from the use of ordnance (Herve Messier, U.S. Army, Ft. Shafter, pers. comm., 1990). Plants of 

Spermolepis hawaiiensis

 are restricted to the outer slope of Diamond Head and are not in an area affected by military activities. One species,


Vigna o-wahuensis,

 grows on the previously federally owned island of Kahoolawe where the Federal government is involved with ordnance
disposal. Although periodic detonation of ordnance is required on the island, the populations of this species found
there are at sites too remote to sustain impacts from such detonation (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). There are no other
known Federal activities that occur within the presently known habitat of these 12 plant species.

The Act and implementing regulations at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions and
exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the 12 plant species subject to this final rule,
all prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 apply. These prohibitions, in part, make
it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any endangered plant
species to/from the United States; transport such species in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial
activity; sell or offer for sale such species in interstate or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any
such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any such species on any area under
Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing violation
of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions
apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Section 10 of the Act and 50 CFR 17.62 provide for the
issuance of permits under certain circumstances to carry out activities involving endangered plants that are otherwise
prohibited by section 9. 
It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed
those activities that would or would not be likely to constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. Such information
is intended to clarify the potential impacts of a species' listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the species'
range. Seven of the twelve species in this rule are known to occur on lands under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, National Park Service or Department of Defense. Collection, damage or destruction of these species on these
lands is prohibited without a Federal endangered species permit. Such activities on non-Federal lands would constitute
a violation of section 9 if conducted in knowing violation of Hawaii State law or regulations or in violation of State
criminal trespass law (see Hawaii State Law section below). 
Two of the listed species are of horticultural interest and both are currently in commercial trade. 

Hibiscus brackenridgei 

is a very attractive member of a genus known for its immense horticultural popularity and is the official State flower
of Hawaii. 

Sesbania tomentosa 

also is an exceptionally attractive species that grows well in low elevation urban areas. Intrastate commerce (commerce
within a State) is not prohibited under the Act. However, interstate and foreign commerce (sale or offering for sale
across State or international boundaries), will require a Federal endangered species permit. (Endangered species
may be advertised for sale provided the advertisement contains a statement that no sale may be consummated until a
permit has been obtained from the Service.) Other than possible interstate commerce, the Service is not aware of any
other activities being conducted by the public that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation of section
9. Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to
the Field Supervisor of the Service's Pacific Islands Office (see 

ADDRESSES 

section). Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and general inquiries regarding prohibitions
and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,
911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232-4181 (503/231-2063; FAX 503/231-6243). 



Hawaii State Law 


Federal listing would automatically invoke listing under Hawaii State law. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS,
Sect. 195D-4(a)) states, ``Any species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been determined to
be an endangered species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species
under the provisions of this chapter and any indigenous species of aquatic life, wildlife, or land plant that has been
determined to be a threatened species pursuant to the [Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be a threatened
species under the provisions of this chapter.'' The State law prohibits cutting, collecting, uprooting, destroying,
injuring, or possessing any listed species of plant, or attempting to engage in any such conduct. The State law also
encourages conservation by State agencies and triggers other State regulations to protect the species (HRS, sect.
195-4 and 5). The State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area required
for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, Sect. 195D-5(c)).



National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 

 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule makes several changes in the interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Public and
Indian Housing. It responds to the public comments received on the interim rule that was published September 20, 1991,
incorporating a few substantive modifications, as well as some clarifications and editorial revisions. 




This rule provides separate regulatory codifications of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for public housing
and for Indian housing, as appropriate for each. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), the rule consists of subpart
P of the Consolidated Program Regulations for Indian Housing (24 CFR Part 905); for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs),
24 CFR Part 906. The language of these two versions is identical, excepting only appropriate distinctions in terminology
and phrasing, and in references to applicable Federal statutes and regulations on nondiscrimination and civil rights.
In general, the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program works the same way for both PHAs and IHAs.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
 Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 

 

The information collection requirements contained in this rule were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) and have been approved under
control number 2577-0201. 

 

Public Comments 

 

The interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Public and Indian Housing was published September
20, 1991 (56 FR 47852), with an effective date of October 21, 1991. 


 Comments were received from 10 commenters, including six Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), one national association
of PHAs, two legal services organizations, and one private consultant. All comments have been considered, as indicated
by the discussion below. 


 Because the texts of the IHA rule (Part 905, subpart P) and the PHA rule (Part 906) follow a parallel format, with provisions
that are substantially the same, the following discussion applies to both, except where noted. In most instances,
dual section references are cited, with the section of the IHA regulation followed by the corresponding section of
the PHA regulation, e.g.,   905.1001/906.1 through 905.1021/906.21. Except where differences in the
IHA and PHA versions are indicated, the term ``Housing Authority (HA)'' is used in the following discussion as a common
term of reference to both PHAs and IHAs.

In General: The Flexibility Issue 




The extent to which the regulation should allow flexibility for Housing Authorities (HAs) and residents in the design
of their local homeownership plans was the subject of greatest concern to the commenters. While a number of comments
addressed this issue in the context of specific provisions of the regulation, as discussed below, some urged that
the regulation as a whole afford the maximum flexibility permitted by the statute, pointing out that the statutory
authorities for this program_Sections 5(h) and 6(c)(4)(D) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act)_are clearly
intended to authorize a high degree of local discretion. Some other commenters, however, argued for a more restrictive
approach, suggesting that local discretion be curtailed and regulatory requirements be more rigidly detailed.



 The changes that are incorporated in the final rule move in the direction of more local flexibility, as explained in
the section-by-section analysis below. The overall approach is deliberately brief and simple, limited to a basic
regulatory framework of essential standards and procedures. No attempt is made to specify the details of everything
that might possibly be required or permitted in all the variety of local situations. Anything not specifically prohibited
is permissible, if consistent with the three fundamental criteria stated in   905.1004/906.4. 


 The Department intends to develop additional handbook materials to provide appropriate guidance and administrative
instructions for HAs, residents, and HUD Field Offices concerning the development, processing and implementation
of Section 5(h) homeownership plans. 


 

Comments on Specific Sections 

 

Sections 905.1002/906.2 (Applicability) 

 

In paragraph (a) of   905.1002/906.2 (

Applicability

), the final rule adds clarifying language to explain that, except where otherwise indicated by the context, the term
``resident'' includes Turnkey III homebuyers (and, in the IHA version, Mutual Help homebuyers as well), along with
rental tenants of public or Indian housing and Section 8 residents. As suggested by one commenter, language has been
added to make it clear that, unless otherwise indicated, references to sale, purchase, conveyance and ownership
include the types of transactions and interests that are incident to cooperative ownership, such as cooperative
shares, membership, and occupancy agreements. 


 As another point of clarification, paragraph (b) of this section adds an express declaration of nonretroactivity.
This responds to one commenter's question about whether a Section 5(h) homeownership plan approved under the statutory
authority, prior to publication of the interim rule, would have to be modified to conform to the requirements of the
interim rule. Neither the interim nor final rule imposes any additional requirements for homeownership plans approved
before the respective effective dates of each rule. 

 

Sections 905.1003/906.3 (General Authority for Sale) 

 

With regard to   905.1003/906.3 (

General authority for sale

), one commenter observed that HUD Field Offices need instructions on how to release the declaration of trust upon
sale of housing units under a HUD-approved Section 5(h) homeownership plan. The Department agrees that such instructions
are needed, and intends to provide them in the forthcoming processing handbook. In the IHA version of this section,
the language of the interim rule concerning housing developments that are subject to project debt under the ACC has
been deleted, because, as a result of loan forgiveness legislation, there are now no Indian housing developments
which are subject to such indebtedness. 

 

Sections 905.1004/906.4 (Fundamental Criteria for HUD Approval) 

 

One commenter urged that resident consultation be added to   905.1004/906.4 (

Fundamental criteria for HUD approval

) as a fourth criterion. The final rule does not adopt this recommendation. The three fundamental criteria that are
established by this section merit special emphasis at the outset, because they go to the plan as a whole, serving as
touchstones for weighing and linking the discrete requirements of all subsequent sections, including the specific
requirements for resident consultation under   905.1005/906.5. 

 

Sections 905.1005/906.5 (Resident Consultation and Involvement) 

 

Sections 905.1005/906.5 (

Resident consultation and involvement

) have been revised to clarify the requirements for resident input at the initial planning stage, in connection with
the HA's development of its proposed homeownership plan for submission to HUD. This language responds to the observations
of several commenters who aptly pointed out that the interim rule failed to indicate who must be consulted when the
development is vacant. The final rule addresses this question by specifying that, where the plan involves an entirely
vacant development, the HA must consult with the HA-wide resident organization, if any.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One commenter argued that no resident consultation at all should be required for newly-developed vacant units, but
the Department sees no justification for exempting such units from the requirement that pertains to vacant units
in general. 

As a further provision in the direction of more local flexibility, the final rule deletes the interim rule's requirement
for a public hearing, leaving it to the HA and the residents to work out methods of consultation that they find most appropriate
and productive. While a public hearing may be advisable for larger undertakings, relatively informal consultation
may be more appropriate in other situations.

One commenter mistakenly asserted that ``there is no mention of resident involvement prior to implementation''.
On the contrary, the interim rule strongly emphasized the requirement for resident input during the planning stage,
and that requirement remains unchanged in the final rule. 



Sections 905.1006/906.6 (Property That May Be Sold)



In paragraph (a) of   905.1006/906.6 (

Property that may be sold

), the final rule corrects the interim rule's unintended indication that only conventional rental units would be
eligible for sale under the Section 5(h) Program. The final rule notes that a homeownership plan may provide for converting
Turnkey III homes (and, in the case of an IHA, Mutual Help homes as well) to Section 5(h) homeownership, subject to the
contractual rights of existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers, and an appropriate ACC amendment. An HA might
thus afford existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers the option to terminate their Turnkey III or Mutual Help
homebuyer agreements in favor of Section 5(h) purchase of their present homes, or might make vacant Turnkey III or
Mutual Help units available for purchase under the terms of a Section 5(h) plan.

One of the public comments asked whether the regulation applies to newly-constructed housing. The answer is yes,
as expressly stated in the interim rule and restated in the final rule at paragraph (a) of   905.1006/906.6.
As a clarification, however, the final rule adds a cautionary note regarding a question that may arise in rare situations
where the HA wants to consider Section 5(h) sale of units developed as replacement housing for public or Indian housing
demolished or disposed of under the regulations implementing section 18 of the Act (for IHAs, subpart M of 24 CFR part
905; for PHAs, 24 CFR part 970). This calls attention to the fact that the demolition-disposition regulations require
selection of the initial occupants of such replacement units solely on the basis of the requirements governing rental
occupancy (or, in the case of replacement of Indian housing with new Mutual Help units, the homebuyer occupancy requirements
of the Mutual Help Program).

Paragraph (b) of these sections amplifies the provisions concerning the physical condition of the property, adding
the Section 8 housing quality standards as an alternative measure for cases where no local code exists, along with
a cross-reference to the regulatory requirements for accessibility by purchasers with disabilities. One commenter
objected to the option for post-conveyance repair. The Department believes that this option should be retained,
subject to the kind of protections for the homebuyer that are stipulated, including the final rule's addition of a
maximum period of two years for completion of the work needed to satisfy the regulatory standard. As a further clarification,
the option for a sound sweat equity arrangement has been added as another example of permissible means for making post-sale
improvements.



Sections 905.1007/906.7 (Methods of Sale and Ownership)



In   905.1007/906.7 (

Methods of sale and ownership

), language has been inserted in subparagraph (b)(2)(ii) to make it clear that, in the context of sale of a multifamily
building or a group of single-family dwellings via a resident-controlled entity, the prohibition against encumbrances
applies only to encumbrances by the resident entity, prior to conveyance of individual units to residents. Thus,
it would not be necessary to obtain additional HA consent for mortgages or other encumbrances that are incident to
the purchase and financing of individual units, pursuant to the provisions of the homeownership plan and the agreement
between the HA and the resident-controlled entity.

Several changes have been made in   905.1008/906.8 (

Purchaser eligibility and selection

). In response to comments, the final rule allows HAs more flexibility concerning how they may wish to formulate the
particulars of the eligibility and preference provisions of their homeownership plans. It also incorporates a number
of clarifications and editorial revisions, including reordering the paragraphs in a more logical sequence.

In paragraph (b) of these sections, language has been inserted to make it clear that Turnkey III homebuyers (and, in
the case of IHAs, Mutual Help homebuyers as well) are within the overall class of public or Indian housing residents
who are eligible to purchase under the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program, should they elect to terminate their existing
homebuyer agreements in favor of purchase under a Section 5(h) plan. A homeownership plan might thus allow Turnkey
III or Mutual Help homebuyers the individual option to switch over to Section 5(h) purchase of their present homes.
As another possibility, a plan might allow such a homebuyer to vacate the present Turnkey III or Mutual Help unit and
purchase a vacant unit that is offered for sale under the Section 5(h) plan.

One comment objected to the option to include Section 8 residents. The Department believes that the statute was intended
to allow that option, at HA discretion, subject to the minimum residency requirement and the requirements for admission
to public or Indian housing. 

One commenter objected to the 30-day minimum residency requirement, while another suggested that a minimum one-year
period be prescribed. Because Section 5(h) of the Act authorizes an HA to sell to ``its tenants'', some initial period
of public or Indian housing or Section 8 residency is a statutory precondition for purchaser eligibility, and the
Department believes that 30 days is the shortest period that satisfies the statute. Each HA is, however, free to include
in its homeownership plan a longer minimum period for such tenure. 

One objection was expressed about the further option (as now reflected in paragraph (c) of these sections) for the
HA to extend eligibility to applicants who are not public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents at the time of application,
subject to the preference for existing public and Indian housing residents and the requirement for a minimum period
of public or Indian housing residency prior to conveyance. The Department believes that the HA should have this option
to extend eligibility to families on its waiting lists, or to other low-income families who may wish to apply, or to
both of those categories, if the HA considers that they are needed to make up a sufficient pool of eligible applicants
for purchase of the vacant units that will be offered for sale. Such nonresident applicants would also be subject to
the requirements for admission to public or Indian housing, including the income limits and Federal preferences
for admission, as prescribed by applicable regulations. (Those admission requirements do not, however, apply to
applicants who are already residents of public or Indian housing.)

The first sentence of   905.1008(d)/906.8(d) modifies the interim rule's provision restricting eligibility
to applicants who have been current in their lease obligations for a period of at least six months. If a family has been
in residence for less than six months, the homeownership plan may now allow eligibility on the basis of lease compliance
for that lesser period. The final rule also adds language that is appropriate in this context to existing Turnkey III
or Mutual Help homebuyers who may elect to terminate their present Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyer agreements
in favor of purchase under a Section 5(h) homeownership plan. 
In response to several comments, the affordability standard of   905.1008(e)/906.8(e) has been modified.
In the interim rule, the cost-to-income ratio_based on mortgage principal and interest, plus insurance and real
estate taxes (PITI)_was 30 percent, but a percentage figure of 35 percent was allowed with special justification.
As aptly pointed out by some commenters, the interim rule did not say what was required to justify the 35 percent exception
ratio or how maintenance, utilities and (if applicable) common ownership fees were to be taken into account. The final
rule's revised formula now states that the average monthly estimate for the total amount of all of the stated types
of homeownership costs_including maintenance and utilities and (if applicable) cooperative, condominium or homeownership
association fees, as well as PITI_may not exceed 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income. 
One commenter urged that separate affordability standards be adopted for single-family and multifamily properties,
with the latter to take into account cooperative or condominium carrying charges, as well as debt service payments
on individual mortgages or share loans. For single-family houses, this commenter recommended that a PITI cost-to-income
ratio of more than 35 percent be authorized, citing the fact that, in the general housing market, the current ratio
among first-time homebuyers tends to be higher. For multifamily properties, a two-part affordability standard
was recommended: (1) the ability of homebuyers to meet their financial obligations on an individual family basis;
and (2) the ability of the homebuyers involved to meet their financial obligations on an aggregated basis. 
Because the prospective purchasers under the Section 5(h) Program are low-income families, the Department believes
that it would be imprudent to allow a cost-income ratio of more than 35 percent for either single-family or multifamily
housing. The final rule requires that, if applicable, cooperative, condominium or other homeownership association
fees must be taken into account. This is sufficient to address the financial viability of multifamily properties
on both an individual and aggregated basis. 
Paragraph (g) of these sections simplifies the requirements concerning preference among the various residency-based
categories of potentially eligible applicants. This affords each HA broad discretion in defining, on the basis of
present residency status, which categories of residents are eligible to apply under the particular homeownership
plan, and in establishing preferences among those categories. 
For occupied units, the rule continues to require a preference for the existing occupants. If such occupants cannot
meet the other eligibility requirements, or do not desire to purchase their units, a further provision of the rule
(  905.1010/906.10) prohibits their involuntary displacement to make the units available for sale
to other families. Consequently, the question of other residency-based eligibility and preference categories
is pertinent only if the homeownership plan contemplates sale of vacant units, or if an existing occupant voluntarily
agrees to vacate and relocate, pursuant to   905.1010/906.10. 
For vacant units, the only residency-based preference category that is mandated by the final rule consists of residents
of the HA's other public or Indian housing units. The HA may limit eligibility to applicants in that category only,
in which case the question of further residency-based eligibility or preference categories will not arise. 
Alternatively, subject to the preference for families who are already residents of public or Indian housing, the
homeownership plan may, at the option of an HA, also allow application for purchase of vacant units by families in either
or both of the other residency-based categories permitted under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section: (1) Section
8 residents, and (2) other low-income families who are neither public or Indian housing nor Section 8 residents at
time of application or selection, subject to their completion of the prescribed minimum period of public or Indian
housing or Section 8 residence prior to conveyance. For example, families in the second category_families who are
not presently public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents_would have to take occupancy of the Section 5(h) unit
under a lease-purchase agreement, providing for completion of an initial period of public or Indian housing tenancy
(30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan) prior to conveyance. 
As noted in   905.1008(h)/906.8(i), the rule does not preclude any other types of eligibility and preference
factors that the HA may wish to establish in its homeownership plan, if consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements.
For example, in a situation where vacant units comprising only a portion of an otherwise occupied development are
to be offered for sale, the homeownership plan could limit eligibility to the other residents of the same development,
or give them preference over the residents of other HA developments. As another example, with reference to families
that are not already public or Indian housing or Section 8 residents, the HA would have the option to restrict eligibility
to families who are already on the HA's waiting lists for other programs, or to give such waiting list families a preference
over other nonresident applicants.

One question was raised about  906.8(h) of the PHA rule, which mandates a preference for residents who have completed
self-sufficiency and job training programs. (There is no parallel provision in the IHA rule). The commenter asked
whether a resident who completes such a program in one PHA may qualify for the preference under another PHA's Section
5(h) homeownership plan. That is a matter for local determination. In general, a plan should allow for recognition
of sound self-sufficiency and job training programs, regardless of where completed, but the regulation leaves each
HA discretion to define the standards for acceptability. 


Sections 905.1009/906.9 (Counseling, Training, and Technical Assistance) 


One commenter recommended that HUD set minimum standards for counseling, in connection with the requirements of
  905.1009/906.9 (

Counseling, training, and technical assistance

). 
Detailed regulatory requirements on this subject would be inappropriate for the wide variety of local situations
that may be presented by particular Section 5(h) homeownership plans. While the rule establishes basic standards,
it is intended to allow due flexibility for HAs to design the kinds of counseling, training and technical assistance
activities that are necessary and appropriate for each local situation. 



Sections 905.1010/906.10 (Nonpurchasing Residents) 


Two commenters recommended that   905.1010/906.10 (

Nonpurchasing residents

) be changed to delete the prohibition against involuntary displacement of nonpurchasing residents. The final rule
retains that prohibition. Another commenter urged that assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and
Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970 (URA) be extended to residents who relocate voluntarily. The final rule does
not adopt that recommendation. The rule mandates that nonpurchasing residents be provided the opportunity to relocate
to another suitable and affordable unit, with counseling and advisory services, along with payment of moving expenses.
However, it is noted that the rule also provides that a violation of the prohibition against involuntary displacement
may trigger a requirement that the HA provide URA relocation assistance. 
Some changes have nevertheless been made in this section, largely editorial revisions to clarify the requirements
that were reflected in the interim rule. In paragraph (b) of the PHA version only, familial status has been added to
the list of nondiscrimination factors. (The IHA version covers nondiscrimination by cross-reference to  905.115.)
In both the IHA and PHA versions, a new paragraph (c) has been added to clarify requirements for temporary relocation
of nonpurchasing residents in connection with repair or rehabilitation. 
This prohibition applies only against displacement for the specific purpose of making the unit available for Section
5(h) sale to another family. It is not intended to prohibit a permanent move for any other reason required or authorized
by the existing occupant's lease (or homebuyer agreement), consistent with applicable statutes and HUD occupancy
regulations. For example, where the size of the unit in relation to family size results in overhousing or underhousing,
a family may be required to move to another unit of suitable size, pursuant to the HA's assignment policy. 


Sections 905.1011/906.11 (Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve) 


In   905.1011/906.11 (

Nonroutine maintenance reserve

), the interim rule's references to ``maintenance reserve'' have been changed to ``nonroutine maintenance''. This
clarifying change was prompted by the suggestion of one commenter that the term ``capital improvement and replacement
reserve'' be used. Two other commenters objected to this section entirely as an undue restriction on local discretion.
The Department believes that, considering the flexibility allowed, this reserve requirement is justified by the
financial viability test that is implicit in Section 5(h) of the Act, and expressly stated in Sec. 6(c)(4)(D) of the
Act. 


Sections 905.1014/906.14 (Limitation on Resale Profit) 


One commenter pointed out that the last sentence of paragraph (a) of   905.1014/906.14 (

Limitation on resale profit

) seemed to contradict the authorization for limited equity or shared equity arrangements. In the final rule, this
sentence has been revised to make it clear that, under a limited or shared equity arrangement, the resale provisions
may limit the seller to a portion of the resale profit attributable to appreciation in value. Language to similar effect
has also been inserted in the limited equity option under paragraph (c) of this section. 
Another commenter urged that the regulation be modified to require or strongly encourage restriction of resale to
low-income families only. The final rule does not adopt this recommendation. Although the regulation allows HA discretion
to design limited equity arrangements with such resale restrictions, the statute does not authorize the Department
to mandate that for all cases. 


Sections 905.1016/906.16 (Replacement Housing) 


With regard to   905.1016/906.16 (

Replacement housing

), one commenter objected to the inclusion of replacement options other than development of additional public or
Indian housing units. As an alternative to such a narrow restriction, the commenter suggested that the options included
in the interim rule be given priority in the order listed. Other commenters objected to the options for rehabilitation
of vacant public or Indian housing units and for use of Section 8 certificates and vouchers. 
The final rule makes no change in the replacement options stated in the interim rule. Those options are statutory,
and the Department has no authority to change them by regulation.

Two commenters addressed the question of funding for replacement housing. One recommended that such funding be built
into the Section 5(h) Program itself, while another suggested a priority for Major Rehabilitation of Obsolete Projects
(MROP) funding. The Department has not adopted those recommendations. Although special funding priorities for
replacement housing in connection with Section 5(h) homeownership plans may be established in the contexts of the
other HUD programs from which the funding becomes available, no provision for such funding is incorporated in the
Section 5(h) Homeownership Program itself.

One commenter recommended that the regulation set a time limit on the actual provision of replacement housing. In
recognition of the different factual situations that may affect the time required to have replacement units ready
for occupancy, the Department believes that it would be unwise to set a rigid time limitation by regulation. However,
reasonable time frames for this and all other major steps must be established in the timetable to be included in the
homeownership plan.

The same commenter argued against the flexibility afforded by the interim rule for the HA to address the community's
current priority housing needs, urging that the regulation impose a rigid requirement to replace with units of the
same sizes as those sold, regardless of current needs. The Department believes that such rigidity would risk absurd
results, in those local situations where identical replacement would be at odds with intelligent prioritization
by the HA of the community's current housing needs. One commenter urged that the replacement housing requirements
be applied retroactively to plans approved or pending before publication of the interim rule. That point is addressed
in paragraph (d) of this section, which, as in the interim rule, reflects the legislative mandate in Section 5(h) of
the Act that the replacement housing provisions shall not apply to ``applications'' (proposed homeownership plans)
that were submitted to HUD prior to October 1, 1990_the effective date of the legislation that added the replacement
requirement to Section 5(h).



Section 906.17 (Records, Reports and Audits)



In  906.17 of the PHA rule only (

Records, reports and audits

), language has been added to specify that, as evidence of compliance with fair housing and equal opportunity requirements,
the sale and financial records maintained in the files of the PHA must contain information on the racial and ethnic
characteristics of purchasers. (No such requirement applies to Indian housing.)



Sections 905.1018/906.18 (Submission and Review of Homeownership Plan)



In paragraph (b) of   905.1018/906.18 (

Submission and review of homeownership plan

), the phrase, ``in a format prescribed by HUD,'' has been inserted. While allowing for due flexibility, HUD will issue
administrative instructions and guidelines regarding the format and processing of homeownership plans.



Sections 905.1020/906.20 (Content of Homeownership Plan)



In   905.1020/906.20 (

Content of homeownership plan

), the order of some items has been changed, for a more logical sequence that places administrative items after those
that describe the principal provisions of the plan. In the PHA rule only, a provision on affirmative marketing (applicable
only if the plan allows purchase of vacant units by families who are not public housing residents or already on the PHA's
waiting lists for those programs) has been added to paragraph  906.20(c). (There is no affirmative marketing
requirement for IHAs.)



Sections 905.1021/906.21 (Supporting Documentation)



In paragraph (a) of   905.1021/906.21 (

Supporting documentation

), the final rule explains that the purpose of the property value estimate is merely to assist HUD in determining whether
the plan adequately addresses the risks of fraud and abuse and the potential for windfall profit. For this item of supporting
documentation, a rough estimate is sufficient, backed by information to support its reasonableness. Submission
of a formal appraisal is not required at this point, because the Department does not believe that such an expense is
justified for the purpose of HUD review of the proposed homeownership plan. (Note, however, that this is a matter involving
only the initial process of preparation and review of the HA's proposal. It is not intended to contradict the rule's
separate requirement, in   905.1014(e)/906.14(e), for the appraisal of individual dwelling units
at the point of sale, made with the distinct purpose of calculating the amount of resale profit that would be payable
to the PHA by the individual purchaser.)



Section 906.21(f) (Nondiscrimination Certification)



In the PHA rule only, language has been inserted in  906.21(f)_the requirement for the PHA's nondiscrimination
certification_to add citations to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11063, and implementing
regulations. (The parallel provision of the IHA rule ( 905.1021(f)) remains unchanged, citing the different
nondiscrimination requirements that apply to Indian housing under  905.115.)



Comments on Other Issues



One commenter observed that the interim rule contained no explicit mention as to whether the Section 5(h) authority
can be used in conjunction with other public housing homeownership programs, such as HOPE. Such questions will be
addressed in the context of the other programs involved, on a case-by-case basis.

It was also observed that the interim rule contained no explicit mention of whether Section 5(h) can be used in conjunction
with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). The Department believes that this is not an appropriate matter for
rulemaking at this time. The Department has not received any Section 5(h) proposals involving LIHTCs, and no determination
has been made as to whether it would be possible to design a feasible proposal of that nature. If warranted by future
experience, the Department will consider this question for further rulemaking.

One commenter recommended that the rule incorporate a specific list of all statutes and regulations that must be complied
with. A list of all of the multitude of Federal statutes and regulations that might possibly be applicable to all of
the variety of possible features of all of the many possible types of homeownership plans would be excessively lengthy
for inclusion in a regulation. While cross-references are cited for some especially important Federal requirements_notably,
as to fair housing and nondiscrimination_the possible variations among local homeownership plans make it impossible
to present a standard matrix of applicable legal requirements. As emphasized in the requirement for the HA to include
in its supporting documentation a legal opinion from its own counsel (  905.1021(g)/906.21(g)), it
is the responsibility of the HA to ascertain for itself just what requirements of Federal, State, Tribal and local
law are pertinent to the facts of each particular homeownership plan. Compliance with State, Tribal and local laws
and regulations on real estate transactions is one of the critical points that must be carefully reviewed by the HA's
counsel.

Environmental Review



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. This finding
is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,
Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW.,
Washington, DC 20410.



Regulatory Planning and Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866, 

Regulatory Planning and Review.

 Any changes to the rule resulting from this review are available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, DC.



Impact on Small Entities



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule creates homeownership opportunities for low-income residents of public and Indian
housing with, at most, an incidental effect on small businesses.



Executive Order 12606, the Family



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
rule would not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and therefore
is not subject to review under the order. The rule would have an indirect, though positive, impact on families to the
extent that it would provide opportunities for families residing in public and Indian housing to own their own homes.



Executive Order 12612, Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this rule would not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their
relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and
other levels of government. The rule's major effects would be on individuals; any involvement of States or their political
subdivisions is limited to their cooperative efforts in promoting homeownership among public and Indian housing
residents.

This rule was listed as Item No. 1695 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994,
(59 FR 20424, 20472) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 14.146 and 14.147.

Subpart P_Section 5(h) Homeownership Program 



 905.1001 

Purpose. 



This part codifies the provisions of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Indian housing, as authorized by
sections 5(h) and 6(c)(4)(D) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act) and administered by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). 



 905.1002 

Applicability. 



(a) 

General applicability. 

This subpart applies to low-income housing owned by Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), subject to Annual Contributions
Contracts (ACCs) under the Act. The terms ``housing'' or ``low-income housing'', as used in this subpart, refer to
the types of properties described in the preceding sentence, except as indicated by the particular context. In reference
to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project'' (as defined in the Act). Except where otherwise
indicated by the context, ``resident'' means the same as ``tenant'', as the latter term is used in the Act, including
Mutual Help and Turnkey III homebuyers, as well as rental tenants of low-income housing and Section 8 residents, and
references to sale, purchase, conveyance and ownership include the types of interests and transactions that are
incident to cooperative ownership. 

(b) 

Nonretroactivity. 

In the case of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan that was approved by HUD before the effective date of the interim rule
under this subpart (October 21, 1991) no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions
of the interim or final rule, except for reasonable administrative procedures prescribed by HUD. Similarly, in the
case of a plan that was approved under the interim rule, but before the effective date of the final rule (December 12,
1994), no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions of the final rule, except
for such reasonable administrative procedures. 



 905.1003 

General authority for sale. 



An IHA may sell all or a portion of a development to eligible residents, as defined under  905.1008, for purposes
of homeownership, according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this subpart. Upon sale in accordance with
the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC.
Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale, it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding
for operating subsidies or modernization under the Act upon conveyance of title by the IHA. (That does not preclude
any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available, under other Federal, Tribal, State, or local programs,
such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of the Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative
homeownership, if authorized by the Section 8 regulations.) 



 905.1004 

Fundamental criteria for HUD approval. 



HUD will approve an IHA's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00320 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Workability. 

The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including
the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement. 

(b) 

Legality. 

The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part and any other applicable Federal, Tribal,
State, and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this
section, any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion
of the IHA, whether or not expressly authorized in this subpart. 

(c) 

Documentation. 

The plan must be clear and complete enough to serve as a working document for implementation, as well as a basis for HUD
review. 



 905.1005 

Resident consultation and involvement. 



(a) 

Resident input. 

In developing a proposed homeownership plan, and in carrying out the plan after HUD approval, the IHA shall consult
with residents of the development involved, and with any resident organization that represents them, as necessary
and appropriate to provide them with information and a reasonable opportunity to make their views and recommendations
known to the IHA. If the plan contemplates sale of units in an entirely vacant development, the IHA shall consult with
the IHA-wide resident organization, if any. While the Act gives the IHA sole legal authority for final decisions,
as to whether or not to submit a proposed homeownership plan and the content of such a proposal, the IHA shall give residents
and their resident organizations full opportunity for input in the homeownership planning process, and full consideration
of their concerns and opinions. 

(b) 

Resident initiatives. 

Where individual residents, a Resident Management Corporation (RMC), or another form of resident organization
may wish to initiate discussion of a possible homeownership plan, the IHA shall negotiate with them in good faith.
Joint development and submission of the plan by the IHA and RMC, or other resident organization, is encouraged. In
addition, participation of an RMC or other resident organization in the implementation of the plan is encouraged.

 905.1006 

Property that may be sold. 



(a) 

Types of property. 

Subject to the workability criterion of  905.1004(a) (including, for example, consideration of common elements
and other characteristics of the property), a homeownership plan may provide for sale of one or more dwellings, along
with interests in any common elements, comprising all or a portion of one or more housing developments. A plan may provide
for conversion of existing housing to homeownership or for homeownership sale of newly-developed housing. (However,
for low-income housing units developed as replacement housing for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to subpart
M of this part, that subpart requires that the initial occupants be selected solely on the basis of the requirements
governing rental occupancy (or Mutual Help occupancy, if applicable), without reference to any additional homeownership
eligibility or selection requirements under this subpart.) Mutual Help or Turnkey III homeownership units may be
converted to Section 5(h) homeownership, upon voluntary termination by any existing Mutual Help or Turnkey III homebuyers
of their contractual rights and amendment of the ACC, in a form prescribed by HUD. 

(b) 

Physical condition of property. 

The property must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established
by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for Existing Housing, under 24 CFR part 882) and the requirements
for elimination of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing, under subpart C of 24 CFR part 35. When a prospective
purchaser with disabilities requests accessible features, the features must be added in accordance with 24 CFR parts
8 and 9. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that
is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. This
standard must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser, unless the terms of sale
include measures to assure that the work will be completed within a reasonable time after conveyance, not to exceed
two years (

e.g

., as a part of a mortgage financing package that provides the purchaser with a home improvement loan or pursuant to
a sound sweat equity arrangement). 



 905.1007 

Methods of sale and ownership. 



(a) 

Permissible methods. 

Any appropriate method of sale and ownership may be used, such as fee-simple conveyance of single-family dwellings
or conversion of multifamily buildings to resident-owned cooperatives or condominiums. 

(b) 

Direct or indirect sale. 

An IHA may sell dwellings to residents directly or (with respect to multifamily buildings or a group of single-family
dwellings) through another entity established and governed by, and solely composed of, residents of the IHA's low-income
housing, provided that: 

(1) The other entity has the necessary legal capacity and practical capability to carry out its responsibilities
under the plan. 

(2) The respective rights and obligations of the IHA and the other entity will be specified by a written agreement that
includes: 

(i) Assurances that the other entity will comply with all provisions of the HUD-approved homeownership plan; 

(ii) Assurances that the IHA's conveyance of the property to the other entity will be subject to a title restriction
providing that the property may be resold or otherwise transferred only by conveyance of individual dwellings to
eligible residents, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, or by reconveyance to the IHA, and that
the property will not be encumbered by the other entity without the written consent of the IHA; 

(iii) Protection against fraud or misuse of funds or other property on the part of the other entity, its employees and
agents; 

(iv) Assurances that the resale proceeds will be used only for the purposes specified by the HUD-approved homeownership
plan; 

(v) Limitation of the other entity's administrative and overhead costs, and of any compensation or profit that may
be realized by the entity, to amounts that are reasonable in relation to its responsibilities and risks; 

(vi) Accountability to the IHA and residents for the recordkeeping, reporting and audit requirements of  905.1017;


(vii) Assurances that the other entity will administer its responsibilities under the plan in accordance with applicable
civil rights statutes and implementing regulations, as described in  905.115; and 

(viii) Adequate legal remedies for the IHA and residents, in the event of the other entity's failure to perform in accordance
with the agreement.

<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00321 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Standards and procedures for eligibility and selection of the initial purchasers of individual dwellings shall
be consistent with the following provisions: 

(a) 

Applications. 

Persons who are interested in purchase must submit applications for that specific purpose, and those applications
shall be handled separately from applications for other IHA programs. For vacant units, applications shall be dated
as received by the IHA and, subject to eligibility and preference factors, selection shall be made in the order of receipt.
Application for homeownership shall not affect an applicant's place on any other IHA waiting list. 

(b) 

Eligibility threshold. 

Subject to any additional eligibility and preference standards that are required or permitted under this section,
a homeownership plan may provide for the eligibility of residents of low-income housing owned or leased by the seller
IHA (including Mutual Help and Turnkey III homebuyers, who may elect to terminate their existing homebuyer agreements
in favor of purchase under the Section 5(h) homeownership plan) and residents of other housing who are receiving housing
assistance under Section 8 of the Act, under an ACC administered by the seller IHA; provided that the resident has been
in lawful occupancy for a minimum period specified in the plan (not less than 30 days prior to conveyance of title to
the dwelling to be purchased). For residents of other housing who are receiving housing assistance under Section
8, the minimum occupancy requirement may be satisfied in the unit for which the family is receiving Section 8 assistance
or the Indian housing unit. If the family is to meet part or all of the minimum occupancy requirement in the Indian housing
unit, the Section 8 assistance must be terminated before the family moves into the Indian housing unit. Indian housing
units are ineligible for Section 8 certificate and voucher assistance as long as they remain under the ACC as Indian
housing. 

(c) 

Applicants who do not meet minimum residency requirement for eligibility. 

(1) A homeownership plan, at IHA discretion, may also permit eligibility for applicants who do not meet the minimum
residency requirement of paragraph (b) of this section (30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan)
at the time of application, provided that their selection is conditioned upon completion of the minimum residency
requirement prior to conveyance of title. A plan may thus allow satisfaction of the threshold requirements for eligibility
by: 

(i) Existing low-income housing or Section 8 residents with less than the minimum period of residency; 

(ii) Families who are already on the IHA's waiting lists; and 

(iii) Other low-income families who are neither low-income housing nor Section 8 residents at the time of application
or selection. 

(2) Applicants who are not already low-income housing residents, however, must also satisfy the requirements for
admission to such housing. 

(d) 

Compliance with lease obligations. 

Eligibility shall be limited, however, to residents who have been current in all of their lease obligations (in the
case of Mutual Help or Turnkey III homebuyers, obligations under their homebuyer agreements) over a period of not
less than six months prior to conveyance of title (or, if so provided by the homeownership plan, such lesser period
as has elapsed since the beginning of low-income housing or Section 8 tenure), including, but not limited to, payment
of rents (or homebuyer's monthly payments) and other charges and reporting of all income that is pertinent to determination
of rents (or homebuyer's monthly payments). At the IHA's discretion, the homeownership plan may allow a resident
to remedy under-reporting of income, provided that proper reporting of income would not have resulted in ineligibility
for admission to low-income housing or for Section 8 assistance, by payment of the resulting underpayment for rent
(or homebuyer's monthly payments) prior to conveyance of title to the homeownership dwelling, either in a lump sum
or in installments over a reasonable period. Alternatively, the plan may permit payment within a reasonable period
after conveyance of title, under an agreement secured by a mortgage on the property. 

(e) 

Affordability standard. 

Eligibility shall be further limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership,
under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of operating subsidies
and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the IHA. A homeownership plan may, however, take account
of any available subsidy from other sources (

e.g.

, in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership, assistance under Section 8 of the Act, if available and authorized
by the Section 8 regulations). Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements:


(1) On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus
insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, and other regularly-recurring homeownership costs (such
as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of 35 percent of the
applicant's adjusted income, as defined in this part. 

(2) The applicant can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a downpayment (if any) and closing costs chargeable
to the purchaser, in accordance with the homeownership plan. 

(f) 

Option to restrict eligibility. 

A homeownership plan may, at the IHA's discretion, restrict eligibility to one or more residency-based categories
(

e.g.

, for occupied units, eligibility may be restricted to the existing residents of the units to be sold; for vacant units,
eligibility may be restricted to low-income housing residents only, or to low-income housing residents plus any
one or more of the other residency-based categories that may be established under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section),
as may be reasonable in view of the number of units to be offered for sale and the estimated number of eligible applicants
in various categories provided that the residency-based preferences mandated by paragraph (g) of this section are
observed.

<TEXT>
 

(g) 

Residency-based preferences. 

For occupied units, a preference shall be given to the existing residents of each of the dwellings to be sold. For vacant
units (including units which are voluntarily vacated), a preference shall be given to residents of other low-income
housing units owned or leased by the seller IHA (over any other residency-based categories that may be established
by a homeownership plan for Section 8 residents or for nonresident applicants). 

(h) 

Other eligibility or preference standards. 

If consistent with the other provisions of this section, a homeownership plan may include any other standards for
eligibility or preference, or both, at the discretion of the IHA, that are not contrary to law.




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0201). 



 905.1009 

Counseling, training, and technical assistance



Appropriate counseling shall be provided to prospective and actual purchasers, as necessary for each stage of implementation
of the homeownership plan. Particular attention must be given to the terms of purchase and financing, along with the
other financial and maintenance responsibilities of homeownership. In addition, where applicable, appropriate
training and technical assistance shall be provided to any entity (such as an RMC, other resident organization, or
a cooperative or condominium entity) that has responsibilities for carrying out the plan. 



 905.1010 

Nonpurchasing residents



(a) 

Nonpurchasing resident's options.

 If an existing resident of a dwelling authorized for sale under a homeownership plan is ineligible for purchase, or
declines to purchase, the resident shall be given the choice of either relocation to other suitable and affordable
housing or continued occupancy of the present dwelling on a rental basis, at a rent no higher than that permitted by
the Act. Displacement (permanent, involuntary move), in order to make a dwelling available for sale, is prohibited.
In addition to applicable program sanctions, a violation of the displacement prohibition may trigger a requirement
to provide relocation assistance in accordance with the Uniform Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Act of
1970 and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. Where continued rental occupancy by a nonpurchasing resident
is contemplated after conveyance of the property, the homeownership plan must include provision for any rental subsidy
required (

e.g.

, Section 8 assistance, if available and authorized by the Section 8 regulations). As soon as feasible after they can
be identified, all nonpurchasing residents shall be given written notice of their options under this section. 

(b) 

Relocation assistance. 

A nonpurchasing resident who chooses to relocate pursuant to this section shall be offered the following relocation
assistance:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00323 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Advisory services to assure full choices and real opportunities to obtain relocation within a full range of neighborhoods
where suitable housing may be found, including timely information, counseling, and explanation of the resident's
rights under applicable civil rights statutes and implementing regulations, as specified in  905.115, and
referrals to suitable, safe, sanitary and affordable housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the Act), which
is of the resident's choice, on a nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with applicable civil rights statutes and
implementing regulations, as specified in  905.115. This requirement will be met if the applicant is offered
the opportunity to relocate to another suitable unit in other low-income housing, under any of the housing assistance
programs under Section 8 of the Act, or any other Federal, Tribal, State or local program that is comparable, as to standards
of housing quality, admission and rent, to the programs under the Act, and provides a term of assistance of at least
five years; and 
(2) Payment for actual, reasonable moving and related expenses. 
(c) 

Temporary relocation. 

A nonpurchasing resident who must relocate temporarily to permit work to be carried out shall be provided suitable,
decent, safe and sanitary housing for the temporary period and reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied
housing and any increase in monthly rent and utility costs. 


 905.1011 

Nonroutine maintenance reserve. 


(a) 

When reserve is required.

 A nonroutine maintenance reserve shall be established for all multifamily properties sold under a homeownership
plan. For single-family dwellings, such a reserve shall not be required if the availability of the funds needed for
nonroutine maintenance is adequately addressed under the affordability standard prescribed by the plan. 
(b) 

Purpose of reserve.

 The purpose of this reserve shall be to provide a source of reserve funds for nonroutine maintenance (including replacement),
as necessary to ensure the long-term success of the plan, including protection of the interests of the homeowners
and the IHA. The amounts to be set aside, and other terms of this reserve, shall be as necessary and appropriate for the
particular homeownership plan, taking into account such factors as prospective needs for nonroutine maintenance,
the homeowners' financial resources, and any special factors that may aggravate or mitigate the need for such a reserve.




 905.1012 

Purchase prices and financing. 


(a) 

Below-market terms.

 To ensure affordability by eligible purchasers, by the standard adopted under  906.8(e) of this chapter, a
homeownership plan may provide for below-market purchase prices or below-market financing, or a combination of
the two. Discounted purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's
ability to pay, or may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method (

e.g.

, uniform prices for a group of comparable dwellings, within a range of affordability by a group of potential purchasers).

(b) 

Types of financing.

 Any type of private or public financing may be used (

e.g.,

 conventional, Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Farmers' Home Administration
(FmHA), or a Tribal, State or local program). An IHA may finance or assist in financing purchase by any methods it may
choose, such as purchase-money mortgages, guarantees of mortgage loans from other lenders, shared equity, or lease-purchase
arrangements. 



 905.1013 

Protection against fraud and abuse. 


A homeownership plan shall include appropriate protections against any risks of fraud or abuse that are presented
by the particular plan, such as collusive purchase for the benefit of nonresidents, extended use of the dwelling by
the purchaser as rental property, collusive sale that would circumvent the resale profit limitation of  905.1014.




 905.1014 

Limitation on resale profit. 


(a) 

General. 

If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide
for appropriate measures to preclude realization by the initial purchaser of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall
profit'' means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market
value at date of purchase from the IHA less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods described
in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should be permitted
to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase (or a portion of such profit under
a limited or shared equity arrangement), along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly attributable to
improvements made by them after purchase. 
(b) 

Promissory note method.

 Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than
fair market value, without a commensurate limited or shared equity restriction, the initial purchaser shall execute
a promissory note, payable to the IHA, along with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms
and conditions: 
(1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of: 
(i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the
note as a dollar amount; or 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00324 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall
define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of: 
(A) The discounted purchase price; 
(B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and 
(C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial
purchaser during tenure as a homeowner. 
(2) At the option of the IHA, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over a specified period
of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total forgiveness of the
indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments of not more
than 20 percent. This does not require an IHA's plan to provide for any such reduction at all, or preclude it from specifying
terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing sentence. 
(3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the IHA shall (by an appropriate
form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the IHA, to be based
solely on the IHA's determination that the resale price represents fair market value or a lesser amount that will result
in payment to the IHA, under the note, of the full amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction,
if provided for by the homeownership plan pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section). If so determined, the IHA
shall be obligated to approve the resale. 
(4) The IHA may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory note, in
favor of an additional lien granted by the purchaser as security for a loan for home improvements or other purposes
approved by the IHA. 
(c) 

Limited equity method.

 As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement,
restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive
purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: 
(1) The seller's paid-in equity; 
(2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during
homeownership tenure; and 
(3) An allowance for a portion of the property's appreciation in value during homeownership tenure, calculated by
a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership plan (

e.g.

, according to a price index factor or other measure). 
(d) 

Third option.

 The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish
the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(e) 

Appraisal. 

Determinations of fair market value under this section shall be made on the basis of appraisal within a reasonable
time prior to sale, by an independent appraiser to be selected by the IHA. 



 905.1015 

Use of sale proceeds. 


(a) 

General authority for use. 

Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying
out the homeownership plan, be retained by the IHA and used for housing assistance to low-income families (as such
families are defined under the Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit
to the purchase price (

e.g.,

 earnest money, downpayments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments
under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under  905.1014, and interest
earned on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.) 
(b) 

Permissible uses. 

Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families,
at the discretion of the IHA and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: 
(1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for purposes that are justified to
ensure the success of the plan and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the IHA and any other entity with responsibility
for carrying out the plan. Nonexclusive examples include nonroutine maintenance reserves under Sec. 905.1011,
a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any
contingent liabilities of the IHA under the homeownership plan (such as IHA guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve
for IHA repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. 
(2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and
for reasonable planning and implementation costs. 
(3) In connection with a Tribal, State or local homeownership program for low-income families, as described in the
homeownership plan, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. Under such
programs, sales proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families,
or to assist such families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners. 
(4) In connection with the IHA's other low-income housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized for
the use of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the Act and Federal regulations, as included
in the HUD-approved operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating
reserves, protective services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating
subsidy otherwise payable to the IHA for its other low-income housing. 
(5) In connection with any other type of Federal, Tribal, State, or local housing program for low-income families,
as described in the homeownership plan. 


 905.1016 

Replacement housing. 


(a)

 Replacement requirement

. As a condition for transfer of ownership under a HUD-approved homeownership plan, the IHA must obtain a funding commitment,
from HUD or another source, for the replacement of each of the dwellings to be sold under the plan. Replacement housing
may be provided by one or any combination of the following methods: 
(1) Development by the IHA of additional low-income housing under this part (by new construction or acquisition).

(2) Rehabilitation of vacant low-income housing owned by the IHA. 
(3) Use of five-year, tenant-based certificate or voucher assistance under Section 8 of the Act. 
(4) If the homeownership plan is submitted by the IHA for sale to residents through an RMC, resident organization or
cooperative association which is otherwise eligible to participate under this subpart, acquisition of nonpublicly-owned
housing units, which the RMC, resident organization or cooperative association will operate as rental housing,
comparable to IHA-owned low-income housing as to term of assistance, housing standards, eligibility, and contribution
to rent.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00326 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Any other Federal, Tribal, State, or local housing program that is comparable, as to housing standards, eligibility
and contribution to rent, to the programs referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, and provides
a term of assistance of not less than five years. 
(b) 

Funding commitments. 

Although a HUD funding commitment is required if the replacement housing requirement is to be satisfied through any
of the HUD programs listed in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD's approval of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan on
the expectation that such a funding commitment will be forthcoming shall not constitute a binding obligation to make
such a commitment. Where the requirement is to be satisfied under a Tribal, State or local program, or a Federal program
not administered by HUD, a funding commitment shall be required from the proper authority. 
(c) 

Use of sale proceeds to fund replacement housing. 

Sale proceeds that are generated under the homeownership plan may be used under some of the replacement housing options
under paragraph (a) of this section (

e.g.

, rehabilitation of vacant public housing units, or an eligible local program). Where a homeownership plan provides
for sale proceeds to be used for replacement housing, HUD approval of the plan and execution of the IHA-HUD implementing
agreement shall satisfy the funding commitment requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, with regard to the amount
of replacement housing to be funded out of sale proceeds. 
(d) 

Consistency with current housing needs. 

Replacement housing may differ from the dwellings sold under the homeownership plan, as to unit sizes or family or
elderly occupancy, if the IHA determines that such change is consistent with current local housing needs for low-income
families. 
(e) 

Inapplicability to prior plans. 

This section shall not apply to homeownership plans that were submitted to HUD under the Section 5(h) Homeownership
Program prior to October 1, 1990. 



 905.1017 

Records, reports, and audits. 


The IHA shall be responsible for the maintenance of records (including sale and financial records) for all activities
incident to implementation of the homeownership plan. Until all planned sales of individual dwellings have been
completed, the IHA shall submit to HUD annual sales reports, in a form prescribed by HUD. The receipt, retention, and
expenditure of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the IHA's housing operations,
and any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring. Where another entity is responsible for
sale of individual units, pursuant to  905.1007(b), the IHA must ensure that the entity's responsibilities
include proper recordkeeping and accountability to the IHA, sufficient to enable the IHA to monitor compliance with
the approved homeownership plan, to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books
and records shall be subject to inspection and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO). 




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0201)


 905.1018 

Submission and review of homeownership plan. 


Whether to develop and submit a proposed homeownership plan is a matter within the discretion of each IHA. An IHA may
initiate a proposal at any time, according to the following procedures: 
(a) 

Preliminary consultation with HUD staff. 

Before submission of a proposed plan, the IHA shall consult informally with the appropriate HUD Field Office to assess
feasibility and the particulars to be addressed by the plan. 
(b) 

Submission to HUD. 

The IHA shall submit the proposed plan, together with supporting documentation, in a format prescribed by HUD, to
the appropriate HUD Field Office. 
(c) 

Conditional approval. 

Conditional approval may be given, at HUD discretion, where HUD determines that to be justified. For example, conditional
HUD approval might be a necessary precondition for the IHA to obtain the funding commitments required to satisfy the
requirements for final HUD approval of a complete homeownership plan. Where conditional approval is granted, HUD
will specify the conditions in writing.



(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0201) 


 905.1019 

HUD approval and IHA-HUD implementing agreement. 


Upon HUD notification to the IHA that the homeownership plan is approvable (in final form that satisfies all applicable
requirements of this part), the IHA and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement, in a form prescribed by
HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The plan itself, as approved by HUD, shall be
incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also be incorporated,
if agreeable to the IHA and HUD. The IHA shall be obligated to carry out the approved homeownership plan and other provisions
of the implementing agreement without modification, except with written approval by HUD. 



(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0201)


 905.1020 

Content of homeownership plan. 


The homeownership plan must address the following matters, as applicable to the particular factual situation: 
(a) 

Property description. 

A description of the property, including identification of the development and the specific dwellings to be sold.

(b) 

Repair or rehabilitation. 

If applicable, a plan for any repair or rehabilitation required under  905.1006, based on the assessment of
the physical condition of the property that is included in the supporting documentation. 
(c) 

Purchaser eligibility and selection. 

The standards and procedures to be used for homeownership applications and the eligibility and selection of purchasers,
consistent with the requirements of  905.1008. 
(d) 

Sale and financing. 

Terms and conditions of sale and financing (see, particularly,   905.1011 through 905.1014). 
(e) 

Future consultation with residents. 

A plan for consultation with residents during the implementation stage (See  905.1005). If appropriate, this
may be combined with the plan for counseling. 
(f) 

Counseling. 

Counseling, training, and technical assistance to be provided in accordance with  905.1009.

 905.1021

Supporting documentation. 



The following supporting documentation shall be submitted to HUD with the proposed homeownership plan, as appropriate
for the particular plan: 

(a) 

Estimate of value. 

An estimate of the fair market value of the property, including the range of fair market values of individual dwellings,
with information to support the reasonableness of the estimate. (The purpose of this information is merely to assist
HUD in determining whether, taking into consideration the estimated fair market value of the property, the plan adequately
addresses any risks of fraud and abuse, pursuant to  905.1013, and windfall profit on resale, pursuant to  905.1014.
A formal appraisal need not be submitted with the proposed homeownership plan.) 

(b) 

Physical assessment. 

An assessment of the physical condition of the property, based on the standards specified in  905.1006. 

(c) 

Workability. 

A statement demonstrating the practical workability of the plan, based on analysis of data on such elements as purchase
prices, costs of repair or rehabilitation, homeownership costs, family incomes, availability of financing, and
the extent to which there are eligible residents who are expected to be interested in purchase. (See  905.1004(a).)


(d) 

IHA commitment and capability. 

Information to substantiate the commitment and capability of the IHA and any other entity with substantial responsibilities
for implementing the plan. 

(e) 

Resident planning input. 

A description of resident consultation activities carried out pursuant to  905.1005 before submission of
the plan, with a summary of the views and recommendations of residents and copies of any written comments that may have
been submitted to the IHA by individual residents and resident organizations, and any other individuals and organizations.


(f) 

Nondiscrimination certification. 

The IHA's certification that it will administer the plan on a nondiscriminatory basis, in accordance with applicable
civil rights laws and implementing regulations, as described in  905.115 of this part, and will assure compliance
with those requirements by any other entity that may assume substantial responsibilities for implementing the plan.


(g) 

Legal opinion. 

An opinion by legal counsel to the IHA, stating that counsel has reviewed the plan and finds it consistent with all applicable
requirements of Federal, Tribal, State, and local law, including regulations as well as statutes. In addition, counsel
must identify the major legal requirements that remain to be met in implementing the plan, if approved by HUD as submitted,
indicating an opinion about whether those requirements can be met without special problems that may disrupt the timetable
or other features contained in the plan. 

(h) 

Board resolution. 

A resolution by the IHA's Board of Commissioners, evidencing its approval of the plan. 

(i) 

Other information. 

Any other information that may reasonably be required for HUD review of the plan. Except for the IHA-HUD implementing
agreement under  905.1019, HUD approval is not required for documents to be prepared and used by the IHA in implementing
the plan (such as contracts, applications, deeds, mortgages, promissory notes, and cooperative or condominium
documents), if their essential terms and conditions are described in the plan. Consequently, those documents need
not be submitted as part of the plan or the supporting documentation.

 906.1

Purpose. 



This part codifies the provisions of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for public housing, as authorized by
sections 5(h) and 6(c)(4)(D) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act) and administered by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD). 



 906.2

Applicability. 



(a) 

General applicability. 

This part applies to public housing owned by public housing agencies (PHAs) (excluding Indian Housing Authorities
(IHAs)) subject to Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs) under the Act. In reference to housing properties, ``development''
means the same as ``project'' (as defined in the Act). Except where otherwise indicated by the context, ``resident''
means the same as ``tenant'', as the latter term is used in the Act, including Turnkey III homebuyers, if applicable,
as well as rental tenants of public housing and Section 8 residents, and references to sale, purchase, conveyance
and ownership include the types of interests and transactions that are incident to cooperative ownership. 

(b) 

Nonretroactivity. 

In the case of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan that was approved by HUD prior to the effective date of the interim rule
under this part (October 21, 1991), no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions
of the interim or final rule, except for reasonable administrative procedures prescribed by HUD. Similarly, in the
case of a plan that was approved under the interim rule, before the effective date of the final rule (December 12, 1994),
no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions of the final rule, except for such
reasonable administrative procedures. 



 906.3

General authority for sale. 



A PHA may sell all or a portion of a public housing development to eligible residents, as defined under  906.8,
for purposes of homeownership, according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this part. If the development
is subject to indebtedness under the ACC, HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated
under the ACC, and the property sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness. (In the case of a development
with financing restrictions (such as a bond-financed development), however, sale is subject to the terms and conditions
of the applicable restrictions.) Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute
a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC
after sale, it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for public housing operating subsidies or modernization
under the Act upon conveyance of title by the PHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that
may be available, under other Federal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance
under Section 8 of the Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership, if authorized by the Section 8
regulations.) 



 906.4

Fundamental criteria for HUD approval. 



HUD will approve a PHA's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria: 

(a) 

Workability. 

The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including
the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement. 

(b) 

Legality. 

The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part and any other applicable Federal, State,
and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this section,
any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion of the
PHA, whether or not expressly authorized in this part. 

(c) 

Documentation. 

The plan must be clear and complete enough to serve as a working document for implementation, as well as a basis for HUD
review. 



 906.5

Resident consultation and involvement. 



(a) 

Resident input. 

In developing a proposed homeownership plan, and in carrying out the plan after HUD approval, the PHA shall consult
with residents of the development involved, and with any resident organization that represents them, as necessary
and appropriate to provide them with information and a reasonable opportunity to make their views and recommendations
known to the PHA. If the plan contemplates sale of units in an entirely vacant development, the PHA shall consult with
the PHA-wide resident organization, if any. While the Act gives the PHA sole legal authority for final decisions,
as to whether or not to submit a proposed homeownership plan and the content of such a proposal, the PHA shall give residents
and their resident organizations full opportunity for input in the homeownership planning process, and full consideration
of their concerns and opinions. 

(b) 

Resident initiatives. 

Where individual residents, a Resident Management Corporation (RMC), or another form of resident organization
may wish to initiate discussion of a possible homeownership plan, the PHA shall negotiate with them in good faith.
Joint development and submission of the plan by the PHA and RMC, or other resident organization, is encouraged. In
addition, participation of an RMC or other resident organization in the implementation of the plan is encouraged.

(a) 

Types of property.

 Subject to the workability criterion of  906.4(a) (including, for example, consideration of common elements
and other characteristics of the property), a homeownership plan may provide for sale of one or more dwellings, along
with interests in any common elements, comprising all or a portion of one or more public housing developments. A plan
may provide for conversion of existing public housing to homeownership or for homeownership sale of newly-developed
public housing. (However, for public housing units developed as replacement housing for units demolished or disposed
of pursuant to 24 CFR part 970, that part requires that the initial occupants be selected solely on the basis of the requirements
governing rental occupancy, without reference to any additional homeownership eligibility or selection requirements
under this part.) Turnkey III homeownership units may be converted to Section 5(h) homeownership, upon voluntary
termination by any existing Turnkey III homebuyers of their contractual rights and amendment of the ACC, in a form
prescribed by HUD. 

(b) 

Physical condition of property.

 The property must meet local code requirements (or, if no local code exists, the housing quality standards established
by HUD for the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program for Existing Housing, under 24 CFR part 882) and the requirements
for elimination of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing, under subpart C of 24 CFR part 35. When a prospective
purchaser with disabilities requests accessible features, the features must be added in accordance with 24 CFR parts
8 and 9. Further, the property must be in good repair, with the major components having a remaining useful life that
is sufficient to justify a reasonable expectation that homeownership will be affordable by the purchasers. These
standards must be met as a condition for conveyance of a dwelling to an individual purchaser, unless the terms of sale
include measures to assure that the work will be completed within a reasonable time after conveyance, not to exceed
two years (

e.g.

, as a part of a mortgage financing package that provides the purchaser with a home improvement loan or pursuant to a
sound sweat equity arrangement). 



 906.7 

Methods of sale and ownership. 



(a) 

Permissible methods.

 Any appropriate method of sale and ownership may be used, such as fee-simple conveyance of single-family dwellings
or conversion of multifamily buildings to resident-owned cooperatives or condominiums. 

(b) 

Direct or indirect sale.

 A PHA may sell dwellings to residents directly or (with respect to multifamily buildings or a group of single-family
dwellings) through another entity established and governed by, and solely composed of, residents of the PHA's public
housing, provided that: 

(1) The other entity has the necessary legal capacity and practical capability to carry out its responsibilities
under the plan; and 

(2) The respective rights and obligations of the PHA and the other entity will be specified by a written agreement that
includes: 

(i) Assurances that the other entity will comply with all provisions of the HUD-approved homeownership plan; 

(ii) Assurances that the PHA's conveyance of the property to the other entity will be subject to a title restriction
providing that the property may be resold or otherwise transferred only by conveyance of individual dwellings to
eligible residents, in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, or by reconveyance to the PHA, and that
the property will not be encumbered by the other entity without the written consent of the PHA; 

(iii) Protection against fraud or misuse of funds or other property on the part of the other entity, its employees,
and agents; 

(iv) Assurances that the resale proceeds will be used only for the purposes specified by the HUD-approved homeownership
plan; 

(v) Limitation of the other entity's administrative and overhead costs, and of any compensation or profit that may
be realized by the entity, to amounts that are reasonable in relation to its responsibilities and risks; 

(vi) Accountability to the PHA and residents for the recordkeeping, reporting and audit requirements of  906.17;


(vii) Assurances that the other entity will administer its responsibilities under the plan on a nondiscriminatory
basis, in accordance with the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations; and 

(viii) Adequate legal remedies for the PHA and residents, in the event of the other entity's failure to perform in accordance
with the agreement. 



 906.8 

Purchaser eligibility and selection. 



Standards and procedures for eligibility and selection of the initial purchasers of individual dwellings shall
be consistent with the following provisions: 

(a) 

Applications.

 Persons who are interested in purchase must submit applications for that specific purpose, and those applications
shall be handled separately from applications for other PHA programs. For vacant units, applications shall be dated
as received by the PHA and, subject to eligibility and preference factors, selection shall be made in the order of receipt.
Application for homeownership shall not affect an applicant's place on any other PHA waiting list. 

(b) 

Eligibility threshold.

 Subject to any additional eligibility and preference standards that are required or permitted under this section,
a homeownership plan may provide for the eligibility of residents of public housing owned or leased by the seller PHA
(including Turnkey III homebuyers who may elect to terminate their existing Turnkey III homebuyer agreements in
favor of purchase under the Section 5(h) homeownership plan) and residents of other housing who are receiving housing
assistance under Section 8 of the Act, under an ACC administered by the seller PHA, provided that the resident has been
in lawful occupancy for a minimum period specified in the plan (not less than 30 days prior to conveyance of title to
the dwelling to be purchased). For residents of other housing who are receiving housing assistance under Section
8, the minimum occupancy requirement may be satisfied in the unit for which the family is receiving Section 8 assistance
or the public housing unit. If the family is to meet part or all of the minimum occupancy requirement in the public housing
unit, the Section 8 assistance must be terminated before the family moves into the public housing unit. Public housing
units are ineligible for Section 8 certificate and voucher assistance as long as they remain under ACC as public housing.


(c) 

Applicants who do not meet minimum residency requirement for eligibility.

 (1) A homeownership plan, at PHA discretion, may also permit eligibility for applicants who do not meet the minimum
residency requirement of paragraph (b) of this section (30 days or more, as prescribed by the homeownership plan)
at the time of application, provided that their selection is conditioned upon completion of the minimum residency
requirement prior to conveyance of title. (A plan may thus allow satisfaction of the threshold requirements for eligibility
by: 

(i) Existing public housing or Section 8 residents with less than the minimum period of residency; 

(ii) Families who are already on the PHA's waiting lists; and

<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00330 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) Other low-income families who are neither public housing nor Section 8 residents at the time of application
or selection.) 

(2) Applicants who are not already public housing residents, however, must also satisfy the requirements for admission
to such housing. 

(d) 

Compliance with lease obligations.

 Eligibility shall be limited to residents who have been current in all of their lease obligations (in the case of Turnkey
III homebuyers, obligations under their Turnkey III homebuyer agreements) over a period of not less than six months
prior to conveyance of title (or, if so provided by the homeownership plan, such lesser period as has elapsed since
the beginning of public housing or Section 8 tenure), including, but not limited to, payment of rents (or homebuyer's
monthly payments) and other charges, and reporting of all income that is pertinent to determination of rental charges
(or homebuyer's monthly payments). At the PHA's discretion, the homeownership plan may allow a resident to remedy
under-reporting of income, provided that proper reporting of income would not have resulted in ineligibility for
admission to public housing or for Section 8 assistance, by payment of the resulting underpayment for rent (or homebuyer's
monthly payments) prior to conveyance of title to the homeownership dwelling, either in a lump-sum or in installments
over a reasonable period. Alternatively, the plan may permit payment within a reasonable period after conveyance
of title, under an agreement secured by a mortgage on the property. 

(e) 

Affordability standard.

 Eligibility shall be limited to residents who are capable of assuming the financial obligations of homeownership,
under minimum income standards for affordability, taking into account the unavailability of public housing operating
subsidies and modernization funds after conveyance of the property by the PHA. A homeownership plan may, however,
take account of any available subsidy from other sources (

e.g.

, in connection with a plan for cooperative ownership, assistance under Section 8 of the Act, if available and authorized
by the Section 8 regulations). Under this affordability standard, an applicant must meet the following requirements:


(1) On an average monthly estimate, the amount of the applicant's payments for mortgage principal and interest, plus
insurance, real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and other regularly recurring homeownership costs (such
as condominium, cooperative, or other homeownership association fees) will not exceed the sum of: 

(i) 35 percent of the applicant's adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR Part 913; and 

(ii) Any subsidy that will be available for such payments. 

(2) The applicant can pay any amounts required for closing, such as a downpayment (if any) and closing costs chargeable
to the purchaser, in accordance with the homeownership plan. 

(f) 

Option to restrict eligibility.

 A homeownership plan may, at the PHA's discretion, restrict eligibility to one or more residency-based categories
(

e.g.

, for occupied units, eligibility may be restricted to the existing residents of the units to be sold; for vacant units,
eligibility may be restricted to public housing residents only, or to public housing residents plus any one or more
of the other residency-based categories that may be established under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section), as
may be reasonable in view of the number of units to be offered for sale and the estimated number of eligible applicants
in various categories, provided that the residency-based preference requirements mandated by paragraph (g) of
this section are observed. 

(g) 

Residency-based preferences.

 For occupied units, a preference shall be given to the existing residents of each of the dwellings to be sold. For vacant
units (including units which are voluntarily vacated), a preference shall be given to residents of other public housing
units owned or leased by the seller PHA (over any other residency-based categories that may be established by the homeownership
plan for Section 8 residents and any categories of nonresident applicants). 

(h) 

Self sufficiency preference.

 For vacant units, a further preference shall be given to those applicants who have completed self-sufficiency and
job training programs, as identified in the homeownership plan, or who meet equivalent standards of economic self-sufficiency,
such as actual employment experience, as specified in the homeownership plan.

(i) 

Other eligibility or preference standards. 

If consistent with the other provisions of this section, a homeownership plan may include any other standards for
eligibility or preference, or both, at the discretion of the PHA, that are not contrary to law.




(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0201)



 906.9



Counseling, training, and technical assistance.



Appropriate counseling shall be provided to prospective and actual purchasers, as necessary for each stage of implementation
of the homeownership plan. Particular attention must be given to the terms of purchase and financing, along with the
other financial and maintenance responsibilities of homeownership. In addition, where applicable, appropriate
training and technical assistance shall be provided to any entity (such as an RMC, other resident organization, or
a cooperative or condominium entity) that has responsibilities for carrying out the plan.



 906.10



Nonpurchasing residents.



(a) 

Nonpurchasing resident's options. 

If an existing resident of a dwelling authorized for sale under a homeownership plan is ineligible for purchase, or
declines to purchase, the resident shall be given the choice of either relocation to other suitable and affordable
housing or continued occupancy of the present dwelling on a rental basis, at a rent no higher than that permitted by
the Act. Displacement (permanent, involuntary move) in order to make a dwelling available for sale, is prohibited.
In addition to applicable program sanctions, a violation of the displacement prohibition may trigger a requirement
to provide relocation assistance in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Act of 1970 and implementing regulations at 49 CFR Part 24. Where continued rental occupancy by a nonpurchasing resident
is contemplated after conversion of the property to cooperative or condominium ownership, the homeownership plan
must include provision for any rental subsidy required (

e.g

., Section 8 assistance, if available and authorized by the Section 8 regulations). As soon as feasible after they
can be identified, all nonpurchasing residents shall be given written notice of their options under this section.

(b) 

Relocation assistance. 

A nonpurchasing resident who chooses to relocate pursuant to this section shall be offered the following relocation
assistance:

(1) Advisory services to assure full choices and real opportunities to obtain relocation within a full range of neighborhoods
where suitable housing may be found, in and outside areas of minority concentration, including timely information,
counseling, explanation of the resident's rights under the Fair Housing Act, and referrals to suitable, safe, sanitary
and affordable housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the Act), which is of the resident's choice, on a nondiscriminatory
basis, without regard to race, color, religion (creed), national origin, handicap, age, sex, or familial status,
in compliance with applicable Federal and State law. This requirement will be met if the resident is offered the opportunity
to relocate to other suitable housing under the Public Housing Program, any of the housing assistance programs under
Section 8 of the Act, or any other Federal, State or local program that is comparable, as to standards of housing quality,
admission and rent, to the programs under the Act, and provides a term of assistance of at least five years; and

(2) Payment for actual, reasonable moving and related expenses.

(c) 

Temporary relocation. 

A nonpurchasing resident who must relocate temporarily to permit work to be carried out shall be provided suitable,
decent, safe and sanitary housing for the temporary period and reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied
housing and any increase in monthly rent and utility costs.



 906.11



Nonroutine maintenance reserve.



(a) 

When reserve is required. 

A nonroutine maintenance reserve shall be established for all multifamily properties sold under a homeownership
plan. For single-family dwellings, such a reserve shall not be required if the availability of the funds needed for
nonroutine maintenance is adequately addressed under the affordability standard prescribed by the plan.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-0-00332 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Purpose of reserve. 

The purpose of this reserve shall be to provide a source of reserve funds for nonroutine maintenance (including replacement),
as necessary to ensure the long-term success of the plan, including protection of the interests of the homeowners
and the PHA. The amounts to be set aside, and other terms of this reserve, shall be as necessary and appropriate for the
particular homeownership plan, taking into account such factors as prospective needs for nonroutine maintenance,
the homeowners' financial resources, and any special factors that may aggravate or mitigate the need for such a reserve.



 906.12



Purchase prices and financing.



(a) 

Below-market terms. 

To ensure affordability by eligible purchasers, by the standard adopted under  906.8(e), a homeownership
plan may provide for below-market purchase prices or below-market financing, or a combination of the two. Discounted
purchase prices may be determined on a unit-by-unit basis, based on the particular purchaser's ability to pay, or
may be determined by any other fair and reasonable method (

e.g., 

uniform prices for a group of comparable dwellings, within a range of affordability by a group of potential purchasers).

(b) 

Types of financing. 

Any type of private or public financing may be used (

e.g., 

conventional, Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Farmers' Home Administration
(FmHA), or a State or local program). A PHA may finance or assist in financing purchase by any methods it may choose,
such as purchase-money mortgages, guarantees of mortgage loans from other lenders, shared equity, or lease-purchase
arrangements.



 906.13



Protection against fraud and abuse.



A homeownership plan shall include appropriate protections against any risks of fraud or abuse that are presented
by the particular plan, such as collusive purchase for the benefit of nonresidents, extended use of the dwelling by
the purchaser as rental property, or collusive sale that would circumvent the resale profit limitation of  906.14.



 906.14



Limitation on resale profit.



(a) 

General. 

If a dwelling is sold to the initial purchaser for less than fair market value, the homeownership plan shall provide
for appropriate measures to preclude realization by the initial purchaser of windfall profit on resale. ``Windfall
profit'' means all or a portion of the resale proceeds attributable to the purchase price discount (the fair market
value at date of purchase from the PHA less the below-market purchase price), as determined by one of the methods described
in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Subject to that requirement, however, purchasers should be permitted
to retain any resale profit attributable to appreciation in value after purchase (or a portion of such profit under
a limited or shared equity arrangement), along with any portion of the resale profit that is fairly attributable to
improvements made by them after purchase.

(

b) Promissory note method. 

Where there is potential for a windfall profit because the dwelling unit is sold to the initial purchaser for less than
fair market value, without a commensurate limited or shared equity restriction, the initial purchaser shall execute
a promissory note, payable to the PHA, along with a mortgage securing the obligation of the note, on the following terms
and conditions:

(1) The principal amount of indebtedness shall be the lesser of:

(i) The purchase price discount, as determined by the definition in paragraph (a) of this section and stated in the
note as a dollar amount; or

(ii) The net resale profit, in an amount to be determined upon resale by a formula stated in the note. That formula shall
define net resale profit as the amount by which the gross resale price exceeds the sum of:

(A) The discounted purchase price;

(B) Reasonable sale costs charged to the initial purchaser upon resale; and

(C) Any increase in the value of the property that is attributable to improvements paid for or performed by the initial
purchaser during tenure as a homeowner.

(2) At the option of the PHA, the note may provide for automatic reduction of the principal amount over a specified period
of ownership while the property is used as the purchaser's family residence, resulting in total forgiveness of the
indebtedness over a period of not less than five years from the date of conveyance, in annual increments of not more
than 20 percent. This does not require a PHA's plan to provide for any such reduction at all, or preclude it from specifying
terms that are less generous to the purchaser than those stated in the foregoing sentence.

(3) To preclude collusive resale that would circumvent the intent of this section, the PHA shall (by an appropriate
form of title restriction) condition the initial purchaser's right to resell upon approval by the PHA, to be based
solely on the PHA's determination that the resale price represents fair market value or a lesser amount that will result
in payment to the PHA, under the note, of the full amount of the purchase price discount (subject to any accrued reduction,
if provided for by the homeownership plan pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section). If so determined, the PHA
shall be obligated to approve the resale.

(4) The PHA may, in its sole discretion, agree to subordination of the mortgage that secures the promissory note, in
favor of an additional lien granted by the purchaser as security for a loan for home improvements or other purposes
approved by the PHA.

(c) 

Limited equity method

. As a second option, the requirement of this section may be satisfied by an appropriate form of limited equity arrangement,
restricting the amount of net resale profit that may be realized by the seller (the initial purchaser and successive
purchasers over a period prescribed by the homeownership plan) to the sum of: 

(1) The seller's paid-in equity; 

(2) The portion of the resale proceeds attributable to any improvements paid for or performed by the seller during
homeownership tenure; and 

(3) An allowance for a portion of the property's appreciation in value during homeownership tenure, calculated by
a fair and reasonable method specified in the homeownership plan (

e.g.

, according to a price index factor or other measure). 

(d) 

Third option

. The requirements of this section may be satisfied by any other fair and reasonable arrangement that will accomplish
the essential purposes stated in paragraph (a) of this section. 

(e) 

Appraisal

. Determinations of fair market value under this section shall be made on the basis of appraisal within a reasonable
time prior to sale by an independent appraiser, to be selected by the PHA. 



 906.15 

Use of sale proceeds. 



(a) 

General authority for use

. Sale proceeds may, after provision for sale and administrative costs that are necessary and reasonable for carrying
out the homeownership plan, be retained by the PHA and used for housing assistance to low-income families (as such
families are defined under the Act). The term ``sale proceeds'' includes all payments made by purchasers for credit
to the purchase price (

e.g.

, earnest money, downpayments, payments out of the proceeds of mortgage loans, and principal and interest payments
under purchase-money mortgages), along with any amounts payable upon resale under  906.14, and interest earned
on all such receipts. (Residual receipts, as defined in the ACC, shall not be treated as sale proceeds.) 

(b) 

Permissible uses. 

Sale proceeds may be used for any one or more of the following forms of housing assistance for low-income families,
at the discretion of the PHA and as stated in the HUD-approved homeownership plan: 

(1) In connection with the homeownership plan from which the funds are derived, for purposes that are justified to
ensure the success of the plan and to protect the interests of the homeowners, the PHA and any other entity with responsibility
for carrying out the plan. Nonexclusive examples include nonroutine maintenance reserves under  906.11;
a reserve for loans to homeowners to prevent or cure default or for other emergency housing needs; a reserve for any
contingent liabilities of the PHA under the homeownership plan (such as PHA guaranty of mortgage loans); and a reserve
for PHA repurchase, repair and resale of homes in the event of defaults. 

(2) In connection with another HUD-approved homeownership plan under this part, for assistance to purchasers and
for reasonable planning and implementation costs. 

(3) In connection with a State or local homeownership program for low-income families, as described in the homeownership
plan, for assistance to purchasers and for reasonable planning and implementation costs. Under such programs, sales
proceeds may be used to construct or acquire additional dwellings for sale to low-income families, or to assist such
families in purchasing other dwellings from public or private owners. 

(4) In connection with the PHA's other public housing that remains under ACC, for any purposes authorized for the use
of operating funds under the ACC and applicable provisions of the Act and Federal regulations, as included in the HUD-approved
operating budgets. Examples include maintenance and modernization, augmentation of operating reserves, protective
services, and resident services. Such use shall not result in the reduction of the operating subsidy otherwise payable
to the PHA under 24 CFR part 990. 

(5) In connection with any other type of Federal, State, or local housing program for low-income families, as described
in the homeownership plan. 



 906.16 

Replacement housing. 



(a) 

Replacement requirement

. As a condition for transfer of ownership under a HUD-approved homeownership plan, the PHA must obtain a funding commitment,
from HUD or another source, for the replacement of each of the dwellings to be sold under the plan. Replacement housing
may be provided by one or any combination of the following methods: 

(1) Development by the PHA of additional public housing under 24 CFR part 941 (by new construction or acquisition).


(2) Rehabilitation of vacant public housing owned by the PHA. 

(3) Use of five-year, tenant-based certificate or voucher assistance under Section 8 of the Act. 

(4) If the homeownership plan is submitted by the PHA for sale to residents through an RMC, resident organization or
cooperative association which is otherwise eligible to participate under this part, acquisition of nonpublicly-owned
housing units, which the RMC, resident organization or cooperative association will operate as rental housing,
comparable to public housing as to term of assistance, housing standards, eligibility, and contribution to rent.


(5) Any other Federal, State, or local housing program that is comparable, as to housing standards, eligibility and
contribution to rent, to the programs referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, and provides
a term of assistance of not less than five years. 

(b) 

Funding commitments. 

Although a HUD funding commitment is required if the replacement housing requirement is to be satisfied through any
of the HUD programs listed in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD's approval of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan on
the expectation that such a funding commitment will be forthcoming shall not constitute a binding obligation to make
such a commitment. Where the requirement is to be satisfied under a State or local program, or a Federal program not
administered by HUD, a funding commitment shall be required from the proper authority. 

(c) 

Use of sale proceeds to fund replacement housing. 

Sale proceeds that are generated under the homeownership plan may be used under some of the replacement housing options
under paragraph (a) of this section (

e.g

., rehabilitation of vacant public housing units, or an eligible local program). Where a homeownership plan provides
for sale proceeds to be used for replacement housing, HUD approval of the plan and execution of the PHA-HUD implementing
agreement shall satisfy the funding commitment requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, with regard to the amount
of replacement housing to be funded out of sale proceeds. 

(d) 

Consistency with current housing needs. 

Replacement housing may differ from the dwellings sold under the homeownership plan, as to unit sizes or family or
elderly occupancy, if the PHA determines that such change is consistent with current local housing needs for low-income
families. 

(e) 

Inapplicability to prior plans. 

This section shall not apply to homeownership plans that were submitted to HUD under the Section 5(h) Homeownership
Program prior to October 1, 1990.

 906.17 

Records, reports, and audits. 



The PHA shall be responsible for the maintenance of records (including sale and financial records, which must include
information on the racial and ethnic characteristics of the purchasers) for all activities incident to implementation
of the HUD-approved homeownership plan. Until all planned sales of individual dwellings have been completed, the
PHA shall submit to HUD annual sales reports, in a form prescribed by HUD. The receipt, retention, and expenditure
of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the PHA's public housing operations, and
any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring. Where another entity is responsible for sale
of individual units, pursuant to  906.7(b), the PHA must ensure that the entity's responsibilities include
proper recordkeeping and accountability to the PHA, sufficient to enable the PHA to monitor compliance with the approved
homeownership plan, to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records shall
be subject to inspection and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO).

 906.18 

Submission and review of homeownership plan. 



Whether to develop and submit a proposed homeownership plan is a matter within the discretion of each PHA. A PHA may
initiate a proposal at any time, according to the following procedures:
