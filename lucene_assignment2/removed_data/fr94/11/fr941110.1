Cranberries Grown in States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota,
Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York; Establishment of Late Payment and Increase in Interest
Charges on Delinquent Assessments 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would increase the interest charge from 1 percent to 11/2 percent per month and add a late payment
charge of 5 percent on delinquent assessments owed by handlers under Marketing Order No. 929 covering cranberries
grown in ten states. This rule would contribute to the efficient operation of the program by ensuring that adequate
funds are available to cover budgeted expenses incurred under the marketing order. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposal is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 (7 CFR Part 929), as amended, regulating the handling
of cranberries grown in ten states, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This proposal has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This proposal will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 30 handlers of cranberries who are subject to regulation under the order and approximately
1,050 producers of cranberries in the regulated area.

Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those
having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual
receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of cranberries may be classified as small entities.


The Cranberry Marketing Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met
on August 23, 1994, and unanimously recommended modifying the administrative rules in effect under the order concerning
delinquent handler assessments. The modification would increase the interest charge from 1 percent to 11/2 percent
per month and add a late payment charge of 5 percent on delinquent handler assessments. 

Under section 929.41 of the order, each person who first handles cranberries is required to pay a pro-rata share of
the cost of administering the program. This cost is in the form of a uniform assessment rate applied to each handler's
acquisitions. 

Section 929.41 also provides that if a handler does not pay an assessment within the time prescribed by the committee,
the assessment may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. 

Section 929.152 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order specifies that delinquent assessments be subject
to an interest charge of 1 percent per month on any unpaid assessment balance beginning 30 days from the due date prescribed
by the committee. The committee currently schedules two assessment payments during the crop year which begins on
September 1. Assessments equal to 100 percent of the prior crop year's assessment obligation are due on October 1.
If a handler's October 1 payment is not sufficient to meet the current crop year's assessment obligation then a second
payment, making up the difference, is required by April 1. If the October 1 payment exceeds the current crop year's
assessment obligation then the committee refunds the difference on or before April 15. 

Assessments are the main source of funds to pay committee expenses. The failure of handlers to pay assessment obligations
promptly results in added expense and operational problems for the committee. The committee has frequently encountered
difficulty in collecting assessments from some handlers. To attempt to collect, the committee must incur the added
expense of sending out additional invoices and contacting each delinquent handler by phone, in person, or by fax.
Nonpayment or late payment of assessments hampers the operation of the committee. 

The authority to levy late payment and interest charges on delinquent assessments was added in 1973 to address the
failure of handlers to pay their assessments promptly. Consequently, in 1978 an informal rulemaking change (43 FR
29764, July 11, 1978) was approved which established a one percent interest charge per month to address this problem.


However, the current interest charge of one percent per month is not sufficient to induce handlers to comply with the
assessment provisions. Competition in the cranberry industry has increased. The number of handlers regulated by
the order has increased, and many of these additional handlers have been more reluctant to pay assessments in a timely
manner. The increase in charges on delinquent assessments would encourage these handlers to pay their assessments
more promptly. 

Charges would not be imposed until the end of the month if handler assessments are invoiced up to the 15th of the month
and would be levied at the end of the following month if the handler assessment is invoiced later than the 15th of the
month. Handlers would have ample time to pay their assessments and avoid incurring the additional charges. Any amount
paid by the handler would be credited upon receipt in the committee office. These additional charges would apply to
any unpaid assessments which become due to the committee after the effective date of this rule change. 

A 30-day comment period is provided to allow interested persons an opportunity to respond to this proposal. All written
comments timely received will be considered before a final determination is made on this matter.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal 
would require replacement of certain fuse pins on the upper link of the inboard and 
outboard struts. This AD also would require inspections to detect corrosion or cracks of 
certain fuse pins, and replacement, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by reports of 
cracked or corroded fuse pins on the upper link of the inboard and outboard struts, which 
could result in fracturing of the pins. The actions specified by the proposed AD are 
intended to prevent failure of the strut and separation of an engine from the airplane due 
to fracturing of the fuse pins.

Discussion 



The FAA received several reports of cracked fuse pins on the upper link of the 
inboard and outboard struts on Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. Several pins also 
showed evidence of corrosion. The fuse pins involved in these reports were ``bottle bore 
style'' fuse pins installed in the forward position of the struts. The cracking initiated in a 
machining groove in the inner recess of the pin bore, and it propagated due to fatigue. 
Cracking of the pins occurred on some airplanes as early as 9,366 total flight cycles (on 
the airplane) and 42,493 total flight hours. One of the reports involved the complete 
fracture of both shear planes on the fuse pin; consequently, that pin had no load carrying 
capability. Analysis of several of the cracked fuse pins indicated that fracturing occurred 
in the recess area of the pin bore. 

Corrosion may cause cracking of the fuse pins; this could lead to fracturing of the 
fuse pins. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the strut and 
separation of an engine from the airplane. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
747-54A2166, dated April 28, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of 
``bulkhead style'' and ``bottle bore style'' fuse pins, installed in the forward position of the 
upper link on the inboard and outboard struts, with either a 15-5 corrosion-resistant steel 
fuse pin (also known as a ``third generation'' pin) or a new bulkhead style pin. (This alert 
service bulletin specifies that installation of the third generation pin is preferred.) The 
alert service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to 
detect corrosion of the bulkhead style pins; magnetic particle inspections to detect cracks 
in these pins; and replacement of any cracked or corroded pin with a third generation pin 
or a new bulkhead style pin. 

The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service Bulletin 747-54-2155, dated 
September 23, 1993, as an additional source of service information for replacement of 
certain fuse pins, installed in the forward and aft positions of the upper link, with third 
generation pins. (Although there have been no reports of cracked pins in the aft position, 
replacement of the pin in the forward position with a third generation pin necessitates that 
the aft pin also be replaced with a third generation pin in order to preserve the function 
and location of the primary structural fuse.) 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require replacement of 
bottle bore style fuse pins, installed in the forward position of the upper link on the 
inboard and outboard struts, with either third generation fuse pins or new bulkhead style 
pins. This proposed AD also would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect 
corrosion of bulkhead style fuse pins; magnetic particle inspections to detect cracks in 
those pins; and replacement of any corroded or cracked bulkhead style fuse pin with a 
third generation fuse pin or with a new bulkhead style pin. Installation of a third 
generation fuse pin, if accomplished, would constitute terminating action for the 
inspection requirements of the proposed AD. The actions would be required to be 
accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 

The manufacturer has advised that it is currently developing a modification 
program for the engine strut that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by 
this AD. Once this modification program is developed, approved, and available, the FAA 
may consider additional rulemaking.

There are approximately 869 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in 
the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 147 airplanes of U.S. registry would be 
affected by this proposed AD. 

It would take approximately 122 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
proposed replacement of fuse pins with bulkhead style pins. The average labor rate is 
$60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact on U.S. operators who 
replace fuse pins with bulkhead style pins is estimated to be $7,320 per airplane. 

It would take approximately 140 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
proposed replacement of fuse pins with third generation pins. The average labor rate is 
$60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact on U.S. operators who 
replace fuse pins with third generation pins is estimated to be $8,400 per airplane. 

It would take approximately 1.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
proposed inspections (in addition to the work hours necessary for fuse pin replacement). 
The average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact 
on U.S. operators for the proposed inspections is estimated to be $90 per airplane per 
inspection. 

The cost of required replacement parts would vary from airplane to airplane, 
depending upon the current airplane configuration. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 

The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the 
accomplishment of the proposed inspection and replacement actions were to be 
conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions, for the 
most part, would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally 
scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the 
actual number of necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. 
Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. 

The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy 
condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to 
address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise 
be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to 
maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing 
those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of 
maintaining safe aircraft, prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if 
they were not required to do so by the AD. 

A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As 
a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and 
be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA 
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In 
adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the 
determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, 
as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that the 
original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed 
actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has 
already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this 
proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Proposed Amendment 



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the 
Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation 
Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 
11.89. 


 39.13 

[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 







Boeing:

 Docket 94-NM-123-AD. 





Applicability: Model 747 series airplanes; line numbers 1 through 967 inclusive, 
and 969 through 992 inclusive; excluding airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney 
PW4000 or General Electric CF6-80C2 series engines; certificated in any category.

Note 1:

 This AD does not require that the actions be accomplished on the struts of airplanes having straight bore fuse pins
(installed on Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or General Electric CF6-80C2
series engines) or 15-5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins. 




Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 

To prevent failure of the strut and loss of an engine due to corrosion or cracking of the fuse pins, accomplish the following:


(a) For airplanes having bottle bore style fuse pins in the forward position on the upper link: Replace any bottle bore
style fuse pin with a new bulkhead style fuse pin in the forward position, or with 15-5 corrosion resistant steel
(third generation) fuse pins in the forward position, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-54A2166,

dated April 28, 1994, at the later of the times specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD. 

(1) Prior to the accumulation of 5,000 landings on the fuse pin, or within 5 years since installation of the pin, whichever
occurs first. Or 

(2) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD. 






Note 2:

 Third generation fuse pins are installed in pairs (in the forward and aft positions). Therefore, replacement of an
individual upper link fuse pin in the forward position with a third generation pin also would necessitate replacement
of the pin in the aft position. 



Note 3:

 The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service Bulletin 747-54-2155, dated September 23, 1993,
as an additional source of service information for replacement of the fuse pins with 15-5 corrosion resistant
steel (third generation) fuse pins. Installation of these third generation fuse pins is preferred over installation
of bulkhead style fuse pins. 




(b) For airplanes having bulkhead style fuse pins in the forward position on the upper link: Perform a detailed visual
inspection to detect corrosion of the pins, and a magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks, in accordance with
Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-54A2166, dated April 28, 1994, at the later of the times specified in paragraphs
(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD. 

(1) Prior to the accumulation of 8,000 landings on the fuse pin, or within 8 years since installation of the pin, whichever
occurs first. Or 

(2) Within 12 months after the effective date of this AD. 

(c) If no corrosion or crack is found during the inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD, repeat the inspections
thereafter at the intervals specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD, as applicable. 

(1) For the inboard and outboard struts on airplanes other than those identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this AD: Repeat
the inspections at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. 

(2) For the outboard struts on airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211-524G or -524H series engines:
Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 2,000 landings.






Note 4:

 The outboard struts of airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce 
RB211-524G or -524H series engines are equipped with thick wall ``4330 steel'' bulkhead style fuse pins
in the forward position of the upper link. Crack propagation to critical length in these thick wall pins is slower than
for pins installed on the struts of airplanes equipped with engines other than the Rolls-Royce RB211-524G or
-524H series.




(d) If any corrosion or crack is found during any inspection required by this AD, prior to further flight, replace the
corroded or cracked pin with either a new bulkhead style fuse pin in the forward position of the upper link, or with 15-5
corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins in the forward and aft positions of the upper link, in accordance
with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-54A2166, dated April 28, 1994. 

(1) If the corroded or cracked fuse pin is replaced with a new bulkhead style fuse pin, prior to the accumulation of 8,000
landings on the new pin, or within 8 years since installation of the new pin, whichever occurs first, perform a detailed
visual inspection to detect corrosion of the new pin, and a magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks of the new
pin, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-54A2166, dated April 28, 
1994. Repeat these inspections thereafter at the interval specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this
AD, as applicable. 

(i) For the inboard and outboard struts on airplanes other than those identified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this AD:
Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 1,000 landings. 

(ii) For the outboard struts on airplanes equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211-524G or -524H series engines:
Repeat the inspections at intervals not to exceed 2,000 landings. 

(2) If the corroded or cracked fuse pin is replaced with a 15-5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation)
fuse pin, no further action is required by this AD. 

(e) Installation of 15-5 corrosion resistant steel (third generation) fuse pins in the forward and aft positions
of the upper link on the inboard or outboard strut constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD.


(f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane
Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO.






Note 5:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Seattle ACO.




(g) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas
Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 (military) series airplanes, and Model MD-88 airplanes,
that currently requires certain inspections and structural modifications. This action would require additional
inspections and structural modifications. This proposal is prompted by an evaluation conducted by the Airworthiness
Assurance Working Group (AAWG), Model DC-9/MD-80 Task Group, which identified additional modifications
for mandatory action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural

capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long term continued operational
safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe, where feasible, rather than only by repetitive inspections
for known service problems.

Discussion 



On August 6, 1990, the FAA issued AD 90-18-03, amendment 39-6701 (55 FR 
34704, August 24, 1990), applicable to Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 (military) series airplanes,
and Model MD-88 airplanes, to require certain inspections and structural modifications. That action was prompted
by reports of incidents involving fatigue cracking, corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking in transport category
airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. These incidents have jeopardized the
airworthiness of the affected airplanes. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural
capabilities of the affected airplanes. 

Since the issuance of that AD, the Airworthiness Assurance Working Group 
(AAWG), Model DC-9/MD-80 Task Group, comprised of representatives from operators of Model DC-9/MD-80
series airplanes, the manufacturer, and the FAA, has completed its review of certain service bulletins that are applicable
to aging Model DC-9/MD-80 series airplanes. The Task Group has recommended these service bulletins for
mandatory inspection and structural modification in order to reduce the potential for major structural failure
of those airplanes. 

Consequently, McDonnell Douglas has issued Revision B to Report No. MDC 
K1572, ``DC-9/MD80 Aging Aircraft Service Action Requirements Document,'' dated January 15, 1993. The Task
Group's most recent recommendations for mandatory actions are contained in Tables 2.3, 2.4, and 3.1 of that document.
(The actions contained in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 were made mandatory by AD 90-18-03.) The FAA has reviewed and
approved that document. Tables 2.3 and 2.4 of the document reference the following service bulletins: 

1. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the slat drive mechanism; 

2. Four service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the doors; 

3. Eleven service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the fuselage; 

4. Four service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the horizontal stabilizers; 

5. Two service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the wings; 

6. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the engine thrust reverser system; 

7. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the nose gear steering; 

8. Two service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the engine pylon; 

9. One service bulletin that describes inspections and modification of the rudder; and 

10. Two service bulletins that describe inspections and modifications of the main landing gear structures. 

Table 3.1 of the document references the following service bulletins for 
mandatory inspections: 

1. One service bulletin that describes inspections of the doors; 

2. One service bulletin that describes inspections of the engine pylons; and

3. Two service bulletins that describe inspections of the wings. (These two 
service bulletins were made mandatory by AD 90-18-03.) 

The Task Group has also recommended, for mandatory modification, the actions 
contained in McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Service Bulletin 53-230, Revision 1, dated 
January 12, 1993. The FAA has reviewed and approved this service bulletin, which 
describes procedures for installation of doublers and clips at the intersections of upper 
longerons/intercostals and fuselage frames between longerons 10L and 10R at various 
overwing stations between Y=484.000 and Y=851.000, as applicable, depending upon 
series of the airplane. Accomplishment of these modifications would terminate the 
inspections required by AD 88-24-08 R2, amendment 39-6469 (55 FR 1002, January 11, 
1990), which requires external eddy current inspection to detect cracking of the fuselage 
skin and certain longerons, internal visual inspections of certain longerons, and repair of 
any findings of cracking. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 90-18-03 
to require additional structural modifications and inspections. The actions would be 
required to be accomplished in accordance with the document described previously. 

There are approximately 892 Model DC-9 and C-9 (military) series airplanes of 
the affected design in the worldwide fleet. 

The FAA estimates that 568 Model DC-9 and C-9 (military) series airplanes of 
U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90-18-03. The requirements of that AD 
were estimated to take approximately 946 work hours to accomplish, at a current average 
labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was estimated to 
be $15,140 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the total cost 
impact of AD 90-18-03 on U.S. operators of Model DC-9 and C-9 (military) series 
airplanes would be $38,152,560, or $67,170 per airplane, over the initial 4-year time 
period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, 
familiarization, or tool acquisition.) 

The FAA estimates that a total of 511 Model DC-9 and C-9 (military) series 
airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by the new requirements specified in this 
proposed AD. The new additional requirements proposed by this AD action would take 
approximately 638 additional work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor 
rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost an additional $37,027 per airplane. 
Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. 
operators is estimated to be $36,851,787, or $72,117 per airplane, over a 4-year time 
period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, 
familiarization, and tool acquisition.) 

There are approximately 1,090 Model DC-9-80 series airplanes and Model 
MD-88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. 

The FAA estimates that 173 Model DC-9-80 series airplanes and Model MD-88 
airplanes of U.S. registry were originally affected by AD 90-18-03. The requirements of 
that AD were estimated to take approximately 47 work hours to accomplish, at a current 
average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost for required modification kits was 
estimated to be $752 per airplane. Based on these figures, the FAA estimated that the 
total cost impact of AD 90-18-03 on U.S. operators of Model DC-9-80 series airplanes 
and Model MD-88 airplanes would be $577,301, or $3,337 per airplane, over the initial 
4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, set-up, 
familiarization, or tool acquisition.) 

The FAA estimates that a total of 615 Model DC-9-80 series airplanes and Model 
MD-88 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by the new requirements specified in 
this proposed AD. This increase in the number of affected airplanes is due to various 
reasons, including transfer of ownership and the fact that additional airplanes have 
accumulated time-in-service since the issuance of AD 90-18-03 and have reached the 
threshold for modification/inspection. The new additional requirements proposed by this 
AD action would take approximately 13 additional work hours per airplane to 
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost an 
additional $943 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total additional cost impact of 
this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,019,670, or $1,658 per airplane, 
over a 4-year time period. (These figures do not include the cost of downtime, planning, 
set-up, familiarization, or tool acquisition.) 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished the currently required or the newly proposed requirements 
of this AD action; however, it can reasonably be assumed that a majority of affected 
operators have already initiated the inspections and structural modifications required by 
AD 90-18-03 [retained in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this AD] and many may have already 
initiated the additional inspections and structural modifications proposed in this new AD 
action. 

The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the 
accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' 
actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be 
accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane 
inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of 
necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any 
costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations in order to more clearly reflect Customs statutory authority
to open and examine baggage and vehicles without the permission of the owners of the baggage and vehicles. These amendments
will make the pertinent Customs regulations consistent with Customs statutory authority to inspect and search baggage
and vehicles coming into the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



There are several statutory provisions which give the 
U. S. Customs Service the authority to open and examine baggage. The primary provisions are sections 482, 1461, 1462,
1496, 1581 and 1582 of Title 19, United States Code (19 U.S.C. 482, 1461, 1462, 1496, 1581, and 1582). Section 482 authorizes
Customs to search vehicles and persons and to seize undeclared merchandise or merchandise imported contrary to law.
Section 1461 authorizes Customs to inspect all merchandise and baggage brought into the United States from contiguous
countries. Section 1461 also authorizes Customs officers to require that owners of baggage open it or furnish keys
for doing so. 

Section 1462 authorizes Customs to inspect the contents of all baggage and vehicles brought into the United States.
Section 1462 also authorizes Customs to seize and forfeit the contents of such imported baggage or vehicle which is
subject to duty or which constitutes a prohibited importation. Section 1496 authorizes Customs to examine the baggage
of people arriving in the United States. Section 1581(a) authorizes Customs to board vessels and vehicles and to examine,
inspect and search the vessels or vehicles and everyone and everything thereon. Section 1582 authorizes the Secretary
of the Treasury to write regulations concerning the search of persons and baggage. It also authorizes officers or
agents of the United States Government to detain and search, under such regulations, any persons coming into the United
States from foreign countries. 



Proposal



The statutes cited above grant Customs broad authority to inspect, search and seize baggage and vehicles coming into
the United States. The current Customs Regulations do not accurately reflect these statutes; therefore, Customs
intends to revise the regulations, specifically 19 CFR 123.63 and 19 CFR 148.21, to more clearly reflect the fact that
Customs has the statutory authority to open and examine baggage, vehicles and compartments thereof without the permission
of the owners. Of course, if at all possible, Customs will ask the owner or operator to unlock the vehicle, compartment
or baggage. 



Comments 



Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to written comments timely submitted to Customs. Submitted
comments will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Inspection Act (5 U.S.C. 552),
 1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and  103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)),
on regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., at the Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations
and Rulings, 1099 14th Street NW., Suite 4000, Washington, D.C.

Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 




Based upon the supplementary information set forth above and because the opening and examination of baggage and merchandise
is mandated by the statutes cited above, pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601


et seq.

), it is certified that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Accordingly, the proposed amendments are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements
of 5 U.S.C. 603 or 604. This document does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified
in Executive Order 12866. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of this document was Janet L. Johnson, Regulations Branch. However, personnel from other offices
participated in its development.

2. It is proposed to revise  123.63 to read as follows: 



 123.63

Examination of baggage from Canada or Mexico. 



(a) 

Opening vehicle or compartment to examine baggage. 

Customs officers are authorized to unlock, open, and examine vehicles and compartments thereof for the purposes
of examining baggage under sections 461, 462, 496, 581(a) and 582, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1461, 1462,
1496, 1581(a), and 1582) and 19 U.S.C. 482. However, to the extent practical, the Customs officer should ask the owner
or operator to unlock such vehicle or compartment first. Where the owner or operator is unavailable or refuses to unlock
the vehicle or compartment or where it is not practical to ask the owner or operator to unlock the same, it shall be opened
by the Customs Officer. If any article is subject to duty, or any prohibited article is found upon opening by the Customs
Officer, the whole contents and the vehicle shall be subject to forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1462. 

(b) 

Inspection of baggage. 

A Customs officer has the right to inspect all merchandise and baggage brought into the United 
States from contiguous countries under 19 U.S.C. 1461. He also 
has the right, under the same statute, to require that owners of such baggage open it or furnish keys for doing so. Where
the owner or agent is unavailable or refuses to open the baggage or furnish keys or where it is not practical to ask the
owner or agent to open or furnish keys to the same, it shall be opened by the Customs Officer. If any article is subject
to duty, or any prohibited article is found upon opening by the Customs Officer, the whole contents and the baggage
shall be subject to forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1462.

2. It is proposed to revise  148.21 to read as follows: 



 148.21

Opening of baggage, compartments, or vehicles. 



A Customs officer has the right to open and examine all baggage, compartments and vehicles brought into the United
States under Sections 461, 462, 496 and 582, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1461, 1462, 1496, and 1582) and
19 U.S.C. 482. To the extent practical, the owner or his agent should be asked to open the baggage, compartment or vehicle
first. If the owner or his agent is unavailable or refuses to open the baggage, compartment, or vehicle, it shall be
opened by the Customs officer. If any article subject to duty, or any prohibited article is found upon opening by the
Customs officer, the whole contents and the baggage or vehicle shall be subject to forfeiture, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.
1462.

Amendment to Rules for Extension of Patent Term


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office (Office) proposes to amend the rules directed to the extension of patent term to implement
the provisions of Public Law 103-179 (December 3, 1993) and to clarify the requirements for eligibility. The
proposed rules establish procedures for the Commissioner to issue an interim extension of the term of a patent where
the original term would expire before a product covered by the patent has received regulatory approval for commercial
marketing or use. The rules also are proposed to be amended to clarify that an application for patent term extension
must be based on regulatory activities performed by the patent owner or its agent.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Patent term extension has been available under 35 U.S.C. 156 for patents that claim certain products that are subject
to regulatory review before being commercially marketed or used. Prior to enactment of Public Law 103-179,
eligibility for patent term extension was dependent on regulatory approval of the product before the original patent
term expired. Public Law 103-179 has made it possible, under appropriate circumstances, to obtain interim
extensions of patent term where the regulatory process is likely to extend beyond the expiration of the patent term.


One purpose of the proposed rule change is to revise the present regulations contained in 37 CFR Part 1, Subpart F, to
include provisions for interim extension of the patent term prior to regulatory approval of the product that can now
form the basis of patent term extension. These proposed rules set forth procedures that govern the content and submission
of applications for an interim extension of a patent term, and procedures governing the interim extension determination
and issuance of interim patent term extension certificates by the Office.
Initial guidelines directed to the preparation and filing of applications for interim extensions of patent terms
as authorized by Public Law 103-179 were published as ``Guidelines For Interim Extension Under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5)
of a Patent Term Prior To Regulatory Approval of a Product For Commercial Marketing or Use_Public Law 103-179
(December 3, 1993)'' in the 

Official Gazette

 at 1159 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 12 (February 1, 1994). It is intended that those guidelines will continue in effect until
the promulgation of final rules based on the proposed rulemaking.
It is important to keep in mind the distinction between an interim patent term extension under  156(e)(2) and
the interim patent term extension provided for by Public Law 103-179 under  156(d)(5). The former applies
after regulatory approval has occurred and is addressed in 37 CFR 1.706. Interim patent term extensions under  156(e)(2)
are not affected by the proposed changes to the rules. The latter applies before regulatory approval has occurred
and is addressed in 37 CFR 1.780 and 1.790.
The eligibility criteria for obtaining an interim extension under  156(d)(5) are substantially the same as
for obtaining patent term extension under  156 after regulatory approval has occurred. Under the provisions
of Public Law 103-179, a patent owner or its agent may submit an application for an interim patent term extension
within six months, but not later than 15 days, of the original expiration date of the patent. At the time the application
is submitted, the regulatory review period must have advanced to the approval phase a defined in  156(g), but
must not have ended. For a new drug, for example, the approval phase is defined in  156(g)(1)(B)(ii) as the period
beginning on the date a new drug application was initially submitted for the new drug under section 505 of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
The content of the application for interim extension is proposed to be the same as for an application for patent term
extension following regulatory review, with certain modifications necessitated by the circumstances. For example,
the application for interim term extension will not be required to contain information about regulatory approval
since that event has not occurred. A fee is proposed for each interim extension application filed before regulatory
approval occurs_$400.00 for the initial application for interim extension and $200.00 for each supplementary application
for interim extension.

The processing of an application for interim patent term extension under Pub. L. No. 103-179 will not require
transmission of a copy of the application to the regulatory agency. However, it is contemplated that the Office will
consult with the regulatory agency, as it has been doing for the past 10 years under  156, on the question of eligibility
for patent term extension.


If the patent is eligible for extension but for the fact that it is still under regulatory review, the Office can extend
the patent term is one-year increments not to exceed five years from the expiration date. Any such extension would
terminate 60 days after market approval. Before the 60-day period expires, the patentee could submit an application
for patent term extension, supplying any additional information necessary to obtain any additional extension available
under  156.

The interim extension of patent term available under  156(d)(5) cannot exceed the extension from the original
patent term that would be available after regulatory approval. Thus, for example, a patent that was subject to the
two-year extension limitation of  156(g)(6)(C), could not obtain interim extension beyond two years from
the original patent term expiration date. However, after an interim extension under  156(d)(5) has been granted,
the amount of patent term extension available after regulatory review is controlled by either  156(d)(5) or
 156(g)(6) (A) or (B). In no case would the extension go beyond five years from the original expiration date of
the patent. However, for those situations falling under  156(g)(6)(C), where regulatory approval occurs
within the two-year period after the original expiration date of the patent, the extension after approval is measured
from the date on which the product receives permission for commercial marketing or use.  156(d)(5)(E)(ii).

Review of recent applications for patent term extension has revealed that the provisions of 37 CFR 1.785(c) may be
read as being inconsistent with 35 U.S.C. 156. The statute requires that an application for patent term extension
be filed by the patent owner or its agent. 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1). The statute further requires under  156(d)(1)(D)
a description of the activities undertaken by the applicant (i.e., the patent owner or its agent) during the regulatory
review period, and specifies in  156(d)(2)(B)(i) that the lack of due diligence by the applicant during the
regulatory review period may be taken into account. Given these statutory requirements, the Office has held that
in order to be eligible for patent term extension, the patent owner or its agent must have undertaken the activities
that lead to regulatory approval. If a patent owner has not been involved, either directly or indirectly, in the regulatory
review process, that patent owner has not lost any effective patent life since it never invested time and resources
necessary to obtain approval for commercial marketing or use. Accordingly, to the extent that  1.785 could
be interpreted to permit a patent owner to obtain a patent term extension where neither the patent owner nor its agent
were responsible for activities leading to regulatory approval, it was misleading and contrary to both the letter
and intent of  156.




Discussion of Specific Rules



Section 1.750, if amended as proposed, would be changed to also provide for an eligibility determination which will
be made on applications for interim extension filed in compliance with  1.790. The section is further modified
to limit the mailing of a notice of a final determination to applications filed in compliance with  1.740 after
the regulatory approval process is complete.

Section 1.760, if amended as proposed, would have the title recite that the section is directed to requests for interim
extensions of patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156(e)(2), to distinguish it from interim extensions available under Pub.
Law No. 103-179, proposed to be addressed in  1.780.

Section 1.765(a) if amended as proposed, would change the phrase (two occurrences) ``the Office of the Secretary''
to read ``the Office or the Secretary.'' The change provides that the applicant has a duty of disclosure to both the
Patent and Trademark Office and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculture.

Section 1.780, if amended as proposed, would provide that a certificate of interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5)
will be issued to the applicant. Section 1.780 would also provide for notification of the issuance of the certificate
of interim extension under 35 U.S.C.  156(d)(5), including the identity of the product currently under regulatory
review, to be published in the 

Federal Register.

Section 1.785, if amended as proposed, would require the applicant for extension, i.e., the patent owner or its agent,
to also have been the marketing applicant who obtained regulatory approval of the product for commercial marketing
or use. While regulatory approval can be obtained by a party other than the patent owner, that other party must have
been an agent of the patent owner when obtaining the regulatory approval in order for the patent owner to be eligible
to apply for extension of the patent term.

Section 1.790, if added as proposed, would provide for one or more interim extensions for periods of up to one year for
patents where the applicable regulatory review period described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(ii), (3)(B)(ii),
(4)(B)(ii), or (5)(B)(ii) of section 156(g) that began for the patented product may extend beyond the expiration
of the patent term in effect.

Paragraph (a) of proposed  1790 defines the time periods in which the initial interim extension application
and each subsequent interim extension application must be filed in the Office. In no event will interim extensions
be granted under proposed  1.790 for a period of extension longer than that to which the applicant would be entitled
to under 35 U.S.C. 156(c).

Paragraph (b) of proposed  1.790 would establish that the content requirements of the initial interim extension
applications are substantially the same as the content requirements for a formal application for extension of patent
term under  1.740 and a complete application under  1.741, except that the content requirements relate
to a product currently undergoing regulatory review. In other words, the interim extension applications contain
information available to the patent owner or its agent at the time the application is filed.

Paragraph (c) of proposed  1.790 permits each interim extension application after the initial interim extension
application to be limited to a request for a subsequent interim extension along with a statement that the regulatory
review period has not been completed and any materials or information required under   1.740 and 1.741
not present in the preceding interim extension application.

Section  1.795, if added as proposed, would provide that any interim extension granted under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5)
terminates at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the product involved receives permission
for commercial marketing or use. If within that 60-day period the patent owner or its agent files additional information
required under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1) not contained in the applications for interim extension, the patent shall be further
extended in accordance with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 156.



Other Considerations



The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
et seq., E.O. 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The proposed rule changes have been
determined to be not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business
Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the proposed rules would affect only a very
small number of patents eligible for interim patent term extension.

The Office has also determined that this notice has no federalism implications affecting the relationship between
the National Government and the States as outlined in E.O. 12612.

These rule changes will impose no substantial additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq. The paperwork burden imposed by adherence to the patent term extension rules is currently approved by
the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0651-0020. Comments relating to this requirement
should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for Commerce,
Patent and Trademark Office.

(a) A duty of candor and good faith toward the Patent and Trademark Office and the Secretary of Health and Human Services
or the Secretary of Agriculture rests on the patent owner or its agent, on each attorney or agent who represents the
patent owner and on every other individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in a patent term
extension proceeding. All such individuals who are aware, or become aware, of material information adverse to a determination
of entitlement to the extension sought, which has not been previously made of record in the patent term extension proceeding
must bring such information to the attention of the Office [of] > or < the Secretary, as appropriate, in accordance
with paragraph (b) of this section, as soon as it is practical to do so after the individual becomes aware of the information.
Information is material where there is a substantial likelihood that the Office [of] > or < the Secretary would consider
it important in determinations to be made in the patent term extension proceeding.

6. Section 1.780 is proposed to be revised to read as follows:



 1.780


Certificate of extension of patent term.



If a determination is made pursuant to  1.750 that a patent is eligible for extension and that the term of the patent
is to be extended, a certificate of extension, under seal,>or certificate of interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5)<will
be issued to the applicant for the extension of the patent term. Such certificate will be recorded in the official file
of the patent and will be considered as part of the original patent. Notification of the issuance of the certificate
of extension will be published in the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office. >Notification of the issuance
of the certificate of interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5), including the identity of the product currently
under regulatory review, will be published in the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office and in the Federal
Register.< No certificate of extension will be issued if the term of the patent cannot be extended, even though

(c) If an application for extension is filed which seeks the extension of the term of a patent based upon the same regulatory
review period as that relied upon in one or more applications for extension pursuant to the requirements of this subpart,
the certificate of extension of patent term will be issued on the application only if [_


(1) The applicant for extension] > the patent owner or its agent < is the holder of the regulatory approval granted
with respect to the regulatory review period [, or


(2) The holder of the regulatory approval granted with respect to the regulatory review period is not an applicant
and the applicant for extension holds express and exclusive authorization from the holder of the regulatory approval
to rely upon the regulatory review period as the basis for the application for extension, or


(3) The holder of the regulatory approval granted with respect to the regulatory review period is not an applicant
and no applicant for extension holds an express and exclusive authorization from the holder of the regulatory approval
to rely upon the regulatory review period as the basis for the application for extension and the application is for
extension of the patent having the earliest date of issuance of those patents for which extension is sought based upon
the same regulatory review period].


(d) An application for extension shall be considered complete and formal regardless of whether it contains the identification
of the holder of the regulatory approval granted with respect to the regulatory review period [or express and exclusive
authorization from the holder of the regulatory approval to rely on the regulatory review period for extension].
When an application contains such information, or is amended to contain such information, it will be considered in
determining whether an application is eligible for an extension under this section. A request may be made of any applicant
to supply such information within a non-extendable period of not less than one (1) month whenever multiple applications
for extension of more than one patent are received and rely upon the same regulatory review period. Failure to provide
such information within the period for response set shall be regarded as conclusively establishing that the applicant
is not the holder of the regulatory approval [and is not expressly and exclusively authorized by the holder of the regulatory
approval to seek the extension being sought].


(e) Determinations made under this section shall be included in the notice of final determination of eligibility
for extension of the patent term pursuant to  1.750 and shall be regarded as part of that determination.

8. Section 1.790 is proposed to be added to read as follows:


> 1.790

Interim extension of patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5).




(a) An owner of record of a patent or its agent who reasonably expects that the applicable regulatory review period
described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(ii), (3)(B)(ii), (4)(B)(ii), or (5)(B)(ii) of subsection (g) of 35 U.S.C.
156 that began for a product that is the subject of such patent may extend beyond the expiration of the patent term in
effect may submit one or more applications for interim extensions for periods of up to one year each. The initial application
for interim extension must be filed during the period beginning 6 months and ending 15 days before the patent term is
due to expire. Each subsequent application for interim extension must be filed during the period beginning 60 days
before and ending 30 days before the expiration of the preceding interim extension. In no event will the interim extensions
granted under this section be longer than the maximum period of extension to which the applicant would be entitled
under 35 U.S.C. 156(c).


(b) A complete application for interim extension under this section shall include all of the information required
for a formal application under  1.740 and a complete application under  1.741. Sections (a)(1), (a)(2),
(a)(4), and (a)(6) through (a)(17) of  1.740 and  1.741 shall be read in the context of a product currently
undergoing regulatory review. Paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(5) of  1.740 are not applicable to an application
for interim extension under this section.


(c) The content of each subsequent interim extension application may be limited to a request for a subsequent interim
extension along with a statement that the regulatory review period has not been completed and any materials or information
required under  1.740 and  1.741 not present in the preceding interim extension application.< 

9. Section 1.791 is proposed to be added to read as follows:



> 1.791

Termination of interim extension granted prior to regulatory approval of a product for commercial marketing or use.




Any interim extension granted under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) terminates at the end of the 60-day period beginning on the
date on which the product involved receives permission for commercial marketing or use. If within that 60-day period
the patent owner or its agent files an application for extension under  1.740 and  1.741 including any
additional information required under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1) not contained in the application for interim extension,
the patent shall be further extended in accordance with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 156.<

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; 
Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plan Revision, State of New Jersey 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve portions of a request from New Jersey to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) related
to the control of carbon monoxide and disapprove remaining portions. EPA is proposing approval of New Jersey's vehicle
miles travelled forecast, carbon monoxide emission inventory, oxygenated fuels rule, and multi-state coordination.
EPA is also proposing approval of the employee commute option and transportation control measures as contingency
measures. In addition, EPA is proposing a limited approval and a limited disapproval of New Jersey's new source review
regulation which covers all nonattainment pollutants. EPA proposes to disapprove New Jersey's November 15, 1993,
proposal for an enhanced inspection and maintenance program. In addition, the attainment demonstration is also
being disapproved since it relies on the enhanced inspection and maintenance program as a control measure. These
revisions have been submitted in response to requirements established in the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, sets forth a number of requirements that states designated as moderate
nonattainment for carbon monoxide had to submit as revisions to their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by November
15, 1992. These requirements are: an attainment demonstration, an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance
program, an oxygenated fuels rule, a vehicle miles travelled forecast, contingency measures, a carbon monoxide
emission inventory, a revised New Source Review program, and multi-state coordination. In addition, a conformity
plan is required to be submitted by November 25, 1994. 
On November 15, 1992, New Jersey submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revisions to its
carbon monoxide SIP that addressed each of the above requirements for its two moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment
areas. In addition, in a submittal dated October 4, 1993, New Jersey submitted to EPA information on TCMs which New
Jersey will use as a contingency measure. 
The New Jersey portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area is classified
as a moderate 2 area (an area that has a design value of 12.8-16.4 ppm.), while the other area, Camden County, is
classified as a moderate 1 area (an area with a design value of 9.1-12.7 ppm). The New York-Northern New Jersey-Long
Island carbon monoxide nonattainment area is part of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Consolidated
Metropolitan Statistical Area and includes the Counties of Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Union, and parts of Passaic. The
nonattainment area in Passaic County includes the Cities of Clifton, Paterson, and Passaic. The remainder of the
State is either in attainment or is not classified. 
EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how it intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions
submitted in order to meet title I requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28,
1992)). The reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the title I requirements
and what EPA views as necessary to adequately comply with title I provisions. The following summarizes EPA's evaluation
of New Jersey's SIP submittals and EPA's proposed actions. The details of EPA's review of New Jersey's submittals
are contained in the Technical Support Document available at EPA's Region II office. 


Attainment Demonstration 


Section 187(a)(7) of the Act requires each state that contains all or part of a moderate 2 area to submit to the Administrator
an attainment demonstration by November 15, 1992. This attainment demonstration should document how the State will
attain the 8-hour carbon monoxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 9 ppm by December 31, 1995.

New Jersey, using emissions from the EPA-approved MOBILE4.1 model, demonstrated attainment of the carbon monoxide
standard with the EPA-approved CAL3QHC air quality dispersion model. New Jersey took emission reductions credit
from an enhanced inspection and maintenance program, oxygenated fuels, and the federal motor vehicle control program
(vehicle turnover) as control measures to attain the standard. The following is a summary of the methods and modeling
techniques New Jersey used in its attainment demonstration. A more detailed explanation of this modeling is contained
in the Technical Support Document. 
To begin the modeling process, New Jersey first selected then ranked the ``worst case'' intersections that the New
Jersey Department of Transportation, working in conjunction with the county and local governments, had identified.
Next, New Jersey chose a background concentration and an ambient temperature for use in the CAL3QHC intersection
model. Once all the parameters were selected, the modeling was performed and maximum future carbon monoxide concentrations
were predicted. 
New Jersey ranked the ``worst case'' intersections with a technique other than that prescribed by the EPA guidance,
``Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections.'' This guidance specifies that such rankings
use Level Of Service (LOS) calculations which measure the operating conditions in the intersection and how those
conditions affect traffic flow and delay. As such, LOS is a measure of the combined traffic volume, signal timing,
and related congestion and delay. New Jersey did not have LOS data in its database, and the time and cost of collecting
this data prohibited the use of this method. Instead, New Jersey used traffic volume information and a survey conducted
by the New Jersey Department of Transportation which examined the geometry of various intersections. Since this
traffic volume information is closely related to delay, it is a valid alternative method for ranking. 
New Jersey then used the EPA default background carbon monoxide value of 3.5 ppm for a central business district from
the ``Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections.'' This background was used in place of
EPA's Urban Airshed Model (UAM) or RAM model. Given the lack of reliable gridded traffic information, the UAM or RAM
model would have no advantage over the default value in this instance. Further, the default value was shown to be conservative
when compared with background values for the entire New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide nonattainment
area. 
New Jersey, using the above parameters along with additional traffic and air quality data inputs required by the CAL3QHC
intersection model, then performed an air quality modeling analysis on the 25 ``worst case'' intersections. This
analysis demonstrated that all of the modeled intersections will attain the 8-hour carbon monoxide standard of 9
ppm. The highest value obtained was 8.0 ppm, which is 11% below the 8-hour carbon monoxide standard. Since air quality
at the most congested intersections was determined to be below the standard, New Jersey has demonstrated that the
entire area will be in attainment for carbon monoxide by December 31, 1995. 
New Jersey used appropriate modeling techniques and modeling inputs in this demonstration, however one of the control
measures used to demonstrate attainment, the enhanced inspection and maintenance program, submitted on November
15, 1993 has not been fully adopted in accordance with State requirements. In addition, New Jersey has publicly declared
its intention to make a revised submittal at a later date. Therefore, EPA is proposing to disapprove the attainment
demonstration because it is dependent on an unadopted program.

Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Program 



Section 187(a)(6) of the Act requires implementation of enhanced inspection and maintenance programs in moderate
2 carbon monoxide nonattainment areas which includes provisions as required under section 182(c)(3) concerning
serious ozone nonattainment areas. Such provisions require implementation of an enhanced inspection and maintenance
program in urbanized areas with a population greater than 200,000. 

On November 15, 1993 New Jersey submitted proposed regulations and other information pertaining to the enhanced
inspection and maintenance program. Since New Jersey did not submit a fully adopted enhanced inspection and maintenance
program, on February 2, 1994 EPA notified the State that this submittal was incomplete and a sanctions process was
begun. Because these regulations were not adopted at the time of their submittal (or since), EPA is proposing the disapproval
of the enhanced inspection and maintenance program as submitted. 



Oxygenated Fuels Rule_Subchapter 25 



Section 211(m) of the Act requires that states submit revisions to their SIPs to require an oxygenated gasoline program
by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment
areas having a design value of 9.1 ppm or greater based generally on 1988 and 1989 air quality data. Each state's oxygenated
gasoline program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7% oxygen by weight
during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide. Under
section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements generally are to cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in
the larger of either the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area or the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which
the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established by
the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months unless a state can demonstrate that, because of meteorological
conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances outside of such
reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1992 (57 FR 47849). 

In this guidance, EPA also announced the availability of an oxygenated gasoline credit program. Under a credit program,
marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content than is required
(i.e. an oxygen content greater than 2.7% by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset the sale of gasoline
with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines provide that
no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight. EPA also issued labeling regulations under section
211(m)(4) of the Act, which were published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1992. 

New Jersey was required to submit a revised SIP by November 15, 1992 under section 110 and part D of title I of the Act and
which was to include an oxygenated gasoline program for the New Jersey portions of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long
Island Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area. 

As part of the November 15, 1992, submittal, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) submitted
adopted amendments and new rule Subchapter 25, ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Vehicular Fuels,''
of Chapter 27, Title 7 of the New Jersey Administrative Code. Subchapter 25 contains the requirements for New Jersey's
oxygenated gasoline program, which was adopted by New Jersey on September 1, 1992.

A more detailed analysis of the submittal is contained in the Technical Support Document. The following is EPA's review
of the major elements of the State's submittal. 



Type of Program and Oxygen Content Requirement 



New Jersey has elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control
area. The regulation also contains a variance that allows, upon individual facility request and subsequent State
approval, the establishment of a 2.0% minimum oxygen content. Under EPA's credit program guidelines, all gasoline
sold or dispensed during the control period by each control area responsible party (CAR or Blender CAR) must contain
an average oxygen content of not less than 2.7% by weight. New Jersey has adopted an oxygen content requirement, though
it also provides for variances from this requirement. 



Applicability and Program Scope 



Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period established by the EPA Administrator
based on air quality monitoring data. New Jersey has established control periods consistent with the EPA guidance.


Subchapter 25 has an ``averaging period'' scheme which provides that all gasoline sold or dispensed within the control
areas during a one month averaging period must comply with the 2.7% average oxygen content standard. 

Subchapter 25 requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold statewide and divides New Jersey into a northern and southern
area. The two areas differ only in the relative length of their control periods: seven months (October 1 to April 30)
in the northern area and four months (November 1 to the last day of February) in the southern area. The length of each
control period is consistent with the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. 



Registration and Reporting Requirements 



EPA's credit program guidelines specify that all parties intending to sell or dispense gasoline obtained from a Control
Area Terminal should register with the state at least 30 days in advance of each control season. At the time of registration,
every CAR will be required to declare its intention to comply with the regulation. Upon acceptance, CAR identification
numbers should be issued by the state. EPA guidelines specify that no party should be allowed to generate, trade, buy
or sell credits without a CAR identification number. 

Subchapter 25 provides CAR identification numbers. However, if the applicant fails to provide all information requested
by the NJDEP, the application may be denied. 

EPA has also specified that records should be retained by all parties in the gasoline distribution system. EPA's guidelines
impose responsibilities on various parties in the gasoline industry. Persons who produce or import gasoline are
responsible for assuring that the gasoline is tested and that the accompanying documentation accurately reflects
oxygen content. Persons who transport, store, or sell gasoline have various responsibilities associated with assuring
that only oxygenated gasoline is sold or dispensed for use in control areas. Terminal owners and operators are responsible
for assuring that the oxygen content of the gasoline they receive, handle, or dispense is accurate. Retailers and
wholesale purchaser-consumers are responsible for assuring that gasoline intended for sale during the control
period contains at least 2.0% oxygen by weight if they are participating in the averaging program.

New Jersey requires all parties in the gasoline distribution network who are located or do business within a control
area, and whose product is eventually sold into the control area for ultimate use, to keep records concerning certain
day-to-day activities. 
New Jersey's regulation requires any terminal or facility that is granted a variance to submit to the NJDEP, on a monthly
basis during the applicable averaging period, a report that states the contemporaneous average of the oxygen content
of the gasoline transferred to or from that terminal or facility during that month. 
With respect to the implementation of an averaging program, EPA guidelines also require that CARs commission an annual
attest engagement (a report detailing relevant activities), performed by either an internal auditor or independent
Certified Public Accountant. Since New Jersey does not provide for the use of oxygenate credits in their averaging
program, there is no need for a requirement to conduct a review or audit for averaging purposes. 


Prohibited Activities 


EPA's credit program guidelines contain provisions designed to ensure that gasoline that fails to meet the minimum
oxygen content requirement is not available for use within a control area. Generally, CARs or blender CARs may not
transfer gasoline for use in a control area that contains less than the minimum percentage of oxygen by weight to parties
who are not themselves registered as CARs or blender CARs. EPA's guidelines further recommend that records be maintained.
New Jersey's program addresses these requirements. 


Transfer Documents 


EPA's credit program guidelines specify that transfer documents should include the following information: date
of the transfer, name and address of the transferor, name and address of the transferee, the volume of gasoline which
is being transferred, the proper identification of the gasoline as oxygenated or nonoxygenated, the location of
the gasoline at the time of the transfer, the type of oxygenate, and the oxygen content of the gasoline (for transfers
upstream of the control area terminal and for transfers between CARs, include the oxygenate volume of the gasoline).
Records are to be kept in a location where they are available for state review. 
Subchapter 25 requires that facilities and terminals keep such records available, upon request, for review by the
NJDEP. 
Subchapter 25 includes requirements related to transfer documentation in its regulation. These transfer document
requirements will enhance the enforcement of the oxygenated gasoline regulation by providing a paper trail for each
gasoline sample taken by State enforcement personnel. 


Enforcement and Penalty Schedules 


State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states
visit at least 20% of the regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product sampling
and record review. In addition, EPA guidelines recommend that each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule.
Penalties should reflect the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential
environmental harm associated with the violation. New Jersey's regulation contains a comprehensive penalty schedule
in accordance with EPA guidance. New Jersey, in addition to having authority to assess a civil administrative penalty,
reserves its authority to revoke a violator's operating certificate or variance.

Test Methods and Laboratory Review 


EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in Appendix D of 40 Code of Federal Regulation part 80. EPA has recommended,
in its credit program guidelines, that states adopt these sampling procedures. New Jersey has adopted EPA sampling
procedures, which include established federal testing procedures and tolerances. 


Labeling 


EPA requires the labeling of gasoline pumps and has strongly recommended that states adopt their own labeling regulations,
consistent with the federal regulation. New Jersey has adopted labeling regulations consistent with the federal
regulation. 
EPA's review of subchapter 25 and supporting materials indicates that New Jersey has adopted an oxygenated gasoline
regulation that meets the requirements of the Act. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve New Jersey's Subchapter
25 oxygenated fuels program.
 


Vehicle Miles Travelled Forecast 


Section 187(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires moderate carbon monoxide nonattainment areas, such as that portion of New
Jersey included in the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island nonattainment area, to submit a SIP revision that
forecasts vehicle miles travelled (VMT) through the year 1995. In addition, annual reports and annual updates are
required by the state, the first of these is required by September 30, 1994. 
The VMT forecast must meet two requirements. First, it must estimate the VMT from 1990 through 1995 using a method acceptable
to EPA, and must be conducted in the appropriate geographic area. Second, there must be proper coordination between
the state agencies involved in developing the VMT forecast. 
Contingency measures are to be implemented in a case where the actual annual VMT or the updated forecast exceeds the
most recent prior VMT forecast by 5.0 percent in 1994, 4.0 percent in 1995, and 3.0 percent thereafter. In addition,
if these annual exceedances are less than these maximum percentages but cumulatively exceed 5 percent, then contingency
measures are also triggered. 
The estimated VMT for 1990 and 1991 are 94.9 and 97.4 million miles per day, respectively. In addition, the future forecasts
are (in million miles per day) 99.8 for 1992, 102.2 for 1993, 104.6 for 1994, and 107.1 for 1995. 
EPA proposes to find that New Jersey has submitted documentation satisfying these requirements, and therefore proposes
approval of its VMT forecast SIP revision. 


Contingency Measures 


Section 187(a)(3) of the Act requires that states adopt contingency measures to take effect without further action
by the Administrator or the state if the state fails to attain the NAAQS by the required date or if the VMT forecast is
exceeded beyond the allowable limit as discussed in the VMT forecast section. New Jersey submitted three contingency
measures, the Employee Commute Option (ECO) program, an enhanced inspection and maintenance program (benefit from
emission reductions outside of the carbon monoxide nonattainment area), and Transportation Control Measures (TCMs)
to fulfill this requirement. The ECO program will act as a contingency measure for failure to attain the carbon monoxide
standard while the state-wide enhanced inspection and maintenance program and the TCMs will be used as measures for
exceeding the VMT forecast.

1. 

ECO Program 

New Jersey is required by section 182(d)(1) of the Act to submit its ECO program as part of its ozone nonattainment SIP.
New Jersey's program will apply to employers with 100 or more employees who arrive at the workplace between the hours
of 6 and 10 a.m. The goal of this program is to increase the average passenger occupancies (APO) by 25% above the average
for vehicles arriving at the workplace. This would decrease the amount of automobiles arriving at the workplace,
and therefore, decrease the VMT. 

New Jersey submitted a SIP revision on November 15, 1993 that contained an adopted ECO program. EPA is proposing to
approve the State's ECO program as a carbon monoxide contingency measure since it is an adopted measure which will
serve to reduce VMT. However, EPA will be taking action on the ECO program submittal as a requirement of the ozone SIP
in a separate 

Federal Register

 notice since there are specific requirements an ECO program must meet for an ozone SIP but not for a carbon monoxide
SIP. 

2. 

Statewide Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Program

 New Jersey also submitted this program as a revision for its ozone SIP, and it is identical to that required by section
187(a)(6) of the Act (see section on enhanced inspection and maintenance program earlier in this notice). Since the
program is being established on a state-wide basis, carbon monoxide reductions derived from outside of the Northeastern
New Jersey nonattainment area will have a benefit in the carbon monoxide nonattainment areas and could be used for
contingency purposes. Once adopted, the enhanced inspection and maintenance program will act as an additional contingency
measure should the VMT forecast be exceeded. 

3. 

TCMs 

The Act requires states in carbon monoxide non-attainment areas to develop VMT forecasts. In addition, states must
develop TCMs that will be used as contingency measures in the event that the VMT forecast included in the 1992 carbon
monoxide SIP is exceeded. 

New Jersey's SIP submittal includes TCMs as contingency measures. These TCMs are incorporated into three major program
areas, which includes traffic flow improvements, park & ride lots, and increased ridesharing. EPA proposes
to approve these TCMs as viable contingency measures to offset excess growth in VMT. 

EPA proposes to approve the ECO program as an adequate contingency measure for failure to attain the carbon monoxide
standard. While New Jersey identified two contingency measures should the VMT forecast be exceeded, only one measure
was adopted. EPA proposes to approve the TCMs as an adequate contingency measure for exceeding the VMT forecast. Once
the enhanced inspection and maintenance program is adopted, it will act as an additional contingency measure should
further carbon monoxide reductions be necessary. 



Carbon Monoxide Emission Inventory 



New Jersey submitted a comprehensive carbon monoxide emission inventory on November 15, 1992 as required by section
187(a)(1) and as described in section 172(c)(3) of the Act. Additional inventory information was submitted on January
12, 1993. 

The emission inventory represents a comprehensive, actual inventory of all carbon monoxide emission sources in
the nonattainment areas. It includes emissions from point, area, and mobile sources (see 1990 base year carbon monoxide
emissions summary in Tables 1 and 2). 

The inventory was developed according to EPA guidance and has been quality assured. Sources that emit in excess of
100 tons per year of carbon monoxide are defined as point sources. Stationary sources that emit below this threshold
are too small to be considered point sources and are, therefore, considered to be area sources. The area and off-highway
mobile sources include such categories as stationary source fuel combustion, aircraft, marine vessels, and railroads.
Highway mobile source emissions were calculated using EPA's MOBILE 4.1 model. Input parameters to this model included
VMT, speed, temperature, and registration distribution. 

EPA proposes to approve New Jersey's 1990 base year emission inventory for carbon monoxide. 

In addition, it should be noted that New Jersey may be undertaking a revised analysis of its attainment demonstration
and emissions budget based on more recent traffic information now being developed. EPA would evaluate, in a future


Federal Register

 notice, any additional information provided by New Jersey.

Multi-State Coordination



Section 187(e) of the Act establishes the requirements for ``multi-state carbon monoxide nonattainment areas,''
which are defined as single carbon monoxide nonattainment areas that cover more than one state. To satisfy this requirement,
states must develop and submit to EPA a joint workplan to demonstrate early cooperation and integration. This workplan
can be in the form of a letter co-signed by all states in the nonattainment area, or EPA has decided, it can consist of
signed individual letters from each of the states. New Jersey submitted its letter, containing a detailed schedule
of milestones and a commitment to coordinate with EPA and each of the states involved, on October 27, 1992.

Therefore, EPA proposes to find that New Jersey has fulfilled this requirement and proposes approval of this SIP revision.



Conformity Plan



Section 176(c) of the Act requires states to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable state SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by states must be consistent with federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed
states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992)).

The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both
transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance
plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to  51.396 of the transportation conformity rule, the
State of New Jersey is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures
consistent with those established in the federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, New Jersey is required to submit
a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal
rule by November 30, 1994, pursuant to  51.851 of the general conformity rule. Those deadlines have not yet come
due.

The State of New Jersey has committed to develop and submit a SIP revision containing conformity procedures that are
consistent with the final federal conformity rules. EPA will evaluate and take action at a later time on any such submittal.
Until EPA approves a conformity SIP revision for New Jersey, EPA's general conformity and transportation conformity
rules, along with the provisions of section 176(c), will govern conformity determinations.

According to EPA's transportation conformity regulation, 40 CFR 93.128, the conformity status of the transportation
plan and TIP shall lapse 120 days following the date of final disapproval of the control strategy implementation plan
revision, and no new project-level conformity determinations may be made. No new transportation plans, TIPs, or
projects may be found to conform until another control strategy implementation plan revision is submitted and conformity
is demonstrated according to transitional period criteria and procedures. Therefore, should EPA's proposed disapproval
be finalized, the conformity status of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority's transportation plan
and TIP will lapse 120 days later.



New Source Review Regulation_Subchapter 18



Section 173 of the Act requires states to submit New Source Review (NSR) revisions that, among other things, incorporate
new offset ratios and applicability limits in new source review permitting regulations by November 15, 1992.



I. Background



EPA is currently developing a proposed rule to implement all changes required by the 1990 Amendments in the new source
review provisions in parts C and D of title I of the Act. EPA will refer to the proposed rule as the most authoritative
guidance available regarding the approvability of the submittals. When final federal regulations are promulgated,
EPA will review those NSR SIP submittals on which it may have taken final action to determine whether additional SIP
revisions are necessary.

In this proposed rulemaking on New Jersey's nonattainment NSR SIP, Subchapter 18 ``Control and Prohibition of Air
Pollution from New and Altered Sources Affecting Ambient Air Quality,'' EPA is applying its current view of the Act's
requirements. New Jersey addressed all pollutants in its revision to Subchapter 18 and therefore, EPA is taking action
on the NSR program as it relates to all criteria pollutants.



II. Evaluation of State Program



The following summarizes EPA's evaluation of New Jersey's revised NSR rule and EPA's proposed action. The State of
New Jersey held a public hearing on November 5, 1992 to entertain public comment on its revised NSR implementation
plan. Subchapter 18 was adopted on February 19, 1993, and submitted to EPA on the same date as part its proposed revision
to its ozone SIP. EPA found the submittal to be complete on April 29, 1993.

General Nonattainment NSR Requirements



The statutory requirements for nonattainment NSR review permitting SIPs are found at sections 172, 173 and 182-189
of the Act. It is on this basis that EPA is making its decision today. The Act requires all states to have submitted the
following nonattainment NSR requirements to EPA by November 15, 1992: 
1. Provisions to ensure that the construction bans imposed by EPA may be lifted by states. New Jersey had no such bans
because it had an approved nonattainment NSR regulation in place. This provision, therefore, does not apply to New
Jersey. 
2. Provisions to assure that calculation of emissions offsets, as required by section 173(a)(1)(A) of the Act, are
based on the same emissions baseline used in the demonstration of reasonable further progress. New Jersey's emissions
baseline for offsets calculation is an inventory based on actual 1990 emissions. This provision meets federal requirements
and is, therefore, approvable. 
3. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(c)(1) of the Act, to allow offsets to be obtained in another nonattainment
area, if the area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other nonattainment
area contribute to a NAAQS violation in the area in which the source would construct. New Jersey has chosen not to allow
offsets from other nonattainment areas. This approach is more restrictive than the federal requirement and is, therefore,
approvable. 
4. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(c)(1) of the Act, to assure that any emissions offsets obtained in conjunction
with the issuance of a permit to a new or modified source must be in effect and enforceable by the time the new or modified
source commences operation. New Jersey has included a provision requiring such a demonstration from all permit applicants.
However subchapter 18 does not contain definitions of ``initiation of construction or operation.'' In addition
New Jersey's rule does not specify that changes to existing permits from sources which are to provide offsets must
be in place by the time of permit issuance to the new or altered source. New Jersey's rule must be clarified accordingly.
Therefore, these deficiencies are a basis for disapproval.
5. Provisions to assure that emissions increases from new or modified major stationary sources are offset by real
reductions in actual emissions as required by section 173(c)(1) of the Act. New Jersey has defined reductions to be
used as offsets as actual reductions in emissions that must be federally enforceable. This definition also applies
to the use of banked emission reductions. This definition meets federal requirements and is, therefore, approvable.

6. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(c)(2) of the Act, to prevent emissions reductions otherwise required
by the Act from being credited for purposes of satisfying the part D offset requirements. New Jersey has defined reductions
used as offsets as reductions not otherwise required pursuant to any federal or state law, rule, order, permit, or
other legal document. In addition, its definition states that emission reductions to be used as offsets cannot have
been relied upon to demonstrate attainment, maintenance of reasonable further progress or of a NAAQS. This definition
satisfies the requirements of the Act and is, therefore, approvable. 
7. Provisions, in accordance with sections 172(c)(4) and 173(a)(1)(B) of the Act, that reflect changes in the use
of growth allowances. Though New Jersey has no growth allowance program in place, it does have a program for banking
emissions reductions to be used as offsets. This program incorporates pre-1990 reductions which have been incorporated
into the emission inventory as future growth. This approach is consistent with the requirements for the achievement
of reasonable further progress. This provision meets the requirement of section 172(c)(4) of the Act and is, therefore,
approvable.

8. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(a)(5) of the Act, that require as a prerequisite to the issuance of any
part D permit, an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques
for proposed sources that demonstrates that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental
and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification. New Jersey has included this
analysis as part of its permit requirements. This provision is, therefore, approvable.

9. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(d) of the Act, for supplying information from nonattainment NSR permits
to EPA's control technology clearinghouse. New Jersey has not included this provision in its revised NSR nonattainment
rule. New Jersey must revise its rule to incorporate this provision. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval.

10. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(e) of the Act, that allow any existing or modified source that tests
rocket engines or motors to use alternative or innovative means to offset emissions increases from firing and related
cleaning if certain conditions are met, or impose a fee on such source. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not
include provisions which allow for these alternative means of meeting offset requirements. While the Act requires
this provision, since New Jersey has no sources which fall into this category, we are not proposing to disapprove on
this basis.

11. Provisions, in accordance with section 819 of the Act, that effectively exempt activities related to stripper
wells from the new NSR requirements of new subparts 2, 3, and 4 for PM-10, ozone, or carbon monoxide nonattainment
areas classified as serious or less, and having a population of less than 350,000. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment
rule does not include provisions which allow for these exemptions. However, since states are allowed under the Act
to implement NSR provisions that are more stringent than the Act requirements, New Jersey's approach is acceptable.

12. Provisions, in accordance with section 328 of the Act, to assure that sources located on the outer continental
shelf are subject to the same requirements applicable if the source were located in the corresponding onshore area.
New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions which address this requirement. It is EPA's understanding
that New Jersey has no sources to which this requirement would apply.

13. A definition, in accordance with sections 302(z) and 111(a)(3) of the Act, of ``stationary source'' reflecting
Congressional intent that certain internal combustion engines be subject to control under state programs, but excluding
the newly defined category of ``nonroad engines.'' New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions
which address this requirement. New Jersey must revise its definition of ``stationary source'' to exclude this category.
EPA, therefore, finds this as a basis for disapproval. EPA will be proposing a definition of ``nonroad engines'' in
its rulemaking package to implement provisions of part D of the Act.

14. Exemptions, in accordance with section 415(b)(2) of the Act, from nonattainment NSR provisions for installation,
operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment
rule does not include provisions which allow for these exemptions. However, since states are allowed under the Act
to implement NSR provisions that are more stringent than the Act requirements, New Jersey's approach is acceptable.

15. Provisions in accordance with section 173(a)(3) of the Act, that owners or operators of each proposed new or modified
major stationary source demonstrate the compliance of all other major stationary sources under the same ownership
in the state. New Jersey's revised rule requires this demonstration from all permit applicants. This provision is
approvable.

16. For new major stationary sources, Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) is to apply to each nonattainment pollutant
which the source has the potential-to-emit in major amounts. New Jersey's definition of LAER incorporates all necessary
requirements. New Jersey's regulations specify that LAER applies to sources which have the potential to emit regulated
pollutants above threshold levels. Application of LAER to the equipment constructed or altered is a requirement
for permit issuance. These provisions meet the federal requirements and are approvable.



NSR Requirements for Ozone



The statutory permit requirements for ozone nonattainment areas are generally contained in sections 172 and 173,
and in subpart 2 of part D of the Act. For all classifications of ozone nonattainment areas and for ozone transport regions,
states must adopt the appropriate major source thresholds and offset ratios, and provisions to ensure that any new
or modified major stationary source of nitrogen oxides (NO

X

) satisfies the requirements applicable to any major source of volatile organic compounds (VOC), unless a special
NO

X

 exemption is granted by the Administrator under the provision of section 182(f) of the Act. For serious and severe
ozone nonattainment areas, state plans must implement the requirements of sections 182(c) (6), (7) and (8) with regard
to modifications.

Though New Jersey contains marginal, moderate and severe ozone nonattainment areas, it has elected to treat the entire
State as a severe nonattainment areas for purposes of nonattainment review. Consequently, it has adopted uniform
major source threshold, offset ratio, and NO

X

 provisions for the entire State.

These are:








These provisions meet the requirements for severe nonattainment areas at sections 182(d) and (d)(2) of the Act. In
addition, New Jersey has adopted offset ratios for all pollutants, except lead, which increase with distance from
the source. Since this approach is stricter than that required under the Act, these offset ratios are approvable.

New Jersey's rule submittal does not include the additional modification provisions for serious and severe areas
required by sections 182(c) (6), (7) and (8) of the Act. First, the amended Act establishes a de minimis emissions threshold
of 25 tons for both VOC and (where applicable) NO

X

. Second, it requires an aggregation of past net increases over a 5-year period, even when the proposed increase itself
is below the de minimis level. The Act establishes different requirements if the modification occurs at sources emitting
less than 100 tons per year (TPY) of VOC or emitting 100 TPY or more of VOC. New Jersey must revise its rule to conform to
these requirements. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval.



NSR Requirements for Carbon Monoxide



The general statutory permit requirements for carbon monoxide nonattainment areas are contained in revised section
173, and in subpart 3 of part D of the Act. States must adopt the appropriate major source threshold and offset ratio.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

New Jersey contains areas classified as moderate nonattainment for carbon monoxide. New Jersey has established
a major source threshold of 100 TPY and an offset ratio that equals or exceeds 1.0:1.0 for these areas. These provisions
meet the federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable. 


NSR Requirements for PM-10 


The general statutory permit requirements for PM-10 nonattainment areas are contained in section 173 and in
subpart 4 of part D of the Act. For both classifications of PM-10 nonattainment areas, moderate and severe, states
must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, significance level for modifications, and provisions
for PM-10 precursors. 
New Jersey has no areas classified as PM-10 nonattainment areas. New Jersey has established a major source threshold
of 25 TPY, a minimum offset ratio which equals or exceeds 1.0:1.0, and a modification significance level of 15 TPY.
These provisions exceed the minimum federal requirements and are, therefore, approvable. If any area is subsequently
reclassified as nonattainment for PM-10, New Jersey will be required to amend its SIP and include the requirements
for PM-10 precursors and the applicable threshold, offset and significance level requirements for that area
classification. 


NSR Requirements for Sulfur Dioxide 


The general statutory permit requirements for SO

2

 nonattainment areas are contained in section 173, and in subpart 5 of part D of the Act. For SO

2

 nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold, offset ratio, and significance
level for modifications. 

New Jersey has one SO

2

 nonattainment area. New Jersey has established a major source threshold of 100 TPY, a minimum offset ratio which equals
or exceeds 1.0:1.0, and a modification significance level of 40 TPY. These provisions meet the federal requirements
and are, therefore, approvable. 


NSR Requirements for Lead 


The general statutory permit requirements for lead nonattainment areas are generally contained in section 173,
and in subpart 5 of part D of the Act. For lead nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source threshold,
offset ratio, and significance level for modifications. 
New Jersey has no lead nonattainment areas. New Jersey has established a major source threshold of 10 TPY, an offset
ratio of 1.0:1.0, and a modification significance level of 0.6 TPY. These provisions meet the federal requirements
for offset ratio and significance level, and exceed the requirements for major threshold level and are, therefore,
approvable. 


NSR Requirements for Nitrogen Dioxide 


The statutory permit requirements for nitrogen dioxide nonattainment areas are contained in section 173, and in
subpart 5 of part D of the Act. For nitrogen dioxide nonattainment areas, states must adopt the appropriate major source
threshold, offset ratio, and significance level for modifications. New Jersey did not address this requirement
since there are no nitrogen dioxide nonattainment areas in the State. 


General Savings Clause 


Section 193 of the Act states that no control requirement, in effect before November 15, 1990, in any area which is a
nonattainment area for any air pollutant, may be modified after November 15, 1990 unless the modification ensures
equivalent or greater emission reductions of that air pollutant. New Jersey's revised NSR rule contains three modifications
to control requirements. First, the revised regulations relax the NO

X

 emission offset ratio from 2.0:1.0 to 1.3:1.0. Second, the revised regulations relax the VOC offset ratio from 2.0:1.0
to 1.3:1.0. Third, the revised regulations relax the carbon monoxide applicability threshold from 50 to 100 TPY.
In all three instances, New Jersey has demonstrated that the revised rule, taken as a whole, provides equivalent or
greater emission reductions than the current rule. It thus complies with section 193, the General Savings Clause.



EPA Policy Issues 


EPA has identified the following provisions of New Jersey's NSR rule which do not adhere to current EPA guidance. 
1. Net Air Quality Benefit. Current EPA guidance (1989 SO

2

 Guidance EPA-450/2-89-019) states that a net air quality benefit analysis must be demonstrated
for sources that do not satisfy the location requirements for emission offsets as specified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix
S. According to that guidance, the net air quality benefit is made with a modeling analysis that predicts that the LAER
and emission offsets proposed will result in a net concentration change that is less than zero at an agreed upon number
of receptors within the nonattainment area of the emission increase. 
As in the Act prior to 1990, section 173(a) specifies that emission increases from a proposed major source or major
modification must achieve LAER and sufficient offsetting emission reductions in order to represent, when considered
together with other provisions of the SIP, reasonable further progress towards attainment of the NAAQS.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 173(c)(1), which was added in the 1990 amendments, specifies conditions on the location of emission reductions
that may qualify as offsets. EPA intends to continue to require the net air quality benefit test consistent with prior
practice, so that it can be assured that the area affected by the source progresses toward attainment on balance. It
need not be interpreted as requiring an air quality improvement at every location affected by the new source (44 FR
3279, (January 16, 1979)), but rather assuring progress toward attainment for the area where the new source is locating.
Also, as explained in the Offset Rule, the reviewing authority should consider atmospheric simulation modeling
for SO

2

, particulates, and carbon monoxide sources. Also, EPA's view in the Offset Rule continues to apply that in most cases
the permitting authority may assume that offsets obtained from an existing source on the same premises or in the immediate
vicinity of the new source and from the same effective stack height satisfy the net air quality benefit test. 
EPA believes that it is prudent for states to reserve the right in their regulations to reject emission reductions
proposed to satisfy offset requirements which do not provide a net air quality benefit in the nonattainment area where
the proposed emission increase will occur. EPA does not believe that a new source should be permitted which will inhibit
progress toward attainment due to the fact that the offsets are obtained from an inappropriate location. 
New Jersey's approach toward a net air quality benefit analysis is inadequate. This is because the Air Quality Impact
Analysis Section does not specifically require a dispersion modeling analysis which demonstrates a net decrease
in ambient impacts on balance in the nonattainment area where the net emission increase is proposed. This test is required
for major new or modified sources whose emission decrease (offset) does not meet the location requirements specified
in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. This test need not be performed at every location but rather on balance in the nonattainment
area of the proposed emission increase (refer to Technical Support Document). EPA requires that the NJDEP modify
subchapter 18, 7:27-18.4 to 18.5 to include a net air quality benefit test. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis
for disapproval. 
2. Calculation of ``Net Emission Increase''. EPA has identified a problem with the provision which requires the calculation
of ``Net Emission Increase.'' As part of EPA's review of New Jersey's revised nonattainment NSR rule, EPA evaluated
whether the formula used to determine whether a source is subject to this rule follows EPA guidance for determining
applicability. New Jersey's rule determines a ``net emission increase'' by using a modified ``potential to potential''
test. However, 40 CFR 51.165 requires that an ``actual to potential'' test be performed. Consequently, EPA cannot
approve this methodology and New Jersey must correct this deficiency in its rule. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis
for disapproval. 
3. Definition of ``Contemporaneous''. New Jersey defines ``contemporaneous,'' in reference to the construction
of new or altered equipment as ``* * * occurring within a time period which includes: 1. The five years
prior to the initiation of the construction; and 2. The period between the initiation of construction and the initiation
of operation of that new or altered equipment.'' However, New Jersey has not specifically defined the terms ``initiation
of construction'' and ``initiation of operation.'' Consequently, EPA cannot approve this definition of ``contemporaneous''
and New Jersey must correct this deficiency in its rule. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval.

NSR Conclusion 


 

The EPA is proposing to grant a limited approval and limited disapproval to New Jersey's rule for NSR in nonattainment
areas (NJAC 7:27-18). EPA cannot grant full approval under section 110(k)(3) of the Act because the rule does
not fully meet the requirements of part D of the Act. 


 In addition, because the provisions are not composed of separable parts, EPA cannot grant partial approval as provided
under section 110(k)(3). However, the rule does contain the major new requirements under the Act for new offset requirements,
lower emission thresholds, and new provisions for NO

X

 in ozone nonattainment areas. Consequently, this rule strengthens New Jersey's SIP. In light of EPA's rulemaking
authority under section 301(a), EPA is granting a limited approval of the rule in order to further progress in air quality
in the state. 


 At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of New Jersey's nonattainment NSR rule because the rule
lacks provisions that will:

 


 
1. Revise offset provisions such that permit changes in existing permits providing offsets must be in effect by the
time of permit issuance. 

 2. Supply information from nonattainment NSR permits to EPA's control technology clearinghouse; 

 3. Revise the definition of ``stationary source'' to exclude the new category of ``nonroad engines;'' 

 4. Add provisions for modifications in serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas required under sections 182(c)(6),
(7) and (8); 

 5. Provide a net air quality benefit test; and 

 6. Provide a methodology for calculating net emissions increase that adheres to EPA guidance and policy. 

 7. Provide definitions for ``initiation of construction'' and ``initiation of operation.''

 


 
If finalized, this disapproval would constitute a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally
57 FR 13566-13567). It should be noted that EPA's limited disapproval does not prevent EPA and the State of New
Jersey from enforcing the NSR rule. 


 

Summary 


 

EPA is proposing approval of New Jersey's vehicle miles travelled forecast, emission inventory, Subchapter 25_oxygenated
fuels rule, and the employee commute option and transportation control measures as contingency measures, and the
multi-state coordination as revisions to its carbon monoxide SIP. EPA is also proposing a limited approval and a limited
disapproval of New Jersey's Subchapter 18_new source review regulation. EPA is proposing a disapproval of New Jersey's
enhanced inspection and maintenance program since it has not been adopted. In addition, since the attainment demonstration
relies on the enhanced inspection and maintenance program, the attainment demonstration is also being proposed
for disapproval. 


 For those elements for which EPA is proposing disapproval, under section 179(a) of the Act, the State of New Jersey
would have up to 18 months after final disapproval to correct the deficiencies responsible for the disapproval before
EPA would be required to impose sanctions. Section 179(b) describes the sanctions available to the Administrator.
Any final disapproval also would trigger the section 110(c)(1) Federal Implementation Plan provision of the Act.
To obtain full approval of this carbon monoxide SIP, New Jersey must correct the identified deficiencies in the new
source review regulation, and an enhanced inspection and maintenance program must be submitted and approved. 


 Nothing in this rulemaking should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.



 This proposed rule has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions. The Office of Management and Budget has agreed to continue the temporary wavier until such time
as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on 
September 30, 1993. 


 Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that SIP approvals under sections 107, 110 and 172 will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. SIP approvals do not create any new requirements
but simply approve requirements that are already state law. SIP approvals, therefore, do not add any additional requirements
for small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis for a SIP approval would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of the
state actions. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes that an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established for residues of FD &
C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake (CAS Reg. No. 15790-07-5), 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole (CAS Reg.
No. 2440-22-4), and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (CAS Reg. No. 2082-79-3) when used
as inert ingredients (components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices) in pesticide formulations applied
to animals. Y-Tex Corp. requested this proposed regulation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Y-Tex Corp., P.O. Box 1450, 1825 Big Horn Ave., Cody, WY 82414, submitted a pesticide petition to EPA requesting that
the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose
to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylonitrile-butadiene
copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 900318-3), FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake (CAS Reg. No. 15790-07-5), 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)-benzotriazole
(CAS Reg. No. 244022-4), and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate when used as inert ingredients
(components of ear tags and similar slow-release devices) in pesticide formulations applied to animals. In the 

Federal Register

 of February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5502), EPA proposed such exemptions. One comment was received in response to the proposal.
The commenter claimed that among the bases for approval of the acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer was an erroneous
interpretation of the results of a risk assessment conducted on acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer by the U. S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). The Agency agreed with the commenter and, based upon additional information, reproposed
the exemption for acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer in the 

Federal Register

 of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38151).


No comments were received in response to the February 3, 1989 proposal on the tolerance exemptions for residues of
the other three substances, FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)-benzotriazole,
and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate. However, because of the length of time that has elapsed
since the original proposal, EPA is reproposing the exemption for FD & C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)-benzotriazole,
and octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate .

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300365]. All written comments filed in response to this petition will
be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday, except legal holidays.
 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

southern Washington and northeast Oregon. For the purposes of this document, the term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onions''
refers to sweet onions grown in the proposed production area, which consists of designated parts of Walla Walla County,
Washington, and designated parts of Umatilla County, Oregon. The proposed order and agreement would authorize production
and marketing research and marketing development and promotion projects, including paid advertising, and would
authorize container markings. The order would be administered by a ten-member committee consisting of six producer
members, three handler members, and a public member. The order would be financed by assessments on handlers of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions grown in the production area. A primary objective of this program would be to improve producer returns
by strengthening consumer demand through various promotional activities and by reducing production and marketing
costs through production and marketing research. Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers would vote in a referendum to
determine if they favor issuance of the proposed marketing order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior documents in this proceeding: Notice of Hearing, issued October 26, 1993, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 29, 1993 [58 FR 58105]. 
 

This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code,
and is therefore excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 
 

Preliminary Statement:

 Notice is hereby given of the filing with the Hearing Clerk of this recommended decision with respect to a proposed
marketing agreement and order regulating the handling of sweet onions grown in the Walla Walla Valley of Southeast
Washington and Northeast Oregon. This notice is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act, and the applicable
rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders 
[7 CFR Part 900]. 
 The proposed Federal marketing agreement and order (order) were formulated on the record of a public hearing held
at the Education Service District Building in Walla Walla, Washington, on November 15, 1993. The hearing was held
pursuant to the provisions of the Act. Approximately 25 witnesses, including Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers,
handlers, and a Washington State University researcher, testified in support of the order. Proponents emphasized
that Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers need a Federal marketing order to effectively compete with other sweet onion
producing areas. No one present at the hearing testified in opposition to the proposed order. At the close of the hearing,
January 15, 1994, was established as the date by which briefs, statements, and proposed corrections to the transcript
were due. None were filed.

The proponents testified that Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers, in order to remain competitive with other sweet
onion producing areas, must conduct research and promotion programs to reduce production and marketing costs and
increase sales. Such programs should include production and marketing research projects and promotion projects,
including paid advertising. 
Testimony indicated that voluntary research and development efforts by the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry have
not been successful because of the lack of a coherent research and development plan with broad-based industry support.
Also, a relatively small percentage of the U.S. onion crop is produced in the proposed production area in Walla Walla
County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon, and individual producers and handlers cannot implement an effective
research, marketing development, and promotion program. By contrast, most other onion growing areas in the United
States are large enough to convince private entities, such as seed companies, to conduct production research and
developmental efforts with the result being new varieties specifically suited to those areas. Proponents believe
that an industry-wide program is therefore necessary to enable the pooling of resources to address common problems.
A single producer or even two or three producers cannot marshal the resources necessary to conduct effective research,
marketing, and promotion programs. 


Small Business Consideration:

 In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service considered the economic impact of this action on small
entities. The record indicates that there are approximately nine handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions in the proposed
production area and 50 producers. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(SBA) (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the handlers and producers may be classified
as small entities. 
During the 1992 season, commercial shipments of 
Walla Walla Sweet Onions totaled about 390,000 hundredweight at an average f.o.b. price of $16.60 per hundredweight
for a total value of $6,474,000. An indeterminate volume, probably about 10 percent, was sold at roadside stands.
While there is a great variance in the size of individual handlers' operations, the record indicates that nearly all
of the handlers that would be regulated under this order would qualify as small firms under the SBA's definition. Witnesses
testified that because most of the producers and handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions are small, they are unable to
individually finance the types of research and promotion efforts needed by the industry. A marketing order program
would provide a means for these small entities to pool their resources and work together to solve their common problems.
Witnesses testified that such action is necessary for this relatively small industry to remain profitable in the
face of intense competition from larger industries. 
Acreage and supplies of Walla Walla Sweet Onions have declined in recent years, and proponents believe that the order
would provide a much needed means of halting the drop in grower returns experienced in past seasons. This would be achieved
by strengthening demand and developing new markets for existing supplies and encouraging increased production.
Also, costs could be reduced through production research. Thus, the order would be expected to have a positive impact
on producer returns. 
The order would authorize the collection of assessments from handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the designated
parts of Walla Walla County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. Assessment funds would be used to finance production
research projects that could reduce costs by reducing the occurrence of onion diseases, controlling plant pests,
and developing varieties with more desirable flavor, quality, and size. Assessment funds could also be used to strengthen
demand and expand markets for Walla Walla Sweet Onions through marketing research and development, and product promotion
programs, including paid advertising. Projects to develop better methods of handling, shipping or storing onions,
to explore additional or alternative uses of onions, to check nutritive values, and similar research are some examples
of marketing research. Examples of marketing development projects include exploring marketing possibilities,
contacting buyers, distributing educational material relating to the handling and marketing of onions, and the
dissemination of the results of current or past marketing research projects. 
The order would be administered by a committee composed of Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers, handlers, and a public
member nominated by growers and handlers and selected by the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary). Daily administration
of the order would be carried out by a staff hired by the committee. The order would not regulate the production of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions and would place no restriction on the quality or quantity of Walla Walla Sweet Onions that could
be handled.

The principal requirements of the order that would affect handlers would be the requirements that they pay assessments
on fresh market shipments of Walla Walla Sweet Onions to fund research and promotion programs and that container markings
would be regulated. The amount of the assessment rate is not specified in the proposed order, but witnesses at the hearing
indicated that an appropriate rate might be five cents per 50-pound bag for administrative costs; research and promotion
costs could require an additional five to seven cents per bag or more. Any assessment rate to cover committee expenses
that may be established would be recommended by the committee to the Secretary for approval. 


The order would also impose some reporting and recordkeeping requirements on handlers. Handler testimony indicated
that the expected burden that would be imposed with respect to these requirements would be negligible. Most of the
information that would be reported to the committee is already compiled by handlers for other uses and is readily available.
In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implement the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) and section 3504(h) of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping
requirements that may be imposed by this order would be submitted to OMB for approval. Those requirements would not
become effective prior to OMB approval. Any requirements imposed would be evaluated against the potential benefits
to be derived and it is expected that any added burden resulting from increased recordkeeping would not be significant
when compared to those anticipated benefits. 


Reporting and recordkeeping requirements issued under comparable marketing order programs impose an average annual
burden on each regulated handler of about one hour with a two year record requirement. It is reasonable to expect that
a comparable burden may be imposed under this order on the estimated nine handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. 

The Act requires that prior to the issuance of an order, a referendum be conducted of affected producers to determine
if they favor issuance of the order. The ballot material that will be used in conducting the referendum will be submitted
to and approved by OMB prior to use. It is estimated that it would take an average of 10 minutes for each of the approximately
50 Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers to participate in the voluntary referendum balloting. Additionally, it has been
estimated that it would take approximately ten minutes for each of the nine handlers to complete the marketing agreement.
In determining that the order would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,
all of the issues discussed above were considered. The order provisions have been carefully reviewed and every effort
has been made to eliminate any unnecessary costs or requirements. Although the order may impose some additional costs
and requirements on handlers, it is anticipated that the order would help to strengthen demand for Walla Walla Sweet
Onions. Therefore, any additional costs should be offset by the benefits derived from expanded markets and sales
benefitting handlers and producers alike. Accordingly, it is determined that the order would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small handlers or producers. 


Material Issues: 

The material issues presented on the record of the hearing are as follows: 
1. Whether the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the proposed production area is in the current of interstate
or foreign commerce, or directly burdens, obstructs, or affects such commerce; 

2. Whether the economic and marketing conditions are such that they justify a need for an order which will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act; 

3. What the definition of the production area and the commodity to be covered by the order should be; 

4. What the identity of the persons and the marketing transactions to be regulated should be; and 

5. What the specific terms and provisions of the order should be, including: 

(a) The definition of terms used therein which are necessary and incidental to attain the declared policy and objectives
of the order and the Act; 

(b) The establishment, composition, maintenance, procedures, powers and duties of a committee that would be the
local administrative agency for assisting the Secretary in the administration of the order;

(h) Miscellaneous provisions as set forth in   956.85 through 956.96 of the Notice of Hearing published
in the 

Federal Register

 of October 29, 1993 [58 FR 58105] which are common to all orders, and other terms and conditions published at   956.97
through 956.99 that are common to marketing agreements only. 



Findings and Conclusions: 

The following proposed findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on the record of the hearing. 

1. The record indicates that the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in designated parts of Walla Walla County,
Washington, and designated parts of Umatilla County, Oregon, is in the current of interstate or foreign commerce
or directly burdens, obstructs or affects such commerce. The proposed production area is discussed in material issue
3. 

The record evidence shows that in July 1989, 49 percent of the commercial shipments of Walla Walla Sweet Onions were
marketed in Seattle, Washington. That percentage increased over the following four years, and, in 1993, 71 percent
of the volume moved to outlets inside the State, the remaining 29 percent going to both eastern and western destinations
outside Washington and Oregon. An indeterminate volume of Walla Walla Sweet Onions is sold within the proposed production
area at roadside stands, and some are marketed throughout the United States. A negligible percentage of the crop is
processed. The record indicates that no Walla Walla Sweet Onions are currently exported, but that they may be in the
future. 

In addition to Seattle, the record indicates that other major markets for Walla Walla Sweet Onions include Chicago,
Illinois, and San Francisco, California. USDA Market News reports show that these three markets accounted for about
12 percent of commercial shipments in June, July, and August of 1992. Walla Walla Sweet Onions also were marketed (in
descending order of volume marketed) in Los Angeles, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; New
York, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; St. Louis, Missouri; Dallas, Texas; Miami, Florida; Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania; and Detroit, Michigan.

Record evidence shows that any handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions in fresh market channels, including intrastate
shipments, exerts an influence on all other handling of such onions and vice versa. Therefore, because such shipments
directly burden, obstruct, or affect such commerce, all handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the proposed
production area should be covered by the order, and an order for Walla Walla Sweet Onions is supported by the evidence
in the record of hearing. 

2. The record indicates that onions are grown in each of the 50 States, but commercial production is concentrated in
a few. There are three major seasonal groups of U.S. dry onions. They include spring onions produced mainly in Georgia,
Texas, and California; summer non-storage onions grown in New Mexico, Texas, and Washington; and summer storage
onions produced mostly in Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin.


The record also indicates that during its season, the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry faces strong competition from
other summer non-storage onion suppliers. Two major competitors are New Mexico, which, in 1992 accounted for 74 percent
of the summer non-storage crop, and the High Plains and Trans-Pecos areas of Texas, with 17 percent of the crop. 

The shipping season for Walla Walla Sweet Onions runs from late June through early August each year. About 23 percent
of the volume moves in June, about 40 percent in July, and the remaining 37 percent is shipped in August. 

As is true with other commodities, sellers of onions conduct their businesses to obtain maximum returns for the product
they have for sale. Handlers and other sellers therefore continually survey all accessible markets so that they may
take advantage of the best possible prices available. Further, they constantly attempt to develop demand and seek
new markets for their product. Likewise, onion buyers consider prices and availability of onions from all sources
in making their purchasing decisions. Frequent market news reports of onion prices are available in shipping areas,
and means of rapid communication are readily available. For these reasons, onion supplies and prices in any one location
are promptly known elsewhere and have a direct effect on onion supplies and prices in other locations. 

Summer storage onions normally account for over half the U.S. dry onion crop. About 55 percent of the 1993 dry onion
crop was summer storage compared to 59 percent in 1992. The two principal types of onions grown for the summer storage
crop are globe and sweet Spanish type onions. Globe onions are the dominant type grown in the midwest and east and are
not generally adaptable to production in the southern States. They tend to have a strong flavor, are firm to hard to
the touch, and keep well under proper storage conditions. Spanish type onions are particularly well adapted to production
in the western States. They are noted for their milder, sweeter flavor, but have a more limited storage life than globes.
Onions grown in the northern States are harvested primarily in July and August, and the bulk of the crop is placed in
storage. Marketing of the late-summer onion crop begins shortly after harvest and continues through the fall and
winter and into the spring months. 

Spring non-storage onions rank second in seasonal importance. Production totaled eight million hundredweight
in 1993, 14 percent of the U.S. total. Spring crop onions are grown primarily in the southern States and are principally
of the Grano and Granex types. These types of onions are typically sweeter and milder than the globe type. Additionally,
they are more tender and perishable than either the globe or Spanish type onion. Unlike the summer storage onion crop,
the spring crop is marketed relatively soon after harvest. Major producers of the spring onion crop are California,
Texas, Arizona, and Georgia. 

Summer non-storage production reached only 4.8 million hundredweight in 1993, but this was a record crop for summer
non-storage production; the 1992 crop was 4.3 million hundredweight. 

Testimony indicated that onions were first planted commercially in Walla Walla County, Washington, located in what
is now known as the Walla Walla Valley around the year 1900. According to testimony, it was discovered that the unique
growing conditions in this area of southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon, particularly the low sulfur
content of the soil, yielded a sweeter, milder onion than those grown elsewhere. In 1915, 500 carlots consisting of
300 100-pound sacks each were grown and shipped from the outskirts of Walla Walla. 

The record indicates that the majority of current commercial non-storage onion production in Washington is in the
Walla Walla Valley. Testimony shows that separate acreage, price, and production statistics are not available for
the Walla Walla Valley alone, but also include other areas in Washington, such as the Tri-cities area, the Yakima Valley,
and the Columbia River Basin. The record indicates that neither the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)
nor State reporting services for Washington and Oregon report separate statistics for Walla Walla Sweet Onions.
Such statistics are grouped together as summer-non storage onions. Witnesses testified that Walla Walla Sweet Onion
acreage is included in the total for Washington non-storage onions, so that any figure representing Walla Walla Sweet
Onions is necessarily an estimate. Moreover, no statistical data are available for Umatilla County, Oregon, although
one witness testified that perhaps 150 to 200 acres of Walla Walla Sweet Onions may be grown. As reported by NASS, summer
non-storage onions grown in Washington in 1980 totaled 780 acres, increasing until 1988 when 1,600 acres were harvested.
Since then, acreage has declined to 1,000 acres in 1992. Testimony was offered that Walla Walla Sweet Onion acreage
has been declining at the rate of about 100 acres per year. Moreover, although harvested acreage in Washington for
1991 was reported as 900 acres, the record indicates that the total number of acres of sweet onions harvested in the
Walla Walla Valley was as little as half that, the remaining acreage being in other areas in the State. 

Washington summer non-storage acreage currently accounts for about .71 percent of the U.S. annual total, and an estimated
9 percent of the summer non-storage crop. Washington accounts for less than a tenth of summer non-storage onion production,
however, because Washington's acreage is much less than that of competing growing areas in New Mexico and Texas. The
record indicates that the average yield for the Washington summer non-storage onion crop in 1992 was about 390 hundredweight
per acre. This compares with the average yield for all summer non-storage onions of 341 hundredweight per acre. 

Walla Walla Sweet Onion plantings begin about September 10 and end as late as October. The majority of growers attempt
to have most of the crop planted by mid- to late-September. Since the growing season spans the winter months, freeze
damage to Walla Walla Sweet Onions is a risk growers face each year. Harvest typically begins in the following June.
Walla Walla Sweet Onions are shipped from June through August, with peak volume moving in July. Statistical data indicate
that production of non-storage onions in Washington has risen in recent years, totaling 29.7 million pounds in 1991,
39.0 million pounds in 1992, and 36.0 million pounds in 1993. 

The record indicates that one weakness in current post harvest handling practices is storage life. Current produced
varieties of Walla Walla Sweet Onions are highly perishable and cannot be stored for extended periods. Preliminary
research has shown that the life of Walla Walla Sweet Onions can be extended by low temperature storage. Additionally,
the identification of varieties with longer storage capability would benefit the industry. 

The record indicates that further extending the storage life of Walla Walla Sweet Onions has become a critical need
of the industry, particularly in view of its competitive pressures. Witnesses testified that the relatively short
life of Walla Walla Sweet Onions accentuates the industry's marketing risks by adding an urgency to move the produce
quickly into wholesale and retail channels without regard to existing supplies and prices in those markets. The proposed
order would authorize production research projects to address these problems.

Season average prices for Washington summer non-storage onions decreased 31 percent to $16.60 per hundredweight
in 1992. Prices reached a record high in 1991 at $23.90 per hundredweight. The 1992 crop was valued at $6.5 million,
which was an 8 percent decrease from the previous season. Monthly prices generally decrease during the peak harvesting
in the State of Washington. There are no separate price data available for Umatilla County. However, given the small
production area, such prices from the Walla Walla Valley area of Umatilla County should be similar to those of the adjacent
area of Washington. 

Monthly prices received for Washington summer non-storage onions decreased 9 percent from June 1992, to August,
1992 ($17.50 per hundredweight to $16.00 per hundredweight). Prices for 1991 were considerably higher, beginning
at $29.40 per hundredweight and ending at $20.00 per hundredweight. The five-year average non-storage onion prices
in Washington (1988-1992) for the period June through August, respectively, was $20.94, $16.94, and $14.06
per hundredweight. This compared with total U.S. five-year non-storage onion average prices of $12.22, $14.20,
and $12.16 per hundredweight for the same period. U.S. summer non-storage prices in June of 1992 were 37 percent lower
than Washington summer non-storage prices during that period, but prices began to even out in August of 1992 at $16.00
per hundredweight for Washington summer non-storage onions and rose 23 percent to $15.80 per hundredweight for the
U.S. total for non-storage onions. 

According to testimony, a major share of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion market is being lost to two major competitors,
South Texas onions and those from Vidalia, Georgia. Onions grown in these areas are covered by Federal marketing order
programs that fund promotion and advertising activities and, therefore, help to make buyers and consumers more aware
of the favorable attributes of the onions. 

Marketing order programs for Idaho-Eastern Oregon onions regulate the handling of onions grown on approximately
17,600 acres; the South Texas program has about 14,200 acres; and the Vidalia program covers about 8,000 acres. The
industry believes that a research and promotion program is necessary to expand Walla Walla markets. 

Witnesses attributed the recent downward trend in Walla Walla Sweet Onion prices in part to increasing competitive
pressures from other, larger onion growing areas. Testimony indicated that while the Walla Walla Sweet Onion is considered
unique in its sweetness, other areas have or are developing sweet varieties of onions to capitalize on the strong consumer
demand for sweet onions. For example, the South Texas onion industry has funded, through a Federal marketing order,
varietal research to develop an onion variety with the desired characteristics of being mild tasting and sweet. This
variety, called the Texas Grano 1015 Y, has been actively promoted. The record indicates that the South Texas onion
industry budgeted funds for research and market development activities through its marketing order. Additionally,
handlers in Idaho and Eastern Oregon, also under a Federal marketing order program, budgeted funds during the same
period for promotion and research of its sweet Spanish onion. Witnesses attributed the success these other growing
areas have had to their ability to pool available resources under their respective marketing orders. Proponents
testified that the research and promotion activities conducted by competitors have assisted those competing industries
in developing and promoting sweeter onion varieties that are challenging the Walla Walla Sweet Onion for its share
of the onion market. It is believed that a similar program is necessary for Walla Walla Sweet Onions to remain profitable
in this competitive industry. 

The record indicates that most Northwest residents are familiar with the taste and origin of the Walla Walla Sweet
Onion. The record also indicates that they are aware of its unique flavor characteristics and are loyal customers.
However, as the Walla Walla industry has grown, the development of new markets has become necessary. Testimony demonstrated
the need to differentiate the Walla Walla Sweet Onion from other onions available in the marketplace to garner customer
loyalty in markets located outside Washington and Oregon.

The record indicates that most Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers and handlers are not sufficiently large to finance
promotion and research programs on an individual basis. In addition, public funds to finance such projects are scarce.
Heretofore, the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry has attempted to operate and fund research and development projects
under voluntary programs. Eventually, these programs ceased to operate because of inadequate support and financing.
Witness testimony unanimously supported a marketing order program to be financed by all handlers, to strengthen
consumer demand through promotion of the commodity and reducing costs through production research. 


Witnesses also testified that market research, in the form of data collection and analysis, would be an essential
part of an overall marketing and promotion strategy. Currently, limited data is gathered with respect to 
Walla Walla Sweet Onions. To effectively promote and market Walla Walla Sweet Onions, proponents testified that
additional knowledge of market conditions and access to complete data is necessary to make prudent decisions for
focusing promotional efforts and promoting the efficient allocation of resources. 

The record indicates that many onions sold as Walla Walla Sweet Onions do not have the same mild flavor and other characteristics
of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the proposed production area. Several witnesses testified that often such onions
were identified as Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in other states or areas near the Walla Walla Valley. Testimony indicates
that the growers of the Walla Walla Valley have spent time and effort attempting to market the Walla Walla Sweet Onion
as one they believe has unique characteristics because of the area in which the onions are grown. These growers believe
that such efforts have been offset by growers and handlers selling onions produced outside the proposed production
area as Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Testimony indicated that 40 percent of the onions sold and described as Walla Walla
Sweet Onions were grown outside the proposed production area and, therefore, were not true Walla Walla Sweet Onions.


In summary, a number of problems were identified in the record that could be resolved through a marketing order that
would enable the Walla Walla industry to work together collectively. Identifying varieties that have good seedling
survival rate, a low susceptibility to cold damage, good eating quality, and increased storage capability would
add stability to the supply and quality of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion crop, and could increase yields and reduce costs.
The marketing order program could assist handlers in solving mutual post harvest handling problems, in the interest
of increasing the quality of their offerings, reducing costs and increasing returns. Finally, authorizing industry
financing of promotion and advertising programs would enable the industry to increase consumer awareness of its
unique commodity, strengthen demand and increase sales. 

In view of the foregoing, it is concluded that there is a need for a marketing order for Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown
in designated parts of Washington and Oregon. The order would meet many of the needs of the industry and would tend to
effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

3. A definition of the term ``production area'' should be included in the order to delineate the area in which Walla
Walla Sweet Onions must be grown before the handling thereof is subject to the marketing order. Such term should include
designated parts of Walla Walla County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. 

The area defined in the proposed order comprises what is generally recognized as the Walla Walla Valley of Washington
and Oregon. The counties included are contiguous and share essentially the same growing, harvesting and marketing
conditions with respect to Walla Walla Sweet Onions. While production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions is currently concentrated
in the two counties of Walla Walla and Umatilla, onions of all types are grown throughout the proposed production area,
as well as adjacent areas. 

At the hearing, a witness proposed revising the definition of production area appearing in the Notice of Hearing to
include an area north of the Touchet River in Washington. However, testimony indicated that this area is dry land of
a different soil type. Further, it does not have a history of Walla Walla Sweet Onion production, so that onions produced
there may not have the same quality attributes as others from the proposed production area. The area as defined accounts
for much of the current sweet onion acreage in Washington and Oregon and, according to record evidence, is generally
recognized by the onion trade and consumers as comprising the Walla Walla Sweet Onion region of Washington and Oregon.
This is because of the unique soil and growing conditions in the highly localized area. Furthermore, the production
area as defined in the marketing order is the smallest practicable geographic area to which the order should be applied,
consistent with carrying out the declared policy of the Act.

The term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' should be defined to specify the commodity covered by the proposed order and to
which the terms and provisions of the marketing order would be applicable. The record indicates that a ``Walla Walla
Sweet Onion'' may be any of a number of onion varieties grown in the production area, rather than one specific variety
of onion. However, testimony indicated that onions acquire special characteristics when grown in the proposed production
area. This is due in part to the low sulfur content of the soil. Further, according to testimony, the term ``Walla Walla
Sweet Onion'' has a specific meaning in the onion trade, and consumers perceive Walla Walla Sweet Onions as a unique
commodity distinct from other onions. For these reasons, the term ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' should be defined to
mean all varieties of the genus and species Allium cepa, 

except sweet Spanish types, grown in the proposed production area. 

To provide for the possibility that other types of onions that have characteristics similar to what is now known as
the ``Walla Walla Sweet Onion'' may be grown in the production area in the future, the committee should be authorized,
upon approval of the Secretary, to add those types of onions to the types included under the term 
``Walla Walla Sweet Onion.'' This would be accomplished through informal rulemaking procedures. 

The definition should include dry onions, onions grown for transplanting, and salad onions. The definition in the
order as originally proposed also included onion seed. However, testimony indicated that regulating seed was not
necessary, as the intent of the proponents is to define Walla Walla Sweet Onions as only those sweet onions grown in
the production area. Accordingly, if onions are grown outside the proposed production area from seed produced within
that area, the resulting onions would not be true Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Testimony indicated that this is because
of the soil and climate unique to the Walla Walla River Valley, comprising designated parts of Walla Walla County,
Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. Accordingly, the term ``seeds'' should not be included in the proposed
definition of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. 

4. The term ``handler'' is synonymous with the term ``shipper'' and should be defined to identify the persons who would
be subject to regulation under the order. Such term should apply to any person, except a common or contract carrier
transporting Walla Walla Sweet Onions owned by another person, who first performs any of the activities within the
scope of the term ``handle'' as hereinafter defined. The definition identifies persons who would be responsible
for meeting the requirements of the order, including paying assessments and submitting reports. 

Common or contract carriers transporting Walla Walla Sweet Onions owned by another person would not be considered
as handlers, even though they transport Walla Walla Sweet Onions, because such carriers do not have control over the
Walla Walla Sweet Onions being transported. Nor are they the persons who cause the introduction of such Walla Walla
Sweet Onions into the stream of commerce. The only interest of a common or contract carrier in such Walla Walla Sweet
Onions is to transport them for a service charge to destinations determined by others. 

Growers who handle their own Walla Walla Sweet Onions or Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown by others would be considered
handlers under the order. Any person who purchases Walla Walla Sweet Onions from growers and performs any other handling
function such as grading and packing such Walla Walla Sweet Onions would be a handler. 

The term ``handle'' should be defined in the order to establish the specific functions that would place 
Walla Walla Sweet Onions in the current of commerce within the production area or between the production area and any
point outside thereof, and to provide a basis for determining which functions are subject to regulation under authority
of the marketing order. ``Handle'' and ``ship'' are used synonymously and the definition should so indicate. 

The record indicates that the term ``handle'' should include the acts of packaging, loading, transporting or selling
Walla Walla Sweet Onions. However, the term ``handle'' should not include the transportation, sale or delivery of
field-run Walla Walla Sweet Onions to a handler within the production area or to a handler outside the production area
but within Walla Walla County, Washington, or Umatilla County, Oregon, to have such onions prepared for market. In
this case, the onions have not yet been prepared for market nor are they in their existing condition being transported
to market. Most sellers and buyers do not consider them as yet suitable or appropriate for commercial transactions
and, as such, they have not yet entered the stream of commerce.

Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers sometimes market their Walla Walla Sweet Onions themselves. In such cases, those
growers would be the first handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions and would be responsible for paying assessments and
complying with other order requirements.

5.(a) Certain terms should be defined for the purpose of designating specifically their applicability and limitations
whenever they are used in the order. The definition of terms discussed below is necessary and incidental to attain
the declared policy and objectives of the order and Act.

``Secretary'' should be defined to mean the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, or any officer, or employee
of the United States Department of Agriculture who has been or who may be delegated the authority to act for the Secretary.

``Act'' should be defined to mean the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674).
This is the statute under which the proposed regulatory program would be operative, and this definition avoids the
need to refer to the citation throughout the order.

``Person'' should be defined to mean an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or any other business
unit. This definition is the same as that contained in the Act and insures that it has the same meaning in the order as
it has in the Act.

The term ``registered handler'' should be defined to mean a person who is a handler with adequate facilities for procuring
and sorting, grading, packaging, and performing any other handling function or who is a handler with access to such
facilities. This provision would require all Walla Walla Sweet Onion handlers to register with the committee after
meeting certain qualifications. Some handlers may have grading and storage facilities outside of the production
area. Handler registration would aid the committee in determining compliance with order requirements. Registration
also would enable the committee to obtain the necessary information to levy assessments.

No testimony was presented concerning the actual method of registration. However, based on similar orders using
handler registration the committee should be authorized to recommend, for approval of the Secretary, procedures
with respect to handler registration. This provision has been added to the definition of registered handler.

The term ``container'' should be defined as a box, bag, crate, hamper, basket, package, or any other receptacle used
in packaging, transporting, sales, shipment, or other handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. It is necessary to define
the term since it may be used throughout the proposed order and any rules established thereunder. 

The term ``producer'' should be synonymous with ``grower'' and should be defined to identify those persons who are
eligible to vote for, and serve as, producer members and alternate producer members on the committee and those who
may vote in any referendum. The term should mean any person engaged in a proprietary capacity in the production of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions for market within the production area. Each business unit (such as a corporation or partnership)
should be considered a single producer and should have a single vote in nomination proceedings and referenda. The
term ``producer'' should include any person who owns or shares in the ownership of Walla Walla Sweet Onions such as
a landowner landlord, tenant, or sharecropper. A person who owns and farms land resulting in that person's ownership
of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions produced on such land should be considered a producer. The same is true with respect
to a person who rents and farms land resulting in that person's ownership of all or part of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions
produced on that land.

Likewise, any person who owns land which that person does not farm, but as rental for such land obtains the ownership
of a portion of the Walla Walla Sweet Onions produced thereon, should be regarded as a producer for that portion of the
Walla Walla Sweet Onions received as rent. The tenant on such land should be regarded as a producer for the remaining
portion produced on such land.

A joint venture is one whereby several persons contribute resources to a single endeavor to produce and market a Walla
Walla Sweet Onion crop. In such venture, one party may be the farmer who contributes one or more factors such as labor,
time, production facilities or cultural skills, and the other party may be a handler who contributes money and cultural,
harvesting, and marketing supervision. Normally, a husband and wife operation would be considered a partnership.
Any individual, partnership, family enterprise, organization, estate, or other business unit currently engaged
in the production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for market would be considered a producer under the order, and would be
entitled to vote in referenda and committee nominations. Each party would have to have title to at least part of the
crop produced, electing its disposition, and receiving the proceeds therefrom. This control could come from owning
and farming land producing Walla Walla Sweet Onions, payment for farming services performed, or a landlord's share
of the crop for the use of the producing land. A landlord who only receives cash for the land would not be eligible to vote.
A business unit would be able to cast only one vote regardless of the number and locations of its farms, but each separate
legal entity would be entitled to vote.

A number of producers in the production area own or operate packing sheds. A producer who owns or operates a packing
shed should not be precluded from qualifying as a producer under the order.

The term ``Varieties'' should mean all classifications, subdivisions, or types of Walla Walla Sweet Onions that
are commonly recognized by the trade and officially recognized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or recommended
by the committee and approved by the Secretary.

Testimony indicated that only Walla Walla Sweet Onions or subdivisions or varieties thereof would be subject to any
regulations issued pursuant to the proposed order, and that varieties of onions grown in the production area not possessing
characteristics of Walla Walla Sweet Onions would not be included. Varieties not included would include hybrid varieties
of the sweet Spanish storage type onion.

The term ``Committee'' should be defined to mean the administrative agency known as the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Committee
established under the provisions of the order. Such a committee is authorized by the Act, and this definition is merely
to avoid the necessity of repeating the full name each time it is used.

The term ``fiscal period'' should be defined to mean the annual period for which the committee would plan the use of
its funds. This period should be established to allow sufficient time prior to the time Walla Walla Sweet Onions are
first shipped for the committee to organize and develop its budget for the ensuing season. However, it should also
be set to minimize the incurring of expenses during a fiscal period prior to the time assessment income is available
to defray such expenses.

The Notice of Hearing proposed that ``fiscal period'' mean the 12-month period beginning June 1 and ending the following
May 31. Record evidence indicates that the harvesting and marketing cycle for Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the
production area begins in June and ends in August. The fiscal period should coincide with the Walla Walla Sweet Onion
crop year, because the industry typically plans its operation on this basis. Hearing testimony supported the fiscal
period being established for a 12-month period beginning June 1 and ending May 31 of the next year.

However, based on future experience, it may be desirable to establish a fiscal period other than one ending on May 31.
Thus, authority should be included in the order to provide for the establishment of a different fiscal period if recommended
by the committee and approved by the Secretary through informal rulemaking procedures. In any event, the beginning
date of any new fiscal period should be sufficiently in advance of the harvesting season to permit the committee to
formulate its marketing policy and perform other administrative functions. Also, it should be recognized that if
at some future date there is a change in the fiscal period, such change would result in a transition period.

(b) Pursuant to the Act, it is desirable to establish an agency to administer the order locally as an aid to the Secretary
in carrying out the declared policy of the Act and to provide for effective and efficient operation of the order. As
proposed in  956.20, the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Committee should therefore be established and consist of ten
members, including one public member. The record indicates that a committee composed of ten members, with a like number
of alternates, would provide adequate representation and would provide for reasonable judgment and deliberation
with respect to recommendations made to the Secretary, and in the discharge of other committee duties.

Since the order is intended to primarily benefit Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers, it is appropriate that the committee
be comprised primarily of growers. Six of the ten committee members should therefore be Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers.
Since the program would be financed by handlers, and handlers would be responsible for complying with the terms of
the marketing order, however, it would be reasonable to provide for handler representation on the committee as well.
For this reason, proponents proposed that, of the ten members on the committee, three of those members should be handlers.

The record indicates that producer members and their alternates should be selected from the production area at large.
Since the production area is relatively small, this method should be adequate to ensure equitable representation
on the committee. The record indicates that Walla Walla Sweet Onion production is currently located in Walla Walla
County in Washington, and Umatilla County in Oregon, which together account for all of the production. 



Hearing testimony indicated that the six persons selected to serve as grower members or alternates should be individuals
who are producers, or officers or employees of producers. Persons selected to serve as handlers should be engaged
in handling Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Such persons could be expected to have strong interests in the effects of committee
decisions of Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers and handlers. 



To help ensure that the committee will not have a membership with partiality toward a single handling entity, the proposal
also contains a provision that, at the time of selection, no more than two producer members may be affiliated with the
same handler. 



Testimony indicates that a producer member should have at least three years experience in the production of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions. The proponents believe that because committee membership is a heavy responsibility requiring
a high degree of individual initiative for what is done and how it is done, and cultural practices for Walla Walla Sweet
Onions are diverse, it would take three years of experience producing Walla Walla Sweet Onions in order to become knowledgeable
about the industry. 



At the hearing, witnesses supported adding a public member to the committee. While the influence of consumers would
be implicitly present in the deliberations of the producer and handler committee members, and all meetings would
be public, the appointment of a public member would offer many advantages. One would be direct communication between
industry members and the public member, who would have no connection with the industry and whose opinions would afford
the industry an opportunity to discuss its problems and concerns with someone who would view these problems and concerns
from outside the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry. 



The public representative and that person's alternate should not be permitted to have a direct financial interest
in the production, processing, financing, buying, packing, or marketing of Walla Walla Sweet Onions except as a consumer,
nor be a director, officer, or employee of any firm so engaged. Such public representatives should be able to devote
sufficient time and express a willingness to attend committee activities regularly and to familiarize themselves
with the background and economics of the industry. 



Proposed  956.25 states that each member of the committee, including the public member, should have an alternate.
This would ensure that all portions of the production area are adequately represented in the conduct of the committee's
business and that the continuity of operation is not interrupted. The order should provide that alternate members
should meet the same qualifications as their respective members, except for tenure and growing experience. They
would act in the place and stead of their respective members during temporary absences. In the case of the death, removal,
resignation, or disqualification of a member, the alternate should serve as member until a new member is selected
and has qualified. 



Proposed  956.21 states that, with the exception of initial members, the term of office of committee members
and their respective alternates should be for three years and should begin on June 1 and end on May 31, or for such other
three year period as the committee may recommend and the Secretary approve. The record indicates that the term of office
should begin on June 1 because that is considered the beginning of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion crop year. The Walla Walla
Sweet Onion shipping season generally ends in August and work begins again in September when growers begin seeding
for the next year's crop. At that point in time, it can be determined which growers have remained in business and qualify
to serve on the committee.

A three-year term would be appropriate because it would give members sufficient time to become familiar with committee
operations and enable them to make meaningful contributions at committee meetings. Furthermore, a three-year term
would enable establishment of a rotation so that approximately one-third of the committee membership would terminate
each year. Staggered terms would lend continuity to the committee by insuring that some experienced members would
be on the committee at all times. Therefore, the order should provide that the terms shall be determined so that approximately
one-third of the total committee membership terminates each year. 



The Notice of Hearing proposed that the term of office for initial members and alternates should be established so
that one-third of the initial producer and handler members and alternates would serve for a one-year term, one-third
would serve for a two-year term, and one-third would serve for a three-year term. Since there would be only one public
member, there is no need to provide for staggering that membership; the initial public member should serve a three-year
term of office. 



The effective date of the order, if issued, may not coincide with the specified beginning date of the terms of office
of committee members and alternates. Therefore, a provision is necessary to adjust the initial terms of office. To
accomplish this, the order should provide that the terms of office of the initial members and alternates shall begin
as soon as possible after the effective date of the order. 



In the event that the initial members are selected prior to June 1, 1995, an example of how the initial terms of office
could be adjusted is as follows: the initial one-year term would not end on May 31, 1995, but would continue until May
31, 1996. Similarly, the two-year and three-year terms would end on May 31, 1997, and 1998, respectively. For the purposes
of applying the tenure requirements of the proposed order, each of these initial terms would be considered as a one-year,
a two-year, or a three-year term even though the actual period of the appointment may be several months longer. 



To prevent unnecessary vacancies from occurring on the committee, the order should provide that members and alternates
shall serve in such capacity for the term of office, or portion thereof, for which they are selected and have qualified,
and until their respective successors are selected. However, so that there is a continual turnover in membership
and infusion of new ideas, the order should provide that no member, including the public member, may serve more than
two consecutive terms on the committee unless specifically exempted by the Secretary. After serving two consecutive
terms, a committee member should be eligible to serve as an alternate, but should be ineligible to serve as a member
for a period of one year. These tenure requirements should not apply to alternate members. 





Testimony indicates that there should be no tenure restriction on alternate members. The proponents believe that
establishing a maximum of two three-year terms for alternate members would serve no useful purpose, but potentially
could limit the pool of candidates for full committee membership. Testimony also indicates that producers with less
than three years experience growing Walla Walla Sweet Onions should be eligible for appointment to the committee
as alternate members. 



To guard against the possibility of a position remaining vacant because of a lack of eligible nominees or persons eligible
to serve, the Secretary should have the authority to except an individual from tenure limitation. Such an exception
would be made in special and unusual circumstances. Limiting the tenure of committee membership as proposed would
be in accordance with the Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders.''




The order should provide that the Secretary shall have the authority to select members and alternates of the committee,
but the Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers and handlers should have the responsibility for recommending nominees to
the Secretary for selection under proposed 
 956.22. The nomination procedure outlined in the order would provide a means of making available to the Secretary
the names of prospective members and alternates desired by the industry to serve on the committee. 



The record does not indicate how the initial committee should be nominated, but an often used method in such instances
is for the Secretary to conduct a meeting to nominate initial industry committee members. All producers of record
in the production area should receive notice of the meeting in sufficient time to enable them to attend. Nominations
should be received and voted upon at these meetings. Those persons receiving the highest number of votes for each of
the positions to be filled should be considered the nominee for that position. Handler nominations should be accomplished
in the same way. 



The committee should be responsible for conducting subsequent nomination meetings, and providing notice to Walla
Walla Sweet Onion producers and handlers of those meetings. The proposal in the Notice also provided that at least
one nominee be submitted for each position for the Secretary's consideration. Proposed  956.22 provides that
one nominee be designated for each member and alternate member position that is vacant or is about to become vacant.
However, the Secretary would reserve the right to select any qualified candidate willing to serve.

Testimony indicates that it would be desirable to hold nomination meetings in conjunction with other industry meetings,
such as a shipper's association, grower's association, or Extension Service meetings. Such a procedure would encourage
higher attendance at the meetings. 

Meetings held for nominating members and alternates of subsequent committees should be held no later than April 1
of each year or such other date as the committee may recommend and the Secretary may approve. Inasmuch as the term of
office would begin June 1 of each year, nomination meetings should be held in sufficient time to assure that appointments
may be made prior to the beginning of each new term of office. 

Nominations should be submitted in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe. One nominee should be designated
for each position that is to be filled the following June 1. Sufficient information about each nominee should be provided
so the Secretary can determine if such person is qualified for the position for which nominated. 

Only Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers should participate in designating nominees for producer members and alternates.
Only Walla Walla Sweet Onion handlers would be entitled to vote for handler members. If a person both produces and handles
Walla Walla Sweet Onions, such person may vote either as a producer or a handler, but not both. Each eligible person
should be allowed to cast only one vote in the nomination process for each member and alternate member position that
is to be filled. 

Provisions also should be made for the nomination and selection of a public member and alternate. The record indicates
that nominees for the public member and alternate should be selected by the industry members of the committee every
three years at the first meeting following the selection of the current committee. The names of the nominees would
then be forwarded to the Secretary for selection. 

The order should provide that the members of the committee should be selected by the Secretary from persons nominated
or from among other qualified persons, in accordance with proposed  956.23. In the event nominations are not
made within the time and in the manner specified in the order, the Secretary may select members and alternates without
regard to nominations, in accordance with proposed 
 956.27. Such selection should be from qualified persons as provided in the order. Each person to be selected
by the Secretary as a member or as an alternate member of the committee should, prior to selection, qualify by advising
the Secretary that such person agrees to serve in the position for which nominated. 

Proposed  956.26 states that the order should provide a method for promptly filling any vacancies on the committee
for unexpired terms of office. There may be vacancies caused by the death, removal, resignation, or disqualification
of a member or alternate. The order should provide that the Secretary should name a successor to fill an unexpired term
from nominations made in the same manner as provided for nominating all other members and alternates. Any nomination
meetings for filling vacancies should be held within a reasonable amount of time after a vacancy occurs. 

In order to avoid holding meetings and electing nominees when other nominees acceptable to the Walla Walla Sweet Onion
industry are before the Secretary, the selection of members from nominees previously submitted but not selected
should be permitted. This would allow, for example, the Secretary to appoint a person who received the second highest
number of votes at the last nomination meeting for the position that has become vacant. 

As set forth in proposed  956.28, the order should specify a procedure for the committee to conduct its meetings.
It should provide that a majority of all members of the committee is necessary to constitute a quorum and to pass any
motion or approve any committee action. However, any action made pursuant to proposed  956.61 pertaining to
recommendations for regulations, would require seven concurring votes. Accordingly, six members of the ten-member
committee must be present in order to constitute a quorum and enable the committee to conduct a meeting. At least six
affirmative votes should be required to pass any motion or approve any committee action, except when dealing with
recommendations for regulations, which would require at least seven. The evidence of record is that at least seven
committee members should be required to concur on any recommendations pertaining to the imposition of container
marking requirements because more is needed to protect minority interests while at the same time allowing majority
rule. A simple majority would be sufficient for recommendations on other activities authorized under the marketing
order, i.e., recommendations on production and marketing research and marketing development and promotion projects,
including paid advertising, and the financing of these activities through handler assessments and voluntary contributions.


There may be times when it will be impossible to assemble the committee promptly to meet an emergency situation. Therefore,
the order also should enable committee members, and alternates when acting as members, to vote by mail, telegraph,
telephone, facsimile, or other means of communication, provided that any vote cast orally be confirmed promptly
in writing. If an assembled meeting is held, all votes should be cast in person, to ensure that the person voting on a
motion or committee action hears both sides of the question before taking such action. The majority, quorum, and voting
requirements should still apply when voting by mail, telegraph, telephone, facsimile, or other means of communication.


Committee members and alternates will necessarily incur some expense while on committee business. Reasonable expenses,
which may include travel, meals and lodging, should be reimbursed to members while attending committee meetings
or performing other duties under the order, in accordance with proposed  956.29. Therefore, the order should
provide that members, and alternates when serving as members of the committee, should serve without compensation
but shall be reimbursed for such expenses authorized by the committee and necessarily incurred by them in attending
committee meetings and in the performance of their duties under the order. Testimony indicates that it should be at
the discretion of the committee to pay expenses of alternate members who are requested to attend meetings regardless
of whether their respective members are present. 

The committee, under proposed  956.30, should be given those specific powers that are set forth in section 608c(7)(C)
of the Act. Such powers are granted by the enabling statutory authority and are necessary for an administrative agency,
such as the Walla Walla Sweet Onion Committee, to carry out its proper functions. It would be necessary for the committee
to adopt rules and regulations, prescribe the terms on which applications or information is to be filed, and to set
up procedural rules to administer this part. The committee also should have the power to investigate complaints of
violations to the order and forward such information to the Secretary, and to recommend to the Secretary appropriate
amendments to this part. 

The committee's duties as set forth in  956.31 of the proposed order are necessary for the discharge of its responsibilities.
These duties are similar to those typically specified for administrative agencies under other programs of this nature.
They pertain to specific activities authorized under the order, such as investigating and compiling information
regarding Walla Walla Sweet Onion marketing conditions, and to the general operation of the order including hiring
employees, appointing officers, and keeping records of all committee transactions. It is proposed that the marketing
order delineate committee duties as follows: 

(1) At the beginning of each fiscal period, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the committee should hold an organizational
meeting at which a chairman and such other officers as may be necessary would be selected, any necessary subcommittees
should be appointed, and such rules and regulations for the conduct of business should be adopted as may be advisable.


(2) The committee should act as intermediary between the Secretary and producers and handlers of Walla Walla Sweet
Onions.

(3) Any available information requested by the Secretary should be furnished by the committee. 

(4) The committee should appoint such employees, agents, and representatives as it may deem necessary, and determine
salaries, benefits, and duties for each such persons. 

(5) At such times as may be necessary, the committee should investigate and assemble data on the growing, harvesting,
shipping, and marketing conditions of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Furthermore, upon approval of the Secretary, the
committee should engage in research and service activities that relate to the production, handling, or marketing
of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. 

(6) The committee should keep minutes, books, and records which clearly reflect all of its acts and transactions.
These minutes, books, and records would be subject to examination at any time by the Secretary or an authorized agent
or representative of the Secretary. 

(7) The committee should ensure that its voting record on recommended regulations and other matters are available
to producers and handlers. 

(8) Prior to the beginning of each fiscal period, the committee should submit to the Secretary a budget of its proposed
expenses for such fiscal period along with a recommendation for the assessment rate for such period. 

(9) The committee should have its books audited by a competent independent accountant at least once each fiscal period,
and at such other times as the committee may find necessary or as the Secretary may request. The audit report should
show the receipt and expenditures of funds collected pursuant to this part. A copy of this report should be made available
to the Secretary, as well as at the principal office of the committee for inspection by handlers and producers. Confidential
or proprietary information should be removed from the audit report before making it available to handlers and producers.


(10) The committee should have the duty of consulting, cooperating, and exchanging information with other onion
marketing committees, as well as with other individuals or agencies in connection with all proper committee activities
and objectives under this subpart. 

The duties listed in proposed  956.31 are reasonable and necessary if the committee is to function in the manner
prescribed under the Act and the order. It should be recognized that the duties specified are not necessarily all inclusive,
and it may develop that there are other duties that the committee may need to perform which are incidental to, and not
inconsistent with, these specified duties. 

(c) The committee should be authorized under  956.40 of the proposed order to incur such expenses as the Secretary
finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred during each fiscal year. Such a provision is necessary to assure the
maintenance and functioning of the committee, as well as to finance production research and market promotion programs.
Necessary expenses would include, but would not be limited to, such items as employee salaries and benefits; establishment
of an office and equipping such office; telephone and mail services; and business-related transportation for the
committee staff. Expenses incurred by committee members in attending committee meetings should also be a reimbursable
expense. All such expenses may be incurred on an ongoing basis. 

The committee, under proposed  956.41, should be required to prepare a budget showing estimates of income and
expenditures necessary for the administration of the marketing order during each fiscal year. The budget, including
an analysis of its component parts, should be submitted to the Secretary sufficiently in advance of each fiscal period
to provide for the Secretary's review and approval. The submitted budget should include a recommendation to the Secretary
of a rate of assessment designed to secure all or part of the income required for such fiscal year. The committee should
be permitted to use reserve and other committee funds carried over from previous years, and voluntary contributions,
to meet budget requirements as authorized under the order.

The Act authorizes the Secretary to approve the incurring of expenses by the administrative agency established under
an order and states that the order must contain provisions requiring handlers to pay their pro rata share of such expenses.

The rate of assessment should be established by the Secretary on the basis of the committee's recommendation and other
available information in accordance with proposed 
 956.42. In the event that an assessment rate is established which does not generate sufficient income to pay
for the approved expenses, the committee should be authorized to recommend to the Secretary an increase in the rate
of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds. The Secretary may approve an assessment rate increase, and such
increase should be applicable to all Walla Walla Sweet Onions handled during the fiscal year to which that assessment
rate applies. 
The order should provide for the payment of assessments by first handlers of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for the maintenance
and functioning of the committee throughout the time the order is in effect, irrespective of whether particular provisions
of the order are suspended or are inoperative. For example, adverse weather during a growing season could result in
reduced supplies, and therefore, planned market support activities for the season could be canceled. The committee
should be able to continue levying assessments to pay other approved expenses incurred for other purposes. 
If a handler does not pay any assessment by the date it is due, the order should provide that the late assessment may be
subject to a late payment charge or an interest charge, or both, at rates set by the committee with the Secretary's approval.
Such charges should be set at rates established to cover additional costs that may be incurred by the committee in attempting
to collect overdue assessments, and should encourage timely payments. The period in which payments would be considered
late, and late payment charges or interest charges incurred should be recommended by the committee and approved by
the Secretary. 
The committee should be authorized to accept advance payment of assessments so that it may pay expenses which become
due before assessment income is normally received. This would give the committee more flexibility in paying obligated
expenses, particularly in the first part of a fiscal year before assessment funds are received. 
The committee should also be able to borrow money to meet administrative expenses that would be incurred before assessment
income is sufficient to defray such expenses. However, the committee should not borrow money to pay obligations if
sufficient funds already exist in the committee's reserve fund or in other committee accounts. 
All funds collected by the committee through assessments or any other provision of the order should be used only for
the purposes set forth in the order, as set forth in proposed  956.43. The Secretary should at all times have authority
to require the committee, its members and alternates, and its employees and agents to account for all receipts, disbursements,
property or records of the committee for which such person has been responsible. Likewise, when any such person ceases
to act in the aforesaid positions, that person should account for all receipts, disbursements, property or records
of the committee for which such person has been responsible. In the event the order is terminated or becomes inoperative,
the committee should appoint, with the approval of the Secretary, one or more trustees for holding records, funds
or other property of the committee. 
If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess should
be established as a reserve or refunded pro rata to the handlers, under proposed  956.44. The committee should
be authorized to carry over excess assessment income into the following fiscal period as a reserve. If such excess
income is not carried over as a reserve, handlers should be entitled to a refund proportionate to the assessments each
handler paid. The reserve should not be allowed to exceed approximately two years' of committee expenses.

One purpose of the reserve fund would be to provide stability in the administration of the order in the case of a short
crop. Also, establishing a reserve should minimize the necessity of the committee borrowing money at the beginning
of a fiscal year or raising an assessment rate during a season of less than anticipated production. 
Finally, reserve funds could be used to cover necessary liquidation expenses in the event the order is terminated.
Upon such termination, any funds not needed to defray liquidation expenses should be disposed of as determined by
the Secretary. To the extent possible, however, these funds should be returned pro rata to the handlers from whom they
were collected. 
Under proposed  956.45, for the payment of production research or promotional activities as authorized by
the order, the committee should also be authorized to receive voluntary contributions. Testimony also indicated
that contributions should be authorized for first-year administrative start-up costs. Such contributions should
be received by the committee without any obligations to the donor, and the expenditure of such funds should be under
the complete control of the committee and subject to the provisions of the order. The committee should not receive
a voluntary contribution from any person if that contribution could represent a conflict of interest. Testimony
indicates that donations should be considered as miscellaneous receipts, the same as interest or dividend income,
and be subject to all of the accounting provisions of the order. 
(d) Under proposed  956.50, the order should authorize the committee to establish and provide for the establishment
of production research, marketing research and development, and marketing promotion projects, including paid
advertising, designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, consumption, or efficient production
of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Funding for these programs should come from any authorized receipts of the committee
including assessment income, voluntary contributions and miscellaneous income such as interest. 
The committee should have the authority to initiate new production and marketing research projects, as well as to
contribute to research which may currently be taking place. 
Testimony indicated that public funds for research are becoming scarcer and more difficult to obtain. Marketing
order proponents believe that their industry needs to finance research on improved onion storage and cultural practices.

The record also supports the need for marketing research and promotion projects. Research would enable the Walla
Walla Sweet Onion industry to identify and analyze its current markets and find ways of expanding current markets
and developing new ones. 
Expanding markets for Walla Walla Sweet Onions could be accomplished by promotional activities, including paid
advertising, to acquaint wholesalers, retailers, and consumers with the product available from the Walla Walla
area. 
Market development projects would enable the committee to compile meaningful market data and to explore marketing
possibilities, such as how to gain entry to or recapture a specific market. That authority also would enable the committee
to contact buyers and food editors to distribute educational material relating to the handling and marketing of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions, and disseminate to the industry the results of current or past marketing research projects. It
would also allow the committee to give out promotional literature, recipes, and information relative to consumption
or use. 
Record testimony indicated that the committee should be authorized to develop and register a common identifying
mark, or logo, that could be used by all Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers and handlers to distinguish the Walla Walla
Sweet Onion in the marketplace. Proponents supported utilizing such a mark in conjunction with any paid advertising,
to make the consumer aware that they are purchasing Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Witnesses supported advertising as
a means of increasing demand for Walla Walla Sweet Onions.

Walla Walla Sweet Onions have a very limited marketing season (June to early August) and prices customarily begin
to decline rapidly over the season. Proponents believe an education and advertising campaign would help increase
the public's awareness of this specialty onion with the objective of expanding the market and increasing consumption
of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Paid advertising with an identifying mark would assist in clarifying and maintaining
the Walla Walla Sweet Onion's image in the marketplace in a way not available through other forms of promotion or publicity.
Also, Walla Walla Sweet Onion producers face larger and better funded competition. Testimony indicates that paid
advertising is necessary for the industry to be competitive and maintain or increase its market share. Testimony
also indicates that advertising could have a positive influence on the demand for Walla Walla Sweet Onions, particularly
in times of heavy supply, thereby tending to increase grower returns. 
Market promotion programs, including paid advertising, for Walla Walla Sweet Onions carried out with funds collected
under the proposed program, would be generic in nature and would not use particular name brands, handler or producer
names, or favor any particular portion of the production area. In addition, any promotional material or advertising
would not be authorized to make false or unwarranted claims on behalf of Walla Walla Sweet Onions.
Nor would such material be authorized to include statements that disparage other agricultural commodities. 
The record does not indicate the amount of assessment funds that may be allotted for research and promotion programs.
The committee should have the responsibility to determine the amount of funds spent on each program each year. Such
determination should be based on the needs of the industry each year. The amount of funds to be spent on research and
promotion programs would be included in the annual budget required to be submitted to the Secretary for review and
approval.
All research and promotion projects to be conducted under the order in a given fiscal period should be submitted by
the committee to the Secretary for approval prior to being undertaken. This will ensure that all projects are appropriate
given the order's authority, and that sufficient funds will be available for their funding. Further, the committee
should be required to report at least annually on the progress of each project and at the conclusion of each project.
Such reports should be made to the Secretary. 
(e) In accordance with proposed  956.61, the committee should have the authority to recommend regulations
to the Secretary, whenever it believes that regulations issued pursuant to proposed  956.62 regarding container
markings would be appropriate. Also, the committee should be authorized to recommend to the Secretary the amendment,
modification, termination, or suspension of any regulation issued under this part, when deemed necessary. The committee
should also be permitted to recommend modification, termination, or suspension of any regulation or amendment thereto
to facilitate the handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for special purpose handling pursuant to proposed  956.63,
regarding handling for specified purposes. 
The committee should have the authority to recommend to the Secretary rules and regulations for fixing the markings
of the containers used in the packaging and handling of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. This could include a logo or other
markings that would identify the contents of such containers. Such a logo or other marking would be small enough to
be used in conjunction with the handler's own label, so that handlers would not have to incur the cost of having existing
labels remade. 
As set forth in proposed  956.63, there should be provision for handling Walla Walla Sweet Onions in other than
fresh market channels differently than those for the fresh market. It would authorize the Secretary, whenever it
is found that it would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, to issue regulations, suspend or terminate
assessment requirements, container marking regulations, or any combination thereof, to facilitate the handling
of Walla Walla Sweet Onions for other than fresh market uses. Such uses would be for relief or charity, livestock feed,
planting and/or plants, salad onions, and all processing uses including canning, freezing, pickling, peeling,
dehydration, juicing, or other processing. In addition, shipments for disposal, for packing and storing within
the production area or to specified areas outside the production area in Washington and Oregon, or for other purposes
which may be specified are included. 
Requirements for special purpose shipments would be intended to ensure that shipments of Walla Walla Sweet Onions
for these uses would not be diverted to the fresh market. Shipments for relief, charity, or livestock feed would not
compete with fresh market shipments in the market place. Onion plants are too small to be used as a food product. Salad
onions, i.e., immature Walla Walla Sweet Onions of smaller sizes, usually 11/2 to 2 inches in diameter, would not normally
be regulated in the same way as fully mature, dry bulbs. Onions for canning and freezing are exempt from regulation
under the authority for this part, and onions of such poor quality that they must be destroyed would not be marketable
in any case. Shipments for storage both within and in specified locations outside of the production area would be handled
as special purpose shipments with suitable safeguards. Such safeguards might be in the form of handler reports and
would include such information that the committee would deem adequate to ensure compliance with program provisions.
Other safeguards, unforeseen at this time, might be needed to assure program compliance and prevent abuses. Hence,
the committee should be provided the flexibility to recommend, with approval of the Secretary, other safeguards
as needed. 
There should be authority under proposed  956.64 to establish minimum quantities of Walla Walla Sweet Onions
that would not be subject to regulation under this part. Testimony indicates that this quantity should be recommended
by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Such quantities would not be subject to the requirements set forth
in   956.42, 956.62, and/or 956.63. Such quantities usually are too small to affect the overall marketing
of Walla Walla Sweet Onions. 
In accordance with proposed  956.65, the Secretary should notify the committee of each regulation issued,
and of each amendment, modification, suspension, or termination thereof, and the committee would give reasonable
notice of such action to handlers subject to this part. Such notification would be necessary for the efficient operation
of the marketing order. 
The committee should be able to issue appropriate rules, regulations, and safeguards in connection with shipments
for specified purposes and minimum quantity shipments. Such rules and regulations should authorize the use of appropriate
safeguards under proposed  956.66.

The term ``certificate of privilege'' is intended to mean the approval or permit necessary to make special purpose
shipments. Authority should be included for the committee to specify the requirements contained in the certificate
of privilege. Such requirements, established through rulemaking, would be intended to ensure that shipments would
not be diverted to the fresh market. 
Safeguards should be adequate so that the committee can track such shipments from the time they leave the local shipping
point to ultimate destination. This would be necessary to determine that such shipments did not enter fresh market
channels of trade. 
The committee should have the authority to rescind or deny certificates of privilege or any other permit to any handler
if proof is obtained that such handler shipped 
Walla Walla Sweet Onions for any other purpose than stated on the certificate of privilege. The committee would rescind
or deny certificates only after an appropriate investigation concerning the alleged shipments and upon adequate
and substantial proof that the handler did in fact violate the regulation. The Secretary would have the right to modify,
change, or rescind any safeguards prescribed and any certificates issued by the committee pursuant to the provisions
of this section.

The committee would report to the Secretary such information concerning certificates of privilege as may be requested.
(f) The committee should have the authority, under proposed  956.80, with the approval of the Secretary, to
require that first handlers submit to the committee such reports and information as the committee may need to perform
its functions and fulfill its responsibilities under the order. In the normal course of business, Walla Walla Sweet
Onion handlers collect and record information that may be needed by the committee. Witnesses expressed the belief
that the reporting requirements that may be imposed under the proposed order would not constitute an undue burden
on handler businesses since the information is typically collected for other purposes.
Reports could be needed by the committee for such purposes as collecting assessments; compiling statistical data
for use in evaluating marketing research and development projects; promotional activities; making recommendations
for production research; and determining whether handlers are complying with order requirements. The record evidence
indicates that to the extent necessary for the committee to perform its functions, handlers will likely need to provide
information on the quantity of Walla Walla Sweet Onions handled each season. This required information may include,
but would not necessarily be limited to, the quantities of Walla Walla Sweet Onions received by the handler and the
quantities disposed of by such handler, the date of each such receipt and disposition, and the identity of the carrier
transporting such onions. This should not be construed as a complete list of information the committee might require,
nor should it be assumed that all of the above would necessarily be required of handlers. There may be other reports
or kinds of information that the committee may find necessary for the proper conduct of its operations under the order.
Therefore, the committee should have the authority, with the Secretary's approval, to require each handler to furnish
such information as it finds necessary to perform its duties under the order.
Each handler should be required to maintain such records of Walla Walla Sweet Onions received and disposed of as may
be necessary to verify the reports that the handlers submit to the committee. All such records should be maintained
for at least two fiscal periods after the fiscal period in which the transactions occurred. The order should provide
that the Secretary and authorized employees of the committee should have access to handlers' premises to examine
those records pertaining to matters within the purview of the order. This provision would enable verification of
compliance with requirements of the order.
All reports and records submitted for committee use by handlers would be required to remain confidential and be disclosed
to none other than persons authorized by the Secretary, as required by the Act. Such reports should become part of the
committee and Secretary's records. However, the committee should be authorized to release composite information
from any or all reports that do not reveal confidential information. Such composite information could be helpful
to the committee and to the industry in planning operations under the order and in promoting the order. Any release
of composite information should not disclose the identity of the persons furnishing the information or any person's
individual operation.
(g) No handler should be permitted to handle Walla Walla Sweet Onions except in conformity with the provisions of this
part, as set forth in proposed  956.89. If the program is to be effective, compliance with its requirements is
essential, and no handler should be permitted to evade any of its provisions. Any such evasion, on the part of even one
handler, could be demoralizing to those handlers who are in compliance and would tend to impair the effective operation
of the program.
Witnesses testified that consumers are being deceived when they purchase onions they believe to be Walla Walla Sweet
Onions, but which are actually onions produced outside the production area. Proponents testified that the application
of the Walla Walla name to onions not grown in the production area is an unfair trade practice that destroys the reputation
of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion and causes harm to the industry.

The Act provides that a marketing order can only apply to a defined commodity grown in a specified production area.
No authority exists for regulating the handling of that commodity grown outside that production area.
In accordance with proposed  956.85, the order should provide that the Secretary conduct a periodic referendum
every six years with the initial referendum conducted within six years of the effective date of the marketing order.
The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that continuance referenda are an effective means for ascertaining
whether producers favor continuance of marketing order programs. The Act provides that the Secretary shall terminate
a marketing order whenever, through the conduct of a referendum, it is indicated that a majority of all producers favor
termination and such majority produced more than 50 percent of the commodity for market during a representative period.
Since less than 50 percent of all producers usually participate in a referendum, it is difficult to determine overall
producer support or opposition to termination of an order. Thus, to provide a basis for determining whether producers
favor continuance of the order, a provision for continuance referenda should be included. Continuance should be
based upon the affirmative vote of either two-thirds of the producers voting or an affirmative vote of the producers
of two-thirds of the volume of Walla Walla Sweet Onions represented in the referendum.
The Act requires that in the promulgation or amendment of a marketing order, at least two-thirds of the producers voting,
by number or volume represented in the referendum, must favor the issuance or amendment of a marketing order. Continuance
referenda should be based on the same standard of industry support. This requirement is considered adequate to measure
producers' support to continue the marketing order. The Secretary would consider termination of the order if less
than two-thirds of the producers voting in the referendum and producers of less than two-thirds of the volume of Walla
Walla Sweet Onions represented in the referendum favor continuance. In evaluating the merits of continuance versus
termination, the Secretary should not only consider the results of the referendum but also should consider all other
relevant information concerning the operation of the order and the relative benefits and disadvantages to producers,
handlers and consumers in order to determine whether continued operation of the order would tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act.
In any event, section 608(C)(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminate the order whenever the Secretary
finds that the majority of all producers favor termination, and that such majority produced more than 50 percent of
the commodity for market.
The Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' provide for periodic
referenda to allow producers the opportunity to indicate their support for or rejection of a marketing order. It is
the position of the Department that periodic referenda ensure that marketing order programs continue to be accountable
to producers, obligate producers to evaluate their programs periodically, and involve them more closely in their
operation. The record evidence supports these goals.
The provisions of proposed   956.87 through 956.99 of the order as contained in the Notice of Hearing and
hereinafter set forth, are common to marketing agreements and orders now operating. All such provisions are incidental
to and not inconsistent with the Act and are necessary to effectuate the other provisions of the marketing order and
marketing agreement and to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. The record evidence supports inclusion of each
such provision as proposed in the Notice of Hearing. These provisions, which are applicable to both the marketing
agreement and the marketing order, are identified by section number and heading as follows:  956.87 Proceedings
after termination;  956.88 Effect of termination or amendment;  956.90 Right of the Secretary;  956.91
Duration of immunities;  956.92 Agents;  956.93 Derogation;  956.94 Personal liability;  956.95
Separability; and  956.96 Amendments. Those provisions applicable to the marketing agreement only are:  956.97
Counterparts;  956.98 Additional parties; and  956.99 Order with marketing agreement.
Miscellaneous changes have been made from the provisions as proposed in the notice of hearing for the purpose of clarity.

Part IV


Environmental Protection Agency





40 CFR Part 82
Protection of Stratospheric Ozone; Proposed Rule








Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 217  Thursday, November 10, 1994  Proposed Rules



<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY </USDEPT>


<USDEPT>40 CFR Part 82 </USDEPT>









Protection of Stratospheric Ozone 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 With this action, EPA is proposing amendments to 
anticipate the phaseout of production and consumption of various 
ozone-depleting substances and to clarify minor aspects of the 
current regulation as provided for under section 604 and 606 of 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA). To ensure an orderly 
phaseout of the production and consumption of halons in 1994, and 
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, methyl 
chloroform and hydrobromofluorocarbons in 1996, this action 
proposes to alter the administrative requirements of the 
regulations so companies may continue to produce for special 
exempted uses. Today's action also proposes clarifications to 
improve the efficiency of the current requirements and to reduce 
the burden on the affected companies while ensuring continued 
compliance with Title VI of the CAA and in a manner consistent 
with the United States' obligations under the Montreal Protocol 
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer as amended. 


Specifically, EPA proposes to (1) change the requirements 
for the post-phaseout period for transformation and destruction 
of ozone-depleting substances; (2) establish the framework for 
the post-phaseout exempted production for essential uses; (3) 
revise the controls for imports of controlled substances that are 
used or recycled; (4) ease the requirements for exporting 
substances to Article 5 countries; (5) change the allowance

I. Background



The current regulatory requirements of the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Program that limit production and consumption
of ozone-depleting substances were promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the 

Federal Register

 on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018), and on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69235). These rules set out the requirements of an
Allowance Program (the Program).

The Allowance Program was originally developed in 1988 (published on August 12, 1988, 58 FR 30568) in response to the
1987 ``Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,'' an international agreement that requires
nations that are Parties to the Protocol to reduce and eventually eliminate their production and consumption of ozone-depleting
chemicals.






In 1990, the Parties to the Protocol amended the Montreal Protocol during their meeting in London and added other ozone-depleting
chemicals and designated phaseout dates for production and consumption of these chemicals. Shortly after the 1990
meeting of the Protocol Parties, the United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA). The CAA requires
the phaseout of ozone-depleting chemicals on a schedule parallel to, or in some cases more stringent than, that of
the Protocol.

The Allowance Program promulgated in the 

Federal Register

, first on March 6, 1991 (56 FR 9518), and then as a final rule on July 30, 1992 (57 FR 33754), was designed to ensure that
the United States meet its obligations to control and phase out these substances under the Protocol and consistent
with Title VI of the CAA. Since that time, the Parties to the Protocol agreed to accelerate the phaseout of all class
I substances (except Group VI), to control class II substances and to add methyl bromide and hydrobromofluorocarbons
(HBFCs) to the list of class I substances. EPA modified its control requirements in a final rule promulgated December
10, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

, to be consistent with Title VI and the Protocol adjustments and amendments.

The substances that are listed in the Protocol, and controlled in the accelerated phaseout, are:



CLASS I



 Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs);

 Halons;

 Carbon Tetrachloride;

 Methyl Chloroform;

 Methyl Bromide;

 Hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs);



CLASS II



 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).



(These substances are described in greater detail in 58 FR 65018).






EPA promulgated regulations on December 10, 1993, accelerating the phaseout of halons to January 1, 1994, the phaseout
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and HBFCs to January 1, 1996, and the phaseout
of methyl bromide to January 1, 2001. The rule also accelerates the phaseout of class II substances, HCFC-22,
HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b.

Both the Protocol and the Clean Air Act require the phaseout of production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances.
In the context of the Program, the use of the term consumption may be misleading. It is not the ``use'' of these substances
that is controlled through the regulations but rather the amount of the substance available for U.S. domestic consumption,
defined as production plus imports minus exports of bulk virgin chemicals.

In developing the regulatory program, EPA collected information on the amounts of ozone-depleting substances produced,
imported, exported, transformed and destroyed domestically. This information was used to establish the U.S. production
and consumption ceilings for these chemicals. The data was also used to assign company-specific production and import
rights in most cases for companies either importing or producing during the base years of the data collection. These
rights are called allowances.

Companies expend allowances when they produce or import ozone-depleting substances. With certain restrictions,
the allowances can be traded among companies both domestically and internationally (between Party countries).
To control production, the Agency allocated baseline production allowances to producers of specific ozone-depleting
chemicals. To control consumption, the Agency allocated baseline consumption allowances to producers and importers
of specific ozone-depleting chemicals. Allowances for class I substances are currently provided to companies on
an annual basis except for the production of halons, which was phased out on January 1, 1994.

In summary, the Program currently operates as follows:

 In order to produce controlled ozone-depleting substances, companies must use both production and consumption
allowances;

 In order to import controlled substances, companies must use consumption allowances;

 No allowances are required in order to export, once allowances are expended in the production or importation
of the substance. Rather, companies that export can apply for and be granted additional consumption allowances;

 If a company exports certain controlled substances to an Article 5 country (developing nations as defined
by the Protocol that consume less than .3 kilograms of CFCs per capita), the company producing these chemicals can
request additional production allowances as well as the consumption allowances normally granted for export. Production
by Parties to the Protocol for these developing countries will continue for 10 years after the phaseout in the United
States. The number of additional production allowances that can be provided to a company for this purpose is currently
limited to 10 percent of their baseline allowance but will increase to 15 percent upon phaseout of these controlled
substances.

 No allowances are required to produce ozone-depleting substances that are transformed or destroyed domestically;

 Used or recycled ozone-depleting chemicals can be imported without allowances. No consumption allowances
are granted if used or recycled ozone-depleting chemicals are exported;

 Companies are required to maintain records and to provide the data to ensure compliance with the regulation
and to meet the reporting requirements of the Protocol.

The Program currently controls and monitors the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in the
United States. The production and import of halons has already been phased out, and the phaseout for the remaining
class I substances, except for methyl bromide, is scheduled for January 1, 1996. In order to ensure an orderly phaseout
in 1996, the EPA must alter the administrative requirements of the regulations so companies may continue to produce
for exempted uses permitted under the Montreal Protocol and Clean Air Act Amendments.

In addition, the Agency is seeking to improve the 
efficiency of the requirements and to reduce the burden on the 
affected companies while ensuring continued compliance with 
Title VI of the CAA and the Montreal Protocol. In light of these 
objectives, the Agency is proposing the following administrative 
changes to improve the Program. 


II. Administrative Changes in the Stratospheric Protection 
Program 


A. Program Requirements for Continued Post-Phaseout Production 
and Imports 


The paragraphs under Section A., Program Requirements for 
Continued Post-Phaseout Production and Imports, describe the 
administrative changes being proposed by EPA to facilitate the 
phaseout of all class I ozone-depleting substances effective 
January 1, 1996 (except for methyl bromide), and the special 
production and importation scenarios allowed for essential 
uses.





The Program currently requires the use of allowances by 
companies that produce or import class I chemicals, except halons 
(Group II), which were phased out January 1, 1994. Under the 
current regulation, the phaseout of the production and 
consumption of the following Groups of class I controlled 
substances will be complete by January 1, 1996:

 

Group I, CFCs 
Group II, Halons 
Group III, Other CFCs 
Group IV, Carbon Tetrachloride 
Group V, Methyl Chloroform, and 
Group VII, HBFCs.

 

A list of the specific class I ozone-depleting chemicals in each 
Group is in Appendix A and F in Subpart A. 
Due to the phaseout, the Agency is proposing to no longer 
use production and consumption allowances for all class I 
controlled substances, except Group VI, methyl bromide, beginning 
January 1, 1996. Today's proposal anticipates the 1996 
production phaseout agreed to by the Parties to the Protocol for 
CFCs, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and HBFCs, but 
allows production for essential uses to become effective January 
1, 1996, contingent upon approval for such essential uses by the 
Parties to the Protocol at the October 1994 meeting. 
Although EPA proposes to no longer use production and 
consumption allowances for class I controlled substances (except 
methyl bromide) beginning January 1, 1996, the Agency envisions 
that the manufacture of class I controlled substances will 
continue after January 1, 1996, provided the substances are: 
 either transformed or destroyed, 
 exported to Article 5 countries, 
 produced for essential uses as authorized by the 
Protocol and CAA and consistent with essential-use 
allowances, or 
 produced with destruction or transformation credits.

In addition, EPA envisions class I controlled substances (except 
methyl bromide) being imported without the need for consumption 
allowances after January 1, 1996, if: 
 the substance is either transformed or destroyed, 
 the substance was previously used, recycled or 
reclaimed, 
 the substance was imported using destruction or 
transformation credits, or 
 the substance was imported using essential-use 
allowances. 
Although the proposal is to no longer use production or 
consumption allowances for the phased out class I substances 
(except methyl bromide), the Agency wishes: 
(1) to maintain a category of Article 5 allowances 
(previously called potential production allowances),

<TEXT>
 

(2) to create a new category of essential-use allowances, 
and 
(3) to create destruction and transformation credits 
(similar to the previous process for granting additional 
production allowances when substances produced or 
imported with expended allowances are transformed or 
destroyed). 

The following paragraphs describe the allowance 
requirements for a variety of production and importation 
scenarios under the current Allowance Program. In addition, the 
paragraphs describe the administrative changes being proposed by 
EPA to facilitate the phaseout of all class I ozone-depleting 
substances effective January 1, 1996, (except for methyl bromide) 
and the special production and importation scenarios proposed for 
the post-phaseout period. 


1. Post-Phaseout Requirements for Transformation and 
Destruction of Controlled Substances 


The current regulation distinguishes between two categories 
of controlled substances that are transformed or destroyed. The 
two categories are: (1) controlled substances that were produced 
or imported explicitly for uses that result in transformation or 
destruction, and (2) controlled substances that were produced or 
imported with the intention of putting the substance to an 
``emissive use.'' EPA proposes adding the definition of emissive 
use to the current regulation, such that emissive use would be 
those uses of controlled substances that do not result in the 
transformation or destruction of the substance. Examples of 
emissive uses would be the incorporation of controlled substances 
into a refrigerator or an air conditioner (for a car, household 
or building), or the use of a controlled substance as a solvent 
to clean machine parts or circuit boards. 
The current program assumes that when a controlled 
substance is produced or imported for other than transformation 
or destruction it is intended for an emissive use. When the 
controlled substance is produced or imported for an intended 
emissive use, the producer or importer must expend allowances 
under the current program. Whether or not the controlled 
substance is actually incorporated into an emissive use is not as 
important as the fact that it was intended for an emissive use. 
If the controlled substance is 

intended 

for an emissive use at 
the time of production or importation, the person producing or 
importing the substance is required to expend allowances. 
However, the expenditure of allowances is not sufficient to 
define emissive use. For example, a controlled substance 
recovered from an air conditioner, refrigerator or dehumidifier 
manufactured before the current program became effective (July 
1989) would not have been produced with expended allowances. 
In the following discussion, EPA proposes changes to the 
requirements for controlled substances that are produced 
explicitly for transformation and destruction, and to the 
requirements for controlled substances that are produced for 
intended emissive uses and then subsequently transformed or 
destroyed. The requirements differ according to the intended 
purpose of the controlled substance during production. 
a. 

Production or importation of controlled substances 
explicitly for uses that result in domestic transformation 
or destruction. 

The current regulation does not require a person to expend 
allowances if they are explicitly producing or importing a 
controlled substance for a use that will result in the 
transformation or destruction of that substance in the United 
States. In other words, allowances do not need to be expended at 
the time of production or importation as long as the producer or 
importer has certification that the controlled substance will be 
transformed or destroyed by themselves, by a second-party, or by 
a third-party. As long as the producer or importer has such 
certification that the substance will be transformed or destroyed 
domestically, there is no need to expend allowances for the 
production or importation of the substance. To confirm the 
future transformation or destruction of the controlled substance, 
the current regulation requires the second- or third-party 
person, who will transform or destroy the substance, to submit a 
transformation certification or destruction verification to the 
producer or exporter.

<TEXT>
 

EPA proposes that the current system continue after January 
1, 1996, and that companies be permitted to produce or import 
controlled substances explicitly for uses that result in 
transformation or destruction with the same requirements as under 
the current regulation.
 Therefore, such producers and 
importers will continue to receive an IRS certification of intent 
to transform or a destruction verification from the second- or 
third-party transformers or destroyers. The producers and 
importers will also continue to submit these certificates or 
verifications to EPA along with their quarterly reports (see 
Section C.7. Recordkeeping and Reporting). 





b. 

Production or importation of controlled substances intended 
for emissive use but subsequently transformed or destroyed. 

Under the current regulation a person who transforms or 
destroys a controlled substance that was produced or imported 
with expended allowances may petition the Agency for ``additional'' 
consumption and production allowances. The person who transforms 
or destroys a controlled substance that was produced or imported 
with expended allowances is essentially requesting a ``refund'' of 
the allowances originally used in the production or importation 
of the substance. 

EPA proposes that, after the phaseout begins on January 1, 
1996, companies will no longer be able to request additional 
production allowances or consumption allowances for the 
transformation or destruction of controlled substances which were 
produced or imported for emissive uses (other than for methyl 
bromide). The Agency proposes the elimination of the specific 
provisions that grant additional production and consumption 
allowances, beginning January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except methyl bromide, in anticipation of the post-phaseout elimination of production and consumption
allowances for 
those substances. Thus, a person who expends allowances to 
produce or import a class I substance, other than methyl bromide, 
and then transforms or destroys that substance after January 1, 
1996, will not be granted additional production or consumption 
allowances. However, a person who expends allowances and then 
transforms or destroys methyl bromide after January 1, 1996, 
would still be able to petition the Agency for additional 
production and consumption allowances until January 1, 2001, as 
under the current regulation. In this respect, a person who 
transforms or destroys methyl bromide that was produced or 
imported for an intended emissive use may continue to follow the 
existing regulation as described under  82.9 and  82.10.

c. 

The post-phaseout procedures for granting destruction and 
transformation credits. 

At the Fourth Meeting of the Protocol Parties in Copenhagen 
in 1992, in Decision IV/24, the Parties agreed to urge ``all 
practicable measures to prevent releases of controlled substances 
into the atmosphere.'' In accordance with this Decision, EPA 
wishes to continue encouraging destruction and transformation of 
controlled substances after the phaseout begins January 1, 1996, 
especially for those controlled substances that were produced or 
imported for intended emissive uses. EPA believes a system of 
incentives can be devised to foster destruction or transformation 
of ozone-depleting substances in order to prevent their emission 
to the atmosphere. 

In this action, EPA proposes a system of incentives to 
encourage destruction or transformation after the accelerated 
phaseout dates by offering credits for the destruction or 
transformation of controlled substances. These credits would be 
used to produce or import an amount of controlled substance. The 
Agency believes a system of incentives to encourage destruction 
or transformation of controlled substances after the phaseout is 
an important mechanism to deter individuals from releasing the 
unneeded controlled substance to the atmosphere. 

As discussed below, EPA believes that Decision IV/24 of the 
Parties to the Protocol urging measures to prevent the release of 
unneeded controlled substances to the atmosphere and the Protocol 
definition of production provide the basis to devise incentives 
for destruction or transformation after the accelerated phaseout 
and until the interim and final phaseout dates set forth in the 
CAA. 

The Protocol defines production as the ``amount of 
controlled substances produced, minus the amount destroyed by 
technologies to be approved by the Parties and minus the amount 
entirely used as feedstock in the manufacture of other 
chemicals.'' Under the Protocol, Parties may continue to produce 
controlled substances after they are phased out as long as the 
amount of the controlled substance produced is offset in each 
control period by the same amount that is transformed
 or 
destroyed by an approved technology.
 The Protocol definition 
of production indicates that an amount of controlled substance 
produced and the same amount destroyed or transformed would 
balance in a calculation of atmospheric loading and result in a 
net environmental impact of zero. 






Although the definition of production in the Protocol would 
permit continued production beyond the phaseout as long as such 
production was offset by transformation or destruction, the 
definition of production under the Clean Air Act Amendments is 
distinct and does not permit such offsetting. The CAA defines 
``produce,'' ``produced'' and ``production'' as the ``manufacture of a 
controlled substance from any raw material or feedstock chemical, 
but such terms do not include (A) the manufacture of a substance 
that is used and entirely consumed (except for trace quantities) 
in the manufacture of other chemicals, or (B) the reuse or 
recycling of a substance.'' Under the CAA definition, once 
production of a controlled substance is phased-out, it may no 
longer be produced for emissive purposes because there are no 
provisions, as in the Protocol's definition, to permit that 
continued production be offset by destruction or transformation. 

Pursuant to CAA section 614, in the case of conflict 
between any provision of the CAA and the Montreal Protocol, the 
more stringent provision shall govern. Because the CAA 
definition of production is more stringent than that of the 
Protocol, the definition of production under the CAA shall apply 
when the phaseout dates under the CAA take effect. Section 604 
of the CAA sets interim reductions and final phaseout dates for 
listed class I substances. The class I substances listed in the 
CAA must be phased out by the year 2000, except for methyl 
chloroform which must be phased out by the year 2002. In 
addition, under the terms of the CAA, methyl bromide must be 
phased out by 2001. Section 604 also includes interim reductions 
for the listed class I substances as outlined in Table I below. 

In today's rule, EPA proposes to authorize the use of 
destruction/transformation credits until the respective dates 
when the terms of the CAA become more stringent than those of the 
Protocol (2000 for most class I controlled substances, 2001 for 
methyl bromide, and 2002 for methyl chloroform). For example, 
under the terms of the Protocol, CFC-12 must be phased out by 
1996, but production may be continued as long as it is offset by 
either transformation or destruction. However, the CAA requires 
that in 1996, the maximum allowable production of CFC-12 be no 
more than 40 percent of the quantity produced in the baseline 
year. From 1995 until 1999, the CAA requires that the maximum 
allowable production of CFC-12 be no more than 15 percent of the 
quantity produced in the baseline year, and in the year 2000, no 
CFC-12 may be produced. 

Today's proposal permits the use of destruction and/or 
transformation credits, but does not permit continued production 
beyond the maximum allowable limits set forth in the CAA. Thus 
in the example above, for 1996, individuals may use destruction 
and/or transformation credits, but in no case may CFC-12 be 
produced for emissive purposes beyond 40 percent of the quantity 
produced in the baseline year. To comply with the 1996 phaseout 
date and definition of production under the Protocol, production 
of this amount of CFC-12 must be offset by the amount transformed 
or destroyed.

Amendment of 1990. 







Proposed System for Credits

_EPA is seeking comments on a 
system that would grant destruction credits and/or transformation 
credits as an incentive to destroy and/or transform controlled 
substances produced or imported for intended emissive uses. EPA 
is seeking comments on this system in which a person may submit, 
after January 1, 1996, a request to the Agency for credits based 
on the destruction or transformation of a quantity of controlled 
substances in the United States that were initially produced for 
an emissive use. The person requesting credits would need to 
identify the amount of controlled substance that was destroyed or 
transformed and the previous use of the controlled substance. In 
addition, the person would need to submit to EPA a copy of the 
destruction efficiency certification as under  82.13(k). Upon 
approval, EPA would grant the person credits equal to the amount 
of the controlled substance they destroyed or transformed minus 
an offset. EPA proposes that credits could be used for: (i) the 
importation of a calculated level of the controlled substance, or 
(ii) the production of a calculated level of the controlled 
substance. Consistent with the parameters set for control 
periods by the Montreal Protocol, EPA proposes that credits not 
be carried over from one control period to the next, due to the 
limits on net production. The recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements associated with the credits described in these 
paragraphs are outlined in paragraph C.7.a.iv and C.7.a.v below. 

Under the proposed system, the Agency will create a balance 
of credits for the person upon approval of a request. Deductions 
will be made from this balance of credits based upon quarterly 
reports to EPA showing production and importation. EPA is 
proposing that inter-pollutant transfers of credits as currently 
defined in  82.12 be permitted within the Groups of class I 
substances listed in Appendix A and F to Subpart A, subtracting a 
one percent offset. The Agency is also proposing that inter-
company transfers of credits be permitted as currently defined in 
 82.12, subtracting the one percent offset. Inter-Party trades 
of credits would also be permitted under today's proposal as 
currently described in  82.9 with the actual controlled substance 
returning to the United States.

Discussion of Options

_The following discussion outlines 
options considered by EPA in proposing today's system to grant 
credits for the destruction or transformation of controlled 
substances. The initial discussion focuses on options for 
destruction credits. This is followed by a summary of how the 
same arguments pertain to a parallel system for granting 
transformation credits. 



Options for Destruction Credits

_The Agency considered 
many factors in analyzing how to provide incentives to destroy 
controlled substances in the post-phaseout period. 

EPA envisions granting destruction credits to people who 
destroy controlled substances that were recovered from use 
systems, as well as controlled substances that were produced or 
imported for intended emissive uses. The Agency believes that as 
the phaseout goes into effect on January 1, 1996, an increasing 
number of people will retrofit or switch from use systems that 
use class I controlled substances to use systems that occupy 
other chemicals or processes less damaging to stratospheric 
ozone. However, in the near term the Agency anticipates a period 
of transition in which some people continue to use equipment that 
occupies class I substances. To meet the needs of people with 
equipment designed for class I controlled substances after the 
phaseout, EPA presumes market demand will engender a service 
industry to recover the phased out substances from existing 
equipment, such as building chillers, commercial refrigeration 
units, and automobile air conditioners as this equipment is 
retrofitted with alternative chemicals or is taken out of 
commission. EPA anticipates that much of the recovered 
controlled substances will be recycled or reclaimed and stored 
(banked) to meet the near term needs of people still using 
equipment that requires phased out substances. At this point in 
time, it is difficult to project what the future supply and 
demand for controlled substances will be once the post-phaseout 
period begins (January 1, 1996) and how long the transition 
period will last. 

EPA is proposing destruction credits to encourage the 
destruction of controlled substances when the supply of these 
substances exceeds the demand. In time, the demand for class I 
controlled substances should fall as the majority of equipment is 
converted to alternative chemicals or new systems replace old 
systems. The Agency presumes this will occur as alternative 
substances, retrofits and new equipment are brought into wider 
use throughout all sectors, obviating the need for banked class I 
controlled substances. Under this scenario, when the supply of a 
class I substance being banked for the period of transition 
exceeds the demand, the price will drop and the existing stocks 
will become ``unneeded,'' as mentioned in Decision IV/24 of the 
Parties to the Protocol cited above. When the substances are 
unneeded, the demand for phased out controlled substances may no 
longer even warrant storage. A person with a stored quantity of 
class I controlled substance that no longer has a market due to 
the conversion and replacement of equipment should be encouraged 
through a meaningful incentive system to destroy the substance. 
Without such an incentive, individuals may continue storing these 
controlled substances, increasing the risk of leaks, accidental 
releases or intentional releases to the atmosphere. EPA believes 
destruction should be encouraged to prevent such releases into 
the atmosphere. 

The proposed system encourages the destruction of 
controlled substances that are unneeded as demand shifts from one 
specific substance to alternatives or other types of equipment. 
The system of granting destruction credits allows market 
flexibility in meeting demand by allowing inter-pollutant 
transfers of destruction credits at the same time that it 
provides an incentive to destroy the excess supply of a given 
substance that might potentially be released into the atmosphere. 
As a hypothetical example, CFC-11 might be recovered from several 
use systems and banked during the first years after the phaseout 
(January 1, 1996) to meet demand during the period of transition. 
But as alternative substances and/or equipment are brought to 
market to replace the need for CFC-11, the supply of CFC-11 that 
was banked would become unnecessary. Today's proposed 
destruction credits would encourage the destruction of this 
excess supply of CFC-11 and the credits could be used, through an 
inter-pollutant transfer, to produce or import a different 
controlled substance in the same Group of controlled substances, 
such as CFC-12, to satisfy a still unmet demand for CFC-12. 

As under the current regulation, the Agency will grant 
credits equal to 100 percent of the volume destroyed (minus the 
offset) for controlled substances that are completely destroyed 
(using the current definition of completely destroy). For 
controlled substances destroyed at less than a 98 percent 
destruction efficiency, EPA will grant allowances commensurate 
with that percent of destruction efficiency that is actually 
achieved (minus the offset). 

Another factor considered in proposing an incentive system 
was the general technical destruction characteristic of the 
chlorinated and brominated compounds regulated under the current 
rule. Due to the chemical composition of these ozone-depleting 
substances, the by-products of destruction are often corrosive 
acids. The corrosivity of these destruction by-products may 
influence the maintenance costs for approved destruction 
technologies. Increased rates of destruction of controlled 
substances could increase the frequency with which operators of 
approved incineration technologies would need to replace the 
liners of their incineration units. Therefore, operators will 
probably continue to charge high prices for the destruction of 
controlled substances.

EPA received anecdotal information that very few incineration facilities in the United States are now accepting
bulk quantities of CFCs for destruction and as a result the price being charged is extremely high. The Agency does not
want the maintenance costs at incineration facilities to impede the overall availability of destruction for controlled
substances, especially as controlled substances are taken from existing use systems. If destruction is limited
and expensive, the release of controlled substances to the atmosphere may be an unfortunately attractive option.
Offering credits for destruction provides an economic incentive to persons who have controlled substances but would
like to dispose of them. The credits have economic value which could offset the high costs of destruction. If persons
gain a benefit from destroying a controlled substance, they will be more likely to destroy the controlled substance
than release it to the atmosphere. The overall goal of providing the incentives for destruction is to prevent the release
of ozone- depleting substances to the atmosphere. 

EPA believes that the proposed system for granting destruction credits will have an overall environmental benefit.
Without an incentive to increase the current rate of destruction the Agency presumes there will be greater release
of controlled substances to the atmosphere as equipment that contains the phased out substances is taken out of commission.
Today's proposal is to grant destruction credits equal to the quantity of controlled substance destroyed minus an
offset of 15 percent. Although the credits can be used to produce or import controlled substances, the amount produced
or imported will be less than the amount destroyed due to the offset. The credits also provide an incentive to destroy
ozone-depleting substances that otherwise might be emitted. 

In making today's proposal the Agency considered other ways of encouraging destruction. EPA considered a voluntary
system for encouraging destruction of controlled substances. The voluntary system would not grant credits but simply
try to persuade companies to destroy ozone-depleting substances with publicity and public relations assistance.
For instance, the Agency could develop a list of companies actively destroying controlled substances as ``friends
of the ozone'' in a national publicity campaign. EPA believes, however, that a system of credits would provide greater
incentive to increase current rates of destruction and there would be less chance of controlled substances being
released to the atmosphere. 

Another option considered by EPA was to grant destruction credits equal to the amount of controlled substance destroyed.
Under an option of giving 1:1 credits for kilograms, a person who destroys 100 kilograms of CFC-12 would be given
a calculated level of 100 kilograms of destruction credits which could be used to produce or import 100 kilograms of
new CFC-12. Although the incentive would be great to destroy unneeded stocks of controlled substances without
an offset, EPA believes the environmental benefits of the actual destruction would be balanced by the subsequent
production or importation of an equal amount of additional controlled substance. 

In developing today's proposal, EPA considered offsetting the number of credits to be granted by one percent from
the actual quantity destroyed. A one percent offset is used throughout the current regulation in calculating allowances
authorized in various transfers; both between Groups of controlled substances (inter-pollutant trades) and between
companies (inter-company trades). The offset was developed to address Section 607 of the CAA which requires that
trades result in less overall production or consumption than would have occurred absent the trade. The one percent
offset was proposed in the September 30, 1991 rule, as an amount large enough to provide a net environmental benefit
but without discouraging the trading that might be necessary to meet market demand. 

In today's proposal, EPA recommends a 15 percent offset. The 15 percent offset is proposed to ensure that environmental
benefits result from the proposed incentive system granting additional production or importation to encourage
destruction and prevent the release of controlled substances. The 15 percent offset proposed today is based on an
estimate of the amount of controlled substances that could possibly be destroyed given the capacity of U.S. approved
technologies. Estimates of destruction capacity for controlled substances in the United States for 1992 are 15 percent
of annual production.
 Therefore, the greatest environmental benefit that can be obtained in the U.S. from destruction is 15 percent of annual
U.S. production. The 15 percent offset means a person who destroys a quantity of controlled substance after the phaseout
(January 1, 1996) may request credits equal to 85 percent of the quantity destroyed. The 85 percent is the portion of
annual United States production of controlled substances for intended emissive uses that cannot be destroyed due
to the limits of estimated domestic destruction capacity. To control and reduce the damage caused by corrosive by-products
from the destruction of controlled substances, operators of incineration units usually incorporate a small percentage
of halogenated substances in each batch. The offset would encourage owners of approved destruction technologies
to maximize their capacity for incorporating controlled substances. 







Options for Transformation Credits

_The discussion of destruction credits above also pertains to a system for granting transformation credits. Transformation
credits would be granted to a person who transforms controlled substances originally produced or imported for intended
emissive uses. EPA is seeking comment on a system that would grant transformation credits as a parallel system to the
system for destruction credits described above. In other words, transformation credits would be granted for a quantity
of controlled substance transformed originally produced or imported for intended emissive uses, minus the 15 percent
offset.

EPA is aware that most controlled substances currently produced or imported for intended emissive uses do not subsequently
become a feedstock for a transformation process. However, EPA believes that new technologies may appear that can
transform controlled substances that were produced or imported for intended emissive uses. As defined in the current
regulation, transformation is the process of entirely consuming a controlled substance (except for trace quantities)
in the manufacture of other chemicals for commercial purposes. The Agency has learned of independent efforts to develop
transformation technologies that would transform controlled substances into commercially useful chemicals.
The information EPA has on these technologies suggests that they may be able to transform even controlled substances
that are taken from use systems and that are contaminated. Today's proposal anticipates the development of these
new technologies and would offer an incentive for the transformation of controlled substances that might otherwise
be released into the atmosphere. 

EPA is proposing to implement the Decision of the Parties to the Protocol to encourage practicable measures to prevent
the release of controlled substances to the atmosphere, recognizing that there are many options for creating incentives
that also achieve varying degrees of environmental benefits. EPA is therefore seeking comments on today's proposed
system for granting credits as an incentive for the destruction or transformation of controlled substances after
the phaseout and the options discussed above. 



2. Post-Phaseout Requirements for Essential-Use Production 



EPA discussed the issue of essential uses in its 

Federal Register 

notice containing the final accelerated allowance regulations (December 10, 1993, 58 FR 65018). While recognizing
the need to include provisions to implement the essential use provisions of the Montreal Protocol, the final rule
did not address how this would be incorporated into EPA's allowance program. 

a. 

Protocol Decisions Regarding Essential-Use Production.

 The Montreal Protocol established an essential use provision at the Fourth Meeting of the Parties (Decision IV/25).
Production and consumption are only to be permitted past the phaseout date for those applications approved under
this Decision. The Decision established both criteria for determining whether a specific use should be approved
as essential and a process for the Parties to use in making such a determination. 

The criteria for an essential use adopted by the Parties is the following: 

``(1) that a use of a controlled substance should qualify as `essential' only if: 

(i) it is necessary for the health, safety or is critical for the functioning of society (encompassing cultural and
intellectual aspects); and 

(ii) there are no available technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable
from the standpoint of environment and health; 

(2) that production and consumption, if any, of a controlled substance for an essential use should be permitted only
if: 

(i) all economically feasible steps have been taken to minimize the essential use and any associated emission of the
controlled substance; and 

(ii) the controlled substance is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked
or recycled controlled substances, also bearing in mind the developing country need for controlled substance.''

<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Thus, any proposed application for an essential use would 
be evaluated based on the social utility of that application, the 
availability of substitutes, and the potential for meeting that 
need through banked or recycled controlled substances. 



Decision IV/25 also set out the procedural steps for 
implementing this process. It first calls for individual Parties 
to nominate essential uses. These nominations are then to be 
evaluated by the Protocol's Technology and Economic Assessment 
Panel (TEAP or the Panel) which makes recommendations to 
representatives of all Protocol Parties. The final decision on 
which nominations are to be approved is to be taken by a meeting 
of the Parties. 



The initial cycle of implementing this Decision has been 
completed in the context of halons which were phased out of 
production at the end of 1993. EPA issued a 

Federal Register

 
notice requesting nominations for essential uses of halons 
(February 2, 1993; 58 FR 6786). In response, the Agency received 
over ten nominations, but was able to work with applicants to 
resolve their near-term requirements. As a result, the U.S. did 
not nominate any uses for continued halon production in 1994. 
About a dozen other nations put forth nominations which were 
reviewed by the Technical and Economics Assessment Panel. 
Because the Panel determined that in each case alternatives 
existed or that the existing supply of banked halons was adequate 
to meet near-term needs, it did not recommend approval of any of 
the nominations. In November of 1993, at the Fifth Meeting, the 
Parties unanimously adopted the recommendation of the Panel not 
to approve any essential uses for the production or consumption 
of halons in 1994. 



EPA issued a second notice for essential use nominations 
for halons on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53722). These nominations 
covered possible production of halons in 1995 for essential uses. 
In response to this inquiry, EPA received no nominations. 



Only one nomination (from France) was received by the TEAP 
for production and consumption of halons for an essential use in 
1995. The TEAP did not recommend approval of this nomination. 



EPA also issued a 

Federal Register

 notice requesting 
nominations for essential use applications which would need to 
continue beyond the 1996 phaseout of consumption and production 
allowances for CFCs, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and 
hydrobromofluorocarbons (May 20, 1993, 58 FR 29410). EPA 
received 20 applications in response to this notice. For several 
of these applications, EPA determined that the criteria contained 
in the Decision had not been satisfied. For example, two 
applications sought CFCs for servicing existing air-conditioning 
equipment. EPA rejected these applications on the basis that if 
all economically feasible steps were taken prior to the 1996 
phaseout, then adequate supplies of banked and recycled CFCs 
should be available. However, in rejecting these nominations, 
the United States noted that servicing existing air-conditioning 
and refrigeration remains a major challenge to the successful 
transition from the use of CFCs and that a future nomination in 
this area might be necessary if a combination of retrofits, 
replacements, recycling, recovery at disposal, and banking do not 
adequately address these needs. 



Of the responses to the 

Federal Register

 request for 
essential use applications, the United States submitted essential 
use nominations to the Protocol for the following uses of CFCs: 
metered dose inhalers and other selected medical applications; a 
bonding agent for the Space Shuttle; aerosol wasp killers; 
limited use in a specified bonding agent and polymer application; 
and a generic application for laboratory uses under specified 
limitations. (Letter from Pomerance to UNEP, September 27, 1993). 



Nominations from the U.S. and other countries for over 200 
specific uses were submitted to the Montreal Protocol Secretariat 
and provided to the Technical and Economics Assessment Panel for 
review. In March 1994, the Panel issued the ``1994 Report of the 
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel.'' The Report includes 
the Panel's recommendations for essential-use production and 
consumption exemptions. The Panel recommended that essential use 
exemptions be granted for nominations of: methyl chloroform in 
solvent bonding of the Space Shuttle; CFCs used in metered dose 
inhalers; and specific controlled substances needed for 
laboratory and analytical applications. 



For each of the other nominations submitted, the Panel 
determined that one or more of the criteria for evaluating an 
essential use had not been satisfied. For example, in the case 
of several of the U.S. nominations, the report states that 
alternatives are available and therefore the essential use 
exemption is not warranted.

The next meeting of the Parties is scheduled for October 
1994. At that session the Parties will review the 
recommendations by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel 
and make final decisions on this round of essential use 
nominations. 



In 1993, the Parties to the Protocol modified the timetable 
for submission of essential use nominations to combine both 
halons and all the other class I controlled substances (except 
methyl bromide) and to reduce the overall length of time between 
nomination and decision. According to Decision V/18, essential 
use nominations for halon consumption and production for 1995 and 
beyond, and essential use nominations for all the other class I 
controlled substances (except methyl bromide) for 1997 and 
beyond, must be submitted to the Secretariat prior to January 1st 
of the year prior to the year for which production and 
consumption is being sought.
 Parties must submit essential use 
nominations for CFCs for 1997 (nominations for 1996 have already 
been considered) to the Montreal Protocol Secretariat by January 
1, 1996. EPA will revise its domestic schedule to require that 
nominations be submitted at least three months prior to the 
Protocol Secretariat deadline for submission, and will issue a 


Federal Register

 notice in August 1994, calling for essential use 
nominations for halons for 1996 and beyond. The next call by EPA 
for other class I controlled substances will be in August of 1995 
for 1997 essential-use exemption nominations. 







b. 

Domestic Implementation of Essential-Use Program. 

Any essential use exemptions would also have to comply with 
the provisions of the CAA. Section 604 of the CAA authorizes the 
granting of specific exemptions from the phaseout schedules 
contained in the Clean Air Act for essential uses for methyl 
chloroform for which no safe and effective substitute is 
available (section 604(d)(1)), for limited quantities of class I 
substances solely for use in medical devices if such 
authorization is determined to be necessary (section 604(d)(2)) 
and for limited quantities of halon-1211, halon-1301 and halon-2402 solely for use in aviation
safety if no safe and effective 
substitute is available and if such authorization is necessary. 
The CAA also authorizes specific exemptions from the phaseout 
schedule of CFC-114, halon-1211, halon-1301 and halon-2402 for 
national security (section 604(f)). 



In today's action, EPA does not propose essential uses 
under the provisions of the CAA. However, EPA does propose to 
permit continued production for the essential uses authorized 
under the Protocol, so long as these essential use exemptions do 
not exceed amounts allowed in the schedule contained in section 
604(a) of the CAA. 



As indicated on the table below, EPA is proposing essential 
uses for specified controlled substances for the years 1996 and 
1997. As discussed in section A.1.c., ``The Post-Phaseout 
Procedures for Granting Destruction and Transformation Credits,'' 
EPA proposes to authorize continued production for essential uses 
permitted under the Montreal Protocol, but not to exceed the 
maximum allowable limits set forth in section 604(a) of the CAA. 
As used in a previous example in section A.1.c., the CAA requires 
that in 1996, the maximum allowable production of CFC-12 may be 
no more than 40 percent of the quantity produced in the baseline 
year. Thus, in 1996, if total production of CFC-12 were to be 
used for essential uses, the amount produced for those essential 
uses may not exceed 40 percent of the quantity produced in the 
baseline year. Although production may be used for some 
combination of essential uses, destruction credits, or 
transformation credits, the total amount produced could not 
exceed the maximum allowable limits set forth in the CAA as 
reproduced in Table I below. 



To incorporate the essential-use provisions under the 
Montreal Protocol into our domestic allowance program, EPA is 
proposing the creation of a new class of allowances to be 
referred to as ``essential-use allowances.'' 



The essential-use allowances will be allocated to United 
States entities based on the nominations made to the Protocol 
which will be decided upon by the Parties at the October 1994 
meeting and at meetings thereafter. In the nominations to the 
Protocol, U.S. entities apply for an essential-use exemption from 
the production and consumption phaseout for a specific quantity 
of controlled substance for a specific use. EPA proposes using 
the applications that are agreed to by the Parties to the 
Protocol to make specific allocations of essential-use 
allowances. Although the TEAP has received applications for 
essential-use exemptions beyond 1997, today's proposal only 
includes those recommendations by the Panel for 1996 and 1997. 
In today's rulemaking, EPA proposes an allocation of essential-use allowances up to the amount being recommended
by the 
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to the Parties for their 
meeting in October 1994. It should be noted that the final 
essential-use allowances promulgated by EPA may not exceed the 
exemptions adopted by the Parties.

The nomination for essential uses in 1996, 1997 and 1998 of 
CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride in analytical 
and laboratory applications is being recommended by the 
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel for a global exemption 
which will not specify the quantity granted to each Party. The 
TEAP describes the many analytical and laboratory procedures for 
which small quantities of controlled substances are now used and 
for which applications were received, such as: equipment 
calibration; extraction solvents, diluents, or carriers for 
specific chemical analyses; inducing chemical-specific health 
effects for biochemical research; and other critical purposes in 
research and development where substitutes are not readily 
available or where standards set by national and international 
agencies require specific use of a controlled substance. The 
TEAP recommendation for a global exemption pertains only to 1996, 
1997 and 1998 and refers to the manufacture of CFCs, methyl 
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride of very high purities to be 
packaged in small containers. Additional detailed information 
regarding the purity of the substances and the size of the 
containers being recommended by the TEAP is contained in Appendix 
G to subpart A. In anticipation of the Parties adopting this 
recommendation of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, 
EPA is proposing that a specific quantity of essential-use 
allowances for laboratory and analytical use not be designated. 
In anticipation of a Decision by the Parties at the October 
1994 meeting that does not specify the quantity of essential use 
allowances permitted for analytical and laboratory application, 
but a global essential-use exemption, EPA is proposing that 
producers or importers of the controlled substance require that 
laboratories certify they are purchasing the designated 
essential-use controlled substances only for laboratory or 
analytical uses, and that the substance will not be resold (see 
Recordkeeping and Reporting in Section C.7.b.). Unlike the 
system for the allocation of essential-use allowances for metered 
dose inhalers and space shuttle solvents, there will not be 
specific recipients of analytical/laboratory essential-use 
allowances. A person who claims the essential need for an 
analytical or laboratory application of a substance that has been 
phased out will be permitted to purchase the requested quantity 
as long as a certificate is provided to the importer or producer 
of the substance. The certificates will allow EPA to monitor the 
quantities of phased-out controlled substances that are used in 
analytical or laboratory applications domestically. EPA reserves 
the right to amend these procedures in the future based on 
information collected through the certificates and changes made 
by the Protocol. 
In the case of the allowances for specific essential uses, 
EPA proposes that the recipient of essential-use allowances 
confer to a producer or importer the right to produce or import a 
specific quantity of the specific controlled substance. The 
company conferring the essential-use allowances must, as in the 
case of laboratories, certify to the producer or importer that 
the controlled substance will only be used for the specified 
essential use. The producer or importer will report to EPA 
quarterly the quantity produced for essential uses, submitting 
the certification from the holder of the essential-use allowance. 
Due to the specific nominations of specific substances for 
specific uses, EPA is proposing that inter-pollutant transfers of 
essential-use allowances not be permitted. The application 
process described above in which U.S. companies petitioned the 
Parties to the Protocol through EPA for an essential-use 
exemption for a specific quantity of a specific substance for a 
given year indicated that the substance is essential for the 
specific application because no practicable alternative chemical 
exists. EPA reviewed these applications and made recommendations 
to the TEAP, which in turn reviewed the claims that the specific 
substance is essential for the application and recommended an 
exemption be given in those cases where experts felt no 
substitute exists. For the same reason, EPA proposes that inter-company transfers of essential-use allowances
not be permitted 
because allowances will be allocated based on a company's 
application to the Parties through EPA for a specific quantity of 
a controlled substance for a specific use. As a result, EPA is 
also proposing that inter-Party trades not be permitted since 
these would be trades between companies internationally and the 
allocations being recommended by the TEAP to the Parties for the 
October 1994 meeting are country-specific. 


B. Imports of Used Controlled Substances 


</TEXT>

In recognition of the critical role that previously used 
materials would play in ensuring a smooth transition to ozone- 
friendly substances, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol decided 
to encourage their expanded use. Specifically, in Decision 
IV/24 
(Copenhagen, 1992), the Parties decided ``not to take into 
account, for calculating consumption, the import and export of 
recycled and used controlled substances.'' EPA implemented this 
decision domestically in the December 10, 1993 phaseout rule 
(December 10, 1993; 58 FR 65018). Accordingly, EPA rules now 
allow importation of previously used or recycled controlled 
substances without allowances ( 82.4(a) and (b)). 
Although the December rule allows importation of used or 
recycled controlled substances, EPA is now investigating several 
cases of potential fraud in which the importer claimed that the 
substance was used or recycled when in fact, the Agency believes 
the substance was virgin or ``off-spec'' virgin (a newly 
manufactured substance that does not meet industry specifications 
for quality). Several other countries are investigating 
importation of controlled substances that were believed to be 
fraudulently labelled as used or recycled. Due to the difficulty 
of determining whether a substance is used or recycled, the 
Parties to the Montreal Protocol are very likely to consider a 
clarification of Decision 

IV/24 during the 1994 meeting. In an 
effort to facilitate final adoption of a rule that is consistent 
with the Protocol Parties' action, EPA is today proposing 
alternative methods for ensuring that materials brought into the 
country under the used and recycled allowance exemption are in 
fact used or recycled. 


Additionally, EPA is today proposing that the current 
definition of used and recycled controlled substances be changed 
to include only the term ``used'' since EPA believes recycled and 
reclaimed substances fall under the current definition. In this 
manner, a controlled substance is defined as used if it was 
recovered from a use system, regardless of whether it was 
subsequently recycled or reclaimed. The proposed change 
simplifies the references to used substances without confusion 
regarding their subsequent treatment. 



1. Information Requirements 


One method for ensuring that a substance claimed to be used 
is in fact used is to require that the importer have proof of the 
origin of the substance prior to import. Naming the previous use 
of the substance offers opportunities for verification, whether 
through chemical analysis or through knowledge of a country's 
infrastructure. Therefore, EPA is considering incorporating some 
or all of the following information requirements: 








_the name and address of the firm that recovered the 
chemical, 
_the type of equipment from which the substance was 
recovered, 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_the type of machine used to recover and/or recycle the 
material, 
_the name of the facility and/or the name of the equipment 
employed to reclaim a previously used substance, or 
_a chain of ownership of the substance from recovery to 
final import, 
_a certification from the foreign seller that the substance 
is previously used, 
_a chemical test of used imports where the quantity of the 
import exceeds some specified weight (e.g., 10,000 pounds). 



EPA is aware that the importer may not always know if the 
imported substance was in fact previously used. In the absence 
of information requirements such as those noted above, the 
importer might be forced to rely solely on the statements of 
exporters from other countries_individuals about whom the 
importer may know little or nothing. The types of information 
noted above are designed to provide an opportunity for 
independent verification of the nature of the substance being 
imported (both from the U.S., and by the exporting country 
government). 
As an alternative, or in addition to requiring import 
information such as that noted above, EPA proposes that it be 
able to request post-import information designed to ensure that 
the product is treated in a manner consistent with the claimed 
import status. Importers of used material that was not reclaimed 
may be asked to provide information on the facilities that they 
will use for reclaiming the used substances once imported. 
Information that EPA may require could include, where applicable:

 

_the name of the reclamation facility that will clean a used 
or a recycled substance to the specified ARI-700 Standard, 
_information demonstrating that such cleaning will take 
place, or 
_the bills of sale from the exporter to the actual purchaser 
of the substance (not necessarily the importer).

 


EPA requests comment on the above-noted list of potential 
information requirements, and requests comment on alternative 
information requirements that can reasonably be expected to 
result in an accurate determination of whether the substance 
being imported is in fact used. 


2. Certification by the Country of Export 


In future meetings, the Parties to the Protocol may decide 
to require the government of the country of origin of a material 
to certify its status as used prior to export. While this might 
obviate the need for some of the information listed in paragraph 
B.1. above, it would also require EPA to establish a program to 
certify any U.S. exports of used controlled substances. EPA 
already has a limited certification program for certain 
reclamation facilities. Under this program, reclamation 
facilities must be able to ensure that previously used substances 
will be reclaimed to a level of purity called for by the ARI-700 
Standard. With regard to exports of used substances, with such 
Protocol changes, U.S. exporters could be required to certify to 
EPA that the ``used'' substance that it wishes to export was indeed 
taken from a use system. The exporter could also be required to 
keep records on selected items under paragraph B.1. above, to 
facilitate future verification. EPA requests comments on this 
approach to certify that the used and recycled class I substances 
being exported are being recovered from use systems. 


3. Creation of a Permit Program for the Importation of Used 
Materials 


EPA is considering the use of a permit system for the 
importation of used controlled substances. In addition to the 
measures discussed in paragraphs B.1. and B.2. above, EPA 
believes a permit system may deter fraudulent import of 
mislabelled controlled substances, and may provide greater 
control over the entry of used controlled substances into United 
States jurisdiction. The European Union requires importers to 
have permits to control the import of mislabelled ozone-depleting 
substances that are used. EPA believes that adoption of a 
similar system of permits for the importation of used controlled 
substances may increase the effectiveness of enforcement actions 
against the illegal importation of used substances into the U.S. 
EPA seeks comments on the potential effectiveness of a permit 
system in controlling the import of mislabelled used controlled 
substances, in general, and the specific permit systems described 
below. Under all options being considered, an importer would not 
be able to import until a permit was granted. 
Currently, EPA receives a monthly list of importers of 
controlled substances from U.S. Customs. With a permit system, 
EPA would collect information from importers of used controlled 
substances and could match persons on the monthly U.S. Customs 
list with the list of persons who have permits to import used 
controlled substances. A person appearing on the U.S. Customs 
list who does not have a permit would be in potential violation 
of the regulation. A permit system would also enable compliance 
and enforcement staff to link suspicious imports by permitted 
importer to a specific person, i.e., the name and address of the 
company. Importers would also be aware that EPA held information 
on each import, providing a disincentive for fraudulent activity. 
One option EPA is considering would require individuals to 
obtain a permit from EPA prior to each proposed import of a used 
controlled substance. EPA would require the person to submit an 
application for a permit 15 days before the import is due to 
enter U.S. jurisdiction. EPA would then have 5 days in which to 
grant the permit. If EPA does not act within 5 days, the permit 
would be granted automatically. EPA would review the information 
to determine if the information is sufficient and verify the 
accuracy of the claims. If the application is denied, the person 
may appeal within 5 days. EPA would then have 5 days in which to 
review the appeal and deny or grant the permit. If EPA does not 
make a determination on the appeal within 5 days, the permit 
would be granted automatically. 
The application for an import permit for a particular 
shipment of used controlled substances would need to include the 
name and address of the importer, their importer identification 
number, and the quantity of controlled substance that the person 
intends to import. In addition, the individual would be required 
to furnish information such as that outlined under paragraph 
B.1., ``Information Requirements,'' that ensures the substance 
being imported is in fact ``used.'' EPA is requesting comment on 
a list of information requirements in paragraph B.1. to identify 
those which might best verify that a controlled substance is in 
fact ``used.'' In addition, importers of used controlled 
substances may be asked to provide information on the reclamation 
facility they will use once the substance is imported, in order 
to bring the contaminated material to chemical and physical 
specifications for sale in the United States. EPA is considering 
this option because it would provide detailed, timely information 
on each shipment and allow more accurate compliance 
determinations. However, EPA is seeking comments on the 
potential constraints on trade that a shipment by shipment 
permitting system might impose.

Another option EPA is considering would require all 
importers of used controlled substances to apply each year for a 
permit. Such a permit application would need to be submitted to 
EPA between November 1 and November 15 in the year prior to the 
control period for which it would be applicable. The permit 
application would include the person's name and address, their 
importer identification number, and the intended quantity of used 
controlled substance that the person estimates will be imported 
during the control period. The estimates would not be binding, 
but would provide EPA with information on the total potential 
import of used controlled substances for the U.S. for that year. 
EPA would need to make a determination within 30 days of the 
receipt of an application. If the application is denied due to 
insufficient information, the person would have 5 days in which 
to appeal the decision. EPA would then have an additional 5 days 
in which to deny or grant the permit. If EPA did not act in the 
5 days, the permit would be granted automatically. A person 
wishing to import used controlled substances who did not apply 
for a permit during the designated time before the control 
period, may submit an application at any time during the year. 
However, EPA would maintain the right to review the application 
within 60 days of its receipt. A 60-day review of the 
application is justified by the fact that the person is applying 
outside of the designated time for processing permits. Any 
person receiving a permit outside of the designated time period 
for application would be required to apply again for the 
following control period, during the designated period.

The importers granted permits for a year would be asked to 
furnish information upon the import of each shipment of used 
controlled substance. EPA is requesting comment on a list of 
information requirements in paragraph B.1. to determine those 
that best verify that an imported controlled substance is used. 
Such information would become the reporting requirements for each 
particular shipment for individuals holding a permit to import 
used controlled substances. 

The yearly permit system described may be easier to 
implement and comply with than a permit system for each imported 
shipment of used controlled substance. A permit system for each 
shipment, however, could provide more detailed information and 
potential control over each particular import of used substances. 
The Agency seeks comments on the options discussed above and also 
solicits suggestions on other approaches for permit requirements 
that are not burdensome but adequately ensure that imported used 
controlled substances are in fact ``used.'' 



C. Adjustments and Clarifications of the Allowance Program to 
Become Effective January 1, 1995
 


This section describes proposed changes to the current 
regulation in an effort to address issues that have arisen since 
the December 10, 1993 rule. The proposed clarifications in this 
section are made to increase the efficiency of the requirements 
and reduce the administrative burden for affected individuals and 
the Agency. The following paragraphs propose changes to the 
current rule that would go into effect January 1, 1995, for the 
last control period before the phaseout begins on January 1, 
1996. 



1. Changes in Requirements for Export to Article 5 Countries 



In accordance with the Montreal Protocol, limited 
production of controlled substances for export to Article 5 
countries may continue after the phaseout. Specifically, Article 
2 of the Protocol allows Parties to produce beyond the January 1, 
1996 phaseout to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 
countries. Article 5 countries are defined by the Parties as 
developing countries ``whose annual calculated level of 
consumption of class I, Group I controlled substances is less 
than 0.3 kilograms per capita.'' Article 5 countries are listed 
in Appendix E to Subpart A. 

Under the current Allowance Program, a company must have 
production and consumption allowances before producing a 
controlled substance for export to an Article 5 country. 
Companies with a baseline allocation of consumption and 
production allowances for specific controlled substances 
currently are given an allocation of potential production 
allowances amounting to ten percent of their baseline production 
allowances until January 1, 2000, and fifteen percent of baseline 
production allowances from January 1, 2000, until January 1, 2011 
based on phaseout dates required by the Clean Air Act (see 
discussion below regarding proposed changes in percentage 
allocations, based on accelerated phaseout dates). These 
companies may request the conversion of these potential 
production allowances to production allowances after exporting a 
controlled substance to an Article 5 country. 

Effective January 1, 1995, EPA proposes changing the name 
of potential production allowances to Article 5 allowances. In 
today's rule, EPA also proposes to eliminate the process for 
converting potential production allowances to production 
allowances beginning January 1, 1995. This proposed change would 
eliminate the current process where companies expend production 
and consumption allowances up-front to produce a controlled 
substance for export to an Article 5 country and, after the 
export, request the conversion of potential production allowances 
to production allowances. The changes are proposed to anticipate 
the elimination of production allowances for class I controlled 
substances (except methyl bromide) after January 1, 1996, and to 
ease the administrative burdens created by the current process. 

EPA proposes that beginning January 1, 1995, the Agency 
assign Article 5 allowances to companies that have an allocated 
baseline of production allowances.
 Under the proposed system, 
a company would notify the Agency at the end of the quarter in 
which they exported to Article 5 countries. EPA would then 
deduct the amount of controlled substance exported to Article 5 
countries from the balance of Article 5 allowances held by the 
company, rather than require an application to convert potential 
production allowances to production allowances. 





The Agency is also proposing to correct the date from 
which, and until which, companies may produce 15 percent of 
baseline allowances for export to Article 5 countries. CAA 
section 604(e)(2)(C) permits production for developing countries 
to exceed baseline allowances by up to 15 percent beginning 
January 1, 2000, and to continue until January 1, 2010 (2012 in 
the case of methyl chloroform). However, the Protocol permits 
production for export to Article 5 countries at 15 percent of 
baseline allowances beginning with the phaseout date (January 1, 
1994, for halons, and January 1, 1996, for CFCs, methyl 
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and continuing for ten years 
after the Protocol phaseout (until 2003 for halons and until 2006 
for CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride). Since the 
terms of the Protocol are more stringent than those of the CAA, 
EPA proposes to permit production of class I substances for 
export to Article 5 countries to continue until 2006 (2003 for 
halons).

At the 1992 London meetings, the Parties agreed that 
Parties may produce fifteen percent of baseline production 
allowances of all class I controlled substances (except methyl 
bromide and HBFCs) to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 
countries starting from the phaseout date (January 1, 1994, for 
halons, and January 1, 1996, for CFCs, methyl chloroform and 
carbon tetrachloride). CAA section 604(e)(2) authorizes 
production of a class I substance at the production percentage 
specified for a given year (see phaseout schedule in Table I of 
section A.2. Post-Phaseout Requirements for Essential-Use 
Production), plus an amount equal to 10 percent of the baseline 
production allowances for export to developing countries. In 
the year in which the CAA phases out production of class I 
controlled substances, section 604(e)(2)(B) authorizes production 
of a class I controlled substance for export to developing 
countries up to 15 percent of baseline allowances. Under the 
CAA, production of listed class I controlled substances 
terminates on January 1, 2000, except for methyl bromide on 
January 1, 2001, and methyl chloroform on January 1, 2002. 


CAA section 604(e)(2) permits production based on limits 
imposed under section 604(a) plus 10 percent of the baseline 
allowance. Thus, in the example cited above for 1996, the CAA 
authorizes 40 percent of baseline production for CFC-12 as listed 
in Table I in this preamble, plus an additional 10 percent for 
export to Article 5 countries, for a total production of 50 
percent of total baseline production for that year. Under 
today's proposal, because the Protocol phases out production of 
CFCs in 1996, up to 50 percent of baseline could be produced 
through a combination of destruction credits, transformation 
credits, essential use allowances and Article 5 allowances. A 
person's total production in 1996 could not exceed 50 percent of 
baseline allowances. Of this total production, production for 
export to Article 5 countries could not exceed 15 percent of 
baseline allowances as authorized under the Protocol. In 
addition, any amount of production in excess of 40 percent of 
baseline allowances would have to be for export to Article 5 
countries. This same scenario would pertain to the production of 
halons for export to Article 5 countries from 1994. EPA invites 
comment on this interpretation. 


In proposing today's changes to the procedures for Article 
5 allowances, EPA considered the following changes to the 
provisions for transfers and conversions in  82.12. Inter-pollutant transfers of Article 5 allowances, as
currently defined 
in  82.12, will continue to be permitted within the Groups of 
class I substances listed in Appendix A and F of Subpart A. 
Inter-pollutant transfers of Article 5 allowances will continue 
to require a one percent offset, as required by section 607 of 
the CAA and stipulated in the current regulation. 


The Agency is also proposing that inter-company transfers 
of Article 5 allowances be permitted as currently defined in 
 82.12 and inter-Party trades of Article 5 allowances be 
permitted as currently described in  82.9. However, the 
requirement that the controlled substance in an inter-Party trade 
return to the country from whom the allowances were traded will 
not apply in the case of Article 5 allowances as stipulated in 
 82.9(a)(b)(1)(vi). As an example, if one Party to the Protocol 
wants to trade Article 5 allowances to another Party to achieve 
improved economies of scale, the controlled substance produced 
with the allowances would not need to be returned to the Party 
from whom the allowances were traded; instead, the substance 
could be sold directly to an Article 5 country. The Agency 
proposes maintaining the requirement that the contract contain 
the statement that the controlled substance exported to an 
Article 5 country will only be used to meet basic domestic needs, 
as defined by the Montreal Protocol, and will not be reshipped. 
In addition, EPA understands that the Parties to the Protocol are 
considering, for future discussion, that reports be sent from the 
exporter to Article 5 countries indicating that they should 
expect to receive a shipment of a specific quantity of controlled 
substance. The Parties may discuss requirements that the 
exporting company send a copy of the sales contract for an export 
to the head of the Montreal Protocol delegation of the Article 5 
country or to the stratospheric ozone unit in the Article 5 
country. 
EPA seeks comments on the proposed changes to the system 
for controlling and monitoring exports of controlled substances 
to Article 5 countries. 



2. Administrative Changes to the Consumption Allowance 
Requirements for Exports

The current regulation requires that production of 
controlled substances for export to Parties meet the requirements 
for both consumption and production allowances. The current rule 
requires producers to expend both production and consumption 
allowances to produce class I controlled substances. If the 
controlled substance is then exported to a Party, the producer 
(or exporter) may request that EPA ``refund'' consumption 
allowances equal to the amount exported. 


EPA considered not proposing any changes to the 
administrative procedures because only one year remains before 
the phaseout of class I controlled substances begins on January 
1, 1996. However, EPA recognizes that the administrative process 
of expending consumption allowances to produce class I controlled 
substances for export, with the subsequent request to have the 
consumption allowances refunded for these exported substances, is 
cumbersome for the producer, especially at this point in the 
schedule of the phaseout. In the last control period before the 
phaseout (from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 1996), producers are 
reducing their production to a fraction of the quantity they 
produced in previous years (see schedule for phaseout in  82.8). 


EPA believes United States companies should be able to 
respond in a timely manner to requests for controlled substances. 
If United States companies are not able to respond to requests 
for controlled substances in a timely manner due to the 
administrative procedures created by the current rule, these 
business opportunities will be lost to foreign competitors. 


According to reports from producers, the time lag between the 
expenditure of consumption allowances during production and the 
receipt of the refunded consumption allowances for an export can 
often mean missing the opportunity to fulfill a request for a 
controlled substance. As a result, the Agency is proposing to 
reduce the time taken to refund consumption allowances for an 
exported controlled substance. 


By changing the reporting requirements so companies report 
earlier to the Agency, EPA proposes to reduce the time taken to 
refund the consumption allowances expended in the production of 
controlled substances that are exported. This proposal would 
permit a U.S. company to report the export of a controlled 
substance to a Party at the time the export is initiated, rather 
than requiring the producer to submit the completed bill of 
lading and the invoice with the request for additional refunded 
consumption allowances. This change in the reporting procedures 
would allow the company to submit a preliminary report of export 
earlier. Therefore, EPA would be able to authorize the refund of 
consumption allowances earlier, contingent upon verification of 
the export when the company submitted the bill of lading and 
invoice. Today's proposal would permit companies to expend the 
contingent consumption allowances to meet their production or 
importation needs in a more timely manner. The contingent 
authorization of consumption allowances will accelerate the time 
in which companies receive the allowances, allowing them to meet 
requests for controlled substances in a timely manner. Thus, 
companies will be less constrained by the time lag caused by 
current administrative requirements. However, in the event that 
documentation submitted by the company does not support the 
export, EPA will consider that the granting of the consumption 
allowances never occurred, potentially putting the company in 
violation of the requirements. 


EPA also considered another option in making today's 
proposal. The option considered would exempt the production of 
class I controlled substances from the consumption allowance 
requirements, if the substance is exported to Parties during the 
one remaining control period before the phaseout (from January 1, 
1995 to January 1, 1996). This option would include an exemption 
for methyl bromide from the consumption allowance requirements 
for exports beginning January 1, 1995, and extending until 
January 1, 2001. Producers would be allowed to produce class I 
controlled substances for export to a Party with only the 
expenditure of production allowances. 


Under the second option described above, exports would be 
exempt from the requirements to expend consumption allowances. 
If the producer is certain that a person purchasing the 
controlled substance in the United States would export to a 
Party, there would be no requirement to expend consumption 
allowances in the production of that substance under this option. 
The exporter would certify to the producer, either in the sales 
agreement or in a letter, that the controlled substance would be 
exported. When the producer has no guarantee that the substance 
would, or would not, be exported to a Party, they would expend 
both production and consumption allowances in producing the 
controlled substance. 


Under the current regulation, a person in the United States 
may receive both production and consumption allowances from a 
Party to the Protocol in an inter-Party trade (under the Protocol 
this is called industrial rationalization). The U.S. company 
that receives the allowances from the other Party expends the 
production and consumption allowances to produce a controlled 
substance. The controlled substance produced with the traded 
allowances is then exported to the Party from whom the allowances 
were traded. The U.S. company expends consumption allowances in 
the production of the controlled substance for an inter-Party 
trade and then asks EPA for a ``refund'' of these consumption 
allowances because the controlled substance was exported. 


Due to the redundant cycling of consumption allowances in 
inter-Party trades to the United States described above, EPA is 
also considering the option that a person 

not 

receive additional 
consumption allowances through inter-Party trades for the 
remaining control period from January 1, 1995, to January 1, 
1996. Under this option, consumption allowances would not be 
expended in the production of controlled substances as part of an 
inter-Party trade. The option of eliminating consumption 
allowances for inter-Party trades to the United States for methyl 
bromide would begin January 1, 1995, and extend until January 1, 
2001. EPA seeks comments on this considered option to alleviate 
administrative requirements for consumption allowances for the 
export of controlled substances to Parties to the Protocol.

Today's proposal is to receive a preliminary export report from U.S. companies at the time they initiate an export
and authorize a contingent refund of consumption allowances with verification conducted later when the company
submits the bill of lading and invoice for the export. However, the Agency considered two other options for today's
proposed rulemaking: (1) to maintain the status quo requirements and reporting procedures in the current regulation
for the remaining control period from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 1996, (2) to eliminate the requirement that consumption
allowances be expended if the controlled substance is produced for export to a Party to the Protocol. EPA seeks comments
on today's proposal and the other options considered for controlled substances exported to Parties of the Protocol.


3. Administrative Changes to Production Allowance Requirements for Exports that are Transformed or Destroyed 

EPA is proposing that a person who produces a controlled substance for exportation to a Party to the Protocol for transformation
or destruction may request from the Agency the refund of the production allowances expended in the production of the
substance. The proposal pertains to the production of class I controlled substances for the control period beginning
January 1, 1995 and ending January 1, 1996, except for methyl bromide. For methyl bromide, the proposed refund of expended
production allowances for quantities exported to Parties which are certified to be for transformation or destruction
would begin January 1, 1995 and extend until January 1, 2001. As with the procedures for refunding consumption allowances,
a person in the U.S. producing or purchasing a class I controlled substance may, upon export to a Party for subsequent
transformation or destruction, request from EPA a ``refund'' of production allowances with a certification that
the production allowances were expended in the production of the substance. To ensure that the controlled substance
is in fact transformed or destroyed by the recipient in a Party country, the Agency is proposing exporters be required
to include in the sales contract a certification of the future transformation or destruction. In parallel with the
administrative changes proposed in the previous section for consumption allowances, the Agency proposes accelerating
the procedures for requesting production allowances for the export of substances that will be transformed or destroyed.
This proposal would permit a U.S. company to report the export of a controlled substance for transformation or destruction
at the time the export is initiated, rather than requiring a completed bill of lading and invoice with a certification
in order to grant additional production allowances. EPA would authorize the refund of production allowances contingent
upon verification of the export for transformation or destruction by the bill of lading and invoice and the certification
of transformation or destruction. The company could expend the contingent production allowances to meet their production
or importation needs in a timely manner. However, in the event that documentation submitted by the company does not
support the export for transformation or destruction, EPA will consider that the granting of the production allowances
never occurred, which may mean the company is in violation if they do not have sufficient production allowances for
the quantity of controlled substances produced. In making today's proposal, EPA also considered eliminating the
expenditure of production allowances for class I controlled substances to be exported to Parties of the Protocol
for transformation or destruction. Under this option, the production of all class I controlled substances explicitly
for transformation or destruction in the U.S. or in a Party after January 1, 1995, would not require the producer to
expend production allowances. The producer would need a certification of intent to transform or verification of
destruction. To ensure that the controlled substance is transformed or destroyed by the recipient in a Party country,
the Agency would require the exporter to include a certification of future transformation or destruction in the sales
contract. EPA seeks comments on today's proposal to allow a person to request production allowances for the export
of class I controlled substances to Parties for transformation or destruction.

4. Treatment of Controlled Substances Remaining in Emptied Containers, i.e. ``Heels'' 




Heels are the amount of a substance remaining in a vessel or container after the majority is off-loaded or discharged.
For example, when a ship returns from transporting a controlled substance, the container that held the controlled
substance often retains a residue of the substance. This is known as the heel. Heels can be as much as ten percent of the
volume of a given container. A ship returning with a heel represents a significant volume of controlled substance
returning to the United States. 


Heels are included in the current definition of bulk controlled substance in the current regulation. Therefore,
the current interpretation of a bulk controlled substance requires ships returning with a heel to the United States
to expend consumption allowances to import that substance. 


EPA proposes amending the current consumption allowance requirements to exempt heels, effective January 1, 1995.
The amended definition will allow vessels with heels to return to the United States if the company certifies that certain
conditions are met. EPA proposes that heels be exempted from the consumption allowance requirements if the company
bringing the heel into the United States certifies that the residual amount will remain in the container and be included
in a future shipment, or recovered and banked for future recycling, reclamation, transformation, destruction or
non-emissive use. The industry rule-of-thumb is that a heel is up to ten percent of the volume of the container. Therefore,
EPA proposes that containers returning to the United States with more than ten percent of their volume filled with
controlled substance, and labelled as a heel, be required to expend consumption allowances to import the substance
until January 1, 1996. After January 1, 1996, a heel that is greater than ten percent of the volume of the container would
require the use of destruction or transformation credits for the importation for the amount in excess of ten percent.



The Agency is proposing that persons who bring heels back to the United States report annually their returns of heels.
The Agency will review this information to determine if the returns of heels is cause for concern due to volume and frequency
of occurrence. Comments are requested on this issue of exempting heels from the requirements to expend consumption
allowances to import. 




5. Clarification of the Definition of Transhipment 




Under the current regulation a person who transships a controlled substance from one foreign country through the
United States to another foreign destination does not need allowances. 


In the current regulation, transhipments of controlled substances are excluded from the limits and requirements
for allowances. The current regulation excludes transhipments from the allowance requirements consistent with
the Decision of the Parties to the Protocol. However, EPA wishes to further elaborate on the definition of transhipment.



The request to clarify the definition of transhipment was made by a company who ships controlled substances through
United States ports. The company brings controlled substances from other countries to United States ports where
the contents of a larger vessel are subdivided into smaller vessels for shipment to other countries. The question
arose whether this constituted repackaging and therefore was considered an import and thus subject to the requirements
of the regulation. Although the language of the regulation does not preclude repackaging, the preamble states that
transhipments are shipments of bulk chemicals that are ``not repackaged within the United States.'' Therefore,
the transfer of a controlled substance from one ship to another while in a U.S. port could possibly be interpreted to
constitute repackaging. 


In today's proposal, EPA further clarifies the definition of transhipment to allow for the transfer of controlled
substances between ships in United States ports as long as the substance does not enter into United States jurisdiction.
In other words, repackaging of controlled substances that are being transhipped through the United States, and that
do not enter into United States jurisdiction, do not require the expenditure of allowances. Today's proposal is intended
to clarify that transhipments do not require consumption allowances to be expended, whether or not the controlled
substance is repackaged. Today's clarification does not change the current rule; and transhipments are still excluded
from the requirements for production and consumption allowances. 


EPA wishes to further clarify the definition of transhipment to allow for shipments into and out of United States foreign
trade zones and subzones without requiring the expenditure of production or consumption allowances. Controlled
substances that enter United States foreign trade zones and subzones are not considered to be entering into United
States jurisdiction. EPA seeks comments on the proposed clarification of the definition of transhipment.

6. Provision of an Account Reconciliation Period 


EPA recognizes that as the phaseout enters the final year 
(1995) for production and consumption of class I controlled 
substances (except methyl bromide), the administrative task 
increases for a company to ensure that it has a balance of 
allowances at the end of the year. This is particularly 
difficult given the need to meet requirements for each controlled 
substance and to reconcile transformations, destructions, 
exports, imports and production. Several companies that produce, 
import, export, transform or destroy controlled substances have 
requested a period in which to reconcile all previous 
transactions in a year. 
EPA is proposing an administrative change to ease the end-of-year burden of reconciling the balance of allowances
without 
changing the level of environmental protection provided by the 
regulation. To ease this burden, EPA is proposing a 45-day 
period of reconciliation beyond the end of the control period in 
which persons may make inter-pollutant transfers of class I 
controlled substances as defined in the current regulation. 
Inter-pollutant transfers of controlled substances can only be 
made between controlled substances in the same Group as listed in 
Appendix A and F of Subpart A. In addition, the inter-pollutant 
transfer must be authorized by EPA and will include a one percent 
offset. The Agency is proposing that inter-company trades not be 
allowed past the end of the control period (December 31st of 
1995), and every subsequent control period for methyl bromide. The proposal allows for a potential net environmental
benefit and 
greater flexibility for end-of-control-period compliance. 
The proposed reconciliation period is being limited only to 
inter-pollutant transfers, in part, to provide a margin of 
latitude for companies in the final year of the phaseout when 
balancing production and consumption allowances at the end of 
year is important before closing the books. For many companies, 
the final year will be particularly difficult because there is 
less margin of error afforded in the amount of allowances 
provided for imports and production. Inter-pollutant transfers 
at the end of the control period are intra-company adjustments to 
the balance of allowances through paper accounting rather than an 
extension of the control period for trades, exports or transfers 
between companies. EPA seeks comments on the proposed period for 
the reconciliation of these specific allowances at the end of the 
control period. 


7. Additional Clarifications 


a. 

Unintended by-products of research and development.

 EPA proposes adding the production of unintended by-products of research and development applications to the list
of 
inadvertent or coincidental creation of insignificant quantities 
of listed substances in Appendix A or Appendix B in the 
definition of ``controlled substance.'' The Agency is proposing 
that these inadvertent or coincidental creations of insignificant 
quantities of unintended by-products during research and 
development applications not be considered controlled substances. 
The Agency believes that an unintended by-product a substance 
generated during research and development can be considered an 
inadvertent creation of a controlled substance. In addition, EPA 
received information from various companies that the amounts 
generated during research and development applications are 
generally insignificant quantities. The Agency reserves the 
right to require a person to destroy the unintended by-products 
of research and development applications if they are determined 
to be no longer insignificant. 

b. 

Export of increased production that is received through a 
trade from a party.

 EPA proposes removing the requirements under  82.9(b)(vi) 
and  82.10(c)(3) that compel increased production to return to 
the Party from whom a U.S. producer receives additional 
production or consumption allowances through an international 
trade. As a result of this proposal, U.S. companies could 
receive allowances through an international trade to produce for 
either the demand within the country from whom the allowances 
were traded or for the demand in the U.S. domestic market. The 
proposal would permit greater international market flexibility 
without increasing global production of ozone-depleting 
substances. EPA believes that U.S. producers will need greater 
flexibility to meet domestic demand as they enter the final year 
before the production of class I controlled substances is phased out (January 1, 1996). Sections 82.9 and 82.10 of
the current 
regulation permit international trades in accordance with the 
Protocol's definition of ``international rationalization'' as 
discussed in the 

Federal Register

 proposed rule published on 
December 14, 1987. Today's proposal would further support 
international rationalization by increasing opportunities for 
achieving ``economic efficiencies'' globally. Achieving these 
economic efficiencies is particularly important as all Parties 
continue to reduce production prior to the phaseout in 1996. EPA 
seeks comments on the proposed amendment that would allow 
international trades from Parties to meet market demand for class 
I controlled substances within the United States. 



8. Clarification of Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 


EPA is proposing amendments to the current recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements to more effectively address issues 
that have arisen and are likely to arise as the phaseout date is 
near and for the period following the end of production of class 
I controlled substances in the United States. In addition, EPA 
proposes to amend reporting and recordkeeping requirements to 
reflect the proposed changes discussed earlier. 

a. 

Reporting and recordkeeping for transformation and 
destruction.

 As with the earlier section describing transformation and 
destruction (Section A.1.), this section distinguishes between 
the different categories of recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements for producers, importers, transformers and 
destroyers.

EPA is proposing that the administrative changes to the 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements for transformation and 
destruction be effective January 1, 1995. The changes are made 
to reduce redundancy and clarify the responsibilities of 
companies that produce or import substances that are transformed 
or destroyed, as well as the responsibilities of transformers or 
destroyers controlled substances (see paragraph A.1. of this 
proposed rule). EPA is proposing changes to the recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements for importers to address issues of 
importation of used, recycled or reclaimed controlled substances. 
These proposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements for 
importers are described in greater detail in Section C.7.c., 
Recordkeeping and Reporting for Imports. 

(i) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for producers 
and importers of controlled substances that were 
produced or imported explicitly for transformation or 
destruction in the United States. Today's proposal does not change the recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements for persons who produce controlled 
substances that are explicitly for transformation or destruction 
within the United States. Although EPA is proposing changes to 
the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for importers to 
address issues of importation of used, recycled or reclaimed 
controlled substances (described in greater detail in Section 
C.7.c., Recordkeeping and Reporting for Imports), there are no 
changes to the requirements for importing controlled substances 
that are explicitly for transformation or destruction. 
Under the current regulation, companies that produce or 
import controlled substances explicitly for destruction or 
transformation in the United States are required to maintain 
records and to report to EPA quarterly. The producers and 
importers must report quarterly the ``amount of controlled 
substances sold or transferred during the quarter to a person for 
use in processes resulting in their transformation or 
destruction,'' and submit the IRS transformation certification or 
destruction verification. Producers and importers must also 
report quarterly on the quantity that they themselves transform 
or destroy in the quarter. 

(ii) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for producers 
and importers of controlled substances that were 
produced or imported for intended emissive uses but 
subsequently transformed or destroyed. Today's proposal does not change these requirements 
regarding controlled substances sold for intended emissive uses 
that are subsequently transformed or destroyed. 
The current regulation requires producers and importers to 
report on controlled substances sold for emissive uses. However, 
the current rule does not require producers or importers to 
maintain records or report to the Agency on the subsequent 
transformation or destruction of controlled substances initially 
produced for emissive uses. Once the controlled substance is 
sold for an emissive use the producer or importer is no longer 
responsible for informing the Agency of its subsequent 
disposition, whether it be for emissive use, for transformation, 
or, for destruction. 

(iii) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for 
transformers and destroyers of controlled substances 
that were produced or imported explicitly for 
transformation or destruction. The Agency is not proposing changes to the recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements for those persons who transform or 
destroy controlled substances that were produced or imported 
explicitly for transformation or destruction. The transformers 
will continue to submit an IRS certification of intent to 
transform to the producer or importer and the destroyers will 
continue to submit a destruction verification to the producer or 
importer. Those transformers and destroyers who submit a 
certification or verification must continue to report annually to 
EPA as in the current regulation under  82.13(m). The Agency 
verifies the transformation or destruction of controlled 
substances that were explicitly produced or imported for 
transformation or destruction through this annual reporting.

<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00089 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The current regulation requires all companies that destroy 
or transform controlled substances, regardless of whether or not 
they were produced or imported explicitly for transformation or 
destruction, to maintain records and to report to EPA the amounts 
of substances destroyed or transformed within 45-days of the end 
of the control period (annually). Facilities that transform or 
destroy controlled substances that were explicitly produced or 
imported for transformation or destruction must submit an IRS 
certificate of intent to transform or a destruction verification 
to the producer when the substance is sold or transferred. The 
producer reports to EPA quarterly the quantities sold or 
transferred for transformation or destruction with a copy of the 
IRS transformation certification or the destruction verification. 
EPA requires the information from both the producer/importer and 
the transformer/destroyer to crosscheck and verify the quantity 
of controlled substances claimed to be produced or imported 
without expended allowances explicitly because it was for 
transformation or destruction. 
(iv) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for 
transformers of controlled substances produced or 
imported for intended emissive uses. 
Under the current regulation, a person who transforms a 
controlled substance that was produced for intended emissive uses 
may request additional production allowances or consumption 
allowances from the Agency. The current regulation lists the 
information the Agency must receive to consider a request for 
additional production allowances in  82.9(c) and for additional 
consumption allowances in  82.10(b). A person may only request 
additional production allowances and consumption allowances for 
the transformation of class I controlled substances (except 
methyl bromide) that were produced for intended emissive uses 
during the remaining control period from January 1, 1995, to 
January 1, 1996. A person transforming methyl bromide that was 
produced for intended emissive uses may request additional 
production and/or consumption allowances until January 1, 2001. 
EPA proposes waiving the annual reporting requirement for 
transformation facilities that receive controlled substances that 
were produced or imported for intended emissive uses, as long as 
the facility does not request from EPA additional production or 
consumption allowances before January 1, 1996, and does not 
request transformation credits after January 1, 1996. If a 
person transforms a controlled substance produced or imported for 
intended emissive use for which additional production or 
consumption allowances are requested from EPA during the control 
period from January 1, 1995, until January 1, 1996, or for which 
transformation credits are requested from the Agency after 
January 1, 1996, the transformer must report to the Agency the 
name and quantity of substance transformed at the end of the 
control period. 
The proposed recordkeeping and reporting requirements for a 
transformer who requests transformation credits (beginning after 
January 1, 1996) are similar to the current requirements for 
obtaining additional production allowances as listed under 
 82.9(c). Effective January 1, 1996, a person who transforms a 
class I controlled substance (except methyl bromide) that was 
produced or imported for intended emissive use may submit 
specific information to EPA requesting transformation credits 
(see Section A.1.c., ``The Post-Phaseout Procedures for Granting 
Destruction or Transformation Credits). The following 
information must be submitted to request transformation credits:

 

_The identity and address of the person requesting the 
credits; 
_The name, quantity, and volume of controlled substance 
transformed; 
_A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of 
the controlled substance to the person; 
_The name of the use system from which the controlled 
substance was recovered;

 

(v) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements for 
destroyers of controlled substances produced or 
imported for intended emissive uses. 
Under the current regulation, all facilities that destroy 
controlled substances that were produced or imported for intended 
emissive uses are required to report the names and quantities of 
class I substances destroyed within 45-days of the end of the 
control period. In addition, these destroyers may request 
additional production allowances and/or consumption allowances 
from EPA under the current regulation in  82.9(c) and  82.10(b). 
EPA proposes waiving the annual reporting requirement for 
destruction facilities that receive controlled substances that 
were produced or imported for intended emissive uses, as long as 
the facility does not request from EPA additional production or 
consumption allowances before January 1, 1996, and does not 
request destruction credits after January 1, 1996. However, if a 
person destroys a controlled substance produced or imported for 
intended emissive use for which additional production or 
consumption allowances are requested from EPA during the control 
period from January 1, 1995, until January 1, 1996, or for which 
destruction credits are requested from the Agency after January 
1, 1996, the destroyer must report to the Agency the name and 
quantity of substances destroyed at the end of the control 
period. 
The recordkeeping and reporting requirements for a 
destroyer who requests destruction credits (beginning after 
January 1, 1996) are similar to the information now required for 
additional production allowances as listed under  82.9(c). 
Effective January 1, 1996, a person who destroys a class I 
controlled substance (except methyl bromide) that was produced or 
imported for intended emissive use may submit specific 
information to EPA requesting destruction credits (see Section 
A.1.c. for a description of the ``The Post-Phaseout Procedures for 
Granting Destruction and Transformation Credits''). The 
information someone must submit to request destruction credits 
is:

 

_The identity and address of the person requesting the 
credits; 
_The name, quantity, and volume of controlled substance 
destroyed; 
_A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of 
the controlled substance to the person; 
_The name of the use system from which the controlled 
substance was recovered; 
_The efficiency of the destruction process.

 

(vi) Recordkeeping and reporting for exporters of controlled 
substances that are transformed or destroyed. 
The current regulation has no specific recordkeeping or 
reporting requirements for exporters of controlled substances 
that are transformed or destroyed. All exporters of controlled 
substances, regardless of whether the substance is exported for 
an intended emissive use, for transformation or for destruction, 
must submit the information listed under  82.13(h) to the Agency 
annually.

<TEXT>
 

Today's proposal includes procedures for refunding expended 
production allowances for controlled substances exported for 
transformation or destruction in the final control period. A 
person who requests additional production allowances for 
controlled substances exported for transformation or destruction 
must submit the same information required under the current rule 
for persons requesting additional consumption allowances in 
 82.10(a):

 

_The identities and addresses of the exporter and the 
recipient of the exports; 
_The exporter's Employer Identification Number; 
_The names and telephone numbers of contact person for the 
exporter and recipient; 
_The quantity and type of controlled substance exported; 
_The source of the controlled substance and the date 
purchased; 
_The date on which and port from which the controlled 
substances are exported from the United States or its 
territories; 
_The country to which the controlled substances were 
exported; 
_The bill of lading and the invoice indicating the net 
quantity of controlled substances shipped and documenting 
the sale of the controlled substances to the purchaser for 
either transformation or destruction; 
_The commodity code of the controlled substance exported.

 

In today's proposal, EPA wishes to accelerate the time when 
exporters of controlled substances to Parties can submit forms 
for the ``refund'' of consumption allowances, whether or not the 
substance is for transformation or destruction or for an emissive 
use. EPA is proposing that exporters submit the current ``Request 
for Additional Consumption Allowances'' form at the initiation of 
the export of a specific quantity of controlled substance to a 
Party rather than wait until a completed bill of lading and 
invoice are prepared. The proposed change accelerates the time 
taken to grant consumption allowances for exports. EPA proposes 
that the consumption allowances be granted for the quantity of 
controlled substance exported, with confirmation contingent upon 
receipt of the bill of lading and invoice. Granting of the 
consumption allowances will be confirmed upon review of the bill 
of lading and invoice. Such allowances may be used at the time 
granted, prior to confirmation. In the event, however, that EPA 
determines that the controlled substances are not exported for 
whatever reason, then EPA will consider that allowances were 
expended by the producer for the production of the controlled 
substance and the consumption allowances were never granted. 
Without the consumption allowances, the producer may have a 
negative balance, at which time the producer will be out of 
compliance. 
b. 

Reporting and recordkeeping for essential uses.

 
Today's proposal creates a new category of allowances 
called essential-use allowances in anticipation of the special 
exemptions that Parties to the Protocol will most likely approve 
for essential-use production after January 1, 1996. 
In today's rule, EPA is proposing that the final allocation 
of essential-use allowances be published in the final rule based 
on the Decisions of the Parties at their meeting in October of 
1994. Once the Parties have reached a final Decision in this 
first round of essential-uses designations, EPA will propose 
allocations of essential-use allowances that parallel the 
specific quantities of a controlled substance for the specific 
uses as nominated by specific U.S. entities to the Protocol. 
EPA is proposing a system whereby deductions will be made 
from the control period allocations of essential-use allowances 
based on quarterly reports submitted by producers and the 
recipient of the essential-use allowances. 
The producer or importer of controlled substances for 
essential uses must maintain, under today's proposal, the 
following records: (i) The letter conferring the essential-use 
allowances from the recipient of the allowances certifying that 
the controlled substance will be used only for the specified 
essential-use, and (ii) in the case of essential-use production 
for laboratory or analytical use, a certification from the 
laboratories that the quantity of the specific substance 
purchased will be used only for laboratory/analytical 
applications and will not be resold.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA is also proposing that the producers and importers of controlled substances for essential uses submit the following
information to the Agency quarterly: (i) A list of the labs and essential-use allowance holders for whom specific
controlled substances were produced or imported during the quarter, (ii) the name and quantity of the controlled
substance produced or imported for each lab and essential-use allowance recipient. 

To verify and crosscheck that essential-use allowances were conferred and that the controlled substance was delivered,
EPA is proposing that the original recipients of essential-use allowances submit quarterly a list of the producers
or importers to whom they transferred allowances and the quantity of the specific controlled substance that will
be, or was, delivered. Those persons purchasing controlled substances under the global exemption for labs must provide
the producer or importer with a detailed description of the analytical procedures requiring the substance with references
to published instructions, standards, or specifications. 

c. 

Reporting and recordkeeping for importers.

 EPA is proposing a clarification of the reporting and recordkeeping for importers to include the entry of virgin and
``off-spec'' virgin controlled substances under current requirements in order to forestall those mislabelled
as used, recycled or reclaimed controlled substance (the issue raised in Section B. ``Imports of Used or Recycled
Controlled Substances,'' of this preamble). EPA is proposing that importers in general, including importers of
used, recycled or reclaimed controlled substances, be required to maintain records on the items included in Section
B. of this preamble that are included in the final rule. In addition, EPA is proposing that the current quarterly reports
from importers differentiate between quantities of imported virgin substances and imported substances that are
used, recycled or reclaimed. 

EPA is also proposing that, at the point of entry into U.S. jurisdiction, importers of used refrigerant provide documentation
(or verification) of the reclamation facility where the controlled substance will be sent before it is sold within
the United States. In accordance with the regulation published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 14, 1993, (40 CFR Part 82) no class I or class II controlled substance may be sold or offered for sale for use as a
refrigerant unless it has been reclaimed to the ARI-700 Standard ( 82.154). Therefore, EPA is proposing
that importers of used or recycled controlled substances (including halons) provide information regarding the
facility at which the substance will be reclaimed. The proposal asks for information that should be readily available
to the importer because it is required by 40 CFR Part 82. By asking the importer to name the point of reclamation, EPA
hopes to deter the immediate sale of virgin or off-spec virgin controlled substances that are mislabelled as imported
used or recycled substances.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-1-00092 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To deter the import of virgin or off-spec virgin controlled substances that are mislabelled as reclaimed, EPA is proposing
that importers identify, at the point of entry into U.S. jurisdiction, the name and address of the overseas reclamation
facility to verify that the substance was indeed previously used and reclaimed. There are a limited number of reclamation
facilities for controlled substances worldwide, and as a Party to the Protocol, the United States can identify those
Parties capable of reclamation. Through the continued cooperation with U.S. Customs, EPA plans to develop coordinated
procedures for reviewing import documents at the point of entry into U.S. Customs territory that will identify controlled
substances suspected of being mislabelled virgin or off-spec virgin entering the U.S. as used, recycled or reclaimed.


The specific reporting requirements (in addition to any recordkeeping requirements that may be established under
Section B. of this preamble) that EPA is proposing, which would accompany the bill of lading and the bill of sale for
the import of used, recycled or reclaimed controlled substances, are: 

(i) For imports of used or recycled controlled substance, the previous use of each substance, and the intended reclamation
destination of the controlled substances in the United States, or 

(ii) For imports of reclaimed controlled substances, the country of origin of the used controlled substance, and
the foreign reclamation facility (reclamation equipment used) where the substance was reclaimed. 

d. 

Reporting and recordkeeping for article 5 exports. 

The current regulation asks producers to report quarterly on the amount of potential production allowances that
are converted to production allowances and the amount of unexpended potential production allowances. Today's proposal
changes the name of potential production allowances to Article 5 allowances but does not change the reporting requirements.
Instead of requiring the quarterly reporting of converted and unexpended potential production allowances, today's
proposal requires the producer to indicate the amount of Article 5 allowances expended quarterly in production for
export to Article 5 countries. 

Today's proposed amendments to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements are made to anticipate the phaseout
of class I controlled substances (except methyl bromide) in January 1, 1996. EPA proposes simplifying the quarterly
reporting beginning January 1, 1996, so that producers indicate which of the production exceptions applies (i.e.,
essential-use allowances, Article 5 allowances, destruction credits, transformation credits, transformation
or destruction) for a given quantity of controlled substance. EPA is proposing many of the changes to the requirements
to address issues and concerns raised by industry regarding the maintenance of a transparent and openly competitive
market in controlled substances during the transition to the phaseout. EPA requests comments on today's proposed
amendments to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 



III. Summary of Supporting Analysis 



A. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may:

 


(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments
or communities; 

(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

 


It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this proposed amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review under the Executive Order.




B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of
proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
(RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 

The Agency originally published an RFA to accompany the August 12, 1998 final rule (53 FR 30566) that placed the initial
limits on the production and consumption of CFCs and halons. That RFA was also updated as Appendix G of the Regulatory
Impact Analysis for the regulations implementing the phaseout schedule of section 604 of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. The Addendum to the Regulatory Impact Analysis was further updated in 1993 to examine the impact of the acceleration
of the phaseout and the phaseout of HCFCs on small businesses. The analysis in the Addendum indicated that the actions
were not expected to have a substantial impact on small entities. Today's proposed amendments to the current regulation
do not significantly change the current requirements, and in many cases reduce reporting or recordkeeping burdens
that might possibly impact small businesses. However, almost all businesses participating in the phaseout program
for ozone-depleting substances are large companies. Therefore, today's proposed amendments are expected to have
minimal if any impact on small entities. 

Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605, I certify that the regulation promulgated in this
notice will not have any additional negative economic impacts on any small entities. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the 

Paperwork Reduction Act

, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et. seq. 

An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1432.15) and a copy may be obtained from
Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, U.S. EPA, 401 M St., SW., (2136), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202)-260-2740.


The information collection requirements for this proposed action has an estimated reporting burden averaging 23.3
hours per response. This estimate includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed and completing the collection of information. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate of any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, U.S. EPA, 401 M St., SW., (2316), Washington, DC 20503,
marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information
collection requirements contained in this proposal.

 82.1 

Purpose and scope. 
 

(a) The purpose of the regulations in this subpart is to 
implement the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer and sections 603, 604, 605, 606, 607 and 616 of the 
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Public Law 101-549. The 
Protocol and section 604 impose limits on the production and 
consumption (defined as production plus imports minus exports, 
excluding transhipments and used controlled substances) of 
certain ozone-depleting substances, according to specified 
schedules. The Protocol also requires each nation that becomes a 
Party to the agreement to impose certain restrictions on trade in 
ozone-depleting substances with non-Parties. 
(b) This subpart applies to any person that produces, 
transforms, destroys, imports or exports a controlled substance 
or imports a controlled product. 


 82.2 

Effective date. 
 

(a) The regulations under this subpart take effect January 1, 
1995, unless otherwise noted herein. 
(b) The regulations under this subpart that were effective 
prior to [date of publication of the final rule] continue to 
apply for purposes of enforcing the provisions that were 
applicable prior to January 1, 1995. 


 82.3 

Definitions. 
 

As used in this subpart, the term: 
 

Administrator 

means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency or his authorized representative. 
 

Article 5 allowances 

means the allowances apportioned under 
 82.9(a) of this subpart. 
 

Baseline consumption allowances 

means the consumption 
allowances apportioned under  82.6 of this subpart. 
 

Baseline production allowances 

means the production allowances 
apportioned under  82.5 of this subpart. 
 

Calculated level 

means the weighted amount of a controlled 
substance determined by multiplying the amount (in kilograms) of 
the controlled substance by that substance's ozone depletion 
weight listed in Appendix A or Appendix B to this subpart. 
 

Class I 

refers to the controlled substances listed in Appendix 
A to this subpart. 
 

Class II 

refers to the controlled substances listed in 
Appendix B to this subpart. 
 

Completely destroy 

means to cause the expiration of a 
controlled substance at a destruction efficiency of 98 percent or 
greater, using one of the destruction technologies approved by 
the Parties. 
 

Complying with the Protocol, 

when referring to a foreign state 
not Party to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the London Amendments, 
or the Copenhagen Amendments, means that the non-Party has been 
determined as complying with the Protocol, as indicated in 
Appendix C to this subpart, by a meeting of the Parties as noted 
in the records of the directorate of the United Nations 
Secretariat. 
 

Consumption 

means the production plus imports minus exports of 
a controlled substance (other than transhipments, or used 
controlled substances). 
 

Consumption allowances 

means the privileges granted by this 
subpart to produce and import class I controlled substances; 
however, consumption allowances may be used to produce class I 
controlled substances only in conjunction with production 
allowances. A person's consumption allowances are the total of 
the allowances obtained under   82.7 and 82.6 of this subpart and 
 82.10 of this subpart, as may be modified under  82.12 of this 
subpart (transfer of allowances). 
 

Control period 

means the period from January 1, 1992 through

substance listed as a Class I, Group I or II substance in 
appendix A to this subpart. Controlled products include, but are 
not limited to, those products listed in appendix D to this 
subpart. Controlled products belong to one or more of the 
following six categories of products: 
(1) Automobile and truck air conditioning units (whether 
 incorporated in vehicles or not); 
 (2) Domestic and commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning/heat pump equipment (whether containing 
 controlled substances as a refrigerant and/or in 
 insulating material of the product), e.g.

Controlled substance 

means any substance listed in appendix A 
or appendix B to this subpart, whether existing alone or in a 
mixture, but excluding any such substance or mixture that is in a 
manufactured product other than a container used for the 
transportation or storage of the substance or mixture. Thus, any 
amount of a listed substance in appendix A or appendix B to this 
subpart that is not part of a use system containing the substance 
is a controlled substance. If a listed substance or mixture must 
first be transferred from a bulk container to another container, 
vessel, or piece of equipment in order to realize its intended 
use, the listed substance or mixture is a ``controlled substance.'' 
The inadvertent or coincidental creation of insignificant 
quantities of a listed substance in appendix A or appendix B to 
this subpart; during a chemical manufacturing process; resulting 
from unreacted feedstock; from the listed substance's use as a 
process agent present as a trace quantity in the chemical 
substance being manufactured; or as an unintended byproduct of 
research and development applications, is not deemed a controlled 
substance. Controlled substances are divided into two classes, 
Class I in appendix A to this subpart, and Class II listed in 
appendix B to this subpart. Class I substances are further 
divided into seven groups, Group I, Group II, Group III, Group 
IV, Group V, Group VI, and Group VII, as set forth in appendix A 
to this subpart.

Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, as amended at the Fourth 
Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Copenhagen in 
1992. 
 

Destruction 

means the expiration of a controlled substance to 
the destruction efficiency actually achieved, unless considered 
completely destroyed as defined in this section. Such 
destruction does not result in a commercially useful end product 
and uses one of the following controlled processes approved by 
the Parties to the Protocol: 
 (1) Liquid injection incineration; 
 (2) Reactor cracking; 
 (3) Gaseous/fume oxidation; 
 (4) Rotary kiln incineration; or 
 (5) Cement kiln. 
 

Destruction Credits 

means those privileges that may be 
obtained under  82.9 of this subpart to produce or import 
controlled substances.

does not result in the transformation or destruction of the 
controlled substance as defined in this subpart.



Essential-Uses 

means those uses of controlled substances 
designated by the Parties to the Protocol to be necessary for the 
health and safety of, or critical for the functioning of, 
society; and for which there are no available technically and 
economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are

 82.4 

Prohibitions. 
 


(a) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I 
controlled substances, except Group VI, and prior to January 1, 
2001 for Group VI, no person may produce, at any time in any 
control period, any controlled substance (except that are 
transformed or destroyed) in excess of the amount of unexpended 
production allowances or unexpended Article 5 allowances for that 
substance held by that person under the authority of this subpart 
at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of excess 
production constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. 
 
(b) Effective January 1, 1996, no person may produce, at any 
time in any control period, any class I, Group I, Group II, Group 
III, Group IV, Group V, or Group VII controlled substance (except 
for controlled substances that are transformed or destroyed) in 
excess of the amount of unexpended essential-use allowances under 
 82.4, amount of unexpended Article 5 allowances as allocated 
under  82.9 or the amount of unexpended destruction or 
transformation credits as obtained under  82.9 for that substance 
held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that 
time for that control period. Every kilogram of excess 
production constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. 
 
(c) Effective January 1, 1996, no person's total production of 
a class I controlled substance (except Group VI) as allocated 
under  82.4 for essential-use allowances, and as obtained under 
 82.9 for destruction or transformation credits, may, at any 
time, in any control period until January 1, 2000, exceed the 
percent limitation of baseline production in appendix H of this 
subpart, as set forth in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 
 
(d) In addition to total production permitted under  82.4(c), 
effective January 1, 1996, for class I, Group I, Group III, Group 
IV and Group V controlled substances, and effective January 1, 
1995, for class I, Group II, a person may, at any time, in any 
control period until January 1, 2000, produce 10 percent of 
baseline production as apportioned under  82.5 for export to 
Article 5 countries. No person may, at any time, in any control 
period until January 1, 2000, produce class I, Group I, Group II, 
Group III, Group IV, and Group V controlled substances for export 
to Article 5 countries in excess of the Article 5 allowances 
allocated under  82.9(a). 
 
(e) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I 
controlled substances, except Group VI, and prior to January 1, 
2001, for Group VI, no person may produce or (except for 
transhipments, heels, or for used controlled substances) import, 
at any time in any control period, any class I controlled 
substance (except for controlled substances that are transformed, 
or destroyed) in excess of the amount of unexpended consumption 
allowances held by that person under the authority of this 
subpart at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of 
excess production or importation (other than transhipments or 
used and recycled controlled substances) constitutes a separate 
violation of this subpart. 
 

(f) Effective January 1, 1995, no person may import, at any 
time in any control period, a heel of any class I controlled 
substance that is greater than 10 percent of the volume of the 
container in excess of the amount of unexpended consumption 
allowances, unexpended destruction credits or unexpended 
transformation credits held by that person under the authority of 
this subpart at that time for that control period. Every 
kilogram of excess importation constitutes a separate violation 
of this subpart. 
 
(g) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I 
controlled substances, except Group VI, and prior to January 1, 
2001, for Group VI, a person may not use production allowances to 
produce a quantity of a class I controlled substance unless that 
person holds under the authority of this subpart at the same time 
consumption allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class 
I controlled substances nor may a person use consumption 
allowances to produce a quantity of class I controlled substances 
unless the person holds under authority of this subpart at the 
same time production allowances sufficient to cover that quantity 
of class I controlled substances. However, only consumption 
allowances are required to import class I controlled substances 
with the exception of transhipments, heels and used controlled 
substances. 
 
(h) Every kilogram of a controlled substance, and every 
controlled product, imported or exported in contravention of this 
subpart constitutes a separate violation of this subpart, thus no 
person may: 
 
(1) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance 
listed in Class I, Group I or Group II, in appendix A to this 
subpart from or to any foreign state not listed as a Party to the 
1987 Montreal Protocol unless that foreign state is complying 
with the 1987 Montreal Protocol (See appendix C, Annex 2 of this 
subpart); 
 
(2) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance 
listed in Class I, Group III, Group IV or Group V, in appendix A 
to this subpart, from or to any foreign state not Party to the 
London Amendments (as noted in appendix C, Annex 1, to this 
subpart), unless that foreign state is complying with the London 
Amendments (as noted in appendix C, Annex 2, to this subpart); or 
 
(3) Import a controlled product from any foreign state not 
Party to the 1987 Montreal Protocol (as noted in appendix C, 
Annex 1, to this subpart), unless that foreign state is complying 
with the Protocol (as noted in appendix C, Annex 2, to this 
subpart).

(c) Until January 1, 1996, a company may also increase or 
decrease its production allowances by trading with another Party 
to the Protocol according to the provision under this paragraph 
of this section. A nation listed in Appendix C to this subpart 
(Parties to the Montreal Protocol) must agree either to transfer 
to the person for the current control period some amount of 
production that the nation is permitted under the Montreal 
Protocol or to receive from the person for the current control 
period some amount of production that the person is permitted 
under this subpart. 

(1) For trades from a Party, the person must obtain from the 
principal diplomatic representative in that nation's embassy in 
the United States a signed document stating that the appropriate 
authority within that nation has established or revised 
production limits for the nation to equal the lesser of the 
maximum production that the nation is allowed under the Protocol 
minus the amount transferred, the maximum production that is 
allowed under the nation's applicable domestic law minus the 
amount transferred, or the average of the nation's actual 
national production level for the three years prior to the 
transfer minus the production allowances transferred. The person 
must submit to the Administrator a transfer request that includes 
a true copy of this document and that sets forth the following: 

(i) The identity and address of the person; 
(ii) The identity of the Party; 
(iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the person and for the Party; 
(iv) The chemical type and level of production being transferred; and 

(v) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies.

(2) For trades to a Party, a person must submit a transfer request that sets forth the following: 
(i) The identity and address of the person; 
(ii) The identity of the Party; 
(iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the person and for the Party; 
(iv) The chemical type and level of allowable production to be transferred; and
(v) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies.
(3) After receiving a transfer request that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Administrator
may, at his discretion, consider the following factors in deciding whether to approve such a transfer: 
(i) Possible creation of economic hardship; 
(ii) Possible effects on trade; 
(iii) Potential environmental implications; and 
(iv) The total amount of unexpended production allowances held by United States entities. 
(4) The Administrator will issue the person a notice either granting or deducting production allowances and specifying
the control period to which the transfer applies, provided that the request meets the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)
of this section for trades from Parties and paragraphs (c)(2) of this section for trades to Parties, unless the Administrator
has decided to disapprove the trade under paragraph (c)(3) of this section for trades to Parties. For a trade from a
Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises the allowances held by the person to equal the unexpended
production allowances held by the person under this subpart plus the level of allowable production transferred from
the Party. For a trade to a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises the production limit for the person
to equal the lesser of: 

(i) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount transferred; or 

(ii) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount by which the United
States average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer
is less than the total allowable production allowable for that substance under this subpart minus the amount transferred.
The change in allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is issued. 

(5) If after one person obtains approval for a trade of allowable production of a controlled substance to a Party, one
or more other persons obtain approval for trades involving the same controlled substance and the same control period,
the Administrator will issue notices revising the production limits for each of the other persons trading that controlled
substance in that control period to equal the lesser of: 

(i) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount transferred; or 

(ii) The unexpended production allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the amount by which the United
States average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer
is less than the total allowable production for that substance under this subpart multiplied by the amount transferred
divided by the total amount transferred by all the other person trading the same controlled substance in the same control
period minus the amount transferred by that person.

(iii) The Administrator will also issue a notice revising the production limit for each person who previously obtained
approval of a trade of that substance in that control period to equal the unexpended production allowances held by
the person under this subpart plus the amount by which the United States average annual production of the controlled
substance being traded for the three years prior to the transfer is less than the total allowable production under
this subpart multiplied by the amount transferred by that person divided by the amount transferred by all of the persons
that have traded that controlled substance in that control period. The change in production allowances will be effective
on the date that the notice is issued. 

(d) Effective January 1, 1996, there will be no trade in production or consumption allowances with Parties to the Protocol
for class I controlled substances, except for class I, Group VI, methyl bromide.

(e) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class
I, Group VI, a person may obtain production allowances for that controlled substance equal to the amount of that controlled
substance produced in the United States that was transformed or destroyed within the United States in the cases where
production allowances were expended to produce such substance in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
A request for production allowances under this section will be considered a request for consumption allowances under
 82.10(b) of this subpart.

(1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class
I, Group VI, a person must submit a request for production allowances that includes the following: 

(i) The identity and address of the person; 

(ii) The name, quantity, and level of controlled substance transformed or the name, quantity and volume destroyed;


(iii) A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of the controlled substance to the person; 

(iv) A certification that production allowances were expended for the production of the controlled substance; 

(v) If the controlled substance is transformed, the name, quantity, and verification of the commercial use of the
resulting chemical transformed; and

(vi) If the controlled substance is destroyed, the efficiency 
of the destruction process. 
(2) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class 
I, Group VI, the Administrator will review the information and 
documentation submitted under paragraph (e)(1) of this section 
and will assess the quantity of class I controlled substance that 
the documentation and information verifies was transformed or 
destroyed. The Administrator will issue the person production 
allowances equivalent to the controlled substances that the 
Administrator determines were transformed or destroyed. For 
controlled substances completely destroyed under this rule, the 
Agency will grant allowances equal to 100 percent of volume 
intended for destruction. For those controlled substances 
destroyed at less than a 98 percent destruction efficiency, the 
Agency will grant allowances commensurate with that percentage of 
destruction efficiency that is actually achieved. The grant of 
allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is 
issued. 
(3) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class 
I, Group VI, if the Administrator determines that the request for 
production allowances does not satisfactorily substantiate that 
the person transformed or destroyed controlled substances as 
claimed, or that modified allowances were not expended, the 
Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the request for 
additional production allowances. Within ten working days after 
receipt of notification, the person may file a notice of appeal, 
with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The 
Administrator may affirm the disallowance or grant an allowance, 
as she/he finds appropriate in light of the available evidence. 
If no appeal is taken by the tenth day after notification, the 
disallowance will be final on that day. 
(f) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class 
I, Group VI, a person may obtain production allowances for that 
controlled substance equal to the amount of that controlled 
substance produced in the United States that was exported to be 
transformed or destroyed within a Party in the cases where 
production allowances were expended to produce such substance in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. 
(1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class 
I, Group VI, a person must submit a request for production 
allowances that includes the following: 
(i) The identities and addresses of the exporter and the 
recipient of the exports; 
(ii) The exporter's Employer Identification Number; 
(iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for 
the exporter and the recipient; 
(iv) The quantity and type of controlled substances 
exported; 
(v) The source of the controlled substance and the date

controlled substances were exported from the United States or its 
territories; 
(vii) The country to which the controlled substances were 
exported; 
(viii) The bill of lading and the invoice indicating the net 
quantity of controlled substances shipped and documenting the 
sale of the controlled substances to the purchaser for either 
transformation or destruction; 
(ix) The commodity code of the controlled substance 
exported. 
(x) Written statement from the producer that the controlled 
substance was produced with expended allowances. 
(2) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class 
I, Group VI, the Administrator will review the information and 
documentation submitted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section 
and will assess the quantity of class I controlled substance that 
the documentation and information verifies was exported to be 
transformed or destroyed. The Administrator will issue the 
person production allowances equivalent to the controlled 
substances that the Administrator determines were exported to be 
transformed or destroyed. The Agency will grant allowances equal 
to 100 percent of volume intended for destruction or 
transformation. The grant of allowances will be effective on the 
date that the notice is issued. 
(3) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for class 
I, Group VI, if the Administrator determines that the 
documentation for production allowances does not satisfactorily 
substantiate that the person exported for transformation or 
destruction as claimed, the Administrator will issue a notice 
disallowing the request for additional production allowances. 
Within ten working days after receipt of notification, the person 
may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the 
Administrator. The Administrator may affirm the disallowance or 
grant an allowance, as she/he finds appropriate in light of the 
available evidence. If no appeal is taken by the tenth day after 
notification, the disallowance will be final on that day. 
(g) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, a 
person may obtain destruction or transformation credits for a 
class I controlled substance (except class I, Group VI) equal to 
the amount of that controlled substance produced in the United 
States that was destroyed or transformed within the United States 
in cases where the controlled substance was produced for an 
emissive use in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, 
subtracting an offset of 15 percent. 
(1) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, a 
person must submit a request for destruction or transformation 
credits that includes the following:

(vi) For transformation credits, an IRS certificate of 
feedstock use or transformation of the controlled substance. 
(2) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, the 
Administrator will issue the person destruction or transformation 
credits equivalent to the class I controlled substance (except 
class I, Group VI) produced for emissive uses that the 
Administrator determines were destroyed or transformed, 
subtracting the offset of 15 percent. For controlled substances 
completely destroyed under this rule, the Agency will grant 
destruction credits equal to 100 percent of volume destroyed 
minus the offset. For those controlled substances destroyed at 
less than a 98 percent destruction efficiency, the Agency will 
grant destruction credits commensurate with that percentage of 
destruction efficiency that is actually achieved minus the 
offset. The grant of credits will be effective on the date that 
the notice is issued. 
(3) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, if 
the Administrator determines that the request for destruction or 
transformation credits does not satisfactorily substantiate that 
the person destroyed or transformed a class I controlled 
substance (except class I, Group VI) as claimed, or that the 
controlled substance was not previously used for an emissive 
purpose, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the 
request for additional destruction or transformation credits. 
Within ten working days after receipt of notification, the person 
may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the 
Administrator. The Administrator may affirm the disallowance or 
grant an allowance, as she/he finds appropriate in light of the 
available evidence. If no appeal is taken by the tenth day after 
notification, the disallowance will be final on that day.

(1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001 for class 
I, Group VI, to receive consumption allowances in addition to 
baseline consumption allowances, the exporter of the class I 
controlled substances must submit to the Administrator a request 
for consumption allowances setting forth the following: 
(i) The identities and addresses of the exporter and the 
recipient of the exports; 
(ii) The exporter's Employer Identification Number; 
(iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for 
the exporter and the recipient; 
(iv) The quantity and type of controlled substances 
exported; 
(v) The source of the controlled substance and the date 
purchased; 
(vi) The date on which, and the port from which, the 
controlled substances were exported from the United States or its 
territories; 
(vii) The country to which the controlled substances were 
exported; 
(viii) The commodity code of the controlled substance 
exported; and 
(ix) Written statement from the producer that the controlled 
substance was produced with expended allowances. 
(2) The Administrator will review the information and 
documentation submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
The Administrator will issue the exporter contingent consumption 
allowances equivalent to the level of controlled substances that 
the Administrator determined will be exported contingent upon 
receipt of confirming documentation. 
(3) To receive the consumption allowances, the exporter of the 
class I controlled substances must submit to the Administrator a 
request for consumption allowances including the following: 
(i) The bill of lading and the invoice indicating the net 
quantity of controlled substances shipped and documenting the 
sale of the controlled substances to the purchaser. 
(ii) [Reserved]
(4) The Administrator will assess the quantity of controlled 
substances that the documentation under paragraph (a)(3) verifies 
was exported. The Administrator will issue the exporter 
consumption allowances equivalent to the level of controlled 
substances that the Administrator determined were exported. The 
grant of the consumption allowances will be effective on the date 
the notice is issued. If the Administrator determines that the 
confirming documentation does not satisfactorily substantiate 
that the person exported controlled substances as claimed the 
Administrator will issue a notice that the consumption allowances 
are not granted. 
(b) A person may obtain consumption allowances for that 
controlled substance equal to the amount of a controlled 
substance either produced in, or imported into, the United States 
that was transformed or destroyed in the case where consumption 
allowances were expended to produce or import such substance in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. Effective 
January 1, 1996, consumption allowances will not be granted for a 
class I controlled substance (except class I, Group VI) produced 
in, or imported into, the United States that was transformed or 
destroyed. However, a person producing or importing a controlled 
substance (except class I, Group VI) that was transformed or 
destroyed must submit to the Administrator the information 
described under  82.13 (f)(3) (i) and (ii). 

(c) A company may also increase its consumption allowances by 
receiving production from another Party to the Protocol for class 
I, Group I through Group V and Group VII controlled substances 
until January 1, 1996, and for class I, Group VI controlled 
substances until January 1, 2001. A nation listed in Appendix C 
to this subpart (Parties to the Montreal Protocol) must agree to 
transfer to the person for the current control period some amount 
of production that the nation is permitted under the Montreal 
Protocol. For trades from a Party, the person must obtain from 
the principal diplomatic representative in that nation's embassy 
in the United States a signed document stating that the 
appropriate authority within that nation has established or 
revised production limits for the nation to equal the lesser of 
the maximum production that the nation is allowed under the 
Protocol minus the amount transferred, the maximum production 
that is allowed under the nation's applicable domestic law minus 
the amount transferred, or the average of the nation's actual 
national production level for the three years prior to the 
transfer minus the production allowances transferred. The person 
must submit to the Administrator a transfer request that includes 
a true copy of this document and that sets forth the following: 
(1) The identity and address of the person; 
(2) The identity of the Party; 
(3) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for 
the person and for the Party; 
(4) The chemical type and level of production being 
transferred; and 
(5) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies. 
(d) On the first day of each control period the Agency will 
grant consumption allowances to any person that produced and 
exported a Group IV controlled substance in the baseline year and 
that was not granted baseline consumption allowances under  82.5 
of this subpart. 
(1) The number of consumption allowances any such person 
will be granted for each control period will be equal to the 
number of production allowances granted to that person under  82.7 for that control period. 
(2) Any person granted allowances under this paragraph must 
hold the same number of unexpended consumption allowances for the 
control period for which the allowances were granted by February 
15 of the following control period. Every kilogram by which the 
person's unexpended consumption allowances fall short of the 
amount the person was granted under this paragraph constitutes a 
separate violation.

 82.12 

Transfers. 


(a) Inter-company transfers. 
(1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, except for Group VI, and until January 1, 2001, for 
Group VI, any person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other 
person (``transferee'') any amount of the transferor's consumption 
allowances or production allowances or Article 5 allowances, as 
follows: 
(i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer 
claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the 
transferee; 
(B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
transferor and the transferee; 
(C) The type of allowances or authorizations being 
transferred, including the names of the controlled substances for 
which allowances are to be transferred; 
(D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances 
or authorizations being transferred pertains; 


(E) The amount of allowances or authorizations being transferred; 
(F) The control period(s) for which the allowances or authorizations are being transferred; 
(G) The amount of unexpended allowances of the type and for the control period being transferred that the transferor
holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and 
(H) The amount of the one percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded that will be deducted from the transferor's
allowance balance (except for trades from transformers and destroyers to producers or importers for the purpose
of allowance reimbursement). 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers
and any production, allowable imports and exports of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate
that the transferor possesses, as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended allowances sufficient
to cover the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transferors of production or consumption
allowances, one percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator
will take action to notify the transferor and transferee as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, the
Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer and will reduce the transferor's
balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or consumption
allowances, one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the transferee may
proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended
allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations
of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer. 
(B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim,
or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make a determination,
the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt of notification,
either 
party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with 
the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate the 
disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day 
after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day. 
(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to 
a transfer claim within the three working days specified in 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the transferor and 
transferee may proceed with the transfer. EPA will reduce the 
transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be 
transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or 
consumption allowances, one percent of that amount. However, if 
EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient 
unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and 
transferee will be held liable for any violations of the 
regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in 
conjunction with, the improper transfer. 
(2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``transferor'') may 
transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the 
transferor's Article 5 allowances. The transfer proceeds as 
follows: 
(i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer 
claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the 
transferee; 
(B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
transferor and the transferee; 
(C) The type of allowances being transferred, including the 
controlled substances for which allowances are to be transferred; 
(D) The group of controlled substances to which the 
allowances being transferred pertains;

(E) The amount of Article 5 allowances being transferred; 
(F) The control period(s) for which the Article 5 allowances are being transferred; and 
(G) The amount of unexpended Article 5 allowances for the control period being transferred that the transferor holds
under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA. 
(H) The amount of the one-percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded that will be deducted from the transferor's
balance. 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers
and any production of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses,
as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended Article 5 allowances sufficient to cover the transfer claim.
Within three working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify the
transferor and transferee as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the transfer
claim the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer and will reduce the
transferor's balance of unexpended Article 5 allowances by the amount to be transferred. When EPA issues a no objection
notice, the transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the
transferor did not have sufficient unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee
will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction
with, the improper transfer. 
(B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the transfer
claim, or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make
a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt
of notification, either party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator
may affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day after notification, the disallowance
shall be final on that day. 
(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a transfer claim within the three working days specified
in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the transferor and transferee may proceed with the transfer. EPA will reduce
the transferor's balance of unexpended Article 5 allowances by the amount to be transferred. However, if EPA ultimately
finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee
will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction
with, the improper transfer. 
(3) Effective January 1, 1996, any person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any
amount of the transferor's destruction credits or transformation credits. The type of credit received by the transferee
in a transfer are the same type of credits transferred by the transferor. The transfer proceeds as follows: 
(i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the transferee; 
(B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the transferor and the transferee; 
(C) The type of credits being transferred, including the names of the controlled substances for which credits are
to be transferred; 
(D) The group of controlled substances to which the credits being transferred pertains; 
(E) The amount of destruction credits or transformation credits being transferred; 
(F) The control period(s) for which the destruction credits or transformation credits are being transferred; 
(G) The amount of unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits for the control period being transferred
that the transferor holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and 
(H) The amount of the one-percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded that will be deducted from the transferor's
balance.

(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers
and any production of controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses,
as of the date the transfer claim is processed, unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits sufficient
to cover the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus one percent of that amount). Within three working
days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify the transferor and transferee
as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits
to cover the transfer claim the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer
and will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended or credits by the amount to be transferred plus one percent
of that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer.
However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended credits to cover the claim,
the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur
as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer. 
(B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended destruction credits or transformation
credits to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply
information needed to make a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within
10 working days after receipt of notification, either party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons,
with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth
working day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day. 
(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a transfer claim within the three working days specified
in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the transferor and transferee may proceed with the transfer. EPA will reduce
the transferor's balance of unexpended destruction credits or transformation credits by the amount to be transferred
plus one percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended
credits to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for any violations of the regulations
of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer. 
(b) Inter-pollutant conversions. 
(1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, except Group VI, and until January 1, 2001 for Group
VI, any person (``convertor'') may convert consumption allowances or production allowances for one class I controlled
substance to the same type of allowance for another class I controlled substance within the group of controlled substances
as the first as follows: 
(i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a conversion claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identity and address of the convertor; 
(B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the convertor; 
(C) The type of allowances being converted, including the names of the controlled substances for which allowances
are to be converted; 
(D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances being converted pertains; 
(E) The amount and type of allowances to be converted;

(I) The amount of unexpended allowances or 
authorizations of the type and for the control period being 
converted that the convertor holds under authority of this 
subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA. 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records 
maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions, 
any transfers, and any production, imports (not including 
transshipments, or used controlled substances), or exports (not 
including transshipments, or used controlled substances) of 
controlled substances reported by the convertor, indicate that 
the convertor possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is 
processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the 
conversion claim (i.e., the amount to be converted plus, in the 
case of conversions of production or consumption allowances, one 
percent of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a 
complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take action to 
notify the convertor as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conversion claim 
the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does 
not object to the conversion and will reduce the convertor's 
balance of unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted 
plus, in the case of conversions of production or consumption 
allowances, one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no 
objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the conversion. 
However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the 
convertor will be held liable for any violations of the 
regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in 
conjunction with, the improper conversion. 

(B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has 
insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the conversion claim, 
or that the convertor has failed to respond to one or more Agency 
requests to supply information needed to make a determination, 
the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the conversion. 
Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, the 
convertor may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, 
with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate 
the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day 
after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day. 

(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to 
a conversion claim within the three working days specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the convertor may proceed with 
the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of 
unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted plus, in the 
case of conversions of production or consumption allowances, one 
percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the 
convertor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover 
the claims, the convertor will be held liable for any violations 
of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or 
in conjunction with, the improper conversion. 
(2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``convertor'') may 
convert Article 5 allowances for one class I controlled substance 
to the same type of allowance for another class I controlled 
substance within the same Group of controlled substances as the 
first, as follows: 
(i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a 
conversion claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identity and address of the convertor; 
(B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the 
convertor; 
(C) The type of Article 5 allowances being converted, 
including the names of the controlled substances for which 
allowances are to be converted; 
(D) The group of controlled substances to which the Article 5 
allowances being converted pertains; 
(E) The amount and type of allowances to be converted; 
(F) The amount of allowances to be subtracted from the 
convertor's unexpended allowances for the first controlled 
substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of allowances 
converted. 
(G) The amount of Article 5 allowances to be added to the 
convertor's unexpended allowances for the second controlled 
substance, to be equal to the amount of allowances for the first 
controlled substance being converted multiplied by the quotient 
of the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled substance 
divided by the ozone depletion factor of the second controlled 
substance, as listed in Appendix A to this subpart. 
(H) The control period(s) for which the Article 5 allowances 
are being converted; and 
(I) The amount of unexpended Article 5 allowances for the 
control period being converted that the convertor holds under 
authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted 
to EPA. 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records 
maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions, 
any transfers, and any production, or exports of controlled 
substances reported by the convertor, indicate that the convertor 
possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is processed, 
unexpended Article 5 allowances sufficient to cover the 
conversion claim. Within three working days of receiving a 
complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take action to 
notify the convertor as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has sufficient 
unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the conversion claim the 
Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not 
object to the conversion and will reduce the convertor's balance 
of unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted. When EPA 
issues a no objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the 
conversion. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor 
did not have sufficient unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover 
the claim, the convertor will be held liable for any violations 
of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or 
in conjunction with, the improper conversion.

(B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has insufficient 
unexpended Article 5 allowances to cover the conversion claim, or 
that the convertor has failed to respond to one or more Agency 
requests to supply information needed to make a determination, 
the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the conversion. 
Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, the 
convertor may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, 
with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate 
the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day 
after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day. 
(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to 
a conversion claim within the three working days specified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the convertor may proceed 
with the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of 
unexpended allowances by the amount to be converted. However, if 
EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have sufficient 
unexpended allowances to cover the claims, the convertor will be 
held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart 
that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper 
conversion. 
(3) Effective January 1, 1996, any person (``convertor'') may 
convert destruction and/or transformation credits for one class I 
controlled substance to the same type of credits for another 
class I controlled substance within the same group of controlled 
substances as the first as follows: 
(i) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a 
conversion claim setting forth the following: 
(A) The identity and address of the convertor; 
(B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the 
convertor;

(F) The amount of credits to be subtracted from the 
convertor's unexpended credits for the first controlled 
substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of credits 
converted; 
(G) The amount of destruction and/or transformation credits 
to be added to the convertor's unexpended credits for the second 
controlled substance, to be equal to the amount of credits for 
the first controlled substance being converted multiplied by the 
quotient of the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled 
substance divided by the ozone depletion factor of the second 
controlled substance, as listed in Appendix A to this subpart. 
(H) The control period(s) for which the destruction and/or 
transformation credits are being converted; and 
(I) The amount of unexpended destruction and/or 
transformation credits for the control period being converted 
that the convertor holds under authority of this subpart as of 
the date the claim is submitted to EPA. 
(ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records 
maintained by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions, 
any transfers, and any production, imports (not including 
transhipments, or used controlled substances), or exports (not 
including transhipments, exports for destruction or 
transformation, or used controlled substances) of controlled 
substances reported by the convertor, indicate that the convertor 
possesses, as of the date the conversion claim is processed, 
unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits sufficient 
to cover the conversion claim (i.e., the amount to be converted 
plus one percent of that amount). Within three working days of 
receiving a complete conversion claim, the Administrator will 
take action to notify the convertor as follows: 
(A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has sufficient 
unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits to cover the 
conversion claim the Administrator will issue a notice indicating 
that EPA does not object to the conversion and will reduce the 
convertor's balance of unexpended credits by the amount to be 
converted plus one percent of that amount. When EPA issues a no 
objection notice, the convertor may proceed with the conversion. 
However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have 
sufficient unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits 
to cover the claim, the convertor will be held liable for any 
violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a 
result of, or in conjunction with, the improper conversion. 
(B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has insufficient 
unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits to cover the 
conversion claim, or that the convertor has failed to respond to 
one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make 
a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice 
disallowing the conversion. Within 10 working days after receipt 
of notification, the convertor may file a notice of appeal, with 
supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may 
affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the 
tenth working day after notification, the disallowance shall be 
final on that day. 
(iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to 
a conversion claim within the three working days specified in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the convertor may proceed with 
the conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of 
unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits by the 
amount to be converted plus one percent of that amount. However, 
if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not have 
sufficient unexpended destruction and/or transformation credits 
to cover the claims, the convertor will be held liable for any 
violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a 
result of, or in conjunction with, the improper conversion.
