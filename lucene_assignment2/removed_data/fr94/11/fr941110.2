Wheat Crop Insurance



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of extension of sales closing date (acceptance of applications).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Effective for the 1995 crop year only, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) gives notice of its determination
to extend the date for acceptance of wheat crop insurance applications for those counties where producers are offered
the winter coverage endorsement. The sales closing date of September 30 previously extended to October 31 shall be
further extended to November 4, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under its regulations for insuring crops, FCIC requires that applications for crop insurance protection must be
filed on or before the policy sales closing date. On Tuesday, October 4, 1994, FCIC published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 50559), effective for the 1995 winter wheat crop year only, a sales closing date extension to October 31. FCIC
has determined that an additional extension of the sales closing date may be needed for wheat counties in which the
winter coverage endorsement is available. By extending the sales closing date, farmers will have more time to make
crop insurance decisions for the 1995 wheat crop year. The Manager has determined that extension of the sales closing
date for the 1995 wheat crop year only in counties in which the winter coverage endorsement is available will not adversely
affect the actuarial status of the crop insurance program. Therefore, the Manager of FCIC has determined that the
October 31 sales closing date shall be further extended to November 14 for wheat counties in which the winter coverage
endorsement is available. No other crop insurance program dates are affected or extended at this time.



Under the provisions of the General Crop Insurance Regulations ( 457.8), the sales closing date for accepting
applications may be extended by notice in the 

Federal Register

 upon determination that no adverse effect will result from such extension. FCIC has determined that no adverse effect
will result from this extension.

FCIC will discontinue the acceptance of applications if it determines that adverse conditions develop and that insurance
risk becomes excessive.



Notice




Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 

et seq.

), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) herewith gives notice that, effective for the 1995 crop year only,
applications for wheat crop insurance in counties in which the winter coverage endorsement is available with published
sales closing dates of September 30, 1994, will be accepted up to the 

close of business on November 4, 1994. 

This sales closing date may be terminated by the Corporation prior to November 4, 1994, if FCIC determines that adverse
conditions develop and that insurance risk becomes excessive.






Authority: 

7 U.S.C. 1501, as amended.




Done in Washington, DC on November 3, 1994.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

Bureau of Land Management


Phosphate Leasing, Caribou National Forest, Caribou County, ID



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA and Bureau of Land Management, USDI.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (FS), Caribou National Forest, and the Department of the Interior,
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Idaho Falls District, will jointly prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
for a proposal to issue two new phosphate leases within the Caribou National Forest. The Dairy Syncline Tract lies
about 13 air miles east of Soda Springs, Idaho, and the Manning Creek Tract lies about 14 air miles southwest of Afton,
Wyoming. If a lease(s) is issued pursuant to the mineral leasing regulations at 43 CFR part 3500, the lessee has a right
to develop a mine and necessary ancillary facilities for the purposes of mining the phosphate ore reserves within
the lease boundaries. However, before actual mining could occur, the lessee would be required to obtain an approved
mining and reclamation plan, which would require a NEPA document addressing the site specific proposed mine development.




SCOPING PROCEDURE: 

The scoping procedure to be used for this EIS has or will involve the following: a wide-scale mailing asking for comments,
issues and concerns to interested and potentially affected individuals, groups, Federal, State, and local governments;
public information gathering meetings; news releases; and a scoping meeting. The scoping meeting will be held in
Chubbuck, Idaho on Monday, November 21, 1994, at 7:00 p.m. in the Aspen-Willow Room, Days Inn, 133 West Burnside Avenue.
Public information meetings were announced in a newsletter by the EIS contractor and held in Pocatello and Soda Springs,
Idaho and Afton, Wyoming on October 18-20, 1994, respectively.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has received proposals to lease two parcels of land for the development and mining
of phosphate reserves within the Caribou National Forest (FS). The 1920 Leasing Act, as amended, gives the primary
responsibility for leasing of solid minerals, like phosphate, to the BLM, even though the surface of the lands may
be administered by other agencies such as the FS. The FS develops recommendations to the BLM concerning whether or
not leases should be issued, and if so, what stipulations or mitigation measures should be included with each lease
to protect the surface resources. Although the BLM decision to be made based on this EIS (the FS only makes recommendations)
is whether or not to lease the two proposed Tracts, and if so, under what conditions, lease issuance confers a right
to mine. Therefore, the anticipated impacts from mining and transportation of the ore must also be analyzed in this
EIS.



These Tracts have only received sufficient exploration to determine the presence of mineable phosphate ore and rough
estimates of ore reserves. Because of this limited information, and because there is no lessee that has developed
a site-specific mining and reclamation plan, only conceptual mine plans have been developed for analysis in this
EIS. The ore from both Tracts would be removed by surface mining methods.

The proposed Dairy Syncline Tract contains 3,380 acres, with preliminary phosphate ore reserves estimated at about
20 million tons. Phosphate rock mined from the Tract would probably be transported to primary users (phosphate fertilizer
or elemental phosphorus plants) by one of the following methods: hauling ore by truck or conveyor to existing railroad
loading facilities located about 4.5 road miles from the Tract; by building a new railroad spur to the Tract (about
5-7 road miles depending on where loading facilities were located); or by the development of a slurry pipeline
(it could parallel an existing slurry pipeline for all but about 4 miles of its length). About 14 miles of existing road
into the area may need to be upgraded to accommodate mine related traffic (not ore haul), and new power/phone lines
to the lease Tract area would need to be constructed. Mine life for this lease Tract is estimated at 10-20 years,
depending on annual mine production.

The proposed Manning Creek Tract covers 2,000 acres, with preliminary estimated phosphate ore reserves in the range
of 18-50 million tons. Mineable reserves may be about 30 million tons. The lease Tract could be developed as an
extension of an existing, operating mine, or ore could be transported from the lease Tract in a slurry pipeline. Based
on the phosphate ore reserves in the proposed leases, the following options do not appear to be economically feasible
at this time: build a phosphate processing plant near the lease Tract; build a railroad facility to the lease Tract
area; or transport the ore to existing railroad facilities or phosphate plants by means other than a slurry pipeline.
If this proposed lease Tract were to be developed separate from the existing mine, as many as 8 miles of new pipeline
may be necessary to reach an existing slurry line corridor, about 5 miles of new mine access road would be required,
as many as 7 miles of existing road upgraded to accommodate mine traffic (not ore haul), and new power/phone lines built.
Mine life is estimated to be 10-25 years.

This EIS will tier to the final EIS for the caribou National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan).
The Caribou Forest Plan provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area direction)
to achieve the Desired Future Condition for the area being analyzed, and contains specific management area prescriptions
for the entire Forest.

Preparation of the EIS will include the following steps:

1. Define the purpose of and need for action.
2. Identify potential issues.
3. Eliminate issues of minor importance or those that have been covered by previous and relevant environmental analysis.
4. Select issues to be analyzed in depth.
5. Identify reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.
6. Describe the affected environment.
7. Identify the potential environmental effects of the alternatives.
Steps 2, 3, and 4 have started and will be completed through the scoping process.
Step 5 will consider a range of alternatives developed from the key issues. Four alternatives have been drafted to
date:

Alternative 1, no lease or the no action alternative.
Alternative 2, issue both leases as delineated (proposed action).
Alternative 3, issue the Manning Creek lease only.
Alternative 4, issue the Dairy Syncline lease only.

Other alternatives could be developed based on key issues.

Step 6 will describe the physical attributes of the area to be affected by this proposal, with special attention to
the environmental factors that could be adversely affected.

Step 7 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. This analysis will be consistent with management
direction outlined in the Forest Plan. The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed
and documented. In addition, the site specific mitigation measures for each alternative will be identified and the
effectiveness of these mitigation measures will be disclosed.

The Forest Service and BLM are seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action as part of the scoping process. The
scoping process is designed to guide project analysis and documentation and obtain input to identify significant
issues and alternatives to the proposal. The EIS will consider a range of alternatives based on the issues, concerns
and opportunities identified for the project. Comments should be submitted to the Forest Service within 30 days from
the date of publication of this Notice in the 

Federal Register

.

The estimated date for completion of the draft EIS is June, 1995. A public meeting(s) will be held in conjunction with
the issuance of the draft EIS. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service and BLM believe it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage in the process of court
rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. Reviewers of draft EISs must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts the agencies to
the reviewers' position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not
raised until after completion of the final EIS. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel,

 (9th Circuit, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). We mention these court cases to ensure that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the BLM and FS at a time when they can meaningfully consider them and respond in the Final EIS.

To assist the Forest Service and BLM in identifying and considering issues and concerns related to the proposed action,
comments for scoping, and later for the draft EIS, should be as specific as possible. It would be helpful if comments
on the draft EIS refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed
in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these points.

The final EIS is expected to be available in December, 1995.

The BLM Idaho State Director, who is the responsible official for the EIS, will then make a decision regarding this
proposal, considering: FS recommendations; comments; responses; anticipated environmental consequences discussed
in the Final EIS; and applicable laws regulations, and policies. The reasons for the decision will be documented in
the Record of Decision.

Notice of Availability of the Record of Decision for the ``Exxon Valdez'' Oil Spill Restoration Plan



AGENCIES: 

Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
Department of Commerce is a cooperating agency.




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the record of decision for the 

Exxon Valdez 

restoration plan.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On behalf of the 

Exxon Valdez 

Trustee Council, the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service and the Department of the Interior announce the availability
of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the 

Exxon Valdez 

Oil Spill Restoration Plan. The responsible officials for the ROD are the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture
and of the Interior, and the Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department
of Commerce. The Restoration Plan will establish management direction and guide all natural resource restoration
activities covered by the civil settlement following the 

Exxon Valdez 

oil spill.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Introduction



On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal governments and Exxon under
which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal
Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore
the natural resources and the services they provide, injured by the 

Exxon Valdez 

oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resources injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided
by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services.
Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources,
and acquisition of equivalent resources and services.

Under the applicable court decrees, all decisions about restoration and use of the civil settlement funds are made
by six natural resources Trustees, three Federal and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the
Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior. The three State Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game,
and Environmental Conservation, and the Alaska Attorney General. A Trustee Council, located in Alaska, composed
of the three State Trustees and designees of the three Federal Trustees, has been assigned responsibility for decisions
relating to the assessment of injuries, use of the civil settlement funds, and all restoration activities including
the preparation of a Restoration Plan.

On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473-12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, the Forest Service
published a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Restoration Plan. This was
later revised on January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2352-2353).

The Trustee Council released a Draft Restoration Plan in November 1993, which was the proposed action for the analysis
conducted in the EIS. The Draft EIS was released for public comment on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31191) followed by a 45-day
comment period ending on August 1, 1994. This was followed by the release of the Final EIS on September 30, 1994 (59 FR
49925).



B. The Decision



The proposed action (Draft Restoration Plan) consisted of policy statements, a discussion of categories of restoration
actions and broad objectives for injured resources and services. The policies for identifying and conducting restoration
actions have been revised and reorganized into policy groups in response to public comments received on the Draft
EIS. People commented that some of the policies needed clarification. This was done in the Final EIS.

Based on the analysis contained in the EIS and the recommendation of the Trustee Council, it is the decision of the Federal
Trustees to adopt Alternative 5 and its policies as identified in the Final EIS. This includes the establishment of
a restoration reserve.

Copies of the ROD may be requested from the Oil Spill Public Information Office, 645 G. Street, Anchorage, Alaska 99501.
Phone number 907 278-8008 or within Alaska 800 478-7745, outside Alaska 800 283-7745.

Foreign-Trade Zone 78_Nashville, TN; Application for Subzone Status; Columbia Specialties, Inc., Plant (Room
Air Conditioners/Dehumidifiers) Columbia, TN 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones 
Board (the Board) by the Metropolitan Nashville Port Authority, 
grantee of FTZ 78, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the 
room air conditioner and dehumidifier manufacturing plant of Columbia 
Specialties, Inc., (CSI) (subsidiary of Fedders North America, Inc.), 
located in Columbia, Tennessee. The application was submitted 
pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended 
(19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 
400). It was formally filed on October 28, 1994. 
The CSI plant (62 acres/200,000 sq. ft.) is located at 1027 
Industrial Park Road, Columbia (Maury County), Tennessee, some 30 
miles south of Nashville. The facility (375 employees) is used to 
produce room air conditioners and dehumidifiers (duty rate_2.2%). 
Materials and components purchased from abroad (some 15% of total 
value) include polymers of styrene, articles of plastic and rubber, 
fasteners, articles of copper (bars, rods, profiles, tubes, pipes, 
fittings), aluminum foil, taps, cocks, valves, electric motors and 
switches, electric heating apparatus, rotary and other compressors and 
parts, capacitors, optical fiber cables, and automatic regulating and 
controlling apparatus (duty rate range: free_14%, $0.9/kg+9.2%). Some 
5 percent of the finished units is exported. 
Zone procedures would exempt CSI from Customs duty payments on 
the foreign components used in export production. On its domestic 
sales, CSI would be able to choose the duty rate that applies to 
finished room air conditioners and dehumidifiers (2.2%) for the 
foreign components noted above. The application indicates that the 
savings from zone procedures would help improve the plant's 
international competitiveness. 
In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ 
Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and 
report to the Board. 
Public comment on the application is invited from interested 
parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed 
to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing 
period for their receipt is January 9, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing
period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to January 24, 1995). 
A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be 
available for public inspection at each of the following locations:

<DOCTITLE>Foreign-Trade Zone 21_Dorchester County, South Carolina; Application for Expansion; Amendment of Application</DOCTITLE>



The pending application of the South Carolina State Ports Authority (SCSPA), grantee of FTZ 21, requesting authority
to expand its zone (Docket 50-93, filed 9/14/93, 58 FR 50330, 9/27/93, amended 8/9/94, 59 FR 40519), has been
further amended to request an additional site.

The application as previously amended requested authority to expand the zone's two existing sites and to include
within the zone project SCSPA's terminal complex at the Port of Charleston (8 parcels_2,040 acres) and two new industrial
park sites.

The further amendment requests inclusion of an additional site (19 acres) located at 4 Meadow Street, Loris, Horry
County, South Carolina, some 55 miles from the Georgetown, South Carolina Customs Port of Entry. The new site, owned
and operated by Southern Ammunition Company, Inc. (SACI), would be used for general-purpose zone warehousing activity.
The application indicates that several firms are interested in using this site for storage activity. SACI plans to
use zone procedures in conjunction with its warehousing of small arms parts, accessories and ammunition.

The comment period is reopened until [45 days from date of publication].

The application and amendment materials are available for public inspection at the following locations:

or suspension of investigation, an interested party, as defined in section 771(9) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
may request, in accordance with section 353.22 or 355.22 of the Department of Commerce (the Department) Regulations
(19 CFR 353.22/355.22 (1993)), that the Department conduct an administrative review of that antidumping or countervailing
duty order, finding, or suspended investigation.



Opportunity To Request a Review



Not later than November 30, 1994, interested parties may request administrative review of the following orders,
findings, or suspended investigations, with anniversary dates in November for the following periods:

In accordance with sections 353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the regulations, an interested party as defined by 353.2(k)
may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested
party must specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting
a review, and the requesting party must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or
resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman,
in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with section 353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the regulations,
a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.

The Department will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping (Countervailing) Duty Administrative Review,'' for requests received
by November 30, 1994. If the Department does not receive, by November 30, 1994, a request for review of entries covered
by an order or finding listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs
Service to assess antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond
for) estimated antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal
from warehouse, for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 69336) the preliminary results of administrative reviews of the antidumping finding on tapered roller bearings
(TRBs), four inches or less in outside diameter, and components thereof, from Japan (41 FR 34374, August 18, 1976).
We have now completed these reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff
Act). 



Scope of the Reviews 


Imports covered by these reviews are TRBs, four inches or less in outside diameter when assembled, including inner
race or cone assemblies and outer races or cups, sold either as a unit or separately. During the review periods such
merchandise was classifiable under item numbers 680.3932, 680.3934, and 680.3938 of the Tariff Schedules of the
United States Annotated (TSUSA). This merchandise is currently classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) item numbers 8708.70.6060, 8708.99, and 8482.99.4510. These TSUSA and HTS item numbers are provided for convenience
and Customs purposes only. The written description remains dispositive. 

These reviews cover TRB sales by Koyo Seiko Company, Ltd. (Koyo), for the periods 1979 through 1986, NSK Ltd. (formerly
Nippon Seiko, K.K.) (NSK), for the periods 1980 through 1986, Mitsubishi Corp. (Mitsubishi), for the periods 1980
through 1985, Sumitomo Yale Co., Ltd. (Sumitomo Yale), for the periods 1980 through 1985, and Sumitomo Corporation
(Sumitomo Corp.), Nachi-Fujikoshi, Niigata Converter, Toyosha, Toyota, Yamaha, Suzuki, and Maekawa Bearing Manufacturer
(Maekawa), for the periods 1985 through 1986. Nachi-Fujikoshi and Niigata Converter claimed no shipments during
the 1985-86 period of review (POR). Consequently, for both firms we have used each firm's rate from the last prior
period in which they had shipments. Finally, as stated in the preliminary results, for these final results we are terminating
the reviews of Nissan, Mazda (formerly Toyo Kogyo Co. Ltd.), and MC International. 



Analysis of Comments Received 


We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received written comments from
petitioner, the Timken Company (Timken), and respondents NSK, Koyo, Mazda, and Sumitomo Corp. Rebuttal briefs were
submitted by Timken, NSK, and Koyo. At the request of Timken, NSK, Koyo, and Mazda, we held a hearing on February 18,
1994. 

Comments are addressed in the following order: 

1. General Issues 

2. Terminations 

3. Annual Average Foreign Market Value (FMV), Model Match, and Cost Test Methodology 

4. Calculation of FMV 

5. Calculation of U.S. Price (USP) 

6. Cost of Production (COP) and Constructed Value (CV) 

7. Use of Best Information Available (BIA) 

8. Clerical Errors

Comments Regarding General Issues





Comment 1: 

Timken proposes that assessment of duties should be based on the actual value of the entries suspended by the U.S. Customs
Service, as Timken states was done in 

Antifriction Bearings from France, et al.,

 58 FR 39729 (July 26, 1993) (

AFBs III

), and was upheld for the first antifriction bearing (AFB) administrative review by the Court of International Trade
(CIT) in 

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States,

 796 F. Supp. 1526, 1529, 

modified,

 806 F.Supp. 1008 (1992) (

Koyo Seiko

). Timken acknowledges that, although the Department's approach in the AFB cases was necessary due to the Department's
sampling methodology, compelling reasons exist in these reviews to adopt the same approach.

Further, Timken cites 

Timken Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 94-1 at 11-12 (January 3, 1994) (

Timken III

), wherein the CIT did not order a remand for further investigation, but required the Department to order liquidation
of the merchandise in accordance with the 

AFBs III

 methodology (

i.e.,

 collect the full amount of antidumping duties calculated to be due in this case by assessing these duties over all suspended
entries of the merchandise). Timken submits that this is the only reasonable method of assessing antidumping duties
in this long-delayed proceeding.

Timken argues that assessing antidumping duties in these reviews may be problematic because ``it is likely'' that
entries subject to the dumping finding have been incorrectly liquidated. Similarly, Timken notes that the administrative
record contains evidence that an importer incorrectly entered certain merchandise as outside the scope of the antidumping
orders on TRBs, referring to 

U.S. Customs Service, HQ 222367

 (December 28, 1990) (

Customs HQ

), originally submitted as Exhibit B of Koyo's October 30, 1991 submission.

Timken acknowledges that identification of the merchandise is complicated by the fact that the subject merchandise
was often entered as part of a multi-product shipment and points out that, unless the Department adopts an alternative
assessment methodology, the correct amount of duty may not be assessed at liquidation. Timken suggests that before
the Department issues final assessment instructions, it should require Customs to report the value of suspended
entries during the review periods for each manufacturer subject to review. With this information, Timken argues,
the Department could then formulate assessment instructions that would ensure collection of the actual amount of
duty determined to be payable by each company.

Koyo believes the Department should reject Timken's claim for the following reasons:

 Timken has provided no evidence to support its claim that entries subject to the dumping finding have been liquidated
in error.

 Timken's cite to the CIT decision in 

Koyo Seiko

 as support for assessment on the basis of entered value is misleading because the use of sampling rendered assessment
on entered value necessary in the AFB cases.

 Section 751(a)(2) of the Tariff Act requires that the excess of FMV over USP ``shall be the basis for the assessment
of antidumping duties on entries of the merchandise included within the determination and for deposits of estimated
duties.''

 Timken's cite to 

Timken III

 is not valid because in that case Timken challenged the Department's failure to address adequately Timken's arguments
regarding discrepancies between the value of U.S. sales reported by respondents and the value of suspended entries
reported by the Customs Service. The CIT concluded that the Department had fulfilled its statutory obligation and
that Timken should have brought an action 

in mandamus

 to compel Customs to perform its duty. Moreover, Koyo argues that the CIT's reference to assessment based on entered
value was 

obiter dicta,

 as the Department had not instructed the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties based on entered value in the
review at issue in that appeal.

 Furthermore, Koyo states that the Department cannot legally order the assessment of duties on entries which
have already been liquidated. Koyo states that liquidation of entries is final unless the liquidation is properly
protested in a timely manner, citing 19 U.S.C.  1514(a) and 

United States

 v. 

Utex Intern, Inc.,

 857 F.2d 1408, 1410-11 (Fed. Cir. 1988).

NSK argues that assessment of antidumping duties must be imposed on an entry-by-entry basis only on unliquidated
entries. NSK asserts that the Department has no statutory authority to assess total antidumping duties (covering
liquidated and unliquidated entries) over unliquidated entries.



Department's Position:

 As outlined in the Department's 

Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making

 (56 FR 63696 (December 5, 1991)), with respect to exporter's sale price (ESP) assessment, the Department has experienced
significant difficulties in issuing liquidation instructions to Customs in cases involving large volumes of ESP
entries. Several factors contribute to this difficulty: (1) the lag between entry date and sale date in ESP transactions,
(2) the fungibility of the product, (3) the volume of transactions reviewed, and (4) the parties' own inability to
link entries to sales or to provide the Department with the documentation to do so. Given these difficulties, as noted
in the 

Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making,

 the Department has explored various alternative methods of issuing ESP assessment instructions. Such alternatives,
and variations, include:

(1) When entry data are available, the Department can derive a per-unit margin by dividing the calculated dumping
duties due (based on sales) by the number of units entered and then instruct Customs to apply the per-unit margin against
all units entered during the review period. Similarly, the Department can derive a percentage margin by dividing
the calculated dumping duties due (based on sales) by the entered value of the merchandise entered during the POR and
then instruct Customs to apply this percentage margin against the entered Customs value of merchandise entered during
the POR. This proposed methodology simplifies and streamlines assessment and liquidation dramatically, yet still
enables Customs to collect the exact amount of dumping duties due on ESP sales that occurred during the review periods
(although the lag between entry and sale dates in an ESP situation will still make assessment problematic).

(2) When entry data are not available, we can derive a percentage margin by dividing the calculated dumping duties
due (based on sales) by the net USP (which is our best calculation of the entered value of the merchandise entered during
the POR), and then instruct Customs to apply that percentage margin against the Customs value of suspended entries
of merchandise entered during the POR.

(3) The Department can derive a per-unit dumping margin by dividing the calculated dumping duties on ESP sales that
occurred during the POR by the number of units sold and then apply the per-unit margin against all units entered during
the POR.

We have evaluated these options in the context of these reviews covering entries from 1979 through 1986. We have determined
that absolute assessment (option 1), as advocated by Timken, is not feasible for these reviews. Collection of the
entered value of suspended entries of covered merchandise requires an amount of precision on a country-wide scale
that, though possible for current ongoing reviews given today's level of electronic database maintenance, is clearly
not feasible for the time periods in question in these reviews. Also, other than a limited number of Yamaha entries
and the single instance cited by Timken (

Customs HQ

), we have no evidence that any entries of covered TRBs were incorrectly liquidated. Timken's concern about possible
incorrectly liquidated entries is also unfounded conjecture and not based on substantial evidence. We disagree
with Timken that these concerns constitute compelling reasons to use the 

AFBs III

 methodology. As for Timken's concern that TRBs entered as a part of a multi-product shipment may escape coverage of
the finding, there is no evidence on the record to support this conclusion. Further, this option is not feasible because
we did not ask the respondents for the entered value data necessary to implement this approach, and do not believe it
appropriate to do so now, given the age of the reviews.

Since option 1 is not feasible, we have considered options 2 and 3. In order to be consistent with the Department's practice
outlined in the second administrative review of the AFB orders (

Antifriction Bearings from the Federal Republic of Germany

 (57 FR 28395, June 24, 1992) (

AFBs II

), we will calculate POR-specific appraisement rates using option 2, and we will instruct Customs to assess dumping
duties on the entered value of suspended entries of covered TRBs during each POR.



Comment 2:

 Timken notes that cash deposits were not required for Koyo and NSK until the completion of the first administrative
review in June 1990. Timken maintains that the Department, in each of the administrative results of review issued
to date in this case, has refused to assess interest on antidumping duties secured by bonds rather than cash deposits.
Timken acknowledges that the CIT has upheld the Department's determination not to assess interest and notes that
Timken has appealed those decisions to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) (

Timken Company

 v. 

United States,

 15 CIT 526, 777 F.Supp. 20 (1991), 

aff'd after remand,

 819 F.Supp. 1093 (CIT March 4, 1993), 

appeal docketed,

 Fed. Cir. No. 93-1312 (April 16, 1993)).

Timken asserts that section 778(a) of the Tariff Act contemplates collection of interest on all ``underpayments
of amounts deposited on merchandise entered'' and that the Department's rationale for distinguishing entries secured
by bonds, as opposed to cash deposits, distorts the statutory purpose and benefits those respondents that failed
to make cash deposits of estimated duties. Timken requests that the Department address this issue once again in these
final results.

NSK argues that the Tariff Act, the Department's practice, and judicial precedent hold that no interest is assessable
on entries covered by bonds rather than cash deposits.

Koyo counters that Timken raises no new arguments in this review in support of its position and that unless and until
the Department's longstanding interpretation of the Tariff Act is rejected by the Federal Circuit, the Department
should continue to instruct Customs not to assess interest on antidumping duties secured by bond when liquidating
the entries subject to these reviews.

Department's Position: 

We disagree with Timken. Section 778(a) of the Tariff Act provides that interest shall be payable only on overpayments
and underpayments of ``amounts deposited.'' The CIT held in 

Timken Co.

 v. 

United States

, 777 F.Supp. 20 (1991), that the words ``amounts deposited'' refer only to cash deposits of estimated antidumping
duties upon entry, and not to other kinds of security, such as a bond. In considering Timken's appeal, the Federal Circuit
held that ``the requirement to make cash deposits of estimated duties, under the duty order, triggers the interest
provision. Without the duty order, the importer has no obligation to pay interest. The Court of International Trade
did not err in upholding ITA's determination that NSK and Koyo Seiko are not liable for interest * * *''
(

Timken Co.

 v. 

United States

, Fed. Cir. No. 93-1312, -1455 (Fed. Cir., September 27, 1994)). 

This proceeding concerns a 1976 finding, in which the statute required bonds, not cash deposits. The Trade Agreements
Act of 1979 (the 1979 Act) did not allow the collection (or payment) of interest where the entry of merchandise was permitted
under bond rather than by the cash deposit of estimated dumping duties. Further, the 1979 Act contained no provision
for the conversion from bonds to cash deposits for existing antidumping findings, except through the administrative
review process. 

Therefore, because we required cash deposits for the first time on entries of merchandise manufactured by Koyo and
NSK on June 1, 1990, interest will only be collected or refunded on under- or overpayments of cash deposits on entries
after that date. 



Comment 3: 

Timken states that in its submission of October 8, 1991, it requested that the Department convert existing bonds,
posted by Koyo and NSK as security for antidumping duties, to cash deposits. Since the Department has never formally
responded to its request, Timken is renewing that request in its case brief for these administrative reviews. 

Timken maintains that the role of Customs in matters pertaining to antidumping duties is purely ``ministerial,''
requiring Customs to implement the instructions of the Department to the extent those instructions are not inconsistent
with Customs regulations, citing 

Diversified Products Corp.

 v. 

United States

, 6 CIT 155, 572 F.Supp. 883 (1983). According to Timken, the Department, therefore, has the authority to require Customs
to collect cash deposits at this time, even if such deposits are nominal in amount. Timken argues that the conversion
of existing bonds to cash deposits would permit the Department to collect interest on under-deposits of antidumping
duties as required by section 778(a) of the Tariff Act. Timken contends that the Department should recognize that
this proceeding is 

sui generis

, at least with respect to Koyo and NSK, since the Department published a decision that cash deposits would be imposed
on entries subject to existing findings as of the date of completion of the first administrative review (45 FR 1084,
January 4, 1980). Timken points out that Koyo and NSK posted bonds for all of their entries during each of the PORs. 

Moreover, Timken notes that the Department's ruling with respect to interest on Koyo and NSK entries was issued in
June 1990 and is still pending before the Federal Circuit. Based on this experience, Timken states that it may take
four years or more before assessment occurs. In order to safeguard the revenue during the inevitable appeals of the
final results of these reviews, Timken urges the Department to require conversion of bonds to cash deposits. 

NSK argues that the Department has consistently followed its policy of not requiring cash deposits on entries covered
by pre-1980 findings until the first administrative review has been completed under section 751 of the Tariff Act.
NSK contends that Timken has cited no authority to suggest that the Department's practice is contrary to law. 

Koyo counters that neither the Department nor the Customs Service possesses any authority to require the posting
of cash deposits retroactively. Koyo remarks, citing 

U.S. Customs Service, HQ 222367 

(December 28, 1990), that the Customs Service has no authority to require posting of cash deposits on entries that
have been entered and accepted. 



Department's Position: 

In 1980, the Department of the Treasury published a notice (45 FR 1084, 1980) stating that the 1979 Act contained no
provision for the immediate conversion of existing antidumping findings from bonds to cash. Section 106(a) of the
1979 Act merely provides that outstanding antidumping findings would remain in effect and would be subject to review
under section 751 of the Tariff Act. Section 751(a)(2) of the Tariff Act provides that the administrative review ``shall
be the basis for * * * deposits of estimated duties.'' Thus, the legal basis for requiring cash deposits
under the 1979 Act is a review under section 751 of the Tariff Act or an order pursuant to section 736 of the Tariff Act.
Because this case is not governed by an order, the Department is without power to require the imposition of a cash deposit
until the completion of an administrative review. 

Under U.S. law, where an affirmative dumping finding has been made, security must be provided upon entry of the merchandise
into the country, and if the form of security is cash deposits, it must be paid no later than 30 days after entry (19 U.S.C.
section 1505). Because the merchandise in question has already entered the country, the form of security cannot be
changed retroactively. Similarly, since interest is only collectible on cash deposits pursuant to sections 737
and 778 of the Tariff Act, interest would accrue only from the time that the Department required a cash deposit and would
not be retroactive to the time of entry under bond. The Department has followed this practice consistently and will
continue to follow it for merchandise already entered into the United States.

Comment 4: 

Timken urges the Department to release detailed computer printouts of the final results of review as the limited information
released in the preliminary results is insufficient to permit the parties to identify all errors in the computer printout.
Since the Department has consistently refused to release ``pre-final'' calculations for review by the parties,
Timken contends that the final output often provides the only indication of clerical errors in the Department's analysis.
Therefore, at a minimum, Timken believes the Department should release a representative sample of major datasets
(

i.e

., 500 observations for each annual period). 

NSK agrees with Timken that the Department should release detailed computer printouts of its final analysis. 
NSK also suggests that the Department consider releasing the printouts in advance of issuance of the final results,
in order 
to expeditiously identify and correct any clerical errors. 

Koyo supports Timken's request for pre-disclosure of the final results in this case due to the very complex nature
of the preliminary margin analysis and the number of clerical errors identified in the preliminary results computer
program. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Koyo and NSK. The issuance of pre-final programs and printouts would only serve to delay the final
results of these reviews. We believe that Koyo has misinterpreted Timken's comments regarding release of the ``pre-final''
calculations. In fact, Timken states that the Department's past consistency in refusing to release pre-final results
makes a detailed release of the final margin program even more important. We agree with Timken in principle, and intend
to provide the parties to this proceeding with a representative sample of the major datasets needed to identify any
clerical errors in the computer programs, if they request disclosure after issuance of the final results to identify
and comment on any clerical errors. 



Comments Regarding Terminations 





Comment 5: 

Mazda states its concern over the Department's refusal to terminate the review of Sumitomo Corp. with respect to Mazda
transactions. Mazda notes that in Timken's agreement to withdraw its request to review Mazda, Timken consented to
the termination of the review with regard to resale transactions to Mazda's subsidiaries through Sumitomo Corp.
Mazda states its interest in this proceeding is to retain its zero margin rate for all U.S. entries of Mazda replacement-part
TRBs, without regard to whether such TRBs are imported directly from Mazda or indirectly from Mazda through resales
by Sumitomo Corp. 

Mazda suggests three alternative proposals: (1) partial termination of the review of those sales through Sumitomo
which both originate and end with Mazda; (2) termination of the review with regard to all sales for export to the United
States by Mazda, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp.; or (3) termination of the review with regard
to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda and instructions to Customs to liquidate all TRBs sold by Mazda
for export to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp. Mazda contends that any of
the three alternatives would leave Sumitomo Corp. in the review while clarifying the Department's intent to have
all of Mazda's export sales of TRBs to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo Corp. as
a reshipper, treated as exports by Mazda. Mazda maintains that such treatment is consistent with both Mazda's and
Timken's request to terminate the review, as well as consistent with current and past treatment by Customs of Mazda's
exports to the United States. 

Sumitomo Corp. maintains that it is not the importer of record, and therefore has no liability for antidumping duties.
Further, by terminating the review of Mazda, the Department will effectively terminate the review of Sumitomo Corp.
with respect to Mazda's exports during the POR. 

Timken reaffirms its agreement to the termination of the 1985/86 review with respect to Mazda and, of the three alternatives
proposed by Mazda, prefers the third, namely, the termination of the review with regard to all sales for export to the
United States by Mazda, with a clarification to Customs of the Department's intent that Mazda's exporter rate should
be applied to all TRBs sold by Mazda for export to the United States, whether directly or indirectly through Sumitomo
Corp.

<TEXT>
 



Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken that alternative three offers the best solution with regard to termination of the review of Mazda
and Mazda transactions through Sumitomo Corp. It satisfies Mazda's request and Timken's affirmation to terminate
the review with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda, while enabling us to appraise exports by
Sumitomo Corp. for sale to parties other than Mazda. Accordingly, in these final results, we are terminating the review
of Mazda with regard to all sales for export to the United States by Mazda. In our instructions to Customs we will clarify
our intent that Mazda's rate should be applied to all TRBs sold by Mazda for export to the United States, whether directly
or indirectly through any entity. For an explanation of our treatment of Sumitomo Corp., please see the following
comment.



Comment 6: 

Mazda argues that the Department erroneously treated Sumitomo Corp. (also known as Sumitomo Shoji Kaisha, Ltd.)
and Sumitomo Yale Co., Ltd. as one company, when in fact they are two separate, independent firms. Mazda also notes
that only Sumitomo Yale was included in the 1980/85 reviews (51 FR 24883) and only Sumitomo Corp. was included in the
1985/86 review (51 FR 32817).

Sumitomo Corp. states that it should not have been included in these reviews and should no longer be considered a party
to this proceeding because Sumitomo Corp. does not manufacture, import, or further process TRBs. Sumitomo Corp.'s
role, for which it receives a fixed commission, in the sale and shipment of TRBs, has only been to arrange for the transport
of the merchandise from Japan to the United States in transactions between related parties.

Because Sumitomo Corp. did not respond to the Department's questionnaire, Timken argues that, for exports by Sumitomo
Corp. for sale to parties other than Mazda, the Department should apply BIA to Sumitomo Corp.'s entries both for appraisement
and to derive the cash deposit rate for future entries.



Department's Position: 

Evidence on the record indicates that Sumitomo Yale and Sumitomo Corp. are, in fact, two separate firms. Evidence
on the record also indicates, however, that we sent Sumitomo Yale questionnaires for the 1980/85 periods to which
the firm declined to respond. Therefore, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Tariff Act and the methodology outlined
in the notice of preliminary results, we have used first-tier BIA to determine the margins for Sumitomo Yale.

Although the Department initiated a review of Sumitomo Corp. only for the 1985/86 POR, we inadvertently sent Sumitomo
Corp. a questionnaire for several periods preceding that POR. In addition, we cannot confirm that we sent a questionnaire
to Sumitomo Corp. for the 1985/86 review. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use BIA, since Sumitomo Corp. did not fail
to respond or otherwise impede the proceeding.

We have considered several additional facts: (1) the age of the proceeding does not allow for efficient retrieval
from Customs of information on suspended entries; and (2) Timken has withdrawn its request for a review of Sumitomo
Corp.'s shipments with respect to Mazda for the 1985/86 POR. Therefore, we have accepted the portion of Sumitomo Corp.'s
case brief with comments regarding its activities for the 1985/86 POR which provides evidence that Sumitomo Corp.
did not sell TRBs to the United States during the 1985/86 POR.

Therefore, for entries suspended as ``Sumitomo Corp.'' entries for the 1985/86 POR, we will notify Customs to liquidate
them at the manufacturer's rate, either based on the final results of this review or as provided for by 19 CFR 353.22(e).
Specifically, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e), Mazda entries suspended as ``Sumitomo Corp.'' entries will be
liquidated at the amount of cash deposit required at the time of entry. We further note that we are currently conducting
a review of Sumitomo Corp. for the 1992/93 POR, and we will determine in that review the role of Sumitomo Corp. in U.S.
TRB transactions based on the information on the record for that review.

For entries by all firms for which we are terminating these reviews, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22, we will instruct
Customs to assess antidumping duties in the amount of the cash deposit required at time of entry. Existing cash deposit
rates will remain in effect for those firms until the next publication of final results of review.

Comments Regarding Annual Average FMV, Model Match, and Cost Test Methodology





Comment 7: 

Both NSK and Timken argue that the Department's calculations incorrectly excluded home-market models which lacked
physical criteria information from the model-match portion of the analysis. NSK and Timken contend that, where possible,
the Department should match such home-market models with U.S. models with identical nomenclature.



Department's Position: 

We agree. In the preliminary results of review we did not intend to exclude from the model-match analysis any home-market
models lacking physical criteria information. We have made the necessary correction to our calculations for these
final results of review to ensure that we consider all home-market models in determining whether they are identical
to models respondents sold in the United States. 



Comment 8: 

Koyo states that for the final results the Department should follow the CIT's direction in 

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A. 

v. 

United States, 

834 F.Supp. 431 (CIT 1993). In that case, the CIT concluded that a 10-percent cap was required to limit the permissible
deviation of the criteria used to match TRB models and agreed with Koyo that the use of a 10-percent cap on the comparison
of each physical criterion is necessary to avoid ``comparisons between products which differ so dramatically that
they simply cannot be considered commercially similar'' (

Koyo Seiko, Co., 

834 F.Supp. 435).

Timken disagrees with Koyo, stating that the ``sum of the deviations'' method of determining comparison merchandise,
in conjunction with the 20-percent difference-in-merchandise (difmer) limit, implements the intent of section
771(16) of the Tariff Act that the comparison merchandise be ``like'' the merchandise sold in the United States, and
of approximately equal commercial value. Section 771(16) of the Tariff Act, Timken argues, does not require that
home-market models be technically substitutable. Therefore, in Timken's opinion, because this issue is currently
under judicial review, the Department should decline to modify its methodology, pending a ``final'' judicial decision
on the issue.



Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken. As we stated in 

Tapered Roller Bearings, Four Inches or Less in Outside Diameter, and Certain Components Thereof, from Japan 

(58 FR 64721, December 9, 1993) (

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs

), we are satisfied that use of the original sum of the deviations methodology, without the 10-percent cap but including
the 20-percent difmer cap, accurately determines the most similar model sold in the home market. We have, therefore,
used the original sum of the deviations methodology for model-match comparisons in these final results of review.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-2-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because we use the original sum of the deviations model-match methodology, rather than the single greatest deviation
methodology we used in conjunction with the 10-percent deviation cap in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation
of TRBs over 4 inches, application of a 10-percent deviation cap to each physical criterion would mean that the best
overall match could be eliminated simply because a single physical criterion deviated by more than 10 percent. By
using the sum of the deviations methodology, all five matching criteria have equal weight. By contrast, the application
of a 10-percent cap to each physical criterion represents a distortion of the model-match methodology, in that it
establishes a randomly-selected hierarchy, rather than evaluating each criterion on an equal basis. The 10-percent
cap can result in our inability to match some U.S. sales of TRBs which the Department considers most similar overall,
but which have a greater than 10-percent deviation in only one criterion. This results in reliance on CV to a much greater
degree when the statutory preference is for price comparisons. 

Furthermore, if the Department were to apply both the 10-percent cap and the 20-percent difmer cap, the methodology
would become too restrictive, since in some cases the only matches passing the 20-percent difmer test may vary by more
than 10 percent in one or more physical criteria. Using both tests might eliminate matches of otherwise comparable
merchandise. Thus, this methodology would result not in more precise matches but in fewer matches to such or similar
merchandise, and an overreliance on CV. 

Finally, although the CIT held in 

NTN Bearing Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 94-25 (February 11, 1994), that the Department must apply the 10-percent cap to the sum of the deviations
methodology, the Department respectfully disagrees with this decision. Because application of the 10-percent
cap in that case does not alter the margins, the Department cannot appeal that case (see 

Zenith Electronic Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

895 F.2d 291 (Fed. Cir. 1989)). However, we have appealed the next case involving this issue (

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-185). Therefore, for all of these reasons, and for the reasons explained in the notices of prior TRB
final results of review, we have not changed our methodology for these reviews. 



Comment 9: 

Koyo objects to the Department's use of set-splitting to create artificial home-market sales of cups and cones for
comparison to sales of cups and cones sold separately in the United States. Koyo states that there are sufficient actual
sales of cups and cones in the home market to allow the Department to avoid comparison with CV. In addition, the use of
annual average FMVs in these reviews permits the Department to match a U.S. sale of a cup or cone to a home-market sale
of a such or similar cup or cone made at any time in the home market, rather than within the six-month window the Department
uses with monthly weighted-average FMVs. Koyo asserts that this fabrication of artificial sales by set-splitting
violates the statute, skews the margins, and creates unnecessary work and expense. 

Koyo cites section 773(a)(1) of the Tariff Act as providing that ``[i]n the ascertainment of foreign market value,
for the purpose of this title, no pretended sale or offer for sale, and no sale or offer for sale intended to establish
a fictitious market, shall be taken into account.'' Koyo contends that there may have been a ``sale'', but not of the
type of product to which it was matched in the U.S. market. 

Acknowledging that the CIT upheld the Department's splitting of sets in 

NTN Bearing Corp. of America 

v. 

United States, 

747 F.Supp. 726 (CIT 1990)(

NTN

), Koyo contends that the facts of that LTFV investigation are different from the facts of these reviews. Koyo explains
that in the LTFV investigation, to avoid over-reliance on CV, the Department split home-market sales of TRBs into
``sales'' of cups and cones. Koyo contends, however, that in these reviews there were sufficient actual home-market
sales of cups and cones to match with the U.S. sales of cups and cones. In addition, Koyo states that reliance on actual
sales would simplify the calculations and lessen the administrative burden. If the Department determines that it
is necessary to continue to split TRB sets, Koyo requests that the Department at least combine the sales of cups and
cones in order to conduct a fair analysis, citing 

Timken Co. 

v. 

United States, 

673 F.Supp. 495, 505 (CIT 1987) (

Timken II

). 

Timken asserts that a TRB set is nothing more than a cup or cone sold together as a unit. The practice of selling cups and
cones as individual components in some markets does not render the components distinct articles of commerce. Timken
challenges Koyo's contention that cups and cones have different commercial values than complete sets, when, in fact,
Koyo points to no evidence in the administrative record to support its contention. 

Timken identifies several court cases where the CIT upheld the Department's set-splitting. For example, in 

Timken II, 

Timken notes that the CIT rejected NTN's argument that the Department was creating pretended sales of cups and cones
in the home market. Timken also cites NTN as support for the Department's set-splitting methodology. 

Moreover, Timken notes that the CIT has upheld the Department's use of set-splitting in the context of using home-market
annual average prices in 

NTN Bearing Corp. of America 

v. 

United States, 

835 F.Supp. 646 (CIT 1993)(

NTN I

). Although this issue was not specifically addressed in this case, Timken notes that the Department's consistent
practice has been to split TRB sets, no matter how FMV was determined (

e.g., 1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs, 

58 FR 64720). 

Finally, Timken sees no merit in Koyo's argument that the Department and respondents would be spared the additional
work necessary to split home-market set sales into cups and cones.

<PARENT> FR941110-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Timken concludes that Koyo has provided no reason for the Department to modify its present approach, and urges the
Department to continue to split home-market TRB sets into individual cup and cone components for the final results
of these reviews. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken. In its most recent decision on this matter, the CIT again reaffirmed the Department's practice
of set splitting (

NTN I

). In 

Timken II

 the CIT pointed out that these split sales are not ``fictitious'' sales, but real sales made to real customers. The
CIT upheld the Department's decision to split sales of sets because, otherwise, respondents could have forced the
Department to use CV in its analysis by simply selling sets in one market and cups and cones in the other: ``the Court
declines to read section 1677b(a)(1) to permit such control by foreign manufacturers of the manner in which FMV is
determined'' (

Timken II, 

at 495, 504-505). In addition, the CIT has also stated in 

NTN I

 that, if NTN's interpretation of the statute were followed, ``such interpretations would encourage importers to
circumvent the antidumping laws by simply using divergent invoicing methods'' (

NTN I, 

726, 741). The Department considers set-splitting to be necessary for these reviews; cups and cones split from sets
are potentially the most similar merchandise to the products sold in the United States. Because they may be the most
similar products, it is appropriate to include this merchandise in the pool of home-market sales. 



Comments Regarding Calculation of FMV 





Comment 10: 

Timken argues that the adjustment to FMV for 
early-payment discounts as direct selling expenses, 
which the Department granted NSK in the preliminary results of the 1984/85 and 1985/86 reviews, is unsupported. Timken
contends that the discounts were not related to specific merchandise and notes that, under identical circumstances,
the Department has in the past denied a respondent's claim for a direct adjustment. 

NSK concedes that, using its present methodology, the Department requires discounts to be reported on a transaction-specific
basis. However, NSK argues that in this case the Department's 1986 questionnaire did not require NSK to report early-payment
discounts on a transaction-specific basis, reflecting the Department's practice at the time. Furthermore, NSK
notes the company was unable to tie its cash discounts to specific merchandise because the same discounts were granted
on all merchandise. NSK explains that its allocation of total discounts over total sales was consistent with its record-keeping
at the time. 



Department's Position: 

The Department's current practice 
is indeed to require that discounts be reported on a 
transaction-specific basis (see 

AFBs III, 

39729, 39759). However, in our original questionnaires for these reviews we did not require NSK to report discounts
on such a basis, and we did not issue supplementary instructions when our practice changed. Therefore, because NSK's
submitted discount information represents the only information on the record, we have continued to rely on these
data for these final results of review. 



Comment 11: 

Timken contends that the Department incorrectly treated Koyo's post-sale price adjustments (PSPAs) and rebates
as direct selling expenses in the home market when, in fact, Koyo reported these adjustments as aggregate amounts,
attributable to all products, and, therefore, did not report them on a transaction-specific basis. Timken states
that at verification the Department determined that Koyo calculated (a) a lump-sum discount amount, and (b) a part-number-specific
debit/credit PSPA, and then reported a PSPA ratio based on the aggregate of these two values. Timken notes that 19 CFR
353.56(a) requires that billing adjustments bear ``a direct relationship to the sales compared'' in order to be treated
as a direct selling expense. In addition, Timken notes that, according to several court decisions, the burden of proving
entitlement to adjustments rests with respondents. Further, Timken cites 

Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

818 F.Supp. 1563, 1579 (1993) (

Torrington

), as evidence that the CIT disallowed a methodology which would include PSPAs and rebates on out-of-scope merchandise
in calculating an FMV.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-2-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Timken, however, believes that the Department should continue to adjust for home-market price increases, by using
Koyo's ``positive'' price adjustments, as these data constitute the best information on the record concerning price
increases during the periods of review. 

Koyo states that the Department correctly accepted Koyo's home-market billing adjustments as direct selling expenses.
Koyo argues that Timken's reliance on 

Torrington

 is misplaced because, although the CIT stated that the Department should not include billing adjustments for out-of-scope
merchandise, the CIT proposed an alternative methodology whereby billing adjustments for in-scope merchandise
can be calculated by identifying the ratio of in-scope merchandise to total sales to which these billing adjustments
apply, and applying that ratio to total billing adjustments (

Torrington

, 1578-79). Koyo maintains that the Department has verified and accepted Koyo's methodology in previously
completed TRB reviews (

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs; Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Japan

, 57 FR 4951 (February 11, 1992))(

TRBs I

). 

Koyo concludes that the Department properly treated Koyo's home-market PSPAs as direct selling expenses. Koyo adds
that if the Department contemplates rejecting Koyo's billing adjustments, it must, at a minimum, re-open the administrative
record to allow Koyo to resubmit information that conforms to any new standard the Department may use in lieu of the
standard prevailing in 1991 when Koyo submitted its consolidated response. 



Department's Position

: We disagree in part with Timken and Koyo. For these review periods, Koyo pooled all debit and credit notes associated
with the PSPAs and rebates of each customer and allocated the amounts over the total purchases (

i.e.

, in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise) of each customer. In our supplemental questionnaire we asked Koyo to demonstrate
how each price adjustment was linked to each transaction. Koyo only provided a computer printout showing price adjustments
by customer code. The price adjustments were divided by the customer's total purchases during each POR. Since Koyo's
records during the PORs did not reveal the exact nature of the price adjustments, we have not treated these expenses
as direct selling expenses. Nor have we limited the adjustments to only positive values, as Timken suggests, because
the use of only positive values would distort the information submitted by Koyo. Therefore, we have classified Koyo's
PSPAs and rebates as indirect, rather than direct, expenses. 



Comment 12: 

Koyo states that the CIT held in 

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. 

v. 

United States

, 810 F.Supp. 1287, 1292 (CIT 1993) (

Koyo Seiko

), and in numerous other cases that the antidumping statute requires the Department to make a circumstance-of-sale
(COS) adjustment to FMV for U.S. direct selling expenses. Koyo cites as examples 

NSK Ltd. 

v. 

United States,

 No. 92-03-00158, Slip Op. 93-216 (CIT Nov. 18, 1993), and 

NTN Bearing Corp. of America 

v. 

United States, 

No. 91-08-00576, Slip Op. 93-56 (CIT April 21, 1993)). Given such clear and consistent instruction
from the CIT, Koyo argues that the Department, for these final results, must adjust for U.S. direct selling expenses
by adding these expenses to FMV, rather than by subtracting them from USP. 

NSK argues that the Department's treatment of U.S. direct selling expenses as adjustments to USP was contrary to law
and judicial precedent. NSK argues that U.S. direct selling expenses are properly treated as upward adjustments
to FMV. 

Timken counters that the law requires Customs to collect the full amount of the difference between USP and FMV, and
if an improper denominator is used in calculating the 

ad valorem

 appraisement rate, respondents will escape collection of the full amount of duties. Timken asserts that in order
for Customs to apply appraisement rates to the entries subject to these reviews, the Department should calculate
the percentage rates on the basis of entered value. If this is done, Timken claims there will be no difference in the
rates calculated regardless of whether the expenses are subtracted from USP or added to FMV. 

Moreover, Timken notes that the Department has declined to follow the decisions cited by NSK and Koyo (

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs

), on the grounds that an appeal of the underlying issue is pending in other TRB litigation. Therefore, Timken states
that the Department should continue to deduct direct selling expenses from USP rather than add them to FMV.

Department's Position: 

It is our longstanding practice, pursuant to section 772(e)(2) of the Tariff Act, to deduct all expenses incurred
in the United States, including direct selling expenses, in calculating ESP. In calculating purchase price (PP),
adjustments for differences in COS pursuant to 19 C.F.R.  353.56, including direct selling expenses, are made
to FMV, and no deduction of direct selling expenses is made from PP. This is necessary to avoid a systematic distortion
in the amounts of duty assessed which would result if the value on which dumping margins were calculated were consistently
different than the entered value, to which Customs will apply the margin. 

Entered value is most commonly based on the price to the United States between the exporter and the importer. In contrast,
the basis of ESP is the resale price in the United States to the first unrelated purchaser, which will approximate the
entered value only after all expenses incurred in the United States (including direct selling expenses) are deducted.
PP will approximate the entered value without the deduction of any expenses because the direct selling expenses are
incurred in the exporting country and included in the price to the United States used for both PP and entered value.


On September 30, 1994, the Federal Circuit reversed the decisions of the CIT in 

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. and Koyo Corporation of U.S.A. 

and 

Isuzu Motors, Ltd. and American Isuzu Motors, Inc., 

v. 

United States 

and 

The Timken Company

 (93-1525, 93-1534), holding that ``(n)othing in the plain language * * * of the Antidumping
Act precludes Commerce's approach of adjusting exporter's sales price by deducting therefrom certain direct selling
expenses incurred in the United States. Indeed, Commerce's stated rationale for its approach is well within the bounds
of reasonableness.'' Therefore, we have maintained our practice for these final results. 



Comment 13: 

Timken maintains that Koyo cannot consolidate its sales to a related distributor and then report the selling expenses
of that distributor (

e.g., 

indirect selling expenses, credit), when it reported the sale between Koyo and its related distributor and did not
report the distributor's re-sale prices to unrelated parties. In Timken's view, Koyo's 

ad hoc

 treatment of related distributors' expenses and sales information, which were consolidated for some purposes and
not for others, renders the entire indirect selling expense claim invalid. 

Koyo states that Timken misinterpreted the verification report, which makes clear that Koyo reported only selling
expenses incurred by Koyo at its headquarters and sales offices, and did not include any expenses incurred by related
companies. 



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Timken. We have reexamined the documents cited by Koyo, including the home-market verification
report, and have concluded that the information on the record regarding Koyo's indirect selling expenses is accurate.
Although we have adjusted Koyo's home-market indirect selling expenses as a result of other positions taken by the
Department for these final results, we are satisfied that Koyo submitted only those expenses it incurred at its headquarters
and sales offices. 



Comment 14: 

Timken maintains that in the preliminary results of review for Yamaha, the Department erroneously deducted an imputed
adjustment for home-market credit expense from FMV. Because Yamaha made no claim for this adjustment, Timken asserts
that the Department is under no obligation to adjust for this expense, and that for the final results the Department
should not make the credit expense adjustment to FMV. 



Department's Position: 

We agree. The CIT has stated that the burden of proving entitlement to adjustments rests with the respondent making
the claim (

Timken II

). Therefore, we have not made an adjustment to FMV for Yamaha's imputed credit expenses. 



Comments Regarding Calculation of USP 





Comment 15: 

Timken asserts that section 772 of the Tariff Act requires the Department to adjust USP for ``all costs, charges, and
expenses . . . incident to bringing the merchandise from the place of shipment in the country of exportation
to the place of delivery in the United States. . . .'' Timken states that this includes pre-sale inland
freight. In contrast, Timken observes that there is no similar provision for deduction of such expenses from FMV.
Therefore, Timken argues that the statute calls for distinct treatment of pre-sale inland freight, depending upon
whether USP or FMV is at issue. 

Timken notes that the Federal Circuit's rejection of the Department's practice of treating home-market pre-sale
inland freight as a direct deduction from FMV is categorical and not limited to the PP context (

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994) (

Ad Hoc Committee

)). Timken asserts that the Department's implementation of 

Ad Hoc Committee

 requires that any adjustment for pre-sale inland freight be made pursuant to the ESP offset (as an indirect selling
expense), rather than pursuant to the COS provision of section 773 of the Tariff Act. 

Koyo points out that the Department treated pre-sale inland freight as an indirect expense, which is contrary to the
Department's established practice in previous reviews of this case of treating pre-sale inland freight as a direct
selling expense. Koyo cites 

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs. 

Koyo states that in Ad Hoc Committee

, which involved PP sales, the Federal Circuit held that the Department may not make a deduction for pre-sale inland
freight in calculating FMV. Koyo notes, moreover, that the Federal Circuit's decision explains that the case before
it was a departure from the Department's longstanding practice of deducting pre-sale transportation expenses from
FMV in ESP situations. 

Therefore, Koyo maintains that the Department should continue its practice of deducting pre-sale inland freight
expenses as direct selling expenses from FMV. Koyo also asserts that Timken's reliance on 

Ad Hoc Committee

 is misplaced because the decision applied only to situations involving PP transactions and does not apply to Koyo's
transactions in these reviews where USP is calculated using ESP. 

NSK argues that the 

Ad Hoc Committee

 decision has no bearing on NSK's sales. NSK contends that the Federal Circuit decision involved PP sales, in which
foreign inland freight was post-sale freight, whereas NSK's sales are ESP sales, in which all inland freight is pre-sale
freight. NSK argues that, in an ESP analysis, the deduction of pre-sale freight from USP but not from home-market price
would result in an unequal comparison. 



Department's Position: 

The 

Ad Hoc Committee

 decision states that the statute does not give the Department the authority to deduct home-market movement expenses
from FMV by invoking its inherent power to fill in ``gaps'' in the antidumping statute (

Ad Hoc Committee

, Slip. Op. 93-1239). Consistent with the rationale of this decision, the Department applies this methodology
to both PP and ESP situations. As a result, we must now evaluate a claim for pre-sale inland freight within the context
of the COS adjustment provision of the Tariff Act. With respect to Koyo's and NSK's claims of having incurred pre-sale
freight expenses, we find that neither claim is directly related to any specific sale and no specific sale is anticipated
at the time when respondents incurred the pre-sale inland freight expense. Consistent with our practice regarding
non-sales-specific expenses, we have treated pre-sale inland freight for NSK and Koyo as a home-market indirect
selling expense (19 CFR 353.56(b)(2)). 



Comment 16: 

Timken notes that in the preliminary results 
the Department excluded NSK's sales with prices of zero from the margin analysis. Timken contends that these sales
are likely sample or promotional sales, and should be included in the margin calculation as required by both the statute
and past Department practice. 

NSK argues that transactions showing zero prices are not ``sales'' because sales require the payment of money, and
are thus more properly viewed as selling expenses. NSK notes that, as verified by the Department, sample sales are
included in NSK's reported SG&A expenses, and thus should not be included in the Department's analysis of sales.




Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken. Our general practice has been to include zero-priced sample U.S. sales in margin calculations.
In 

AFBs II, 

where our policy is discussed at length, we stated, 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-2-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Sample sales fall outside the scope of the review 
when the respondent can demonstrate that no transfer of ownership has occurred between the exporter and the unrelated
U.S. purchaser . . . the statute and the regulations require the Department to analyze all sales within
the period of review. . . . Consequently, all U.S. zero-price sales have been included for the final
margin calculation. 



In 

Granular PTFE from Japan

 we excluded certain U.S. sample sales from our analysis. In that case, however, sample goods were provided to customers
for testing. Because of the nature of the product, once tested, the sample could not be returned. Although a transfer
of ownership had occurred, the product had not been used for commercial consumption, and thus could not be said to have
been ``sold'' (see 

Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Japan; Final Results of Review

, 58 FR 50345 (September 27, 1993)). In this case NSK states that its sample sales involve transfer of ownership and
makes no claim that the samples are destroyed or rendered unusable, as in 

Granular PTFE from Japan

. Accordingly, we have included all U.S. sample sales in our analysis for these final results of review. 


Comment 17:

 Timken argues that NSK's selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) for U.S. sales are underreported.
Timken notes that NSK excluded SG&A expenses which it claimed to be related to NSK's U.S. subsidiary's manufacturing
operations. Timken argues that NSK has not provided evidence to support such a claim, and that the Department, in the
1974/80 reviews, rejected a similar claim. Timken contends that the Department should recalculate NSK's SG&A
expenses to include the ``manufacturing-related'' expenses. 
NSK argues that expenses specifically related to U.S. manufacturing should not be included in SG&A expenses.
NSK maintains that, in the administrative reviews of the AFB orders, the Department recognized that a portion of NSK's
SG&A expenses are properly related to U.S. manufacturing. NSK contends that it would be unreasonable to deny
NSK a similar allocation in these reviews. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with Timken. NSK has failed to support its claimed allocation in either these or previous segments of this
proceeding. At verification we noted that while total SG&A expenses attributable to manufacturing-related
expenses had been verified, ``NSK did not provide evidence to substantiate the amounts to be allocated to manufacturing
only'' (see 

Verification Report

, March 27, 1987, p. 10). Therefore, for these final results of review we have recalculated NSK's SG&A expenses
to be deducted from USP to include the ``manufacturing-related'' expenses. 


Comment 18:

 Timken notes that NSK reported an export inspection fee applicable to exports to the United States in 1985/86, and
Timken presumes that similar expenses were also incurred for other periods. Timken contends that the Department
has not adjusted USP for these expenses in the 1980/85 reviews. 
NSK agrees with Timken's contention. 


Department's Position:

 In the preliminary results we did not adjust USP for export inspection fees. We have made the necessary changes to our
calculations for these final results of review. 


Comment 19:

 Timken argues that for 1980 through 1982, NSK claims that it had no loans in the United States, and challenges the ``average
lending rate'' methodology NSK used to determine credit expenses and inventory carrying costs. Timken claims that
the ``average lending rate'' used by NSK is the rate charged on intra-company loans. Timken argues that the Department
should recalculate the U.S. interest rate based on the formula used by NSK for the other periods (

i.e.

, the U.S. prime lending rate plus a given factor). 
NSK argues that its reported ``average lending rate'' was 
in fact the average interest received on short-term deposits, and thus reflects NSK's true credit costs. NSK argues
that, as verified by the Department, NSK had no loans for the period 1980 through 1982, and, therefore, its cost of credit
is properly the opportunity cost of late payment, 

i.e.

, unrealized interest from short-term deposits.

Department's Position:

 We agree with NSK. We verified that NSK had no loans for the period 1980 through 1982 and agree that NSK's credit costs
are the opportunity costs of late payment, and therefore, properly captured using the average interest rates on short-term
deposits. 


Comment 20:

 Timken maintains that Koyo's conclusion that 50 percent of its inland freight costs are direct and 50 percent are indirect
is an unsupported estimate of pre-sale and post-sale inland freight expense and, therefore, should be rejected in
its entirety, or, at a minimum, all of Koyo's inland freight expenses should be considered as indirect selling expenses.

Koyo counters that there is no evidence that its reported freight expenses are inaccurate or unreliable. Koyo states
that the Department verified the accuracy of its freight expense amount, and that the Department's practice of treating
pre-sale and post-sale inland freight as direct selling expenses renders the amount of the allocation between the
two types of expenses immaterial. 


Department's Position:

 Although Koyo requested that we deduct pre-sale inland freight as direct selling expenses from FMV, it allocated
total freight expenses into direct and indirect categories in its submission. Koyo contends that it did not distinguish
post-sale and pre-sale freight expenses in its records at that time and, therefore, allocated half of the expenses
to warehouse transfers and half to direct inland freight. We verified the accuracy of Koyo's total freight expenses
and accept Koyo's allocation of these expenses as the best estimate possible given the lack of specificity of Koyo's
records at the time. Therefore, we have continued to accept Koyo's allocation of direct and indirect home-market
freight expenses in these final results, treating 50 percent of total freight expenses as pre-sale freight (an indirect
selling expense) and 50 percent as post-sale freight (a direct selling expense deduction from FMV). 


Comment 21:

 Timken contends that the Department should deduct a reasonable profit amount from ESP. Timken concedes that the statute
is silent on this question, but states that there is broad international understanding that reseller profits should
be deducted in ESP-type situations. 
NSK argues that the Department has consistently rejected Timken's argument, and has been sustained by the CIT. Therefore,
the Department's treatment of profit is in accordance with the law. 
Koyo believes that Timken's argument should be rejected not only because there is no statutory basis for deducting
profit from ESP, but Timken's interpretation of the statute would require a fundamental change in a well-established
Department practice. According to Koyo, section 772(e) of the Tariff Act directs that, for purposes of calculating
ESP, the price shall be reduced by the amount of ``commissions for selling in the United States the particular merchandise
under consideration.'' Koyo asserts that the Department (and, prior to 1980, the Department of the Treasury), interprets
this provision literally (

i.e.

, that ``commission'' does not include ``profit''), citing 

Timken II

 and 

Timken Co.

 v. 

United States

, 630 F.Supp. 1327, 17783-44 (CIT 1986). Koyo concludes that there is no basis upon which to overturn the Department's
decision not to deduct profits from ESP. 


Department's Position:

 We agree with Koyo and NSK. Sections 772(d) and (e) of the Tariff Act do not include resale profits among the detailed
list of adjustments that the Department is authorized to make to USP in ESP situations. Thus, there is no provision
in the statute by which we can make the adjustment that Timken requests. 


Comment 22:

 Timken points out that the Department, in several recent administrative reviews, rejected Koyo's U.S. discount
data because they were aggregated, rather than transaction-specific. Timken states that aggregated discounts
or price adjustments are unreliable for purposes of antidumping analysis. Timken cites 

AFBs III

, wherein the Department rejected Koyo's U.S. discounts and sales allowances because Koyo did not report them on a
transaction-specific basis. In that review, Timken asserts that the Department assigned to Koyo, as BIA, the highest
percentage discount or sales allowance of any U.S. sale to all sales that received a discount or sales allowance. Timken
believes the Department should be consistent with its approach in AFBs III. 
Moreover, Timken maintains that the Department should not grant any adjustment for upward PSPAs to USP given that
Koyo's claim is based on averages of price adjustments and discounts on in-scope and out-of-scope merchandise rather
than transaction-specific price adjustments and discounts on in-scope merchandise. 
Koyo contends that the application of BIA for U.S. discounts would be inappropriate for these reviews because BIA
is normally reserved for situations in which a respondent fails to comply with an information request from the Department.
Koyo cites 

Olympic Adhesives

 v. 

United States

, 899 F.2d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990), in support of its contention. 
In this instance, according to Koyo, the Department never informed Koyo that the methodology Koyo used in 1991 for
reporting U.S. discounts and sales allowances would no longer satisfy the Department's new standard in the more recent
final results of review the Department published for TRBs and AFBs in 1993. Thus, Koyo concludes that it would be extremely
unfair for the Department to reject Koyo's claimed U.S. discounts at this late stage of these long-delayed reviews.

Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken. In these reviews of TRBs it has been the consistent practice of the Department to require that
discounts be reported on a transaction-specific basis. As early as June 6, 1991, in our final results of review for
the 1987/88 POR (

Tapered Roller Bearings from Japan; Final Results of Review, 

56 FR 26059) (

TRBs

), we stated that Koyo's methodology of calculating one discount factor for all bearing sales and assigning it to a
group of customers is not representative of actual TRB sales experience, since it fails to tie the actual discounts
granted to the sales to which they apply (56 FR 26059). Thus, we did not allow discounts, rebates, or price adjustments
based on broad allocations in that review. Moreover, in our 1993 supplemental questionnaire for these administrative
reviews, we requested documentation of the discount rates in effect during each of the PORs. We also asked Koyo to report
discounts and sales allowances on a transaction-specific or, if that were not possible, on a customer-specific basis.
However, since Koyo did not report its U.S. discounts and sales allowances on a transaction-specific basis for the
reviews in question, we assigned, as BIA, the highest percentage discount reported for any U.S. sale to all sales that
received a discount during each POR.





Comment 23: 

Timken contends that Koyo's ESP offset cap is inflated due to the Department's inclusion of freight-out expense and
commissions which the Department should re-classify as direct selling expenses, not indirect. Timken points out
that Koyo reported its U.S. sales commissions on a transaction-by-transaction basis as direct expenses. Similarly,
Timken states that there is no basis for including freight-out in indirect selling expenses since freight, in general,
is considered a movement charge when calculating USP.

Koyo agrees that the Department should define the ESP offset cap in the same manner as in its other recent TRB reviews.



Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken that freight incurred in the United States should be treated as a direct deduction from USP pursuant
to 19 CFR 353.41(d) and have done so for these final results. However, the Department rejected Koyo's claim for a deduction
for home-market commissions because Koyo was unable to tie the total commission amount to sales of covered merchandise
at verification. We have, therefore, included U.S. commissions in the ESP cap, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(b).



Comment 24: 

Timken objects to Koyo's reporting of U.S. freight expenses based on sales value. Timken notes that the Department
requested that Koyo report its freight-in expense based on the cost of goods sold, but Koyo indicated that it was unable
to comply. Timken cites 

TRBs 

to assert that the Department's consistent position is that ``allocation of freight costs by volume, weight, distance,
or a combination of these, is preferable to allocations based on sales value'' (TRBs 56 FR, 41508, Comment 17). Timken
requests that the Department re-allocate freight expenses based on the weight of the merchandise, since the net weight
of individual bearings is available in the administrative record of these reviews.

Koyo claims that its method of allocating freight expenses over the sales value of the subject merchandise remains
the most accurate method available to account for these expenses. Koyo asserts that the Department accepted this
method as reasonable in prior reviews and should continue to do so for these final results.



Department's Position: 

We agree with Koyo. While we have stated, as Timken notes, that allocations of freight costs by volume, weight, distance,
or a combination of these elements are preferable to allocations based on sales value, we have also recognized that
individual bearing firms do not maintain records of freight expenses based on weight (see TRBs). Therefore, we determined
that Koyo's allocation of freight expense based on value is a reasonable method and does not produce distorted results.



Comment 25:

 Timken states that the Department is faced with competing data for export sales expenses reported in May 1991 (revised
November 1993) and export department expenses verified in 1987 for the period 1974/85. Since both the March 1987 and
November 1993 verification reports indicate that total export expenses were ``unsubstantiated'' or an aspect of
the expense was ``not verified,'' the Department should use the highest figure on the record for determining export
selling expenses.

Koyo counters that Timken has misconstrued language in the Department's verification report that Koyo failed verification
regarding its selling expenses. Koyo asserts that the statement that the breakdown of employees into various categories
``was not verified'' means that the verification team did not address that issue in detail, and not, as Timken has interpreted
it, that Koyo failed verification regarding its selling expenses.



Department's Position: 

We agree with Koyo that Timken misinterpreted the verifiers' explanation of Koyo's home-market indirect selling
expenses, specifically selling expenses incurred in Japan with respect to U.S. sales. Since export selling expenses
were, indeed, satisfactorily verified in November 1993, we have used the export selling expenses reported in Exhibit
C-16 of Koyo's November 10, 1993, submission.



Comment 26:

 Timken asserts that Koyo, in its calculation of U.S. inventory carrying costs, failed to include the imputed interest
expense for time in transit from Japan to its U.S. subsidiary, American Koyo Company (AKC). Timken cites 

Silver Reed America, Inc. 

v. 

United States, 

12 CIT 250, 683 F.Supp. 1393 (1988), as support for its position that such an interest expense can be deducted from ESP.
Although Koyo contends that the U.S. inventory period includes time in transit, Timken maintains that there is no
support for that claim in the administrative record. Timken cites the Department's U.S. verification report (March
27, 1987), covering the PORs from 1974/85 wherein the Department determined that inventory carrying costs, which
were reported on a similar basis as the present period, did not include time in transit from Japan.

Timken urges the Department to increase the reported inventory time by a reasonable time for shipment from Japan to
the United States, using data supplied by another producer, or by assuming at least thirty-five days in transit.

Koyo states that Timken is incorrect in its assertion that Koyo's U.S. inventory carrying cost does not include ``time
on the water''. Koyo explains that AKC takes title to merchandise when it leaves Koyo's warehouse in Japan, and it is
booked into AKC's inventory at that time. Therefore, Koyo contends that AKC's inventory values used to determine
the average time in inventory include the value of the inventory in transit.



Department's Position: 

We disagree with Timken. Koyo submitted U.S. inventory carrying costs in two separate stages, the expenses incurred
in Japan for exported goods and the inventory expenses associated with U.S. sales. Koyo states that these costs include
``time on the water''. Because its sales were satisfactorily verified, and we have no reason to believe that this expense
is inaccurate, we have continued to use Koyo's U.S. inventory carrying costs as reported.

Comments Regarding COP and CV





Comment 27: 

Timken argues that NSK reported interest expenses for COP net of interest income, but NSK did not demonstrate that
this income stemmed solely from short-term deposits or normal operations. Timken contends that the Department should
recalculate NSK's COP based on gross interest expenses, or in the alternative, recalculate the interest expense
factor to exclude long-term interest income based on a supplementary cost response in which NSK segregated short-term
and long-term interest revenue.

NSK agrees with Timken's contention that the submitted COP figures incorrectly included an interest expense net
of all interest income. NSK suggests that the Department should recalculate the interest expense factor based on
the supplementary cost response figures.



Department's Position: 

The interest-expense factor should reflect only short-term interest income attributable to the normal production
of the merchandise within the scope of the order. We have reviewed NSK's data for this claimed adjustment and are satisfied
that the firm attributed the reported interest income only to the production of merchandise within the scope of the
order. We did not find evidence on the record to suggest that some portion of the claimed interest income is attributable
to the production of other merchandise or associated with long-term deposits.

Therefore, for these final results we have recalculated NSK's interest expenses based on a NSK's supplementary COP
response, wherein NSK segregated short-term and long-term interest income.



Comment 28: 

Timken argues that the Department's deduction from CV for home-market selling expenses is overstated for NSK. Timken
contends that the Department calculated selling expenses by applying reported factors to CV to determine the amount
of selling expenses to deduct from CV, which already includes selling expenses, rather than applying those factors
to COP.

NSK argues that CV is a proxy for price, and that since the selling expense factors reported were calculated as a percentage
of total sales, these factors are correctly applied to CV.



Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken in part. To avoid overstating the home-market selling expense adjustments, and given that we
have the home-market unit prices, we have applied the reported selling expense factors, expressed as a percentage
of unit price, to obtain a yen amount for the expense. We then deducted the resulting amounts from CV.

Comment 29:

 According to Timken, the Department should exclude below-cost sales in calculating profit for CV. Timken cites section
773(e) of the Tariff Act to argue that CV includes profit earned on sales ``in the ordinary course of trade''. Since
CV is merely an alternative basis for determining FMV, and the Department disregards below-cost sales when sales
form the basis of FMV, Timken asserts that the Department should not include any below-cost sales in its calculation
of profit for CV. 
Timken notes that the Department recognized the need for this balance in 

Timken II 

and in 

Asociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores 

v. 

United States,

 13 CIT 25, 704 F.Supp. 1114, 1124, (1989), 

aff'd,

 901 F.2d 1089, 

cert. denied,

 498 U.S. 848 (1990). Timken points out that in these cases the question was whether CV is properly subject to COS adjustments
pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, which provides for adjustments to home-market price for certain types of selling expenses.
Timken notes that the CIT held that adjustments were proper, given the functional equivalent of CV and FMV.
Timken states that in 

Certain Stainless Steel Wire Rods from France, 

58 FR 68865 (December 29, 1993), the Department recognized that non-arm's-length sales to related parties should
not be included in the profit calculation for CV. Timken concludes that the same reasoning applies to below-cost sales
in the home market and that the statute's reference to sales in the ordinary course of trade does not include below-cost
sales when those sales are made in substantial quantities over an extended period of time.


Citing section 773(e) of the Tariff Act, NSK argues that the statute does not require that sales below cost be excluded
in the calculation of profit of the class or kind of merchandise under consideration. 



Koyo asserts that Timken's arguments run contrary to the statute and represent unprecedented and radical departure
from the Department's past administrative practice. Koyo notes that the Department has recently rejected substantially
identical arguments made by Timken in the most recent TRB reviews and the two most recent AFB reviews (

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs,

 58 FR 64728; 

AFBs III,

 58 FR 39751; 

AFBs II,

 57 FR 28374). Koyo concludes that the Department should reject Timken's arguments and continue its longstanding
practice of including all home-market sales in the calculation of profit for CV. 


Department's Position:

 As noted by Koyo, the Department has rejected Timken's arguments that below-cost sales should not be included in the
calculation of profit because (a) the statute does not explicitly provide that below-cost sales should be disregarded
in the calculation of profit, (b) the definition of ``ordinary course of trade'' (section 771(15) of the Tariff Act)
does not exclude or even mention sales below cost, and (c) the provision requiring the Department to disregard certain
sales below COP in the calculation of FMV suggests that below-cost sales are not, 

per se,

 outside the ordinary course of trade. Therefore, in these reviews we have not excluded below-cost sales in calculating
profit for CV (see, 

e.g., AFBs III

).


Comment 30:

 Koyo objects to the Department's initiation of a sales-below-cost investigation on the grounds that the Department
has acknowledged, and the CIT has held, that Timken's below-cost allegation in 1983 for the 1974 through 1979 reviews
formed an inadequate basis for a below-cost investigation. Because the 1989 allegation for the 1979/86 PORs was based
on the 1983 allegation, Koyo asserts that the later allegation is also inadequate. In addition, Koyo maintains that
both allegations were untimely. 
Koyo points to section 773(b) of the Tariff Act, which states that the Department may initiate a below-cost investigation
whenever it has ``reasonable grounds'' to believe sales of subject merchandise in the home market are being made at
prices which represent less than the cost of producing the merchandise. Koyo maintains that Timken's 1983 and 1989
cost allegations were not company-specific and instead relied entirely upon references to public sources and, therefore,
should be rejected. Koyo cites 

Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. 

v. 

United States,

 575 F.Supp. 1277 (CIT 1983), in support of its position that COP allegations must be company-specific. Koyo states
that despite the CIT's decision that Timken's allegations were deficient with respect to the 1974/79 PORs, Timken
never attempted to remedy the deficiencies in its cost allegations regarding the periods covered by the 1979/86 administrative
reviews. 
Koyo states that prior to the promulgation of 19 CFR 353.31, which requires all below-cost allegations to be filed
within 120 days of the initiation of the administrative review, the Department examined the span of time between when
Timken possessed sufficient information to make the allegation and when the below-cost allegation was actually
made. Koyo cites 

Color Television Receivers, Except for Video Monitors, from Taiwan

 (51 FR 46895, December 29, 1986), which stated that possessing information 4 months prior to making a COP allegation
was enough time to make the allegation untimely. Koyo states that the Department relied on these parameters in dismissing
two below-cost allegations, one 10 months after the release of cost-of-manufacture data, the other 12 months later,
submitted by Timken against NSK in the 1974/80 reviews.
In contrast to the NSK situation, Koyo notes that the Department initiated a below-cost investigation of Koyo for
the 1974/79 reviews based on Timken's 1983 allegation despite the fact that it was based on information that was available
to Timken nearly two years before it filed the allegation. Koyo notes that Timken's 1989 allegation for the 1979/86
reviews was filed three years after the end of the final period covered by these reviews, and nine years after the end
of the first period covered by these reviews.

Koyo concludes that the below-cost allegation on which the Department predicated its cost investigation in the 1979/86
periods of review was both factually deficient and untimely and, accordingly, the Department should not investigate
whether Koyo sold such or similar merchandise in the home market at prices below the COP. 
Timken disagrees with Koyo's assessment of Timken's 1983 below-cost allegation for the 1974/79 administrative
reviews, stating that Koyo's argument contains several key errors and omissions, namely its failure to mention Timken's
supplemental COP allegation of April 28, 1992, or its submission of August 19, 1988. 
Timken notes that although the Department initiated a sales-below-cost investigation for the 1974/79 periods in
September 1983, that investigation was subsequently interpreted to cover only the 1978/79 period, and was to encompass
subsequent periods only if the Department found below-cost sales in the 1978/79 POR. Timken states that when the Department
found that Koyo made below-cost sales during the 1978/79 POR, it issued a COP questionnaire for the 1979/86 PORs in
July 1989. 
Timken states that, upon completion of the 1974/79 reviews, Koyo filed a CIT action challenging the Department's
decision to conduct a COP investigation of Koyo. Timken elaborates on the history of that litigation: 1) the court
ruled that Timken's original 1983 submission did not meet the 

Al Tech 

standard for initiation of a cost investigation and remanded the case for re-calculation of the margin without a COP
analysis (

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States,

 796 F.Supp. 517 (CIT 1992); 2) on Timken's motion for rehearing, the CIT modified the remand order, permitting Timken
to supplement its COP allegation without recourse to information obtained during the Department's initial COP investigation
(

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

16 CIT 92-139 at 11 (August 21, 1992)); 3) the Department determined and the CIT affirmed that Timken's supplemental
allegation was a sufficient basis for the below-cost sales investigation (

Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd., et al. 

v. 

United States 

v.

 United States, 

819 F.Supp. 1093 (CIT 1993)). 
With regard to the 1979/86 reviews, Timken asserts that it supplemented its prior allegations for the 1979 through
1986 reviews in April 1992, based on the COP data Koyo submitted in response to the July 1989 questionnaire and the variable
cost data that would have been on the administrative record in any event. Timken notes that Koyo failed to address Timken's

April 1992 submission. 


Department's Position:

 If we find sales below cost in the immediately preceding segment of a proceeding, we have reasonable grounds to believe
or suspect below-cost sales in the subsequent segment of the proceeding pursuant to section 773(b) of the Tariff Act.
Therefore, we require a response to a cost questionnaire in an administrative review subsequent to finding sales
below cost in a previous segment of the proceeding. We decided to proceed in the 1979/86 reviews with a cost investigation
since, upon remand in the 1974/79 litigation, the Department conducted a cost investigation for 1978/79 and found
sales below cost. The Department's finding of sales below cost in the 1978/79 review is an adequate foundation to conduct
a cost investigation in the subsequent administrative reviews. 


Comment 31: 

Timken maintains that Koyo's COP information should be rejected in its entirety as unreliable because Koyo admitted
that its primary records for COP prior to 1984 were destroyed. According to Timken, the information submitted by Koyo
is simply an extrapolation of data from the 1985/86 POR. Moreover, the data have never been verified. 
Timken points out that the Department rejected Koyo's COP data for the 1978/79 review as inconsistent and unreliable
and consequently used BIA. According to Timken, Koyo has not demonstrated that the cost information submitted for
these reviews is any more accurate or reliable than the cost data rejected by the Department in the 1978/79 review.
Moreover, Timken notes that corporate losses sustained by Koyo in the late 1970's and early 1980's makes it inherently
unreasonable to extrapolate 1985/86 costs to this earlier period. 
Timken identifies the following specific deficiencies in Koyo's COP submissions: 
 From 1980-86 Koyo used three separate and irreconcilable COP systems.

 Post-1983 standards and variances were projected backward to yield costs for the 1979/83 PORs. 
 ``Actual'' and ``reconstructed'' costs for a limited sample of bearings differed substantially, calling
into question the reliability of Koyo's methodology. 
 Koyo failed to provide information on transfers of production equipment from related parties, although Koyo
is a major manufacturer of bearing-production equipment. 
 Koyo failed to provide part-number-specific data regarding material usage and prices during the PORs. 
 The responses contain no detailed information on calculation of research and development expenses. 
 Timken asserts that the Department should reject Koyo's COP data unless it can establish that the newly-submitted
data are consistent with previously-verified information on the record. If the Department determines to accept
the data as submitted, Timken argues that the Department should make the following modifications: 
 Timken states that, under the Department's precedent in 

AFBs III and Minivans from Japan 

(57 FR 21933, May 26, 1992), interest income must be related to production of the subject merchandise to be allowed
as an offset to interest expense. Since Koyo was unable to report separately long- and short-term interest income
for the 1979/83 periods, and instead used net interest expense based on its experience during the 1983/86 PORs, Timken
urges the Department to use the interest expense contained in Koyo's consolidated financial statements. 
 Timken maintains that the Department should ensure that all adjustments to CV are consistent with the price-based
adjustments Koyo reported. If it is not possible to adjust the reported expenses in this manner, the Department should
decline to make any adjustment to CV for selling expenses. 
 Timken claims that the Department misconstrued Koyo's reporting of direct and indirect selling expenses,
G&A expenses, and interest expenses as a fixed amount per unit rather than as a percentage of the cost of manufacturing
(COM). Timken urges the Department to revise its calculations accordingly. 

Koyo reiterates its contention that the Department's initiation of a below-cost investigation in these reviews
was improper (see Comment 30). In response to Timken's arguments Koyo makes the following points: 
 Timken's assertion that Koyo's costs for the 1979/85 periods are merely an extrapolation of Koyo's 1985/86
costs is incorrect. Koyo submits that the costs for all the periods covered by these reviews can be reconciled to total
cost of goods sold as reported in the annual financial statements. 
 Contrary to Timken's conclusion that essential records were destroyed, Koyo states that it did retain a complete
historical record of total standard costs, or COM, by bearing model and year. 
 Koyo argues that it is normal for a firm to change its cost accounting procedures in the ordinary course of business
over a ten-year period. 
 Koyo maintains that nothing in its submission suggests that the ratio of interest expenses for the later period
was applied to the earlier period, as Timken implies. 
 Koyo did not project post-1983 standards and variances backwards, but applied standard costs and variances
for each review year to obtain the actual costs for that year. 
 Contrary to Timken's assertion that Koyo failed to provide information on transfers of production equipment
from related parties, Koyo maintains that it fully disclosed all consolidated subsidiaries and subcontractors.



Koyo maintains that differences in how it accounted for various expenses in different years do not, in themselves,
suggest that Koyo's system is inaccurate or unreliable. Therefore, Koyo concludes that the Department should continue
to use these data if it decides to pursue the below-cost investigation. 
Moreover, Koyo contends that Timken fails to produce new evidence of any deficiencies in Koyo's cost data, relying
only on references to Koyo's cost submissions in the 1974/79 reviews. Koyo argues that references to those reviews
are irrelevant, and Koyo is under no burden to draw comparisons between its current submissions and submissions in
previous reviews. Koyo adds that the Department has had Timken's comments for over two and a half years and has not seen
fit to request additional or clarifying data from Koyo. For the Department to decide that these data are inadequate
would be grossly unfair and prejudicial to Koyo's interests. 



Department's Position

: We disagree with Timken's assertion that Koyo's cost response should be rejected in its entirety. Timken does not
explain why or how Koyo's cost accounting systems are irreconcilable. Moreover, there is no evidence on the record
that Koyo extrapolated data from the 1985/86 review period and applied a deflator for previous years included in these
reviews. Koyo stated in its responses to our COP questionnaires that all cost data for these reviews can be traced to
its financial statements. While we did not verify these specific cost data from the October 1989 and April 1990 submissions,
we did verify a significant portion of Koyo's data from these review periods and found the reported information in
the vast majority of cases to be accurate. 

We agree with Koyo that Timken is incorrect in its assertion that Koyo used net interest expense for the 1979/83 PORs
extrapolated from its experience in the 1983/86 PORs. In its 1990 supplemental response Koyo explained that it does
not separate long- and short-term interest expense in the normal course of business. However, Koyo stated that it
was able to separate these expenses for the periods 1983/1986. For the periods 1979/83 Koyo estimated the short-term
element based on the ratio of short-term to long-term liabilities actually paid rather than accrued each year. Koyo
deducted short-term interest income to derive a net interest expense ratio which was then applied to each model's
basic cost. Therefore, Timken is incorrect in its contention that 1979/83 net interest expenses were based on Koyo's
experience in the 1983/86 review periods. 

We agree, however, with Timken's contention that not all of the expenses reported by Koyo as direct expenses should
be deducted from CV. For these final results we have not used the direct selling expense variable as submitted in the
CV database because this variable represented commissions, which we disregarded (see our response to Comment 23),
and rebate expenses, which we did not treat as a direct adjustment to Koyo's home-market unit prices (see our response
to Comment 11) in these final results. We have used the weighted-average home-market credit expense of all sales reported
in each POR as the only direct deduction from CV. 

We believe that the cost information submitted by Koyo provides the necessary data to conduct a cost test for each of
these periods of review. Therefore, for these final results of review, we have continued to use Koyo's cost data as
submitted, with certain changes explained in this notice which we deemed appropriate (see Comments 33, 38, 41, and
46).

Comments Regarding Use of BIA 





Comment 32

: Timken asserts that in all instances BIA for missing data should be based on adverse inferences. Timken points out
that in 

Rhone Poulenc Inc. 

v. 

United States 

(899 F.2d 1185, 1190 (Fed. Cir. 1990)) the Federal Circuit upheld the Department's use of the highest prior margin
as BIA. In this instance, however, Timken notes that for those home-market models lacking variable cost of manufacture
(VCOM) information, the Department set the difference in merchandise (difmer) to 20 percent, the maximum difference
allowed for matching bearings under the Department's model-match methodology. Timken claims that this approach
infers that the match is otherwise valid, and, in practice, provides an incentive for respondents to manipulate the
model-match process. Timken concludes that the Department should apply the highest rate in any previous administrative
review to any U.S. sales that are missing cost data. In Timken's view, such a choice would reflect ``a common sense inference
that the highest prior margin is the most probative evidence of current margins because, if it were not so, the [respondent],
knowing of the rule, would have produced current information showing the margin to be less'' (

Rhone Poulenc

). 

NSK argues that at the time that the VCOM data were submitted in this case the Department did not use a 20-percent difmer
as BIA, and, therefore, respondents had no incentive to selectively report VCOM information. 



Department's Position

: We disagree with Timken's contention that setting the difmer equal to 20 percent when home-market sales lack VCOM
data provides an incentive for respondents to manipulate the model-match process. We have no reason to believe that
such manipulation is taking place. As a result, we do not agree with Timken that the highest rate from a previous administrative
review should be applied to U.S. sales which match to home-market sales for which respondents did not provide VCOM
data. Rather, for these final results we have set the difmer equal to 20 percent. We have used this approach in previous
TRB reviews (see 

TRBs, 

56 FR 26057 (June 6, 1991), 

TRBs I,

 57 FR 4986 (February 11, 1992), 

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs 

58 FR 64731 (December 9, 1993)). 



Comment 33

: NSK disagrees with the Department's application of NSK's rate for the April 1, 1978 through July 31, 1978, period
as BIA for these reviews. NSK argues that the Department should not have used as BIA a weighted-average rate resulting
from a four-month period. NSK contends that the Department has never relied on a rate from a prior administrative review
that covered such a brief period of time. 

Timken notes that the Department frequently applies as BIA 
margins from LTFV investigations, which generally cover six-month periods. Timken argues that NSK has not offered
any evidence that a BIA rate from a four-month period should be deemed unreliable, particularly where the underlying
determination has been through judicial review. 



Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken. As stated in our preliminary results, the Department sought to use, as BIA, the highest rate NSK
received in a previous POR, which in this instance was a rate for a four-month POR. In the final results of review covering
the 1974 through 1980 period the Department found a rate of 23.43 percent for the period August 1, 1977 through July
31, 1978 (55 FR 369, June 1 1990). NSK challenged those results and the CIT remanded them to the Department with instructions
to use Treasury master lists for sales made from August 1, 1977, through March 31, 1978, and to recalculate the margin
for the remaining (non-master list) period in accordance with the CIT's instructions. Thus, the margin from the previous
review covered four months. 

We note that NSK has not cited any instance where the Department deemed a rate from a four-month period to be unsuitable
as BIA. Furthermore, NSK has not provided evidence that the rate in question is not representative of the rate that
we would have obtained from a longer POR. Therefore, for U.S. sales for which we have relied on BIA, we have applied the
margin from the four-month POR, since it is the highest margin for NSK in a previous segment of the proceeding. 



Comment 34: 

Timken states that as a result of Koyo's model-match exercise it became clear that Koyo failed to provide VCOM data
for a number of U.S. and home-market part numbers. In these instances the Department applied a 20 percent variable-cost
differential as BIA. Timken suggests that splitting the variable costs of the sets would provide VCOMs for those cups
and cones which lacked variable costs in the preliminary results. 

Koyo acknowledges that there may still be some part numbers for which no VCOM can be found after correction of the VCOM
error. However, Koyo submits that the Department's present BIA approach is more efficient and reliable than the alternative
of set-splitting advocated by Timken. 



Department's Position: 

In our calculations of FMV we did split the variable costs of the home-market sets. There were four TRB sets sold in the
home market with no reported cost data which resulted in four cup and cone models with no reported VCOM after set splitting.
For these sales we have continued to calculate a 20-percent VCOM differential as BIA. There were no models of cups and
cones sold in the home market for which Koyo did not report a variable cost. 

Where the variable cost of models sold in the U.S. was missing, we did not use BIA to calculate a difmer adjustment to
FMV. For U.S. sales of those models with no variable cost information, we either matched them to identical home-market
models or we have used CV as the basis for FMV pursuant to  773(a)(1) and  773(a)(2) of the Tariff Act. 



Comment 35: 

Timken argues that the Department should base NSK's margin on total BIA. Timken contends that NSK failed to submit
complete home-market sales data on a sale-by-sale basis, despite a specific request from the Department to do so.
Timken notes that NSK reported only home-market sales with quantities equal to five percent or more of the corresponding
U.S. sales, and generally utilized its own model-match criteria, which deviated substantially from those currently
applied by the Department. 

Timken further argues that the Department should determine that NSK was ``non-cooperative'' and should apply first-tier
BIA to NSK for all periods (

i.e.,

 use the highest margin calculated for any respondent in either prior or concurrent periods of review). 

NSK argues that there are no grounds for the Department to base NSK's margin on total BIA. NSK contends that the Department
verified that the home-market sales list reported by NSK was complete. NSK contends that the Department, after verification,

did not challenge or further investigate the model-matching method employed by NSK.

NSK further argues that the Department's request for a 
sale-by-sale listing of home-market sales was made in the context of a cost investigation, and came two years after
the submission of the original home-market sales listing. 
Finally, NSK argues that to the extent that NSK responses may have been deficient, the omissions were minor and not
intended to impede the reviews, and first-tier BIA should not be applied. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with NSK that the Department verified the general completeness of NSK's reported home-market sales listing.
We also agree with NSK that the Department's request for a sale-by-sale listing of home-market sales was pursuant
to a cost investigation. 
However, as NSK has conceded both in its rebuttal brief and 
at the hearing, NSK never responded to our July 1, 1988, request for a complete home-market sales listing. This failure
to report a sale-by-sale listing has major implications with respect to the cost test and the model match. By selectively
reporting home-market sales, NSK could have arguably contrived a result where U.S. models would be matched with low-cost,
low-price ``similar'' models. Therefore, while we appreciate NSK's candor in admitting that it never provided the
complete sales listing, we cannot ignore the fact that the cost test and model match were 
compromised. 
We note that this conclusion applies only to U.S. models which do not have ``identical'' matches in the home market.
Throughout the TRB reviews, all parties have operated on the premise that bearings with identical nomenclature (

i.e.

, product or identification number) are identical in all physical aspects. Thus, models with identical nomenclature
will in every instance be matched to each other, and NSK's incomplete sales listing does not compromise such a comparison.

Therefore, for these final results of review, we have relied on BIA for sales of U.S. models for which NSK did not make
sales of identical merchandise in the home market. Where identical bearings were sold in both markets, we have used
NSK's reported data. 
With respect to the choice of BIA, we note that, throughout the many delays that have arisen in the course of the 1980/86
reviews, NSK has generally been a cooperative respondent. Accordingly, for those U.S. sales where no identical matches
are possible, we have relied on a second-tier BIA rate, which is the highest margin for NSK from any preceding review
period. 


Comment 36: 

NSK takes issue with the Department's application of BIA for U.S. sales lacking VCOM information. NSK contends that
its COM records are tied to the year of production, rather than the year of sale and, therefore, the Department should
use cost data from another year within the 1980/86 PORs for any U.S. sale lacking difmer cost data.

NSK further notes that in the 1974/80 segment of this proceeding, the Department used 1980/85 cost data, if available,
as BIA when cost data for the 1974/80 period were missing. 
Timken argues that while it may be reasonable for the Department to search the annual period immediately prior to the
period in which the sale took place, any search beyond one period would be affected by fluctuations in steel prices
and changes in labor efficiency over the course of the six-year review period. 
Timken further notes that NSK's citation of the 1974/80 results is misleading. In that case, the Department relied
on NSK's 1980/85 cost data as BIA because NSK had not retained cost information for the 1976/80 PORs. Timken contends
that for the 1980/86 PORs, NSK simply failed to provide complete review-specific VCOM data despite the Department's
request for the information. 
Timken counters that the Department specifically requested VCOM information in both markets for the entire POR,
and NSK failed to provide it. Under these circumstances Timken concludes that application of a BIA rate for sales with
missing data is reasonable. 
Department's Position: In our preliminary results of review we applied BIA to sales of U.S. models lacking VCOM data
which were matched with similar home-market models. For these final results of review, we applied BIA to sales of all
U.S. models when we did not find an identical match in the home market. Since we are not attempting to find matches for
U.S. models with no identicals in the home market, VCOM data is not relevant to these results. Therefore, the issue
of missing VCOM data is moot. 



Comment 37: 

Koyo contends that the Department should not apply BIA to Koyo's U.S. sample sales because the Department did not specifically
request this information until September 17, 1993, 13 years after the end of the first period and 7 years after the end
of the final period covered by these reviews. Koyo asserts that it was not the Department's practice to require the
submission of information regarding such sales during the periods under review (1979/86). Koyo argues that it may
have been able to provide information regarding its U.S. sample sales had the Department completed these reviews
in a timely manner. In Koyo's view, the application of BIA to these sales, in effect, would punish Koyo for the Department's
own delay. In the interest of fairness, Koyo states that the Department should not apply any BIA to these sales. 
Timken agrees with the Department's proposal to use BIA for U.S. sample sales, based on the value of sample sales in
the home market, as obtained at verification. Timken also states that the Department should guard against increasing
the value of U.S. sales (the denominator of the weighted-average margin) and increasing the value of the duties due
(the numerator of the weighted-average margin) by a BIA factor which would result in the same amount of duties collected
absent the application of BIA. 


Department's Position: 

In its response to our supplemental questionnaire, Koyo failed to comply with our request for a list of U.S. sample
sales, stating that ``to produce such a sales listing, AKC would have to review manually all of its sales invoices and
records for the covered periods'' (November 1, 1993 submission, p. 6). In that letter Koyo stated that time restraints
were the only obstacles to producing a list of U.S. sample sales. However, in its case brief Koyo stated that ``it is
unable, at such a removed point in time, to identify its U.S. sample sales, because (it) did not maintain a database
of its U.S. sales that identified its sample sales.'' 
Section 776(c) of the Tariff Act requires that BIA be applied when a party does not produce requested information whether
the non-compliance is due to refusal or mere inability to produce the desired data (Olympic Adhesives, Inc., v. United
States, 899 F.2d 1565, 1574 (1990)). Koyo failed to reply to our request for a list of U.S. sample sales, saying the effort
would be too great. In our preliminary analysis memorandum for these reviews we identified the methodology we intended
to use as BIA for the missing U.S. sample sales in our final results of review. Therefore, we are applying BIA to these
sales. We only have information on Koyo's home market sample sales. Therefore, we used the data for home market sample
sales from the 1985/86 period. We used the relationship of home market sample sales to total home market sales to represent
the relationship of U.S. sample sales to total U.S. sales. With this information, we determined a value for those U.S.
sample sales and applied a BIA margin to that value. We added both the resulting duties due amount and the calculated
value of the sample U.S. sales to our respective margin and value totals in deriving our weighted-average margin.

Comment 38: 

Timken asserts that Koyo's failure to report home-market sample sales in its original submission, and then, at the
Department's request, Koyo's submission of a list rather than a computer tape, should not be countenanced. Timken
claims that the printout of home-market sample sales Koyo provided in its supplemental response is clearly from a
computer file. 
Therefore, Timken concludes that submission of a computer tape of home-market sample sales could not be as difficult
as Koyo professes. Moreover, Timken chides the Department for not requesting such data despite Timken's timely protest
of Koyo's failure to report home-market sample sales. Absent sample sales, the home-market sales listing is incomplete
and unreliable. In Timken's view, the only proper solution, short of rejecting the entire response, is to require
immediate submission of a computer tape listing of sample sales. 
Timken maintains that Koyo elected not to comply because the Department has only limited options regarding ``best
information'' under these circumstances. Timken states that in 

1990/91 and 1991/92 TRBs 

the Department addressed Koyo's failure to support its claim that particular home-market sales were samples. 
Koyo argues that the Department properly excluded its home-market sample sales because they are 

de minimis 

in volume and value and have been verified by the Department as sample sales outside the ordinary course of trade. Koyo
characterizes Timken's suggestion that Koyo be required to submit an entire new computer tape of the home-market
sales, including these sales, as ``ridiculous'' and contrary to Timken's own stated desire not to ``increase the
cost of bringing this proceeding to a final conclusion.'' 


Department's Position: 

In our October 1993 supplemental questionnaire we requested that Koyo submit a listing of its home-market sample
sales. In response to our supplemental questionnaire Koyo submitted a hard copy computer printout of its home-market
sample sales (November 1, 1993, Exhibit 1). At verification we confirmed the accuracy of the nature of these sales
(

i.e., 

samples) and the value and volume reported. We determined that the volume and value of these sales were indeed minuscule
and the fact that we did not have them electronically could not have any measurable or significant impact on our ability
to conduct these administrative reviews. We are confident that the home-market data base we used for comparison purposes
was indeed sufficient and complete. Requiring a computer tape of the home-market sample sales would be, in this instance,
superfluous and unnecessarily time-consuming. 


Comment 39: 

Timken notes that the Department relied upon the revised data submitted by Koyo in 1991 for its analysis and did not
consider other information contained in the administrative record. In view of Koyo's decision to revise its data,
Timken asserts that the Department should draw adverse inferences in any instance where data are deficient or missing.
According to Timken, the Department's failure to draw any adverse inference based on the omission of various data
(

e.g., 

home-market sample sales, some variable costs) allowed Koyo to control in part the Department's calculation of margins.

Koyo asserts that it is absurd for Timken to suggest that Koyo's co-operation in the resubmission of its data for the
1979 through 1986 PORs should be used against Koyo, when Koyo is in no way responsible for the delays in this proceeding.
Koyo states that the CIT made it clear that respondents must not be prejudiced by the government's undue delays in the
completion of administrative reviews, and, similarly, respondents cannot be punished for intervening changes
in the Department's antidumping methodologies (

Koyo Seiko

). 
Koyo also objects to Timken's conclusion that Koyo's cost data should be rejected in their entirety. In Koyo's opinion
the Department should not even conduct a below-cost investigation (see Comment 30). However, should the Department
do so, Koyo states that the Department has had several years in which to request supplemental cost data or other germane
information, and the Department cannot now decide that Koyo's data are inadequate without unduly and illegally prejudicing
Koyo's rights in these proceedings. 


Department's Position: 

We disagree with Timken's contention that we should draw the most adverse inferences in applying BIA to Koyo's revised
submission where data are deficient or missing. The Department agreed to accept a consolidated response from Koyo
to facilitate and expedite the completion of these administrative reviews. We verified Koyo's consolidated response
and found that, for the most part, Koyo's data were reasonable and accurate (see 

Verification Report, 

November 22, 1993, and Comment 31 regarding the adequacy of Koyo's cost data). We used BIA when we did not agree with
Koyo's methodology in calculating an expense, or when data were missing from the submission. Therefore, we do not
believe that we allowed Koyo to control the calculation of the margins in any way. 


Comments Regarding Clerical and Ministerial Errors 




Comment 40: 

Both Timken and Koyo addressed the following clerical errors: 
1. The preliminary program erroneously sets the VCOM and other variables equal to zero (see Comment 45). 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941110-2-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941110-2-00009 </PARENT>

2. The denominator for recalculating the home-market credit expense in 1979/80 must be added to the program. 
3. The ratio of inventory carrying costs to total U.S. sales for the 1980/81 POR should be multiplied by the landed cost,
consistent with the other PORs. 
4. The Department failed to adjust Koyo's reported home-market unit price for post-sale freight expense in calculating
FMV. However, Timken believes that no change is necessary because Koyo failed to report its freight expenses correctly
(see Comment 20). 
5. The Department should delete certain duplicate observations in the home-market database. 
6. Timken maintains and Koyo confirms that Koyo reported direct and indirect selling expenses, G&A expense,
and interest expense as a percentage of COM, not fixed amounts per unit as interpreted by the Department. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Koyo and Timken and have made each of these changes in the calculations for these final results of review.



Comment 41: 

Timken states that the Department inadvertently reversed signs in its preliminary program for Koyo by applying the
20-percent BIA rate for models with no reported home-market VCOM. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken and have corrected the program for these final results. 


Comment 42: 

Timken asserts that the Department must ensure that selling-expense adjustments to CV are consistent in all respects
with price-based adjustments. Timken contends that not all of the expenses, originally reported as direct selling
expenses, were ultimately considered direct by the Department (

e.g., 

freight, discounts). 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Timken's assertion that deducting the expenses reported as ``direct'' selling expenses in Koyo's CV
database was incorrect. For these final results we have not used this variable in our CV calculation because it represented
commission and rebate expenses, both of which we did not treat as direct selling expenses for Koyo in these final results
(see our responses to Comments 11 and 23, respectively). Therefore, the only valid direct deduction from CV is the
weighted-average credit expense for home market sales from the sales database for each POR. 


Comment 43: 

Koyo maintains that the Department's constant practice in its TRB determinations has been to break ties between two
equally similar matches by first comparing the sum of the deviations for the two models, then comparing the levels
of trade for the two models, then comparing the cost deviations for the two models, and finally by ranking the two models
alphanumerically. According to Koyo, the Department inadvertently omitted the level-of-trade (LOT) tie-breaker
in conducting the model match for these PORs. Koyo notes that this is not the same issue regarding LOTs that Koyo has
raised unsuccessfully in previous reviews_that the Department should not cross levels of trade in comparing identical
models before looking for similar models at the same level of trade. 
Timken agrees, stating that where two matches with equivalent ``sums of the deviations'' are found, each at a different
LOT, the Department should select the match at the same level of trade. 


Department's Position: 

Koyo's statement that we have consistently selected the best model match based on, in order, ``sum of the deviations,''
LOT, and cost differences in all of its recent TRB determinations, is correct in the context of our computer programs
for some previous reviews of this finding and the 1987 order of Koyo's U.S. sales of TRBs. However, in those previously
completed reviews, the Department's stated methodology was to rank similar merchandise by minimizing first the
``sum of the deviations'', second, the difference in the VCOM of the U.S. and similar home-market product, third,
the differences in LOT, and lastly, alphanumerically. When the ``sum of the deviations'' was the same for two or more
bearings, the Department ranked them according to the similarity in costs, and, if the costs were the same, according
to the similarity in LOT (

TRBs I, 

57 FR 4978 (February 11, 1992)). In our computer programs for these administrative reviews, we have followed this
methodology, ranking similar bearings by ``sum of the deviations'', differences in cost, LOT, and, lastly, alphanumerically.



Comment 44: 

Koyo states that the load rating for some sales of one model was reported incorrectly on Koyo's submitted computer
tape. Although the cup and cone of each model should have the same basic load rating as the assembled model, in this instance
a computer input error on Koyo's part resulted in an inconsistency in reporting the load rating of the cup, cone, and
set. Koyo requests that the Department correct this error for these final results and cites 

AFBs III 

as precedent. 
Timken contends that the Department should make the requested correction only if the error is discernible based on
the evidence of record at the time the error was identified. Timken notes that the documents cited by Koyo that contain
corroborating evidence were all submitted in administrative reviews for periods other than 1979/86.

Department's Position: 

The load rating of individual bearings for the periods under review is available in any Koyo catalogue and, as such,
is part of the public domain. Therefore, we have made the appropriate corrections in the load rating of the model designated
by Koyo. 


Comment 45: 

Timken points out that the preliminary program erroneously sets certain home-market VCOMs equal to zero. Timken
states that for certain set-split bearings only VCOM is zero. For others the VCOM, net unit price, and indirect selling
expenses are zero, resulting in erroneous calculations for FMV and the weighted-average home-market indirect selling
expenses. 
Timken notes that this problem has been discussed with Department personnel and revision of the program instructions
will apparently result in assignment of correct values. 
Koyo affirms Timken's observation, stating that the Department erred in its calculation of the cup and cone ratios
during the set-splitting exercise, resulting in the progressive reduction of the cup and cone ratio variables and,
consequently, the VCOM ratio. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Koyo and Timken. We inappropriately altered VCOM when we merged the home-market sales and cost data files
and split the home-market sales of TRB sets into sales of cups and cones. However, Koyo's explanation that the cup and
cone ratios are progressively reduced toward zero is wrong, as evidenced from the computation of the home-market
net unit prices and indirect selling expenses for sales of split sets. We have determined that the value for the VCOM
itself was reduced toward zero, and have corrected the calculations accordingly. 
We also found a similar error in the calculations where we split home-market sales of TRB sets with no reported cup or
cone ratios using the weighted-average of the reported cup and cone ratios as BIA for each POR. We have also corrected
this error. 


Comment 46: 

Timken believes that a discrepancy in the U.S. sales values reported by Koyo and those analyzed by the Department in
its preliminary results signifies that the Department either dropped some U.S. sales from the database or it perhaps
dropped sales that lacked data. 
Koyo claims that Timken is comparing apples to oranges. The U.S. sales numbers from the Department's analysis memorandum
appear to represent net USP figures, whereas the figures cited from Koyo's 1991 submission are gross figures. Koyo
adds that it has found no discrepancies in the value of U.S. sales used by the Department. 


Department's Position: 

We agree with Koyo. It is impossible to arrive at any definitive conclusion by comparing Koyo's gross sales figures
to the net sales figures calculated by the Department. We are satisfied that we used all of Koyo's reported U.S. sales
in our analysis. 


Comment 47: 

Timken maintains that in analyzing Koyo's transactions, the Department failed to make any adjustment to USP, FMV,
or CV for packing expenses. In addition, Timken states that, if it is not practical to apply packing expenses on a LOT
basis, we should apply the higher value to all sales. 
Koyo states that the Department deducted home-market packing from FMV, but that the Department failed to adjust FMV
for U.S. packing. Both Timken and Koyo urge the Department to adjust for packing in accordance with its normal practice.



Department's Position: 

We agree with Koyo that we inadvertently failed to add U.S packing expenses to FMV and CV. For these final results we
have made this correction pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56 and 353.50. 


Comment 48: 

NSK notes that it inadvertently included in 
its U.S. sales listing certain U.S. sales of TRBs over four inches in outside diameter (

i.e.

, outside the scope of the finding). NSK contends that it advised the Department of this oversight in a timely manner,
and points out that the Department nonetheless included these sales in its analysis. 
NSK notes further that a reported 1986 sale of a U.S. bearing which lacked a part number and had an unusually high price
in fact corresponded to the sale of a four-row cylindrical roller bearing. NSK claims that cylindrical roller bearings
are outside the scope of the finding and, thus, the Department should exclude this U.S. sale from its analysis. 
Timken agrees with NSK that the above-cited models are 
out-of-scope merchandise and should not be included in the Department's analysis. 


Department's Position: 

We agree. We have excluded all U.S. sales of bearings over four inches in diameter, as well as the one U.S. sale of cylindrical
roller bearings, from our analysis. 


Comment 49: 

NSK and Timken point out that the Department incorrectly treated certain U.S. expenses (warehousing, inventory
carrying costs, duty, and inland freight) as factors, rather than as actual amounts. Both parties agree that NSK reported
these expenses as actual amounts, 

e.g.

, an expense of ``.25'' should be read as twenty-five cents rather than twenty-five percent. 


Department's Position: 

We agree. We inadvertently treated the reported expenses as factors rather than as actual amounts. We have made the
appropriate correction to the computer program for these final results of review. 


Comment 50: 

NSK contends it reported certain export expenses (ocean freight, export, insurance, SG&A) as a percentage of
C.I.F. price, and that the Department incorrectly treated these expenses as a percentage of reported unit price.
NSK argues that the Department should only apply these factors to unit price where NSK has not reported a C.I.F. price.

Timken agrees with NSK's position, and emphasizes that expenses reported by NSK as a percentage of C.I.F. price should
be applied to unit price where a C.I.F. price has not been reported. 


Department's Position: 

We agree. We have made the appropriate correction to our calculations for these final results of review. We have applied
expenses, which NSK reported as a percentage of C.I.F. price, to unit price where NSK did not report a C.I.F. price.



Comment 51: 

Timken contends and NSK agrees that in adjusting NSK's CV for direct and indirect selling expenses, the Department
reversed the relevant variables in its computer program. 


Department's Position: 

We agree and have made the necessary corrections for these final results. 


Comment 52: 

Timken notes that the CV calculations for NSK do not include export packing expenses. Timken argues that the CV 
calculation, in accordance with the statute, must include export packing expenses. Timken also contends that ``palletizing''
expenses should be included as packing expenses. 
NSK agrees with Timken's observations. 


Department's Position: 

We agree that CV must include export packing expenses pursuant to section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We have therefore
added NSK's export packing expenses, which were reported as a percentage of ``processing cost'', as well as palletizing
expenses, to CV. In addition, we note that in our preliminary results we did not add NSK's U.S. packing expenses to FMV
for price-to-price comparisons, but we have corrected this for these final results. 


Toyota Correction 


Although no parties submitted comments regarding the preliminary results for Toyota, we discovered a programming
error in our preliminary calculations for Toyota that resulted in the exclusion of all PP sales from the preliminary
weighted-average margin calculation. For these final results we have corrected this error by incorporating all
sales in our final weighted-average margin calculation for Toyota.

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of these
administrative reviews, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act:
(1) All exports of subject merchandise by firms covered in these reviews will be subject to cash deposit rates as follows:

a. for Koyo, NSK, and Nachi-Fujikoshi, see the final results of the 1991/92 review (58 FR 64720, December 9, 1993);

b. for Toyota, see the final results of the 1986/87 review (55 FR 38720, September 20, 1990);

c. for those firms that have not been covered in reviews of later periods, the cash deposit rates will be those rates
established in the final results of the 1985/86 review, as outlined above;

(2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed in this notice and not reviewed in subsequent periods,
the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period;

(3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the
manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer
of the merchandise; and

(4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review conducted by the Department,
the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others'' rate. The ``all others'' rate is the ``new shipper'' rate established
in the first review conducted by the Department in which a ``new shipper'' rate was established, as discussed below.

On May 25, 1993, the CIT, in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States

, 822 F.Supp. 766 (1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States

, 839 F.Supp. 864 (1993) decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders.

In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the
Treasury LTFV investigation, we have determined that it is appropriate to adopt the first ``new shipper'' rate established
in the final results of an administrative review of this finding published by the Department (or that rate as amended
for correction of clerical errors as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of establishing
cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews.

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate
from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the ``all others'' rate for the purpose of these reviews is 18.07 percent from


Tapered Roller Bearings and Certain Components Thereof from Japan, Final Results of Administrative Review of Antidumping
Finding

, 49 FR 8976 (March 9, 1984), the first review conducted by the Department in which a ``new shipper'' rate was established.

This notice serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR  353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review
periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19
CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion to judicial protective
order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation.

These administrative reviews and this notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C.
1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22(c).

<DOCTITLE>Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Antidumping
Duty Investigation of Stainless Steel Angle From Japan </DOCTITLE>


Agency: 

Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.

On November 2, 1994, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), the respondent requested that, in the event of an affirmative
preliminary determination, the Department postpone the final determination due to the complexity of the cost information,
and the problems associated with scheduling verification because of the year-end holidays. 


Scope of Investigation 


For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless steel angle'' includes hot-rolled, whether or not annealed
or descaled, stainless steel products angled at 90 degrees, that are not otherwise advanced. 
The stainless steel angle subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.40.30.20
and 7222.40.30.60 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings
are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is
dispositive. 


Period of Investigation 


The period of investigation (POI) is November 1, 1993, through April 30, 1994. 


Such or Similar Comparisons 


For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have determined that stainless steel angle constitutes a single
``such or similar'' category of merchandise. 
The respondent reported that there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market during the POI. Because
there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise
comparisons on the basis of: (1) stainless steel grade; (2) leg-length; 
(3) thickness; (4) spine length; and (5) other characteristics. The Department used Aichi's reported costs to adjust
for physical differences in merchandise. 


Fair Value Comparisons 


To determine whether sales of stainless steel angle from Japan to the United States were made at less than fair value,
we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. When comparing the U.S. sales to sales of similar merchandise
in the home market, we made adjustments for differences in physical characteristics, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.57. In
accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible. 


United States Price 


We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to an unrelated purchaser before importation into the United States and because exporter's sales price methodology
was not otherwise indicated. 
We made deductions from the U.S. sales price, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, foreign inland freight,
and insurance. 
We recalculated U.S. credit expense based on Aichi's lending rate to its customers as opposed to Aichi's investment
return rate. 
We made an adjustment to U.S. price for a consumption tax levied on comparison sales in Japan in accordance with our
practice, pursuant to the decision of the Court of International Trade (CIT) in 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company 

v. 

United States, 

834 F. Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). See Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Color Negative Photographic Paper
and Chemical Components from Japan (59 FR 16177, 16179, April 6, 1994), for an explanation of this methodology. 


Foreign Market Value 


We compared the volume of home market sales of SSA to the volume of third-country sales to determine whether there was
a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, in accordance with section
773 (a)(1)(B) of the Act. We found that the home market was viable for sales of stainless steel angle, in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.48(a). 
We excluded from our analysis those sales in the home market database with negative quantities or negative sales prices.

We used the Department's arm's-length test to determine whether sales to related customers were made on an arm's-length
basis. Where possible, we compared related and unrelated party sales at the same level of trade. For purposes of the
preliminary determination, we considered a party as related to respondent whenever respondent had substantial
ownership in the party. See Appendix II to the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina (58 FR 37077, July 9, 1993) for more information on the Department's arm's-length
test. 
In the home market, Aichi sells SSAs through several distribution channels. Where Aichi sold SSAs through its subsidiary,
that subsidiary's sales to unrelated parties formed the basis of our FMV calculation. Only a minuscule proportion
of Aichi's sales were made to related parties, either directly, or through its subsidiary. We only included sales
to the related parties that were made at arm's length. We also excluded certain related party sales from our analysis
because those products could not be compared to unrelated sales and because these were made in insignificant quantities.

We calculated FMV based on delivered prices. We made deductions for discounts and rebates, where applicable. 
In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States

, 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we will adjust for those expenses under the
circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted
post-sale home market inland freight and insurance from FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a).

For one expense claimed as a rebate by Aichi, we preliminarily determined that the expense was, in fact, a transfer
of funds from the parent to its subsidiary. This rebate was not passed on to the unrelated purchaser. Consequently,
we did not make any adjustments to FMV for this claimed rebate. 
We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.
We also made circumstance of sale adjustments for home market direct selling expenses, which included credit, in
accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We reclassified pre-sale warehousing expenses as indirect selling expenses.

We adjusted for the consumption tax in accordance with our practice (see ``United States Price'' section of this notice).



Cost of Production (COP) 


In order to determine whether home market sales prices were below COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act,
we calculated COP based on the sum of the respondent's cost of materials, fabrication, general, and packing expenses,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.51(c). (See e.g., Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review:
Polyethylene Terrephthalate Film, Sheet, and Strip from the Republic of Korea (59 FR 35098, 35099, July 8, 1994).
We then compared the COP to the home market selling prices, net of movement charges and discounts and rebates.

<PARENT> FR941110-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In accordance with Section 773(b) of the Act, we followed our standard methodology to determine whether the home market
sales of each product were made at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period of time,
and whether such sales were made at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time
in the normal course of trade. 

To satisfy the requirement of 773(b)(1) that below-cost sales be disregarded only if made in substantial quantities,
we applied the following methodology. Where we found that over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product
were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that respondent's below-cost
sales are not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product
were at prices above the COP, we disregarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where
we found that more than 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP and were sold
over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that model and calculated FMV based on constructed value
(CV), in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. 

In accordance with section 773(b)(1) of the Act, in order to determine whether below-cost sales had been made over
an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which below-cost sales occurred for each product to
the number of months in the POI in which that product was sold. If a product was sold in three or more months of the POI,
we did not exclude below-cost sales unless there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POI. When
we found that sales of a product only occurred in one or two months, the number of months in which the sales occurred constituted
the extended period of time; 

i.e., 

where sales of a product were made in only two months, the extended period of time was two months, where sales of a product
were made in only one month, the extended period of time was one month. (See, Preliminary Results and Partial Termination
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews: Tapered Roller Bearings, Four Inches or Less in Outside Diameter, and
Components Thereof, From Japan (58 FR 69336, 69338, December 10, 1993). 



Constructed Value (CV) 



We calculated constructed value based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, profit,
and U.S. packing cost. In accordance with section 773 (e)(1)(B) of the Act, for general expenses, which include selling
and financial expenses (SG&A), we used the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum
of ten percent of the cost of production. For profit, we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of manufacturing
and general expenses, because Aichi's reported profit was less than eight percent of the total of cost of manufacturing
and general expenses. 



Currency Conversion 



We have made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates, certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales. 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of stainless steel angle from Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice,
that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in
the 

Federal Register

. 

The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin,
as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. 



 


ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. 

If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring,
or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination. 



Postponement of Final Determination 



On November 1, 1994, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondent requested that, in the event of an affirmative
preliminary determination by the Department, the Department postpone the final determination due to the complexity
of the cost information and problems associated with scheduling verifications with the year-end holidays. We find
no compelling reason to deny the request. Accordingly, we are postponing the date of the final determination until
not later than 135 days after the date of publication of this notice. 



Public Comment 



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies may be submitted by any
interested party to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than February 10, 1995, and rebuttal
briefs no later than February 17, 1995. We request that parties in this case provide an executive summary of no more
than 2 pages in conjunction with case briefs on the major issues to be addressed. Further, briefs should contain a table
of authorities. Citations to Commerce determinations and court decisions should include the page number where cited
information appears. In preparing the briefs, please begin each issue on a separate page. In accordance with 19 CFR
353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments
raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on February 23, 1995, at 9 a.m. at the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20230. Parties should confirm the
time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time. 

Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice
in the 

Federal Register

. Requests should contain: (1) the party's name, address, telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and (3)
a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to the
issues raised in the briefs. 

This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)) and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On March 29, 1994, Credisa Division Textil, S.A. (Credisa), a producer and exporter of the subject merchandise, requested
a company-specific administrative review of the countervailing duty order on certain textile mill products from
Peru for the period May 18, 1992, through December 31, 1993, pursuant to 19 CFR 355.22(a)(2). No other interested party
requested a review. On April 15, 1994, the Department published a notice initiating the company-specific administrative
review for that period (59 FR 18099). On September 28, 1994, Credisa withdrew its request for review. 



Section 355.22(a)(3) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 355.22(a)(3)) stipulates that the Secretary may permit
a party that requests a review to withdraw the request not later than 90 days after the date of publication of the notice
of initiation of the requested review. This regulation also provides that the Secretary may extend the time limit
for withdrawal of a request if it is reasonable to do so. 



Because no significant work has been done on this review, Credisa's request does not unduly burden the Department
under the circumstances presented in this review, we are waiving the 90-day requirement in 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3). Accordingly,
we are terminating this review. 

This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3).

ACTION:

 Notice of Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty 
Administrative Review.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty order
on ceramic tile from Mexico. The review period is 
January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. We preliminarily determine the total bounty or grant to be zero or 

de minimis

 for 32 companies, and 2.55 percent 

ad valorem

 for all other companies during this review period. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.5 percent 

ad valorem

 is 

de minimis

. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On April 28, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (58 FR 25802)
of the countervailing duty order on ceramic tile from Mexico. We received a request for review from Ceramica Regiomontana,
S.A., (Ceramica) a Mexican exporter of the subject merchandise. We initiated the review on June 25, 1993 (58 FR 34414).
The review period is January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. This review involves 33 companies and 10 programs.

On February 7, 1994, the Government of Mexico submitted a request for partial revocation for 14 companies with their
questionnaire response. According to 19 CFR 355.25(b)(3), a request for revocation can only be submitted in the fifth
and subsequent anniversary months of an order. Since the anniversary month for the review period January 1, 1992 through

December 31, 1992 is May 1993, and the request was submitted on February 7, 1994, the request was untimely. Therefore,
the Department is unable to consider partial revocation for these 14 companies in this administrative review. 



The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended.
The final results of the last administrative review of this order were published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2823). 


Scope of Review 


Imports covered by this review are shipments of Mexican ceramic tile, including non-mosaic, glazed, and unglazed
ceramic floor and wall tile. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS) item numbers 6907.10.0000, 6907.90.0000, 6908.10.0000, and 6908.90.0000. The HTS item numbers are provided
for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 


Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes 


In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in the preamble
to 
19 CFR 355.20(d) (53 FR 52306, and 52325; December 27, 1988). We calculated a country-wide rate, weight-averaging
the benefits received by the 33 companies subject to review to determine the overall subsidy from all programs benefitting
exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. In weight-averaging the benefits, we used each firm's share
of exports to the United States as weights. 
Because the overall weighted-average country-wide rate was above 

de minimis

, as defined by 19 CFR 355.7, we proceeded to the next step in our analysis and examined the 

ad valorem

 rate we had calculated for each company for all programs combined, to determine whether individual company rates
differed significantly from the weighted-average country-wide rate. Thirty-two companies received aggregate
benefits which were zero or 

de minimis

 (significantly different within the meaning of 
19 CFR 355.22(d)(3)(ii)). Therefore, these companies were treated separately for assessment and cash deposit purposes.

Ceramica's rate was not significantly different from the weighted-average country-wide rate. Since Ceramica was
the only company receiving subsidies greater than 

de minimis

, the all other rate was calculated based on the unweighted aggregate benefits that Ceramic received from all countervailing
programs. 


Analysis of Programs 


(1) BANCOMEXT Financing for Exporters 


Effective January 1, 1990, the Mexican Treasury Department eliminated the Fondo para el Fomento de las Exportaciones
de Productos Manufacturados (FOMEX) loan program and transferred the FOMEX trust to the Banco Nacional de Comercio
Exterior, S.N.C. (BANCOMEXT). BANCOMEXT offers short-term financing to producers or trading companies engaged
in export activities; any company generating foreign currency through exports is eligible for financing under this
program. The BANCOMEXT program operates much like its predecessor, FOMEX. BANCOMEXT provides two types of financing,
both in U.S. dollars, to exporters: working capital loans (pre-export loans), and loans for export sales (export
loans). In addition, BANCOMEXT may provide financing to foreign buyers of Mexican goods and services.

The Department has previously found this program to confer an export subsidy to the extent that the loans are provided
at preferential terms (

See Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Review

 (57 FR 5997; February 19, 1992) and 

Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Review

 (57 FR 24247; June 8, 1992)). In this review the Government of Mexico provided no new information or evidence of changed
circumstances that would lead the Department to alter that determination. 

We found that the annual interest rates that BANCOMEXT charged to borrowers for certain loans on which interest payments
were due during the review period were lower than commercial rates. The BANCOMEXT dollar-denominated loans under
review were granted at annual interest rates ranging from 7.1 percent to 9.8 percent. As discussed in 

Certain Steel Products from Mexico; Final Countervailing Duty Determination

 (58 FR 37357; 
July 9, 1993), because loans are funded by BANCOMEXT through commercial banks in dollars and indexed to dollars for
repayment, we used a dollar benchmark. As the benchmark for BANCOMEXT pre-export and export dollar-denominated
loans granted in 1992, we used the average of the quarterly weighted-average effective interest rates published
in the 

Federal Reserve Bulletin,

 which resulted in an annual benchmark of 7.18 percent in 1992. 

We consider the benefits from short-term loans to occur at the time the interest is paid. Because interest on BANCOMEXT
pre-export loans is paid at maturity, we calculated benefits based on loans that matured during the review period;
these were obtained between March 1992 and May 1992. Interest on BANCOMEXT export loans is paid in advance; we therefore
calculated benefits based on BANCOMEXT loans received during the review period. 

Two exporters of ceramic tile products used BANCOMEXT pre-export and export financing. Because we found that the
exporters were able to tie their BANCOMEXT loans to specific sales, we measured the benefit only from the BANCOMEXT
loans tied to sales of the subject merchandise to the United States. To determine the benefit for each exporter, we
multiplied the difference between the interest rate charged to exporters for these loans and the benchmark interest
rate by the outstanding principal and then multiplied this amount by the term of the loan divided by 365. Because one
company's monthly sales figures are indexed to account for inflation, we adjusted that company's benefit amounts
to be on the same terms as the sales figures. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program
to be 0.01 percent 

ad valorem

 for Internacional de Ceramica and zero for all other companies listed in the preliminary results of review section
of this notice. 



(2) PITEX 



The Program for Temporary Importation of Products used in the Production of Exports (PITEX) was established by a decree
published in the 

Diario Oficial

 on May 9, 1985, and amended in the 

Diario Oficial

 on September 19, 1986, and May 3, 1990. The program is jointly administered by the Ministry of Commerce and Industrial
Development (SECOFI) and the Customs Administration. Under PITEX, exporters with a proven export record may receive
authorization to temporarily import products to be used in the production of exports for up to five years without having
to pay the import duties normally imposed on those imports. PITEX allows for the exemption of import duties for the
following categories of merchandise used in export production: raw materials, packing materials, fuels and lubricants,
machinery used to manufacture products for export, and spare parts and other machinery. The importer must post a bond
or other security to guarantee the reexportation of the temporary imports. Because it is only available to exporters,
the Department previously found in 

Certain Textile Mill Products From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review

 (56 FR 50859; October 9, 1991) and 

Ceramic Tile From Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review

 (57 FR 24247; 
June 8, 1992) that PITEX provides countervailable benefits to the extent that it provides duty exemptions on imports
of merchandise not physically incorporated into exported products. The Government of Mexico provided no new information
or evidence of changed circumstances that would lead the Department to alter that determination. 

During the review period, Ceramica used the PITEX program for imports of machinery and spare parts which are not physically
incorporated into exported products. To calculate the benefit from this program, we calculated the duties that should
have been paid on the non-physically incorporated items that were imported under the PITEX program during the review
period. We then divided that amount by the company's total exports. On this basis, we preliminarily determine the
benefit from this program to be zero for the 32 companies listed in the preliminary results of review section of this
notice and 2.55 percent 

ad valorem

 for all other companies. 



(3) Other Programs 



We also examined the following programs and preliminarily determine that exporters of the subject merchandise did
not use them during the review period: 

(A) Other BANCOMEXT preferential financing; 
(B) Other Dollar-Denominated Financing Programs; 
(C) Fiscal Promotion Certificates (CEPROFI); 
(D) Import duty reductions and exemptions; 
(E) State tax incentives; 
(F) Article 15 Loans; 
(G) NAFINSA FONEI-type financing; and 
(H) NAFINSA FOGAIN-type financing.

Preliminary Results of Review 



We preliminarily determine that the following 32 companies received zero or 

de minimis

 benefits during the 1992 review period. In accordance with 19 CFR 355.7, any rate less than 0.5 percent 

ad valorem

 is 

de minimis.

the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, shipments of this merchandise from Mexico
exported by the 32 companies listed above for the period on or after January 1, 1992, and on or before December 31, 1992,
and to assess countervailing duties of 2.55 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price of shipments from all other companies
for the same period.

Notice of Intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Army proposes to prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for changes to the operation
and ongoing mission of the U.S. Army Aviation Center and Fort Rucker, Alabama. The DEIS will identify and evaluate
the environmental, social, and economic aspects of the installation operation, master planned component plans
and their alternatives for the proposed changes to the ongoing mission and training activities of the USAAC and Fort
Rucker. Alternatives to be evaluated include:



a. No action. Installation ongoing operations, development and training would continue at current levels.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Public Law 101-510, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, the 1991 Defense
Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended the closure of Sacramento Army Depot and transfer of depot missions
to other installations/agencies. Maintenance missions would be competed to determine location of transfer. In
accordance with the Act, the Secretary of Defense must implement all recommendations for closure or realignment.
The FEIS focuses on the environmental and socioeconomic impacts and mitigations associated with the disposal and
reuse of Sacramento Army Depot.


No long-term adverse ecological or environmental health effects are expected due to this action. The increase in
population anticipated by the reuse and disposal activities is expected to have a net positive impact on the local
economy. The preferred alternative, prepared with the cooperation of the local community, is not expected to significantly
impact environmental resources.

<USBUREAU>Department of the Navy</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice of Public Hearing for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal and Redevelopment of Naval Base
Charleston, North Charleston, South Carolina </DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), implementing procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Department of the Navy has prepared and filed with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the disposal and subsequent
redevelopment of the Naval Base Charleston, North Charleston, South Carolina. 

In response to the recommendations of the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission and to legislative
requirements in the 1990 Base Closure and Realignment Act (BCRA) (Pub. L. 101-510), Naval Base Charleston is
to be closed. Activities included in the closure are the Naval Station, the Naval Shipyard, the Fleet Industrial Support
Center, the Fleet and Mine Warfare Training Center, the Submarine Training Facility, and the Naval Reserve Center.


Naval Base Charleston is located in the City of North Charleston approximately five miles north of the City of Charleston.
The Base encompasses approximately 1,575 acres of land along the Cooper River and includes about 2.3 million square
feet of industrial space, l.8 million square feet of warehouse space, 2.2 million square feet of administrative space,
86 residences, 19 barracks, 152 marina slips, 23 piers, 5 dry-dock facilities, and a wide range of recreational facilities.


The proposed action addressed in the DEIS is the disposal and subsequent redevelopment of lands/facilities determined
surplus to the needs of the federal government. A Charleston Naval Complex Reuse Plan was prepared by the Building
Economic Solutions Together (BEST) Committee, which included representation of over 40 local groups and organizations
from throughout the region. This plan, which identifies a preferred development plan, was approved by both the BEST
Committee and the recently created Charleston Naval Base Redevelopment Authority. The DEIS has been prepared to
address the environmental consequences of the implementation of this comprehensive reuse plan. 

In the preparation of the Redevelopment Plan, consideration was given to the possible reuse of the Base by other federal,
state, and local agencies, homeless support organizations, business interests (i.e., privatization of the Shipyard),
and recreational users. Various reuse scenarios were developed by BEST, and a preferred reuse plan was identified
and approved following public review and evaluation. The Preferred Alternative evaluated in the DEIS is the Preferred
Development Plan as approved by BEST and the Redevelopment Authority. 

The Preferred Redevelopment Plan identifies areas of the Naval Base for use as a Cargo Terminal, Intermodal Rail Yard,
Marine Industrial Park, recreational areas, cultural park warehouse space and open space/stormwater management.
The Shipyard is to be privatized for continued use as a shipyard. The preferred plan also provides facilities for local/regional
homeless service agencies including residential, training, and administrative uses. The plan also provides for
use of lands/facilities for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), the Defense Finance Accounting
Service (DFAS), and interim use of facilities by the Navy. 

In response to environmental concerns and the current unavailability of information from ongoing Installation
Restoration efforts, a Contingent Redevelopment Plan is being considered as part of the Preferred Alternative.
The Contingent Redevelopment Plan includes all the same components as the Preferred Development Plan and will result
in similar beneficial economic impacts, but will avoid restoration sites if necessary. The DEIS also addresses potential
impacts to community services, traffic, air quality, water quality, vegetation and wildlife, cultural resources,
noise and land use. 

The DEIS has been distributed to various federal, state, and local government agencies and elected officials, special
interest groups, libraries and the media. A limited number of single copies are available at the address listed at
the end of this notice. 


The Department of the Navy will hold two public hearings to inform the public of the DEIS findings and to solicit comments.
One hearing will be held from 7:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on Monday, November 28, 1994, at the Chicora Neighborhood Center,
North Charleston. The second hearing will be held from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM on Tuesday, November 29, 1994, at the North
Charleston City Hall. Public hearing times will be as scheduled or until the conclusion of public comments. The hearings
will be conducted by the Navy. Federal, state, and local agencies and interested parties are invited and urged to attend
or be represented at the hearings. Oral statements will be heard and transcribed by a stenographer, however, to assure
the accuracy of the record, all statements should be submitted in writing. All statements, both oral and written,
will become part of the public record. Equal weight will be given to both oral and written comments. 


In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit remarks to five minutes. Longer statements should
be summarized at the public hearing and submitted in writing either at the hearing or mailed to the address listed at
the end of this announcement. All written statements must be postmarked by Monday, December 12, 1994 to become part
of the official record. 


Additional information concerning this notice may be obtained by contacting Mr. William Sloger, PE (Code 203WS),
Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, 2155 Eagle Drive, North Charleston, South Carolina,
29419-9010, telephone (803) 743-0797.

<DOCTITLE>Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products; Granting of the Application for Interim Waiver and Publishing
of the Petition for Waiver of DOE Furnace Test Procedures From York International; Case No. F-077 </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's notice publishes a letter granting an Interim Waiver to York International (York) from the existing Department
of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for the company's P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces.



Today's notice also publishes a ``Petition for Waiver'' from York. York's Petition for Waiver requests DOE to grant
relief from the DOE furnace test procedure relating to the blower time delay specification. York seeks to test using
a blower delay time of 30 seconds for its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces instead of the specified 1.5-minute
delay between burner on-time and blower on-time. The Department is soliciting comments, data, and information respecting
the Petition for Waiver.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products (other than automobiles) was established pursuant to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy
Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National Appliance Energy Conservation
Act of 1987 (NAECA), Public Law 100-12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA
1988), Public Law 100-357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), Public Law 102 486, 106 Stat. 2776, which
requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products,
including furnaces. The intent of the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that
will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.



The Department amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the
waiver process. 45 FR 64108. Thereafter, DOE further amended the appliance test procedure waiver process to allow
the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary) to grant an Interim Waiver
from test procedure requirements to manufacturers that have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures.
51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986. 
The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary to waive temporarily, test procedures for a particular basic model
when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing according
to the prescribed test procedures, or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate the basic model in a manner
so unrepresentative of its true energy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers
generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective, resolving the problem that is
the subject of the waiver. 
The Interim Waiver provisions added by the 1986 amendment allow the Secretary to grant an Interim Waiver when it is
determined that the applicant will experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiver is denied,
if it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted, and/or the Assistant Secretary determines that
it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the Petition
for Waiver. An Interim Waiver remains in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE issues its determination on the
Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180 days, if necessary. 
On September 22, 1994, York filed an Application for Interim Waiver regarding blower time delay. York's Application
seeks an Interim Waiver from the DOE test provisions that require a 1.5-minute time delay between the ignition of the
burner and starting of the circulating air blower. Instead, York requests the allowance to test using a 30-second
blower time delay when testing its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces. York states that the 30-second delay
is indicative of how these furnaces actually operate. Such a delay results in an overall furnace AFUE improvement
of approximately 1.5 percent points. Since current DOE test procedures do not address this variable blower time delay,
York asks that the Interim Waiver be granted. 
The Department has published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on 
August 23, 1993, (58 FR 44583) to amend the furnace test procedure, which addresses the above issue.

it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.
In those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated based upon DOE having
granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated
for energy consumption on a comparable basis.
Therefore, based on the above, DOE is granting York an Interim Waiver for its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces.
Pursuant to paragraph (e) of Section 430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 430, the following letter granting
the Application for Interim Waiver to York was issued.
Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR Part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety.
The petition contains no confidential information. The Department solicits comments, data, and information respecting
the petition.

Subject: Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver.



Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27,
as amended 14 November 1986. Waiver is requested from the test procedures for measuring the Energy Consumption of
Furnaces found in Appendix N of Subpart B to Part 430, specifically the section requiring a 1.5 minute delay between
burner ignition and start-up of the circulating air blower.
York International requests a waiver from the specified 1.5 minute delay, and seeks authorization in its furnace
efficiency test procedures and calculations to utilize a fixed timing control that will energize the circulating
air blower 30 seconds after the gas valve opens. A control of this type with a fixed 30 second blower on-time will be utilized
in our P2LN and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces.
The current test procedure does not credit York for additional energy savings that occur when a shorter blower on-time
is utilized. Test data for these furnaces with a 30 second delay indicate that the overall furnace AFUE will increase
approximately 1.5 percentage points compared to the same furnace when tested with the 1.5 minute delay. Copies of
the confidential test data conforming these energy savings will be forwarded to you upon request.
York International is confident that this waiver will be granted, as similar waivers have been granted in the past
to Coleman Company, Magic Chef Company, Rheem Manufacturing, the Trane Company, Carrier Corporation, Lennox Industries,
Amana Refrigeration, Goodman Manufacturing Company and others.
Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application
for Interim Waiver.

Mr. Michael B. Eberlein, P.E., Engineering Manager_Furnace Products, Unitary Products Group, York International,

Dear Mr. Eberlein: This is in response to your September 22, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for
Waiver from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for York International (York)
P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces.

Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710,
January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December

57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992, and 59 FR 30575, June 14, 1994; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated
Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992, and 59 FR
46968, September 13, 1994; Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992, and 59 FR 30578, June 14, 1994;
and York International Corporation, 59 FR 46969, September 13, 1994. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for
Waiver will be granted for blower time delay.

York's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic
impact or competitive disadvantage York will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application.

However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon
DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested
and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.

Therefore, York's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing
furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted.

York shall be permitted to test its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified
in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below:

(i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph:

3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103-82 with the
exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures:

(ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows:

3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test
and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple
grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the
blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the
indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is
designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall
be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which
shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the
fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to
start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up
test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within 

#

0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft.

This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company.
This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the
application is incorrect.

The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever
is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Gas Transmission Corp., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



November 2, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Texas Gas Transmission Corporation 



[Docket No. CP95-36-000]



Take notice that on October 26, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky,
42302, filed in Docket No. CP95-36-000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
(NGA), requesting authority to abandon in place a purchase meter station and related pipeline located in Panola County,
Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open for public inspection.


Texas Gas asserts that the facilities proposed to be abandoned consist of a dual 12-inch purchase meter station known
as the Union Pacific PMS (``old'' Union Pacific PMS) and approximately 1,298 feet of related 20-inch pipeline, as
well as approximately 20 feet of 20-inch line installed in conjunction with the installation of a ``new'' Union Pacific
PMS, with all appurtenances, located at the Union Pacific Resources Company's East Texas Plant (East Texas Plant)
in Panola County, Texas. 

It is stated that Texas Gas proposes to transfer ownership to Union Pacific Resources Company (UPRC) the ``old'' Union
Pacific PMS, approximately 1,248 feet of the ``old'' 20-inch pipeline, and approximately 20 feet of ``new'' 20-inch
pipeline installed in conjunction with the construction of the ``new'' Union Pacific PMS. The remaining approximately
50 feet of ``old'' 20-inch pipeline located downstream of the ``new'' Union Pacific PMS will be abandoned in place,
but not transferred to UPRC. 

It is also stated that the facilities for which Texas Gas seeks abandonment approval are utilized to receive natural
gas purchased by Texas Gas or transported by Texas Gas from various producers located in the Carthage Area in Texas.
However, because the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS is located 

inside 

the East Texas Plant yard, Texas Gas states that operation of the facilities has become increasingly difficult. Therefore,
UPRC and Texas Gas agreed to ``relocate'' the Union Pacific PMS to an area outside the plant property downstream of
the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS. (The ``new'' Union Pacific PMS was constructed and installed pursuant to Section 157.208
of the Commission's regulations.) In the instant application, Texas Gas is requesting authority to: (1) Abandon
by transfer to UPRC the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS and all the related 20-inch pipeline located upstream of the ``new''
Union Pacific PMS, as well as a small portion of ``new'' 20-inch pipeline installed in conjunction with the ``new''
meter station; and (2) abandon in place a portion of the ``old'' 20-inch pipeline located downstream of the ``New''
Union Pacific PMS. Texas gas states that the relocation of these facilities will eliminate the operational problems
now existing at the location of the ``old'' Union Pacific PMS while continuing to allow Texas Gas to receive gas into
its system from the East Texas Plant. 

Comment date: November 23, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation



[Docket No. CP95-37-000]



Take notice that on October 26, 1994, pursuant to Section 7(c) and Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended (NGA)
and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Regulations (18 CFR Section 157.7), Columbia Gas Transmission
Corporation (Applicant), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, SE., P.O. Box 1273, Charleston, West Virginia 25325-1273,
filed an application for: (1) A certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing construction and operation
of certain natural gas facilities to provide firm transportation service under Rate Schedule FTS pursuant to Part
284 of the Commission's regulation for Panda-Brandywine, L.P. (Panda), a new firm service customer; and (2) an order
granting permission and approval to abandon an existing segment of natural gas transmission facilities to be replaced
to aid in providing the service to Panda; all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Specifically, Applicant states that Panda has requested up to 24,240 Dth/d of firm service under Rate Schedule FTS,
which will be used to supply natural gas to its Brandywine, Maryland cogeneration plant. Applicant states that the
proposed construction will consist of three segments: (a) The first segment's construction will be approximately
4.1 miles of 36-inch pipeline loop on Line WB in Hardy County, West Virginia; (b) the second segment's construction
will be approximately 1.6 miles of 36-inch pipeline designated as Line WB-5, which will replace by abandonment
approximately 1.5 miles of 26-inch pipeline in three sections designated as Line WB, Braxton County, West Virginia;
and (c) the third segment's construction will be approximately 0.6 miles of 36-inch pipeline loop on Line WB-5
in Clay County, West Virginia. 

Applicant estimates that the proposed facilities total cost will be $11,448,000. Applicant states that Panda has
agreed to make a contribution-in-aid of construction of up to $8,772,590, toward the actual cost of construction
of the proposed facilities, plus any gross-up for income taxes. Applicant claims that the remaining balance for construction
will be financed through funds generated from internal sources. Applicant states that the net book value of the 1.5
mile segment of Line WB, to be abandoned by replacement, is $727,000. Applicant estimates that the revenues associated
with its proposal are greater than the cost of service which results in a net benefit to Applicant and 
its customers. Finally, Applicant states that the proposed construction will aid in the development of a natural
gas-fired electric power generation in Washington, DC and a major portion of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties,
Maryland.

Title: Cooperative Agreements and Superfund State Contracts for Superfund Response Actions (OMB Control No. 2010-0020;
EPA ICR No. 1487.05).

Abstract: This is an extension of an existing collection of information to support the administrative requirements
set forth for cooperative agreements funded under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as ``Superfund''. CERCLA, as implemented at 40 CFR Part 35 Subpart O, sets forth
the pre-award, post-award, and after-the-grant requirements for receiving and managing a Superfund State contract
or Superfund cooperative agreement. The information is necessary to qualify grant/cooperative agreement applicants
for funding, monitor compliance of grant/cooperative agreement recipients with statutory and regulatory requirements,
perform cost recovery, and close-out awards.

Recipients must perform activities that include preparing and submitting: (1) standardized applications for funding;
(2) certifications; (3) technical performance, property inventory, procurement and financial reports; and (4)
other information necessary to support cost recovery and provide EPA with the status of activities under the grant/cooperative
agreement. Recipients must also develop and maintain records related to: (1) accounting and finances; (2) cost comparison
and user rate analysis, (3) property disposition and (4) health and safety plans, community relations plans, and
quality assurance plans.

The information is used by EPA project officers, grant specialists, and finance officials to manage/oversee clean-up
activities at Superfund sites. The information is also used to update the CERCLA information system (CERCLIS) which
tracks progress made at Superfund sites.

Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 9 hour per response
annually, including time for gathering information, completing and reviewing the collection of information, and
submitting the information to the EPA. Public recordkeeping is estimated to average 1 hour per recordkeeper annually,
including the time for preparing and maintaining records, plans and other information.

Respondents: Local, State and Indian tribe applicants for, and recipients of, Superfund grant/cooperative awards.

Estimated Number of Respondents: 1110.

Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent: 1.

Frequency of Collection: Quarterly and annually.

Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 9,990 hours.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to:

Office of Water



Title: National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Sewage Sludge Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
(OMB Control No. 2040-0004; EPA ICR No. 0229.09).

Abstract: This ICR extends the collection of information for the current monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping
requirements associated with Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), and other monitoring reports EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge System (NPDES) program. This ICR has incorporated the ICR for the ``Standards for the Use and
Disposal of Sewage Sludge at 40 CFR Part 503'' (OMB control no. 2040-0157) and recent OMB-approved amendments
for ``Storm Water Implementation'' (EPA ICR 229.07) and the ``State Sludge Management for NPDES/State Sludge Monitoring''
(EPA ICR 229.08). The information collected in support of these programs is authorized under Clean Water Act (CWA)
Section 308, 402 and 405, as promulgated at 40 CFR Parts 122 through 125, 40 CFR Part 501, and 40 CFR Part 503. The information
is necessary to ensure that permit holders comply with CWA mandates by fulfilling the terms and conditions of their
NPDES permits.


Respondents must perform activities that include (1) monitoring, sample collection and analysis of water samples;
and (2) reporting of monitoring results (DMRs, stormwater and sewage sludge monitoring reports, as appropriate)
to the permitting authority. In general, with the exception of certain sludge records that must be kept indefinitely,
respondents must maintain records for five years.

Reporting information received by the permitting authority is entered into the Permit Compliance System (PCS) national
computer database. The permitting authority will use the reporting information stored on PCS to assess permittee
compliance, modifying/and new permit requirements and revise effluent guidelines.

Burden Statement: Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 17 hours per
response, including time for reviewing the institutions, searching existing data sources, gathering the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the information. Public recordkeeping burden is estimated to average 19 hours per recordkeeper,
including time for gathering and maintaining monitoring data and other records, as appropriate.

Repondents: State NPDES permitting authorities, NPDES permittees (including local governments and businesses),
and domestic sewage treatment works and domestic septic haulers.

Estimated Number of Respondents: 123,277 respondents, 11,914 recordkeepers.

Estimated Number of Respondents Per Respondent: 9.

Frequency of Collection: Varies with respondent (Monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 17,947,910 reporting hours, 225,235 recordkeeping hours.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to:

An explanation of the ratings assigned to draft environmental impact statements (EISs) was published in FR dated
April 08, 1994 (59 FR 16807). 



Draft EISs 



ERP No. D-FHW-K40207-CA Rating LO, CA-41 Route Adoption of Alignment Project, between El
Paso Avenue and CA-145, Funding, Right-of-Way Acquisition and COE Section 404 Permit, Fresno and Madera Counties,
CA. 

Summary: EPA expressed a lack of objections with the draft EIS, it noted that the rating does not preclude EPA from having
future comments on site-specific environmental impacts and mitigation that may be identified or required during
the Tier II NEPA review. 

ERP No. DR-COE-K35035-CA Rating EO2, San Gabriel Canyon Sediment Management Plan, Dredging and
Disposal of Sediments, Revised Information, COE Section 404 Permit, Special Use Permit and Right-of-Entry Issuance,
Angeles National Forest, San Gabriel River, Los Angeles County, CA. 

Summary: EPA expressed environmental objections due to potential adverse impacts to riparian habitat, aquatic
biota, biodiversity and water quality. EPA recommended that upstream sediment management techniques and reservoir
operation be included to help avoid potential adverse impacts. 



Final EISs 



ERP No. F-COE-G30013-LA West Bank of the Mississippi River Hurricane Protection Plan, Implementation,
east of the Harvey Canal, New Orleans, LA. 

Summary: EPA had no objection to the proposed action. ERP No. F-FHW-G40129-AR US 67 Construction,

 Notice of Final Decision on Exemption Reissuance. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that a request for reissuance of an exemption to the land disposal restrictions under the 1984
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act has been granted to Chemical Waste
Management, Inc., for the Class I injection well located at Corpus Christi, Texas. As required by 40 CFR Part 148, the
company has adequately demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Environmental Protection Agency by petition and
supporting documentation that, to a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents
from the injection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. This final decision allows the underground injection
by Chemical Waste Management, Inc., of the specific restricted hazardous waste identified in the reissued petition,
into the Class I hazardous waste injection well at the Corpus Christi, Texas facility specifically identified in
the petition for as long as the basis for granting an approval of this petition remains valid, under provisions of 40
CFR 148.24. As required by 40 CFR 124.10, a public notice was issued on September 2, 1994. The public comment period
ended on October 17, 1994. EPA received no comments. This decision constitutes final Agency action and there is no
Administrative appeal.

<DOCTITLE>Reregistration Eligibility Decision Documents for Mevinphos, et. al.; Notice of Availability; Opportunity to

<AGENCY>

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of Reregistration Eligibility Decision documents; opportunity to comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice announces the availability of the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the active
ingredients Mevinphos (List A, case 0250), N6-Benzyladenine (List B, case 2040), and Periplanone B (List D, case
4115). This notice also announces a 60-day public comment period. The REDs for the chemicals listed above are the Agency's
formal regulatory assessments of the health and environmental data base of the subject chemicals and present the
Agency's determination regarding which pesticidal uses are eligible for reregistration. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency has issued Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents for the pesticidal active ingredients
listed above. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended in 1988, EPA is conducting
an accelerated reregistration program to reevaluate existing pesticides to make sure they meet current scientific
and regulatory standards. The data base to support the reregistration of each of the chemicals listed above is substantially
complete. EPA has determined that all currently registered products subject to reregistration containing these
active ingredients are eligible for reregistration. 


All registrants of products containing one or more of the above listed active ingredients have been sent the appropriate
RED documents and must respond to labeling requirements and product-specific data requirements (if applicable)
within 8 months of receipt. Products containing other active ingredients will not be reregistered until those other
active ingredients are determined to be eligible for reregistration. 
The reregistration program is being conducted under Congressionally mandated time frames, and EPA recognizes both
the need to make timely reregistration decisions and to involve the public. Therefore, EPA is issuing these REDs as
final documents with a 60-day comment period. Although the 60-day public comment period does not affect the registrant's
response due date, it is intended to provide an opportunity for public input and a mechanism for initiating any necessary
amendments to the RED. All comments will be carefully considered by the Agency. If any comment significantly affects
a RED, EPA will amend the RED by publishing the amendment in the 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Agency Forms Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Clearance</DOCTITLE>


The following request has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance in compliance
with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 USC Chapter 35). Expedited review by OMB has been requested as described below.
Call PHS Reports Clearance Officer on 202-690-7100 for a copy of the submission.
Cosmetics Adverse Reaction Hotline Reports Guide_New_In support of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Women's
Health Initiatives Program, the agency is undertaking a consumer cosmetics adverse reaction program to enable the
public to report directly to FDA any adverse reactions they encounter with cosmetic product usage. Both men and women
will be able to report adverse rections encountered.
Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, cosmetics are defined as ``articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled,
or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying,
promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.'' Cosmetic products and ingredients are regulated after,
not before, they are marketed and thus are not subject to premarket approval for safety or effectiveness for their
intended use. They can only be removed from the market place when it can be demonstrated that they are adulterated or
misbranded under sections 601 and 602 of the Act.
Almost everyone uses some cosmetic products, and many people use a great many. The number of cosmetic products grows
daily and there is great diversity of intended uses and a potential for consumer harm. In addition, product formulation
technology has advanced to the point where manufacturers can put together highly sophisticated products that were
unknown even a few years ago. With this vigorous activity in the cosmetic market place, there is considerable uncertainty
about the prevalence and intensity of product problems being experienced by the public and there is limited capability
to detect emerging problems due to new types of products or changing consumer usages.
The agency currently has two monitoring systems in place, the Cosmetic Adverse Reaction Monitoring Program and the
Voluntary Cosmetic Product Experience Program. However, both of these systems are passive in nature and each has
limitations in terms of timeliness or completeness of reporting.

The toll-free hotline program will allow consumers to report to the agency detailed information on the nature and
severity of cosmetic adverse reactions that they experience. Direct entry of information reported into an on-line
computer database will minimize possible errors and expedite the timeliness of data processing.
 
Such information will enable the agency to know the magnitude of a problem in real time. The agency also intends to provide
the cosmetic industry with a listing of their products which have adverse reaction rates greater than the norm for
similar products. This will enable cosmetic companies to compare their products to the rest of the industry and to
correct quickly a problem with a cosmetic product.
The cosmetic adverse reaction reports received through the hotline will be used in conjunction with the cosmetic
product ingredient registration program information received in accordance with 21 CFR 720. Correlation of hotline
data with ingredient data from over 28,000 cosmetic product formulations will give FDA scientists a valuable insight
into potentially unsafe ingredients in cosmetic products.
OMB has been requested to review and approved the hotline reports guide on an expedited basis by Friday, December 2.
This approval date is necessary in order to implement the national toll-free hotline service on December 7. This date
is crucial because of the outreach program needed to promote consumer awareness of cosmetic adverse reactions and
have the hotline available for the holiday season. In keeping with the requirements for expedited review, we are publishing
the interview guide and associated instructions. It should be noted that the information will actually be collected
using a computer assisted telephone interview program which presents to the interviewer screens containing the
data items and associated instructions.


Respondents: 

Individuals or households; Number of Respondents: 30,000; Number of Responses per Respondent; 1; Average Burden
per Response: .25 hour; Estimated Annual Burden: 7,500 hours.


OMB Desk Officer: 

Steve Semenuk.
Because of the time frame in which OMB has been asked to act on this submission, any comments and recommendations for
the proposed information collection should be provided directly to the OMB Desk Officer designated above by telephone
at (202) 395-7316 or by express mail at the following address: Human Resources and Housing Branch, New Executive
Office Building, Room 10235, Washington, D.C. 20503.

Background


Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-3619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging
discrimination in housing. (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988, is cited as the ``Fair Housing Act.'') Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer
complaints to State and local agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined
and certified by the Department. 

Part 115 of the Department's regulations (24 CFR part 115) contains the certification standards and the procedures
for certifying State and local fair housing laws that provide substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory
housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act. 




Announcement of Initial Determinations and Solicitation of Comments



In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c)(1), this notice announces that the fair housing laws of the States of Connecticut,
Ohio, South Carolina and the city of Cambridge, MA, have been determined by the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing
and Equal Opportunity to be substantially equivalent, on their face, to the Fair Housing Act. The Assistant Secretary
has determined, after application of the criteria set forth in 24 CFR 115.3 and 115.4, that the fair housing laws for
these three States and this locality provide, on their face, substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory
housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act. 


Following a review of performance standards and other materials pertaining to the fair housing laws of these three
States and this locality, the Department expects to make final determinations that the law of each of the three States
and the locality, in operation, provides rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to those available
under the Fair Housing Act. The Department intends to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the agency charged
with enforcement of the fair housing law of each State and locality in accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c). 

In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(b), the public is invited to submit written comments on this notice. Specifically,
the Department requests written comments on the proposed determinations that the current practices and past performance
of the agencies charged with administration and enforcement of the fair housing laws of the three States and the locality
demonstrate that, in operation, these laws provide substantive rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent
to the Fair Housing Act. This notice also invites comments from the public on the Department's determination that
the fair housing laws of these three States and the locality are, on their face, substantially equivalent to the Fair
Housing Act. 

In commenting on this notice, the Department requests that commenters clearly identify the State or the locality
for which comments are submitted.

 Decision No. 5; Notice of Acceptance of Application. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is accepting for consideration the application filed October 13, 1994, by Burlington Northern Inc.
(BNI), Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN), Santa Fe Pacific Corporation (SFP), and The Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe) (collectively applicants), seeking Commission approval and authorization
under 49 U.S.C. 11343-45 for: (1) BNI's acquisition of, control of, and merger with SFP; (2) the resulting common
control of BN and Santa Fe by the merged company; and (3) the merger of the two railroad entities. Applicants are directed
to provide certain additional information.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 13, 1994, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11343-45 and our rules at 49 CFR 1180.4, applicants filed an application
for approval of BNI's acquisition of, control of, and merger with SFP, the resulting common control of BN and Santa
Fe by the merged company, the consolidation of BN and Santa Fe railroad operations and the merger of BN and Santa Fe.
Applicants are also seeking exemption from regulation under 49 U.S.C. 10505 for the merged holding company and merged
railroad to control The Wichita Union Terminal Railway Company (WUTR) [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 1)] and
for eleven construction projects related to the primary application [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 2 through
Sub-No. 12)].

 We are accepting for consideration the control and merger application filed in this proceeding.

Upon receipt of Commission approval and authorization and satisfaction of other conditions to closing under an Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated June 29, 1994, SFP will merge with and into BNI, which will change its name to Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corporation. Each share of SFP common stock will be exchanged for 0.34 shares of newly issued BNI common stock.
Upon the BNI-SFP merger, BNI will acquire and exercise control of Santa Fe in common with its existing control of BN.

3

 The operations of BN and Santa Fe will be consolidated and fully integrated following the holding company merger.
Applicants also seek Commission approval to merge the BN and Santa Fe legal entities, although the timing of the railroad
merger will depend on tax, legal and other considerations. 




As a result of the proposed transaction, the merged company will also acquire control of WUTR, in which BN and Santa
Fe each own a one-third stock interest. A petition for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505 from the prior approval requirements
of 49 U.S.C. 11343-47 for the acquisition and exercise of control of WUTR was filed concurrently with the primary
application [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 1)]. 

No new securities will be issued by any company subject to Commission regulation under 49 U.S.C. 11301 to effect the
merger of BNI and SFP or the common control of BN and Santa Fe. To the extent BN's succession to then-outstanding debt
obligations of Santa Fe in the merger of the railroad entities may be deemed to require Commission authorization under
49 U.S.C. 11301, applicants seek such authorization, and provide the relevant information in accordance with 49
CFR 1180.6(a)(1)(iv). 

In connection with the transaction, applicants propose to construct new railroad lines that are or may be subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commission under 49 U.S.C. 10901. Petitions for exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505 from the
prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10901 for the construction of those railroad lines were filed concurrently
with the primary application [Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 2 through Sub-No. 12)].

BN operates approximately 25,000 miles of road and second main track in the United States and Canada. BN's principal
routes are as follows: a route that extends from the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and southern British
Columbia) across Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, and the western edge of Wisconsin to Chicago; a route extending
from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming in a southeasterly direction through Lincoln to Chicago and Kansas City; a second
route extending from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming south to Denver and Fort Worth; a route extending from the Powder
River Basin in Montana to Bismarck and Minneapolis/St. Paul, with an auxiliary line to the Head of the Lakes; a route
from Denver to Chicago with a junction at Lincoln; a route from Avard, Oklahoma east to Memphis and Birmingham; and
a route from Chicago to Houston through Kansas City and Dallas, with an auxiliary line from St. Louis to a junction point
east of Tulsa. BN's principal termini are at Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Bieber,
California; Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Billings, Montana; Cheyenne, Wyoming; Denver,
Colorado; Duluth, Minnesota/Superior, Wisconsin; Fargo, North Dakota/Moorhead, Minnesota; Minneapolis/St.
Paul, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska; Des Moines, Iowa; Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas;
Kansas City, Springfield, and St. Louis, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston, and Galveston,
Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Birmingham and Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida. BN's principal points of interchange
are at those termini and at Avard, Oklahoma. 
As of December 31, 1993, BN operated approximately 22,506 miles of road track, 2,134 miles of second main track and
39 miles of other main tracks in the United States and Canada. 
Santa Fe operates approximately 10,400 miles of road and secondary main tracks, creating a system of 8,500 route miles.
Santa Fe's principal routes are as follows: a route from Chicago across Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona to California; a second route from Kansas City to Colorado and New Mexico with an auxiliary
line to Superior, Nebraska; and a route from Chicago to Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston with an auxiliary line to East
Texas and Louisiana. Santa Fe's principal termini are at San Francisco/Oakland, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Barstow,
California; Phoenix, Arizona; Albuquerque and Clovis, New Mexico; Denver, Colorado; El Paso, Dallas, and Houston,
Texas; Kansas City, Kansas; and Chicago, Illinois. 
As of December 31, 1993, Santa Fe operated approximately 8,536 miles of road track, 1,812 miles of second main track
and 45 miles of other main tracks, including the lines of its wholly owned subsidiaries and leased lines. 
According to applicants, the consolidation of BN and Santa Fe would be almost entirely an end-to-end transaction,
which would create new single-line routes and increase, not reduce, competition. In terms of both geographic configuration
and commodities handled, applicants indicate that their existing rail operations are essentially complementary
to one another. BN's routes are concentrated in the Upper Midwest, the Northern Plains and the Pacific Northwest.
From this defining core, BN's lines extend into the south central region of the country, but with much less market coverage
than in the North. Santa Fe serves the area from California through the Southwest, reaching up through the Midwest
to Chicago. The principal commodities handled by BN are coal and grain. A primary focus of Santa Fe's business is intermodal
traffic.

According to applicants, both BN and Santa Fe operate in a highly competitive environment and face pervasive competition
from other rail carriers as well as from trucks and barges in many markets. Applicants contend that, with only a few
limited exceptions, the proposed transaction does not threaten any reduction in the vigor of intramodal competition.
Applicants contend that the bulk of the BN and Santa Fe systems do not overlap in horizontal competition. Applicants
also indicate that no horizontal overlap exists in the three major corridors from the mid-continent to the west coast.
BN operates in the Northern Corridor; Santa Fe operates in the Southern Corridor. Where overlap is present, applicants
indicate that it almost always occurs in the presence of extensive competition with other providers of freight transportation
services. Applicants' analyses, however, indicate the possibility for some limited reduction in competition in
the areas of Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas. Concerning this area, applicants say that they are prepared to negotiate
ameliorative arrangements to address any such reductions in competition. 
Applicants state that there will be few basic changes in the existing route structure. Applicants find that the Avard,
OK gateway route will experience the most pronounced change. Applicants also project that California-Southeast
traffic will increase significantly and that traffic on the route east of Avard to Tulsa will approximately double
due to a combination of growth and internal reroutes. Applicants' traffic projections also involve increases in
intermodal, merchandise, and grain traffic. 
BN and Santa Fe routes between Denver and Texas and between Chicago and Texas also possess some parallel characteristics.
Applicants, however, find that each route is generally far removed from its counterpart and each serves other different,
but important, traffic lanes and, therefore, no major change in overall uses and traffic density is planned. 
We are accepting the application for consideration because it complies with the applicable regulations, waivers,
and requirements. 

See

 49 U.S.C. 11343-45; 49 CFR Part 1180. We reserve the right, however, to require the filing of supplemental information
from applicants or any other party or individual, as necessary to complete the record in this matter. 
Although applicants have provided sufficient market analysis under 49 CFR 1180.7 for us to accept their application
for consideration, we find that additional information will be necessary for us to analyze the effect of this transaction
on certain other railroads. Specifically, we are concerned about railroads which have interests in either WUTR or
HBT. 
In our decision served October 3, 1994 [Decision No. 3], we waived our regulations at 49 CFR 1180.3(b) pertaining to
WUTR and HBT by not considering either of them an ``applicant carrier.'' Consequently, we are lacking certain information
that we believe is necessary to conduct our market analysis. Therefore, applicants are directed to provide us with
additional information concerning WUTR and HBT. 
In Finance Docket No. 32549 (Sub-No. 1), applicants seek an exemption for their control of WUTR. In their petition,
applicants indicate that the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) owns the other one-third stock interest in WUTR.
Applicants state in the petition that they expect MP will continue to participate in WUTR's management and that applicants'
control will not impair MP's ability to obtain service from WUTR. Applicants are directed to provide copies of any
agreement concerning use of that property. 
Although BN and Santa Fe currently own only 24% and 25% of HBT, respectively, in the event of consolidation, their combined
interests may constitute control of HBT. Therefore, we will direct applicants to provide us with the following information:

1. Identify the owners of HBT and their respective ownership percentages. 
2. Identify any railroads dependent on HBT in order to interchange with other carriers (specify which carriers) or
to connect their own lines through the city. Explain each dependent circumstance. 
3. Explain whether the agreement or agreements governing the use of the property held or owned by HBT protect any other
owners of HBT from adverse effects in the event of consolidation. Provide copies of any agreement concerning use of
that property. 
Because of the expedited procedural schedule, additional information will be necessary to assist us in preparing
prompt and complete analysis of the transaction. Therefore, applicants are directed to provide us with a current
complete set of employee operating timetables for both BN and Santa Fe. 
In our Decision No. 4, served October 5, 1994, we adopted an expedited procedural schedule, and we have attached it
here to give notice to all interested persons. All of the filing deadlines are in accordance with the statute and governing
regulations, as modified by the expedited procedural schedule. We advise applicants and all other parties to this
proceeding that, particularly because of the accelerated schedule we have adopted, they must strictly comply with
all requirements.

4

 If questions arise concerning an interpretation of a requirement, they may contact the Commission's Office of Proceedings
at 202-927-5610 for assistance. 

See

 49 CFR 1180.4(c)(6)(iii). 




The application and accompanying exhibits are available for inspection in the Public Docket Room, room 1221, at the
offices of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington, DC. 
Any interested persons, including government parties, may participate in this proceeding by submitting written
comments regarding the application. Comments must be filed no later than December 27, 1994. An original and 20 copies
must be filed with the Secretary, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423.

Written comments must be concurrently served by first class mail on the United States Secretary of Transportation
(DOT), the Attorney General of the United States (DOJ), and applicants' representatives. Written comments must
also be served upon all parties of record within 10 days of service of the service list by the Commission. We plan to issue
the service list shortly after comments have been received. Any person who files timely written comments shall be
considered a party of record if he, she, or it so indicates in their comments. In this event, no petition for leave to
intervene need be filed. Written comments shall include: 

1. The docket number and title of the proceeding; 

2. The name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party and its representative upon whom service shall
be made; 

3. The commenting party's position, 

i.e.

, whether it supports or opposes the proposed transaction; 

4. A statement on whether the commenting party intends to participate formally in the proceeding or merely comment
upon the proposal; 

5. A list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant carriers; 

6. An initial list of specific protective conditions sought; 

7. An analysis of the issues the Commission must consider in this proceeding. Particular attention should be given
to our general policy statement for the merger or control of at least two class I railroads, 49 CFR 1180.1, the statutory
criteria, and antitrust policy. 

Because we have determined that this proceeding constitutes a major transaction within the meaning of our rail consolidation
rules, 49 CFR Part 1180, railroads filing written comments must also submit at that time a statement of whether the
commenting railroad intends to file inconsistent applications, petitions for inclusion, trackage rights, or any
other affirmative relief requiring an application to be filed with the Commission and a general statement of what
that application is expected to include. THIS WILL BE CONSIDERED A PREFILING NOTICE WITHOUT WHICH THE COMMISSION
WILL NOT ENTERTAIN APPLICATIONS FOR THIS TYPE OF RELIEF. 

Comments from the Secretary of Transportation and Attorney General must be filed by January 11, 1995. Parties seeking
to modify any protective conditions specified in their initial comments must file a second list of protective conditions
no later than January 24, 1995. Parties shall 
not be permitted to seek any protective conditions other than those requested in their final list.

Parties seeking to file responsive applications must do so no later than February 8, 1995. Responsive applications
include inconsistent applications, petitions for inclusion, or any other affirmative relief that requires an application
to be filed with the Commission (such as trackage rights, purchase, purchase of a portion, acquisition, extension,
construction, operation, pooling, terminal operations, abandonment, etc.). Parties should contact Chris Oehrle
(202) 927-6288 to obtain docket numbers for their responsive applications. 

Petitions for waiver or clarification by responsive applicants shall be filed no later than December 27, 1994. Each
responsive application filed and accepted will be consolidated with the primary application in this proceeding.

Discovery may begin immediately. The Commission will not tolerate dilatory tactics in response to discovery requests
designed to elicit relevant evidence. A refusal voluntarily to supply information will be treated as an objection
to the request for discovery. Responses must be served upon all parties of record, and five copies of those responses
must be concurrently filed with the Commission. 

We plan to conclude the evidentiary phase of this proceeding by January 2, 1996. The initial decision will be waived,
and the determination of the merits of the application(s) will be made in the first instance by the entire Commission
under 49 U.S.C. 11345. 

Any traffic studies and data submitted in opposition to the primary application must use calendar year 1993 data and,
where relevant, use depreciation accounting, in order to be comparable with the evidence submitted by applicants.
Evidence supporting protestants' responsive applications must use 1993 as the base year and the depreciation accounting
system, and applicants' evidence in opposition to the responsive applications must use 1993 and depreciation accounting.


We advise protestants that, if they seek to have the primary application denied, or seek conditions if approved, because
they contend their ability to provide essential service and/or competition will be harmed, they must present substantial
evidence in support of their positions. 

See Lamoille Valley R.R. Co. v. ICC,

 711 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. 1983). 

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources. 


It is ordered:



1. The application in Finance Docket No. 32549 is accepted for consideration. 

2. The parties shall comply with all provisions as stated above. 

3. Applicants are directed to provide the Commission's Office of Compliance and Enforcement with a current complete
set of employee operating timetables for both BN and Santa Fe within 30 days of the effective date of this decision.


4. Applicants are directed to provide copies of any agreement concerning use of property operated by WUTR within 10
days of the effective date of this decision. 

5. Applicants are directed to provide the following information within 10 days of the effective date of this decision:


a. Identify the owners of HBT and their respective ownership percentages. 

b. Identify any railroads dependent on HBT in order to interchange with other carriers (specify which carriers) or
to connect their own lines through the city. Explain each dependent circumstance. 

c. Explain whether the agreement or agreements governing the use of the property held or owned by HBT could adversely
affect any other owners of HBT in the event of consolidation. Provide copies of any agreement concerning use of that
property. 

6. This decision is effective on November 10, 1994. 




Decided: November 3, 1994.

Controlled Substances: Established Revised 1994 Aggregate Production Quota



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a final revised aggregate production quota for 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The interim notice (59 FR 49256, September 27, 1994) which established a revised 1994 aggregate production quota
for methylphenidate, a Schedule II controlled substance, as required under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)
(21 USC 826), is adopted without change.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator,
in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994). 



On September 27, 1994, an interim notice establishing a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for methylphenidate
was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 49256). All interested persons were invited to comment on or object to this proposed aggregate production quota
on or before October 27, 1994. No comments or objections were received. The interim notice is adopted without change.

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual
aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international
treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their
impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined
that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substance Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quota for methylphenidate, expressed in grams of anhydrous base,
be established as follows:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. National Administrative Office (NAO) gives notice that on November 4, 1994, Submission 

#

940004 was accepted for review. The submission was filed with the NAO on September 12, 1994 by the United Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) and concerns the operations of an employer in Ciudad Juarez, State of Chihuahua,
Mexico. The allegations of the submission relate principally to the right of freedom of association and the right
to organize. 




Article 16(3) of the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) provides for the review of labor law matters
in Canada and Mexico by the NAO. The objective of the review of the submission will be to gather information to assist
the NAO to better understand and publicly report on the Government of Mexico's promotion of compliance with, and effective
enforcement of, its labor law through appropriate government action, the availability of enforcement procedures,
and procedural guarantees, as set out in Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the NAALC. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 12, 1994 the UE filed a submission with the NAO concerning allegations involving the operations of an
employer in Ciudad Juarez, State of Chihuahua, Mexico. The allegations of the submission relate principally to the
right of freedom of association and the right to organize. 




Article 16(3) of the NAALC provides for the review of labor law matters in Canada and Mexico by the NAO. ``Labor law''
is defined in Article 49 of the NAALC to include freedom of association and the right to organize. 

The procedural guidelines for the NAO, published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994, specify that, in general, the Secretary of the NAO shall accept a submission for review if it raises
issues relevant to labor law matters in Canada or Mexico and if a review would further the objectives of the NAALC. 

Submission 

#

940004 relates to labor law matters in Mexico. A review would also appear to further the objectives of the NAALC, as
set out in Article 1, which include improving working conditions and living standards in each Party's territory;
promoting, to the maximum extent possible, the labor principles set out in Annex 1 of the NAALC, among them freedom
of association and the right to organize; promoting compliance with, and effective enforcement by each Party of,
its labor law; and fostering transparency in the administration of labor law. Accordingly, the submission has been
accepted for review. However, acceptance for review is not intended to indicate any determination as to the validity
or accuracy of the allegations contained in the submission. 

The objective of the review will be to gather information to assist the NAO to better understand and publicly report
on the Government of Mexico's promotion of compliance with, and effective enforcement of, its labor law through appropriate
government action, the availability of enforcement procedures, and procedural guarantees, as set out in Articles
3, 4, and 5 of the NAALC. The review will focus on labor laws that guarantee the right of association and the right to organize
freely and prohibit interference with the efforts of workers to exercise those rights. The review will be completed,
and a public report issued, within 120 days, or 180 days if circumstances require an extension of time, as set out in
the procedural guidelines of the NAO.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Commonwealth Edison Co.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of a schedular exemption from the
requirement of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, to Facility Operating License No. DPR-19, issued to Commonwealth
Edison Company, (ComEd the licensee), for operation of the Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2, located in Grundy
County, Illinois.




Environmental Assessment




Identification of Proposed Action





The proposed action would grant a schedular exemption from the requirements of Section III.A.6.(b) (Type A test)
of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 relating to the primary reactor containment leakage testing for water cooled reactors.
The purpose of the test is to assure that leakage through the primary reactor containment shall not exceed allowable
leakage rate values as specified in the Technical Specifications (TS) and that periodic surveillance is performed.



The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's request for an exemption dated October 28, 1994.




Need for the Proposed Action





The licensee requested, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), a one-time schedular exemption for Dresden, Unit 2, from the
integrated leak rate test (ILRT) intervals for the Type A leak rate test required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J. Section
III.A.6.(b). The exemption is requested to avoid the potential for a reactor shutdown. If a forced outage is imposed
to perform testing, it would present undue hardship and cost in the form of increased radiological exposure. Furthermore,
if a forced outage is imposed to perform the required testing, an additional plant shutdown and startup will be required.
ComEd has had to reschedule the Dresden, Unit 2, refueling outage from September 1994 to July 1995, because of two forced
maintenance outages. Increasing the interval between refueling outages will cause Dresden, Unit 2, to exceed the
Type A leak rate testing surveillance interval required for the Type A leak rate test which can not be performed during
reactor operation.




Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action





The proposed action includes an exemption from performing the Type A test for a maximum period of 242 days beyond the
required Appendix J test interval. As stated in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, the purpose of the primary containment leak
rate testing requirements is to ensure that leakage rates are maintained within the TS requirements and to assure
that proper maintenance and repairs are performed throughout the service life of the containment boundary components.
The requested exemption is consistent with the intent of 10 CFR 50.12(a), in that it represents a one-time only schedular
extension of short duration. The required leak tests will still be performed to assess compliance with TS requirements,
albeit later, and to assure that any required maintenance or repair is performed. As noted in Section III.A.6.(b)
of Appendix J, it was intended that the testing be performed during refueling outages or other convenient intervals.
Extending the Appendix J interval by a small amount to reach the next refueling outage will not significantly impact
the integrity of the containment boundary and, therefore, will not significantly impact the consequences of an accident
or transient in the unlikely event of occurrence during the 242 day extended period. In order to provide an added margin
of safety and to account for possible increases in the leakage rates of untested volumes during the relatively short
period of the exemption, Dresden Unit 2 will impose an administrative limit for minimum pathway leakage of 85 percent
of 0.75La for the remaining Unit 2 fuel cycle. Past Unit 2 local leak rate test data have, in general, demonstrated good
leak rate test results. The two consecutive Type A ILRT failures that have placed Unit 2 on the accelerated test schedule
were the result of the addition of Type B and C test results to the Type A leakage and not problems with the Type A test boundaries.
The containment leakage rate minus the Type B and C leakages for the last two Type A test failures during D2R12 and D2R13
were 285.50 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) and 302.62 scfh, respectively. These values are 47 percent and 50 percent
of the Type A ILRT acceptance criteria of 610.56 scfh (.75La). The above data, along with the station imposed limit
for minimum pathway leakage, provide a basis for showing that the probability of exceeding the off site dose rates
established in 10 CFR Part 100, will not be increased by extending the current Type A testing interval for a maximum
of 242 days. The proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological effluents and has no other environmental
impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes there are no measurable environmental impacts associated with the
proposed exemption.




Alternatives to the Proposed Action





Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the exemption would be to require rigid compliance with the requirements of Section III.A.6.(b) of Appendix J to 10
CFR Part 50. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result in unjustified costs
for the licensee.




Alternate Use of Resources





This action does not involve the use of any resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statements
for Dresden, Units 2 and 3, dated November 1973.




Agencies and Persons Consulted





The staff consulted with the Illinois State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.




Finding of No Significant Impact





Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.



For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's request for exemption dated October 28, 1994,
which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, D.C., and at the local public document room located at the Morris Public Library, 604 Liberty Street,
Morris, Illinois 60451.

<DOCTITLE>Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from Facility Operating
License No. DPR-36, issued to Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, (the licensee), for operation of the Maine
Yankee Atomic Power Station, located in Wiscasset, Maine.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated August 5, 1994, for an exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, ``General Criteria for Security Personnel.'' The requested exemption
would relieve two security officers from meeting the distant visual acuity requirements in one eye, which was not
discovered at the time of their initial employment screening in 1989 and 1990.



The Need for the Proposed Action



Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, security personnel who are responsible for the protection of special nuclear
material on site or in transit should, like other elements of the physical security system, be required to meet minimum
criteria to ensure that they will effectively perform their assigned security-related job duties.

The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a), ``Vision,'' specifies, in part
that: For each individual (security officer), distant visual acuity in each eye shall be correctable to 20/30 (Snellen
or equivalent) in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with eyeglasses or contact lenses.

At the time of their employment in 1989 and 1990, the two subject security officers were screened using a licensee-generated
form that was based on the requirements of Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 73. However, the form did not properly reflect the
correct distant visual acuity requirements of the ``other eye.'' On July 28, 1994, the discrepancy between the licensee's
form and the requirements of 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a) was noted for the first officer. A review
of the visual examination records for all security officers found a second instance in which the distant visual acuity
requirement was not met for another security officer.

The licensee has provided expert professional medical opinions asserting that each officer has normal peripheral
vision, normal peripheral depth perception, and normal binocular acuity. Further, each security officer uses the
right eye for firearms siting and each currently tests 20/20 in the right eye. Finally, the licensee has committed
to have each security officer's vision tested by its optometrist every 6 months to ensure no significant visual deterioration
occurs. The criteria to establish that no significant visual deterioration has occurred will be:

1. Vision in the better eye will be at least 20/30 corrected or uncorrected.

2. Vision in the other eye will be monitored. If eyesight in the other eye should worsen, immediate testing will be performed
to demonstrate that the individual is physically capable of meeting all the requirements of the Maine Yankee Security
Training and Qualification Plan prior to being reassigned duties of an armed security officer. (This testing will
include the complete firearms qualification course.)

3. The remaining vision criteria of 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix B, will be met or exceeded.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action, including the expert professional medical opinions,
vision screening results, firearms qualifications, and the proposed alternate qualification criteria the licensee
has documented. The expert professional medical opinions assert that the diminished central visual acuity for each
officer's left eye has existed since birth for one, and since about the age of four, for the other. Thus, the early age
of onset and the nature of both conditions contribute to relative functional normality for each officer. Further,
each officer has normal peripheral vision, normal peripheral depth perception, and normal binocular acuity.

The underlying purpose for requiring vision criteria for security officers is to ensure that they can effectively
perform their assigned security-related job duties. Expert professional opinions assert that each officer has
relative functional normality and that an exception could thus be made because of the longevity of their vision loss
(they have adapted and effectively compensate for diminished central visual acuity in their left eye).

Accordingly, the Commission concludes that an exemption to allow continued service of the two subject employees
as security officers at Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station would not result in a reduction in the physical protection
capabilities for the protection of special nuclear material_either on site or in transit_or of Maine Yankee Atomic
Power Station. Consequently, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological impacts associated
with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Denial of the requested action would not significantly enhance the environment
in that the proposed action will result in visual capabilities for two security officers that are substantially equivalent
to the existing requirements.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
Related to Operation of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated August 5, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555, at the local public document room located at the Wiscasset Public Library, High Street, P.O. Box 367, Wiscasset,
Maine 04578.

License </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of the Power Authority of the State
of New York (the licensee) to withdraw its September 29, 1994, application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-64 for Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, located in Westchester County, New York.


The proposed amendment would have revised the facility technical specifications to allow a one-time extension to
the 30-month interval requirement for the leak rate testing of Residual Heat Removal containment isolation valves
AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870. 

The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 5, 1994 (59 FR 50777). However, by letter dated November 2, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed amendment.


For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated September 29, 1994, and the
licensee's letter dated November 2, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents
are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street

things, that the licensee, is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.
The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor at the licensee's site located in Westchester County, New York.


II


By letter dated September 29, 1994, the licensee requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TSs) that
would allow Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) to be performed during refueling
outage (RFO) 9/10, scheduled for spring of 1996. In addition, the licensee's letter requested an exemption from the
requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) since 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, requires
that licensees perform Type C tests during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater
than 2 years. Type C tests are LLRTs of containment isolation valves.
The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles in August 1992, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles,
starting with fuel cycle 9. The requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, indicate that Type C
LLRTs must be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling at intervals no greater than 2 years (24 months).
On January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption that allowed Type C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30
months, thus, permitting operating on a 24-month fuel cycle.
Approximately 6 months after startup from RFO 8/9, IP3 began an extended unplanned nonrefueling outage. In November
and December of 1994, RHR containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744,
and AC-MOV-1870 are due for their Type C LLRT. Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves
is 30 months. Therefore, the licensee requested a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed
valves to be deferred until the 9/10 RFO, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996.
By letter dated November 2, 1994, the licensee requested withdrawal of the proposed changes to the TSs and modified
the exemption request. Specifically, the licensee requested that the exemption extend until the return to power
following the current outage, which is defined as prior to T

avg

 exceeding 350
  F. The NRC staff granted the request for withdrawal of the proposed changes to the TSs in a letter dated November
3, 1994.


III


Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security and (2) when special
circumstances are present. According to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present whenever application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.
The CFR at 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Paragraphs III.D.3, states: ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor
shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years * * *.'' The underlying purpose
of the requirement to perform Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not to exceed 2 years is to ensure that
any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified within a time span that prevents
significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow the test to be conducted during
scheduled refueling outages. The requirements to perform Type C LLRTs at intervals no greater than 2 years presumed
the 2-year time interval was adequate to accommodate the 12-month fuel cycles which were common when Appendix J to
10 CFR part 50 was published in 1973. However, IP3, along with several other facilities, are utilizing core designs
which allow operation on a 24-month cycle. In January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption that allowed Types
B and C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30 months, thus, permitting operation on a 24-month fuel cycle.

The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles, starting
with fuel cycle 9. Fuel cycle 9 started in August 1992. Approximately 6 months after startup from 8/9 RFO, IP3 began
an extended unplanned nonrefueling outage. Startup from the outage is currently expected for early 1995. After startup
from the current outage, the plant expects to run until its next FRO 9/10 which is scheduled to begin in spring of 1996.
In November and December of 1994, RHR containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 are due for their Type C LLRT.
Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves is 30 months. These LLRTs are normally performed during
a refueling outage when the reactor is defueled and the RHR system is not providing a source of cooling water. The current
outage is a nonrefueling outage; therefore, the reactor is not defueled and RHR system is providing core cooling water.
The licensee's procedure and the system design require the RHR system to be out of service in order to perform the LLRTs.
The licensee has requested a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred
to provide additional time to finalize plans to accomplish this testing.
The NRC staff has reviewed the LLRT data provided by the licensee as well as methodology used by the licensee to extrapolate
LLRT data to a 30-month test interval and the staff concludes that there is reasonable assurance that the containment
leakage rate would be maintained within acceptable limits with a one-time LLRT interval increase until the return
to power following the current outage, which is defined as prior T

avg

 exceeding 350 
 F. As a result, the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule. Thus, there are special circumstances present which satisfy the requirements
of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii).


IV


Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, that (1) the exemption as described in Section
III are authorized by law, will not endanger life or property, and are otherwise in the public interest and (2) special
circumstances exist pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). Therefore, the Commission hereby grants the following
exemption:




The Power Authority of the State of New York is exempt from the requirement of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3,
in that the interval for Type C tests of RHR containment isolation valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 may be extended until the return to power following the current
outage at Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, which is defined as prior to T

avg

 exceeding 350 
 F.




Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 54478).
This exemption is effective upon issuance.




Dated at Rockeville, Maryland, this 4th day of November, 1994.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Over-the-Counter Options Trading System Procedures for Emergency Contingencies and Disaster Recovery


November 3, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on September 9, 1994, the Delta Government Options Corp. (``Delta'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
items have been primarily prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On September 23, 1994, Delta filed an amendment
to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change will modify Delta's Over-The-Counter Options Trading System Procedures (``Procedures'')
relating to emergency contingencies and disaster recovery. In particular, Delta is adopting provisions governing
(1) the waiver or suspension of Delta's procedures; (2) action by Delta's management on behalf of Delta; and (3) interpretation
of Delta's rules.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, Delta included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Delta has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(a) The proposed rule change will add a new Article XIX to Delta's Procedures. Article XIX contains Section 1901, ``Waiver
or Suspension of Procedures,'' Section 1902, ``Action by Delta,'' and Section 1903, ``Interpretation of Rules.''
These new provisions codify Delta's existing policies regarding emergency contingencies and disaster recovery.
Section 1901 will permit Delta's Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer, Secretary, or Controller (1) to extend the time fixed by any provision of Delta's Procedures or any regulations
issued by Delta for the doing of any act or acts or (2) to waive or to suspend any provision of Delta's Procedures or any
regulations issued by Delta if they judge such extension, waiver, or suspension to be necessary or expedient. The
extension, waiver, or suspension may remain in effect only for sixty days unless approved by Delta's Board of Directors.
Section 1901 will require that a written report of the extension, waiver, or suspension be filed with Delta and shall
be available for inspection by any participant. The written report will set forth the pertinent facts, the identity
of the person who authorized the extension, waiver, or suspension, and the reason the extension, waiver, or suspension
was deemed necessary or expedient. No written report will be required for extensions of time of less than eight hours.
Section 1902 will permit Delta's Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer, Secretary, Controller, or other persons designated by Delta's Board of Directors to act on behalf of Delta
except where Delta's Procedures require action by the Board of Directors. Section 1903 will authorize Delta's Board
of Directors, Chairman of the Board, President, any committee of the Board of Directors, or any designee of the Board
of Directors to interpret Delta's Procedures.
(b) The proposed rule change will enable Delta to establish contingency planning and disaster recovery procedures
that can be used in the event of an emergency, market disruption, or other unanticipated event and will permit Delta
to maintain continuous operations while safeguarding the assets under its custodianship. Delta believes that the
proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act which requires that a clearing agency be organized and its rules
be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions. Delta believes the proposed rule change will greatly reduce the possibility of market
disruption and insure the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in Delta's system in the event
of an emergency or other unanticipated event.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


Delta does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments have neither been solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) by order approve such proposed rule change or 
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 


IV. Solicitation of Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-DGOC-94-5 and should be submitted by December 1, 1994.

 

For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change
Establishing New Categories of Netting System Membership for Futures Commission Merchants</DOCTITLE>


November 3, 1994.


On July 5, 1994, the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-94-04) pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The proposed rule change establishes new categories of netting system membership for futures commission merchants
(``FCMs''). The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on August 23, 1994.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.





I. Description


Background


GSCC was established primarily to provide the government securities marketplace with risk protections and a means
of ensuring orderly settlement of member trading activity in U.S. Treasury securities. Initially, membership criteria
were specified for large dealers, interdealer brokers, and clearing banks that might benefit from GSCC's services.
Following expressions of interest in netting system membership by several FCMs, GSCC is establishing a Category
1 and a Category 2 FCM netting system membership class.
An FCM is generally an entity that solicits orders, accepts orders, and/or accepts funds for the purchase or sale of
exchange traded futures or options on futures. In effect, an FCM is the equivalent in the futures industry of a securities
broker.
 The determination of whether an applicant is considered a Category 1 FCM or a Category 2 FCM will be based on the determination
by GSCC as to which minimum financial admission criteria such FCM satisfies.

<PARENT> FR941110-2-00077 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Proposed Minimum Financial Standards


The term ``net capital'' as used in GSCC's rules and the Commission's uniform net capital rule is the approximate accounting
equivalent of the term ``adjusted net capital'' as that term is used in the CFTC financial requirement rule.
 In addition, the term ``net worth'' as used in GSCC's rules is comparable to the concept of ``net capital'' in the CFTC's
financial requirement rule.






Given these similarities, GSCC established categories of FCM netting membership with minimum financial standards
and margin requirements that are equivalent to those for Category 1 and Category 2 dealer netting members. Specifically,
if an applicant is applying to become a Category 1 FCM, it must have, as of the end of the calendar month prior to the effective
date of its membership, $50 million in net worth and $10 million in excess adjusted net capital
 and must meet the same clearing fund requirements as a Category 1 dealer netting member. If an applicant is applying
to become a Category 2 FCM, it must have, as of the end of the calendar month prior to the effective date of its membership,
$25 million in net worth and $10 million in excess adjusted net capital and must meet the same clearing fund requirements
as a Category 2 dealer netting member.
 The minimum financial admission criteria are continuing membership standards, and a member must promptly inform
GSCC any time it is not in compliance with any of the financial standards.





GSCC's rules require dealers to submit to GSCC certain financial reports that the dealers are required to file with
their regulatory authorities. Because the CFTC requires all FCMs as of the close of business each month only to make
and to keep a record of their computation of adjusted net capital and does not require FCMs to file such computations
with their regulatory authorities, GSCC specifically will require every FCM netting member to submit to GSCC each
month a copy of the computation of adjusted net capital required by the CFTC. GSCC also will require FCMs to submit to
GSCC a copy of the CFTC's regulatory financial report at the time that the form is filed with the CFTC each quarter.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that GSCC's proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act
 and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds within its possession or control or for which it is responsible and to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal to establish new categories of netting system membership
for FCMs is consistent with these obligations.





In their trading of futures on government securities, FCMs may be required to deliver or to accept delivery of Treasury
securities but under certain circumstances may not be required to register as broker-dealers.
 By permitting FCMs to become GSCC members, the proposed rule change allows GSCC to extend the services and benefits
it offers as a registered clearing agency to a greater number of market participants and thereby should promote the
establishment of a national system for the prompt clearance and settlement of securities transactions.




The minimum financial requirements implemented by GSCC for Category 1 and Category 2 FCMs mirror those for Category
1 and Category 2 dealer netting members. The Commission believes that given the similarities between the concepts
of net capital and net worth in GSCC, CFTC, and Commission rules, there is a basis for establishing categories of FCM
netting membership with net capital, net worth, clearing fund, and margin requirements that are equivalent to those
for Category 1 and Category 2 dealer netting members. The Commission therefore believes that the financial and reporting
requirements established by GSCC for Category 1 and Category 2 FCMs along with GSCC's regular risk management procedures
should allow GSCC to provide membership to FCMs consistent with GSCC's safeguarding obligations.


III. Conclusion


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, particularly
with Section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder.


It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-94-04) be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Relating to Amendments to Parts VI and X of Schedule C of the NASD By-Laws Relating to Foreign Finders
and Foreign Associates </DOCTITLE>


November 4, 1994. 


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 27, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing to amend Parts VI and X of Schedule C of the NASD By-Laws relating to foreign finders and foreign
associates. Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is italicized and proposed deletions
are bracketed. 


PART VI 
PERSONS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION


* * * * * 




(2) Member firms, and persons associated with a member, may pay to nonregistered foreign persons transaction-related
compensation based upon the business of customers they direct to member firms if the following conditions are met:

(a) the member firm has assured itself that the nonregistered foreign person who will receive the compensation (the
``finder'') is not required to register in the U.S. as a broker/dealer nor is subject to a disqualification as defined
in Article II, Section 4 of the NASD By-Laws, and has further assured itself that the compensation arrangement does
not violate applicable foreign law; 
(b) the finders are foreign nationals (not U.S. citizens) or foreign entities domiciled abroad;

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


At its January 1994 meeting, the NASD Board of Governors approved the issuance of a Notice to Members soliciting comments
on amendments to the foreign associate provisions in Part X of Schedule C to the NASD By-Laws. These proposed amendments
would substantially conform NASD requirements for ``foreign finders'' to certain interpretations under New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) Rule 345 recently approved by the Commission in SEC Rel. No. 34-32431; File No. SR-NYSE-92-33.
These amendments would permit the payment of transaction-related compensation to non-registered foreign finders
who are not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. securities laws, subject to certain disclosure and recordkeeping
requirements by the U.S. broker-dealer.
The proposed amendment to Part VI of Schedule C of the NASD By-Laws is limited in application only to compensation arrangements
that involve foreign (i.e., non-U.S. citizens) finders who are domiciled abroad and customers who are not U.S. citizens
or U.S. institutions that are also domiciled abroad. Additionally, as one of the conditions under the proposed interpretation,
customers must acknowledge receipt of information, in the form of a descriptive document, regarding the compensation
arrangement. If all the specified conditions of the proposed interpretation are met, members may pay transaction-related
compensation to nonregistered foreign finders based on the business of non-U.S. customers that the finders refer
to the member. The proposed amendment would also require member firms to verify that these foreign finders are not
subject to a disqualification as defined in Article II, Section 4 of the NASD By-Laws.
While the foreign finders' sole involvement would be the initial referral to a member or a member organization, compensation
could be made on an ongoing basis and tied to such variables as the level of business generated or assets under control.
All accounts referred by such foreign finders would be carried on the books of the member.
The proposed amendment will allow member organizations the opportunity to enhance their competitive position in
foreign countries where new accounts are routinely opened on a referral basis with ongoing compensation.
The proposed amendment to Part X of Schedule C of the By-Laws would allow members to continue to use Part X to register
Foreign Associates with the NASD but would require members to file Form U-4 to register such persons.
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act in
that the proposed changes to Parts VI and X of Schedule C of the By-Laws will impose substantial regulatory requirements
on the relationship between members and foreign finders while at the same time allowing members to use foreign finders
to expand the members' business opportunities overseas.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


The Association received 7 letters commenting on Notice to Members 94-6, the proposed amendments to the Interpretation.
The commenters include the Securities Industry Association (SIA), two law firms, and four broker-dealers. Below
is a summary of the more significant and/or recurring issues raised in the letters and the NASD's position in connection
with the same.
One letter dealt with the narrow issue of whether the drafting of the foreign associate provisions inadvertently
conflicted with the provisions of SEC Rule 15a-6. The NASD does not believe the amended proposal conflicts with
Rule 15a-6.
Of the remaining six letters, one was from the SIA and another from counsel representing five large, full service member
firms. All of these comment letters supported the NASD's attempt to comport its requirements to the disclosure provisions
of the interpretation to NYSE Rule 345, but opposed both the requirement to include foreign finders under the definition
of foreign associates and the provision subjecting such persons to full U-4 registration. The commenters argued
that foreign finders are not associated persons of a member. The commenters noted that, if NASD rules required such
persons to file U-4 registration documents, the foreign finders would likely refuse to do so and would redirect
their business to foreign broker-dealers and banks. Such a result would contradict the purpose of the NYSE interpretation
which was designed to permit U.S. broker-dealers to be more competitive in global markets where finding arrangements
are common practice. The commenters also noted that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for NASD members
to exert meaningful supervision over foreign finders even if they did file U-4 registration documents, because
these individuals and firms view themselves as independent contractors not otherwise subject to supervision of
the broker-dealer. Furthermore, the filing of such documents through a firm may raise regulatory, tax and other issues
in the country of domicile for the foreign finders and increase the overall burden of regulation of member firms.
The NASD Board of Governors (``Board'') found the commenters' arguments persuasive and developed a different approach
to the foreign finder issue. In keeping with a recommendation from counsel for the five large member firms, the Board
determined to include foreign finders under the portion of Schedule C that identifies persons exempt from registration
and to incorporate the information disclosure requirements of the interpretation to NYSE Rule 345 into the section.
The Board also added a provision requiring firms to take reasonable steps to assure that foreign finders are not subject
to the disqualification provisions of Article II, Section 4 of the NASD By-Laws. The Board also decided it is important
to coordinate its activities with the NYSE to ensure consistency in the NASD's requirements with those of the NYSE.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or
B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to file number SR-NASD-94-51 and should be submitted by
December 1, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Section 308 of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 requires the FAA and NASA to jointly
conduct a noise study and report the results to Congress. This study shall identify technologies for noise reduction
of propeller-driven airplanes and rotorcraft. The goal of the study is to determine the status of research and development
now underway in the area of noise reduction technology for propeller-driven airplanes and rotorcraft, and to determine
whether a research program to supplement existing research activities is necessary.

The FAA and NASA have developed a plan for conducting the required study and completing the report to Congress. The
plan's major elements include an assessment of current noise reduction technology for propeller driven airplanes
and rotorcraft, a review of the study findings with appropriate groups, and preparation of the report to Congress.

The FAA and NASA are in the process of determining the status of research and development now underway within NASA in
the area of noise reduction technology for propeller-driven airplanes and rotorcraft.

Participation of federal agencies will be invited through the Federal Interagency Committee on Aviation Noise (FICAN).



Request for Information



In supplementing the study findings, the FAA is seeking comment and information regarding the following 6 questions.
A discussion of each will be incorporated into the FAA/NASA report to Congress. Additional comments regarding any
of the issues raised by Congress under Section 308 of the Authorization Act are also invited. The FAA and NASA will review
and consider all responses in preparing its report to Congress. 

1. What are the existing and emerging propeller driven airplane and rotorcraft noise reduction technologies?

2. Which noise reduction technologies can be retrofitted to the current propeller driven airplanes and rotorcraft
and what are the economic impacts?

3. To what extent do existing noise reduction technologies succeed in reducing noise exposure?

4. To what extent is noise from propeller driven airplane and rotorcraft considered a problem requiring further research
efforts?

5. What aspects of propeller driven airplane and rotorcraft noise create impact?

6. What are the areas of propeller driven airplane and rotorcraft noise reduction technology that require further
research?

The FAA encourages public participation in this opportunity to comment to comply with the requirements of the Federal
Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994. The data received for this request will be considered in preparing
the report to Congress. Comments responding to these questions should be mailed to the office designated in the ADDRESSES


heading and include docket number. Commenters who wish the FAA to acknowledge the receipt of their comments must submit
with their comments a pre-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket
No. 27954.'' The postcard will be date-stamped by the FAA and returned to the commenter.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_Request for Proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The NIS Secondary School Initiative Division, Office of Citizen Exchanges of the United States Information Agency's
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award to facilitate academic
exchanges between American high school students and students from the 12 Newly Independent States (NIS) of the former
Soviet Union. Public or private non-profit organizations and educational institutions meeting the provisions
described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply to develop projects that promote the purposes of this program, which
are to: (a) Build the capacity of organizations to conduct academic exchanges at the secondary school level between
the U.S. and the NIS; (b) promote study abroad opportunities in the NIS for Americans; and (c) sponsor study opportunities
in the U.S. for NIS high school-aged students. Applicants may apply for grants of up to two years duration. Full-year
exchanges are permitted only in the second year of the grant. Exchanges of three to five months duration may take place
during the 1996 spring semester, the 1996 fall semester, the 1997 spring semester, and the 1997 fall semester. Full
year exchanges for both inbound and outbound students may take place during the 1996-97 academic year.



Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Secondary School Exchange Initiative, as originally
authorized in the Freedom Support Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-391). It is anticipated that $5 million will be allotted
to this program. However, grants are subject to the availability of funds in Fiscal Year 1995.

Programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines as outlined in the Solicitation Package.




ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/P-95-24.
This is a request for proposals only for the program models described above. Requests for proposals in support of other
youth exchange programs with the NIS are being published separately.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity''
should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle.



Overview



The purpose of this program is to provide the opportunity for American students to study at a school and experience
life with a host family and its community in one of the 12 Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, and, to
sponsor students from countries of the former Soviet Union to study at an American school and experience life with
a host family and its community in the U.S. Grant funding is also intended to provide avenues that will enhance the students'
understanding of each country's political, social, and cultural and ethnic diversity; to promote the exchange of
ideas; and to foster long-term friendships. The countries of the NIS are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrogyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.



Guidelines



This program has four components. Please note that each component is independent of the other and is not subject to
reciprocity. However, applicants may opt to apply for any component or a combination of any or all four.



A. Outbound Semester



This component will give American high-school students a chance to live with a host family and study at the secondary
school level in an NIS country for a period of no less than three months.



B. Inbound Semester



This component provides opportunities for NIS high school students to live with a host family and study at secondary
level institutions for one academic semester in the U.S.



C. Academic Year Outbound



This component provides opportunities for American high school students to study for a full year in one of the countries
of the former Soviet Union, and to more fully experience the life and culture of a host family and its community.



D. Academic Year Inbound



This component provides the opportunity for students from the former Soviet Union to study for a full year at an American
high school, and to more fully experience the life and culture of a host family and its community.

There is no prescribed formula for either component of the program. However, organizations should encourage students
to participate in extracurricular activities as well as provide students with community based activities. Also,
organizations have the option to disperse students widely or concentrate groups of students in regional clusters.
The purpose of clustering is to facilitate periodic gatherings for ongoing orientation, excursions and cultural
programming, as well as supervision and feedback. Organizations should identify in their proposals the target regions,
states and/or communities in which placements will be sought. Regardless of the placement plan, organizations may
propose periodic gatherings of students locally, regionally or nationally.

Grantee organizations working with their offices overseas and/or NIS partners will: Recruit and select students
based on merit using their own criteria; arrange for their placement in schools; select and orient host families;
make all travel and logistical arrangements; conduct orientation sessions; conduct re-entry and debriefing sessions;
supervise students, solve problems, and provide counseling as needed; develop a mechanism for the transfer of academic
credit and/or the certification of school attendance; interact with the schools on an ongoing basis; and evaluate
the program's success. Proposals should succinctly describe how these elements will be handled, with special attention
to the following factors:




_Organizations must demonstrate the capacity to secure quality homestays and school placements for the number of
students on which they are bidding in conformance with the regulations governing J visas for inbound secondary school
students.

_The proposal should include a description of the process the organization uses to identify and screen potential
host families, as well as its system for making school placements.

_Proposals using the cluster method should: Specify the cluster size and likely locations; and include a description
of how clustering will affect the program, such as scheduling periodic gatherings of the students. A sample schedule
of gatherings and topics or themes to be addressed should be included.

_An organization using the dispersal method should include a justification for not using the cluster model and explain
its placement philosophy; and if planning period gatherings the proposal should include a tentative itinerary for
a sample meeting.

_Inbound students should be sufficiently proficient in English upon arrival in the U.S. to function in a high-school
environment. No USIA grant funding will be provided for English training under this program. Preference will be given
to proposals that include language skills as a selection criterion for American students going to the NIS. Applicant
organizations with alternative approaches to language qualifications should discuss them in the proposal.

or activity in order to facilitate USIA decisions on funding. Cost-sharing is encouraged and may be in the form of allowable

Review Process



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines stated herein and in the Solicitation Package. Eligible
proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will also be reviewed
by the Agency contracts office, as well as the Agency's Area Office and the USIA post overseas, where appropriate.
Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel or by other Agency elements. Funding decisions
are at the discretion of the USIA Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority
for grant awards resides with the USIA grants officer. 



Review Criteria



Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the criteria stated below. These
criteria are not rank ordered and all carry equal weight in the proposal evaluation:

1. 

Quality of the program idea: 

 Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, precision, and relevance to Agency's mission and the program
idea as described above. 

2. 

Program planning: 

Detailed agenda and relevant work plan should demonstrate substantive undertakings and logistical capacity. Agenda
and plan should adhere to the program overview and guidelines described above. Proposals should also clearly demonstrate
how students will be selected on the basis of merit and the qualifications needed for a successful program. 

3. 

Ability to achieve program objectives: 

Objectives should be reasonable, feasible, and flexible. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution
will meet the program's objectives and plan. 

4. 

Multiplier effect/impact: 

Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, including maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual linkages. 

5. 

Support of diversity: 

Proposals should demonstrate the recipient's commitment to promoting the awareness and understanding of diversity
throughout the program. This can be accomplished through documentation (such as a written statement or account)
summarizing past and/or ongoing activities and efforts that further the principle of diversity within both the organization
and the program activities. 

6. 

Institutional capacity: 

Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the program or project's
goals. 

7. 

Institution's record/ability: 

Proposals should demonstrate an institutional record of successful exchange programs, including responsible
fiscal management and full compliance with all reporting requirements for past Agency grants as determined by USIA's
Office of Contracts. The Agency will consider the past performance of prior recipients and the demonstrated potential
of new applicants. 

8. 

Follow-on activities: 

Proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity (without USIA support) which ensures that USIA
supported programs are not isolated events.

9. 

Project evaluation: 

Proposals should include a plan to evaluate the success of the program, both as the activities unfold and at its conclusion.
USIA recommends that the proposal include a draft survey questionnaire or other technique, plus a description of
a methodology to use to link outcomes to original project objectives. Grantee organizations/institutions will
be expected to submit intermediate reports after each project component is concluded or quarterly reports, whichever
is less frequent. 

10. 

Cost-effectiveness: 

The overhead and administrative components of the proposal, including salaries and honoraria, should be kept as
low as possible. All other items should be necessary and appropriate. 

11. 

Cost-sharing: 

Proposals should maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding
contributions. 

12. 

Value to U.S.-partner country relations: 

Proposed projects should receive positive assessments by USIA's geographic area desk and overseas officers of program
need, potential impact, and significance in the partner country(ies).



Notice



The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory
information provided by the Agency that contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP does
not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government. The needs of the program may require the award to be
reduced, revised, or increased. Final awards cannot be made until funds have been appropriated by Congress, allocated
and committed through internal USIA procedures. 



Notification



All applicants will be notified of the results of the review process on or about March 24, 1995. Awards made will be subject
to periodic reporting and evaluation requirements.

Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 217  Thursday, November 10, 1994  Notices









<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed priority. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes a priority under the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind program.
The Secretary may use this priority for fiscal year (FY) 1995 and subsequent years. The Secretary takes this action
to focus Federal financial assistance on States that do not currently have projects funded under this program. The
priority is intended to increase the number of States participating in this program. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains one proposed priority under the Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind
program. Grants under this program are authorized by section 752(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), as amended.
The expenditure of grant funds under this program is governed by the regulations in 34 CFR Part 367, which were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41910). 



The purpose of this program is to support projects that provide to older individuals who are blind any of the independent
living services that are described in 34 CFR 367.3(b); conduct activities that will improve or expand services for
these individuals; and conduct activities to help improve public understanding of the problems of these individuals.


This program is an important part of the National Education Goals. This programs supports the National Education
Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary
to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 

Any designated State agency (DSA) that meets the requirements in 34 CFR 367.2 is eligible to receive an award under
this program. A DSA's application for funds under this program must contain the assurances required by 34 CFR 367.11
and any other agreements, assurances, and information that the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out
this program. In addition, section 21 of the Act requires that projects funded under this program must demonstrate
how they will address, in whole or in part, the needs of older individuals who are blind and are from minority backgrounds.


The Secretary will announce the final priority in a notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priority will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of
the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priority,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to meeting
applicable rulemaking requirements. 






Note: 

This notice of proposed priority does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priority. 



Priority 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priority. The Secretary proposes to fund under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority:




Background 


The Department funded projects in 45 States in fiscal year 1994 to provide independent living services for older individuals
who are blind. The Secretary is interested in supporting projects in States that do not currently have projects funded
under this program. This priority would increase the number of States providing services to older individuals who
are blind under this program. 



Priority 


Projects must provide services to older individuals who are blind in States that do not currently have projects funded
under this program. 



Intergovernmental Review 


This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.


In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program. 



Invitation To Comment 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding this proposed priority. 

All comments submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment
period, in Room 3326, Mary Switzer Building, 330 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C., between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and

Management of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride (UF

6

); Request for Recommendations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of request for recommendations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 DOE is preparing to assess several alternative strategies for the long-term management or use of depleted UF

6

. As part of that assessment, DOE is requesting recommendations from interested persons, industry, and other Government
agencies for potential uses for the depleted UF

6

 stored at the gaseous diffusion plants in Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, and at the Oak Ridge Reservation
in Tennessee, as well as for technologies that could facilitate the long-term management of this material. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
1. Background



Uranium is a naturally-occurring radioactive element containing different isotopes, notably Uranium-238 (U-238)
and Uranium-235 (U-235). The usability of uranium for controlled fission in nuclear chain reactions in most nuclear
reactors depends on increasing the proportion of the U-235 isotope in the material through an isotopic separation
process called enrichment. This process divides a stream of UF

6

 into separate streams_one enriched in U-235 and the other depleted in U-235. The first large scale enrichment process
was developed by the United States through the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. The process of enrichment used in the
United States is called ``gaseous diffusion,'' and has continued under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission
and its successor agencies, including DOE. On July 1, 1993, general responsibility for uranium enrichment was transferred
from DOE to the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). 

Gaseous diffusion was developed, on a large scale, first at the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee and, later, at plants
located near Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio. Using UF

6

 as feed material for the enrichment process, these plants produced highly enriched uranium for defense needs of the
United States, as well as low enriched uranium for use as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors. The production of highly
enriched uranium was discontinued in 1992 due to the reduced requirements of the U.S. defense programs. All diffusion
operations at the Oak Ridge facility ceased in 1985. 

A major consequence of the gaseous diffusion process is the accumulation of a significant amount of depleted UF

6

. This material is so named because it is depleted in the percentage of the U-235 isotope, as compared to the original
feed material. Most of this material is stored at the Paducah and Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plants and at the Oak
Ridge Reservation. The total amount in storage at these three sites is approximately 560,000 metric tons. Depleted
UF

6

 is a solid at ambient temperatures, and is stored in large cylinders holding approximately 14 tons each, stacked two
layers high, which are subject to regular inspection and maintenance. About 29,000 cylinders are stored at Paducah,
13,000 at Portsmouth, and 5,000 at Oak Ridge. 

2. DOE is publishing, elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

, an Advance Notice of Intent (ANOI) to prepare an EIS on alternative strategies for the long-term management of depleted
UF

6

. The first step in the process to consider alternative approaches is this Request to the public, industry, and other
Government agencies for information and suggestions for potential uses for depleted UF

6

 and/or technologies that could facilitate the long-term management of the material. This Request will help to ensure
that the resulting long-range management strategy will consider all reasonable alternatives. For purposes of responding
to this Request, current regulatory requirements should not be considered a barrier to recommended uses or technologies.
DOE will evaluate each submission to determine if it should be included as a reasonable alternative in the EIS, which
will assess the environmental impacts of the various alternative management strategies.

3. DOE requests from the public, industry, and other Government agencies, their suggestions and recommendations
on the following: 

 A. 

Uses or applications of products or materials that use any form of depleted uranium. 

Such uses or applications could be for the depleted uranium in its current chemical form, for any of its individual
components, for either the uranium or fluorine in some other chemical or physical form, or products made from any form
or compound of depleted UF

6

 including alloys, cements, or other materials. Suggested uses and applications should not be limited to those that
only DOE or another Government agency might pursue. The Department is interested in all possible uses or applications
for the depleted UF

6

, whether by the public or the private sector. With the suggestions, the Department requires as much of the following
information as possible: 

1. A description of the use or application, including a design description and/or flow sheet; material, fabrication,
product, and other specifications; and resulting wastes or effluents; 

2. The potential annual and total usage; 

3. The technical status of the use or application (that is, 

whether it is standard industrial practice; demonstrated on a 

bench or small scale, but not on an industrial scale; engineering, materials, or design development needed; etc.);


4. Facilities, equipment, other materials, and labor required; 

5. Environmental and health and safety approvals required; 

6. Any Government participation or funding required; 

7. Estimated cost, including research, development and demonstration; construction; operations; decontamination;
decommissioning; basis for estimates; and assumptions; product value, if any; and 

8. Proposed schedule including, research, development and demonstration; and operations. 

B. 

Technologies that could facilitate the long-term management of the depleted uranium. 

The Department requires as much of the following information as possible concerning the recommended technology:


1. The environmental, health and safety, and economic characteristics; 

2. A description of the technology and any processes or 

treatment, including a design description and/or flow sheet; material, fabrication, product, and other specifications;
and resulting wastes or effluents; 

3. The status of the technology and any required research, development or demonstration; 

4. Materials balance information and chemical composition of any wastes produced; 

5. Labor requirements for both construction and operation; 

6. Timing of research, development and demonstration; 

construction; and operation; 

7. Factors that might limit siting choices; 

8. Facilities, equipment, or materials required; and 

9. Estimated cost, including research, development and demonstration; construction; operations; product value,
if any; decontamination; decommissioning; basis for estimates; and assumptions. 

4. If any of the information supplied to the Department is proprietary, privileged and confidential commercial or
financial information, a trade secret, or otherwise exempt from public disclosure, it should be so designated and
the Department will protect this information in accordance with its standard procedures as prescribed in 10 CFR 1004.11
or other applicable law. The title page of the information should be marked with the restriction cited in the regulation.
Each page to be so restricted should be marked with the following legend: 

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to 

the restriction on the title page. 

5. A DOE Laboratory will prepare a report, based on evaluations by independent experts, on the responses to the request
for recommendations. After review of the laboratory report, responses DOE considers reasonable will be included
as alternatives for which environmental impacts will be assessed in the EIS. DOE will also initiate a study of the life
cycle costs of each EIS alternative. That study will also be considered, along with the final EIS, when DOE selects
a strategy from among these alternatives. 

6. This Request is solely for the information described above and is not for the purpose of obtaining recommendations
and/or proposals for research, development, and demonstration to be funded by the Government. 

7. Except as provided in paragraph 4, the written submissions from the public, industry, and other Government agencies
will be made available for public review at DOE Public Reading Room located in Room 1E-190 at 1000 Independence
Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20585. 

8. Throughout this process, opportunities for public participation will be provided to discuss technologies submitted.
Comments will be requested on the criteria that the technical experts will use to evaluate responses to this Request
for Recommendations. 

9. In addition to the ANOI, DOE intends in the future to publish in the 

Federal Register

, a notice of intent to begin the scoping process for the preparation of the EIS on the selection of a strategy for the
long-term management of the depleted uranium hexafluoride. 

 


Issued in Washington, D.C. on this 26th day of October, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Alternative Strategies for the Long-Term Management </DOCTITLE>

of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride Resources 

at Several Geographic Locations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy is providing advance notice of its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The environmental impact statement will assess the potential
environmental impacts of alternative strategies for the long-term management or uses of depleted uranium hexafluoride
(UF

6

) resources currently stored at Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. 



This environmental impact statement will consider general strategy options, including the general impacts of siting
potential facilities or transporting materials to or from such facilities. In addition, such analyses would focus
on those issues that would affect strategy selection, such as consolidation at one site. The specific environmental
impacts of the transportation of materials or impacts from the actual siting of any projects that would result from
strategy selection would be further assessed by any necessary project NEPA documents to follow. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Depleted UF

6

 is stored as a solid compound of uranium and fluorine in large cylinders. It is produced by an enrichment process that
divides a single stream of UF

6

 into two separate streams_one enriched in uranium-235 and one depleted in uranium-235. The enriched UF

6

 is withdrawn from the process and used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. The depleted UF

6

 is withdrawn from the process and stored in large cylinders. 



The purpose of the environmental impact statement is to assess the potential impacts of a range of technological or
market options related to the management of depleted UF

6

 (currently stored at Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee), including use, reuse, conversion,
or disposal, and to select a strategy for the long-term management of such depleted UF

6

 in light of the changed missions and functions. Should the Department of Energy develop any proposal in the future
to use any fraction of the depleted UF

6

 inventory for its own research or other activity, that proposal would be the subject of a separate NEPA document, and
would not affect this notice. 

The environmental impact statement will focus on the Department of Energy's depleted UF

6

 stored at the Paducah, Portsmouth, and Oak Ridge sites. Other forms of depleted uranium (e.g., uranium oxides and
uranium metal) and depleted UF

6

 used or stored at other sites would not be analyzed in the environmental impact statement since they exist only in small
quantities (taken all together they total about 7 percent of the quantity of the subject depleted UF

6

), would not affect strategy selection, and would involve different management and potentially different uses.
Should the Department propose an action that involves these other forms of depleted uranium, such a proposal would
receive appropriate NEPA review. 



The Department of Energy is publishing elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

 a Request for Recommendations for potential uses for the d
