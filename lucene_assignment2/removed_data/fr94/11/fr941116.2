DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE



Forest Service

DASH Mining Project; Humboldt National Forest, Elko County, NV



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will be directing the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for the proposed development of an open pit and underground gold mining project in Elko County, Nevada. This
EIS will be prepared by contract and funded by the proponent, Independence Mining Company Inc. (IMC).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

IMC has submitted to the Humboldt National Forest, a Proposed Plan of Operations (POO) for additional mining activities
at its Jerritt Canyon Mine in Elko County, Nevada. The POO describes the proposed mining development activities and
operational and reclamation procedures for the DASH Mining Project. The proposal includes developing two open pits
and mining of reserves by underground methods. Waste rock dumps, soil stockpiles, pit backfills, ore stockpiles,
haul roads and support facilities would also be developed. Ore would be processed at the existing Jerritt Canyon Millsite
located on BLM administered lands adjacent to the project site. The proposal would affect approximately 700 acres
of public and private lands. Preliminary internal scoping has identified several issues which would be addressed
in the analysis process. The following list of issues is not intended to be all inclusive. They are: impacts to ground
and surface water resources; impacts to grazing resources; impacts to Waters of the United States including wetlands;
mine economics; threatened, endangered, and sensitive plant and wildlife species; and visual resources. These
issues and any others identified during the scoping process may be used to develop alternatives to the proposed action.
In addition, the No Action alternative will be considered in the analysis.



Public participation is important during the EIS scoping process. As part of the scoping process, the Forest Service
will be seeking information and comments from Federal, State, County and local agencies and other individuals or
organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed actions. This input will be used in the preparation
of the draft EIS and final EIS.

Several government agencies will be invited to participate in this project as cooperating or participating agencies.
These agencies include, but are not limited to, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Nevada Division of Wildlife, and
Elko County Board of Commissioners. In addition to the Plan of Operations, various Federal, State, and local permits
and licenses may be required to implement the proposed action. These may include, but are not limited to, a Section
404 permit, Water Pollution Control Permit, Reclamation Permit for Mining Operations, and a General Discharge Permit
for Stormwater.

The Forest Service is the lead agency for this project and R.M. ``Jim'' Nelson, Acting Forest Supervisor of the Humboldt
National Forest is the responsible official. He will make a decision to approve the proposed Plan of Operations or
one of the alternatives analyzed. IMC's rights under the 1872 Mining Law as amended, applicable Forest Service regulations
and the Humboldt National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (1986) will be taken into account throughout the
analysis.

The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and be available for review
in June of 1995. At that time, EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

.

The comment period on the Draft EIS will be at least 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in
the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact stage but that are not raised
until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns
on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It
is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the
adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated or discussed in
the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

<DOCTITLE>Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Comprehensive Management Plan Amendment, Wallowa-Whitman National Forest,
Baker and Wallowa Countries in Oregon and Adams, Idaho, and Nez Perce Counties in Idaho </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the USDA, Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to amend
the Land and Resource Management Plan to incorporate new and modified management direction in the Hells Canyon National
Recreation Area (HCNRA) Comprehensive Management Plan (CMP). The EIS will tier to the Wallowa-Whitman Land and Resource
Management Plan (Forest Plan) & Final EIS for the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The HCNRA CMP is incorporated
into the Forest Plan.



The need for action is based on: Forest Service monitoring and evaluation reports indicating a need for change in programmatic
direction to ensure resource protection pursuant to the HCNRA Act; alignment of programmatic direction with new
private and public land use regulations (36 CFR part 292); revised Forest Service directives; changed social values;
and agency emphasis on ecosystem sustainability. 

The purpose of the action is to amend existing programmatic direction within the Forest Plan and CMP to align management
goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, management area direction, and monitoring and evaluation with the
intent of the Act establishing the Hells Canyon NRA (Pub. L. 94-199). 

The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest invites written comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis in addition
to comments already received as a result of local and regional public participation activities (meetings, newsletters,
surveys) in the past. 

The agency also gives notice of the full environmental analysis and decision-making process that will occur on the
proposal so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.


 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest proposes to amend the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan)
to modify management direction for the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (HCNRA) and affirm continuation of
other existing management direction. The planning process will be guided by the National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA) with implementation scheduled for January 1, 1996. 




This modified or affirmed management direction will provide programmatic management direction for the next 10 to
15 years. The changes will reflect the intent of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act (HCNRA Act) (Pub. L.
94-199), public and private land use regulations (LUR) (36 CFR part 292), Forest Service directives, changing
social values, agency emphasis on ecosystem sustainability, new information and research findings, and results
from the monitoring and evaluation process. 

The Eastside Ecosystem Management Project, (EEMP) headquartered in Walla Walla, Washington, is expected to produce
management direction on a large landscape scale based upon ecosystem management concepts. The Wallowa-Whitman
National Forest expects to coordinate with the EEMP project managers to ensure that those concepts are brought forward
for analysis in this NEPA process. 

The scope of the proposed action focuses on only those specific items identified for needing change through the monitoring
and evaluation process. Reviewers are encouraged to review the CMP Monitoring and Evaluating Report (on file at the
Forest Supervisors Headquarters) for a complete understanding of the existing CMP management direction that is
affirmed or proposed for change or deletion. 

The proposed action recognizes the resolution of issues through recent NEPA decisions for the Wild and Scenic Snake
River Recreation Management Plan, Imnaha Wild and Scenic River Management Plan, Noxious Weed Management, Prescribed
Natural Fire Program, and Outfitting and Guiding for Cougar and Bear that provide improved management direction
for the HCNRA. The issues surrounding these previous decision will not be considered in this EIS unless specifically
addressed in the proposed action or the scoping or analysis process identifies new issues not resolved in those previous
NEPA analyses. 

The proposed action would integrate management direction for the HCNRA within the framework of Forest Plan decisions
and would establish: 



Management Goals 



Goals are a concise statement that describe a desired condition to be achieved sometime in the future (36 CFR 219.3).
Goal statements form the principal basis from which objectives are developed. Goal statements are intended to implement
and perpetuate the intent of the HCNRA Act and LUR. 



Management Objectives 



HCNRA management objectives would be established to describe the incremental progress that is expected to be made
over a ten-year period toward the management goals/desired conditions listed above. These objectives would provide
a basis to estimate quantities of services and accomplished acres that are expected during the Forest and Rangeland
Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) ten-year planning periods (36 CFR 219.11 (b)) to achieve the desired conditions.




Standards and Guidelines 



Standards and guidelines (S&Gs) are principles that specify desired conditions or levels of environmental
quality that facilitate the achievement of management goals and objectives of the HCNRA Act and LUR. 

Specific management goals, management objectives, and standards and guidelines are presented as follows in relationship
to the objectives set forth in Section 7 of the HCNRA Act: 

HCNRA Act Section 7. * * * the Secretary shall administer the recreation area in accordance with the
laws, rules and regulations applicable to the national forests for public outdoor recreation in a manner compatible
with the objectives set forth in Section 7 of the HCNRA Act.

Management Area 10_Dispersed Recreation/Forage


Modify the title and management area description to reflect the changes embodied in the public LURs. The title of this
management area would be changed to ``Dispensed Recreation/Semi-Primitive.'' 
Modify vegetation S&Gs for forage allocation and utilization standards to ensure achievement of the HCNRA-wide
goals and objectives. 
Modify access S&Gs to establish road densities to ensure achievement of the HCNRA-wide goals and objectives.



Management Area 11_Dispersed Recreation/Timber Management


Modify the title and management area description to reflect the changes embodied in the public LURs. The title of this
management area would be changed to ``Dispersed Recreation/Roaded Natural-Roaded.'' 
Modify the management area description to reflect the intent of the public LURs.
Modify vegetation S&Gs for forage allocation and utilization standards to ensure achievement of the HCNRA-wide
goals and objectives. 
Modify access S&Gs to establish road densities to ensure achievement of the HCNRA-wide goals and objectives.



Management Area 12_Research Natural Areas


Modify vegetation S&Gs for forage allocation and utilization standards to ensure achievement of the HCNRA-wide
goals and objectives. 
Develop S&Gs for scientific research consistent with the objectives for these areas. 


Management Area 16_Administrative and Recreation Site Retention


Identify sites for allocation to administrative and recreation site retention compatible primary objectives of
the HCNRA Act and compatible with management area objectives. 
Develop S&Gs for management, development, and maintenance of administrative and recreation sites, including
ROS classes. 


Monitoring and Evaluation


The monitoring and evaluation program for the HCNRA would be refined to be compatible with the above changes in management
direction to ensure that the goals and objectives for the HCNRA are achieved; assess the effectiveness of achieving
desired conditions and results; ensure quality consistency and cost effectiveness of monitoring data and information
in order to support maintenance of changes in management direction; and maintain viable Forest Plans. 
The existing Forest Plan Monitoring and Implementation Plan and CMP Monitoring Plan would serve as the foundation
in which to develop a refined monitoring plan that would best monitor the implemented management plan. The format
for each monitoring element, whether it is implementation, effectiveness, or validation monitoring would address
the following:



_Monitoring Goal
_Purpose of Monitoring
_Unit of Measure
_Threshold of Variability
_Frequency of Monitoring
_Costs
_Responsibilities 



This EIS will tier to the Final EIS and Forest Plan. The CMP is incorporated into the Forest Plan. The CMP provides the
programmatic management direction for the HCNRA. The Forest Plan provides goals and objectives, standards and guidelines,
management area direction, and monitoring and evaluation for the various lands on the Forest and HCNRA. Both the Forest
Plan and CMP provide programmatic management direction for site-specific management practices that will be utilized
during the implementation of the Forest Plan and CMP.
The HCNRA consists of an estimated 652,488 acres. The HCNRA is comprised of the following management areas: wilderness,
wild and scenic rivers, dispersed recreation/native vegetation, forage, dispersed recreation/timber management,
research natural areas, and developed recreation and administrative facilities. 
The analysis will consider a range of alternatives, including no-action.
Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis, beginning with the scoping
process (40 CFR 1501.7). The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal,
State, local agencies and other individuals, organizations, or governments who may be interested in or affected
by the proposed project. This input will be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:
1. Identifying potential issues. 
2. Identifying major issues to be analyzed in depth. 
3. Identifying issues which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis. 
4. Exploring additional alternatives based on themes which will be derived from issues recognized during scoping
activities.
5. Identifying potential environmental effects of this project and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and cumulative
effects and connected actions). 
6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. 
7. Notifying interested publics of opportunities to participate through meetings, personal contacts, or written
comment. Keeping the public informed through the media and/or written material (i.e., newsletters, correspondence,
etc.). 
The draft EIS will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is expected to be available for public
review by April, 1995. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of
availability in the 

Federal Register

. The final EIS is expected to be available for public review by September, 1995. 
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. 
First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation in the environmental
review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived
or dismissed by the court if not raised until after completion of the final EIS. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d. 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 30-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully be considered and responded to in the final
EIS. 
To be most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement
or the merit of the alternatives discussed. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points. 
Public workshops are scheduled in Boise and Grangeville, Idaho and Enterprise and Portland, Oregon on November 28
through December 1. Please contact Kurt Wiedenmann, Planning Team Leader, at (503) 523-1296 for additional
information. 
The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by September, 1995. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding the proposal.
R.M. Richmond, Forest Supervisor, is the Responsible Official. As the Responsible Official, he will decide whether
to implement the proposal or a different alternative. The Responsible Official will document the decision and reasons
for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to Forest Service Appeal Regulations (36
CFR part 217).

Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Columbia River Channel Deepening Feasibility Study, Oregon-Washington



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action is to determine the feasibility of improving navigation in the existing Columbia and Lower Willamette
Rivers Federal navigation project by potential modifications, including the potential deepening of up to 3 feet.



This feasibility study has been authorized by Congress pursuant to appeals by local port authorities for navigation
assistance.

The existing navigation channel depth does not allow some of the deeper draft vessels using the channel to fully load.
Prospective traffic and potential economies of scale are such that the lower Columbia River ports could operate more
safely, effectively and economically with a deeper channel.

The EIS is being prepared to address the comparative impacts for alternative actions related to navigation channel
modifications.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed study, authorized under House Document 452, Eighty-Seventh Congress, Second Session, is being conducted
to determine the feasibility for improvements to the existing Columbia and Lower Willamette Rivers deep-draft navigation
project. The study was modified by the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 1994 which specified that no alternatives
deeper than 43 feet would be considered and that a concurrent Dredged Material Management Study of the existing project
be conducted.


Alternatives identified in the reconnaissance phase study, public and agency comments and port authority input
include:
(1) Channel deepening ranging from 1 to 3 feet;

(2) One-way channel;

(3) Deepening selected reaches by increments ranging from 1 to 3 feet;

(4) Tiered channel with an outbound land deeper than the inbound lane;

(5) Development of a regional port closer to the mouth of the Columbia River;

(6) No action.

Existing upland and inwater disposal sites would be used for disposal of a large portion of material dredged for channel
deepening. New upland and inwater sites would be investigated for disposal of deepening and future maintenance dredging
material. The feasibility study and EIS will also address the long term effects of additional channel maintenance
dredging. EIS scoping will formally commence in November 1994 with the issuance of a scoping letter. Federal, state
and local agencies, Indian tribes and interested organizations and individuals will be asked to comment on the significant
issues related to the potential effects of the alternatives. Potentially significant issues to be addressed in the
EIS which are currently identified include: fisheries impacts (particularly anadromous species); wildlife impacts
at upland disposal sites; water quality impacts in the vicinity of port docks; salinity intrusion; indirect effects
from increased port dredging and modified shipping activity. Additional environmental review and consultation
requirements to be addressed in conjunction with the EIS include:

(1) Clean Water Act of 1977;

(2) Fish and Wildlife;

(3) Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended;

(4) Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended;

(5) Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended;

(6) Cultural Resources Acts;

(7) Executive Order 11988, Flood Plain Management, 24 May 1977;

(8) Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, 24 May 1977;

(9) Analysis of Impacts on Prime and Unique Farmlands.
Formal public meetings have been scheduled to obtain input from the general public.
Comments received at these meetings will be considered during preparation of the Feasibility Study/EIS. As previously
stated, a scoping letter will be issued in November 1994, providing additional opportunity for comment. The Draft
EIS is scheduled for public review in October 1997.

standards, or guidance on low-level radioactive waste management; the scope of planned studies for improving modeling
and predictive capability of low-level radioactive waste impacts; an assessment of studies for enhancing stability
of waste forms, deterring intrusion, and inhibiting radionuclide migration; and studies of enhanced volume reduction
methods. The Implementation Plan will also address an assessment of the safety merits and demerits of privatization
of facilities for low-level radioactive waste disposal for exclusive use by DOE.

The Department is taking steps to accelerate the completion of performance assessments for all active low-level
radioactive waste burial sites as required by DOE Order 5820.2A. The Department recognizes the importance of assessing
the potential cumulative impacts to the public health and safety and the environment of all low-level radioactive
waste facilities on a site, including waste disposed prior to 1988. We will address these issues in the Implementation
Plan for this recommendation.

We look forward to working closely with you and your staff to develop a responsive Implementation Plan. The Implementation
Plan will be forwarded to you in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2286d. If you have further questions please contact me or
Mr. Thomas Grumbly, Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management at (202) 586-7710.

<DOCTITLE>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., et al; Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and to Conduct Site
Visits </DOCTITLE>



November 9, 1994. 




The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) has received applications for new license (relicense) from
the current owners and operators of six existing hydropower projects located on the Hudson River and its tributaries,
the Sacandaga, Hoosic, and Mohawk rivers, in Warren, Saratgoa, Albany, Rensselaer, and Washington counties, New
York. The Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NiMO) filed applications for four projects: the E.J. West Project, FERC
No. 2318, located in Saratoga County on the Sacandaga River; the Hudson River Project, FERC No. 2482, consisting of
the Spier Falls and Sherman Island developments in Warren and Saratoga counties on the Hudson River; the Hoosic River
Project, FERC No. 2616, consisting of the Johnsonville and Schaghticoke developments in Rensselaer and Washington
counties on the Hoosic River, and the School Street Project, FERC No. 2539, located Albany and Saratoga counties on
the Mohawk River. Finch, Pruyn and Company, Inc. filed an application for the Glens Falls Project, FERC No. 2385, located
in Warren and Saratoga counties on the Hudson River. Moreau Manufacturing Corporation filed an application for the
Feeder Dam Project, FERC No. 2554, located in Warren and Saratoga counties on the Hudson River. 

Upon review of the applications, supplemental filings, and intervenor submittals, the Commission staff has concluded
that relicensing these six projects would constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment. 

Moreover, given the location and interaction of the projects, staff is considering preparing one multi-project
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that describes and evaluates the probable impacts of the applicants' proposed
and alternative operating procedures, new generating facilities, environmental enhancement measures, and associated
facilities for the eight developments that comprise the six hydropower projects. 

The staffs EIS will consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of relicensing the six projects,
and will include economic and financial analyses. 

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
by analyzed by the Commission staff and considered in a final EIS. 

One element of the EIS process is scoping and site visits. These activities are initiated early to: 

 Identify reasonable alternative operational procedures and environmental enhancement measures that should
be evaluated in the EIS; 

 Identify significant environmental issues related to the operation of the existing projects; 

 Determine the depth of the analysis for issues that will be discussed in the EIS; and 

 Identify resource issues that are of lesser importance and, consequently, do not require detailed analysis
in the EIS. 



Site Visits 



Site visits to the eight developments that comprise the six projects will be held during the three-day period, December
12, 13, and 14, 1994. The purpose of these visits is for interested persons to observe existing area resources and site
conditions, learn the locations of proposed new facilities, and discuss project operational procedures with representatives
of NiMO, Finch, Pruyn and Company, Inc., Moreau Manufacturing Corporation, and the Commission. 

For details concerning the site visits, please contact Jerry Sabattis of NiMO in Syracuse, New York at (315) 428-5582,
David Manny of Finch, Pruyn and Company, Inc. in Glens Falls, New York at (518) 793-2541, and Kenneth Oriole of
Moreau Manufacturing Corporation in Syracuse, New York at (315) 471-2881. 



Scoping Meetings 



The Commission staff will conduct two scoping meetings: the evening meeting will be designed to obtain input from
the general public, while the morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. These meetings will be held
in Glens Falls, New York, sometime in March, 1995. The dates and locations of these meetings will be the subject of future
announcement. 

For further information, please contact Edward R. Meyer in Washington D.C. at (202) 208-7998.

<DOCTITLE>Big Sandy Gas Co., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



November 7, 1994 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Big Sandy Gas Co. 



[Docket No. CP95-46-000] 



Take notice that on October 31, 1994, Big Sandy Gas Company (Big Sandy), 15375 Memorial Drive, Houston, Texas 77079,
filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP95-46-000, requesting that the Commission declare
that Big Sandy's proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of certain natural gas gathering systems and other
facilities currently owned by CNG Transmission (CNGT) would not subject Big Sandy or any portion of its facilities
or services to the jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in the application on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Big Sandy seeks a declaratory order finding that the facilities Cabot wishes to acquire from CNGT will be gathering
facilities exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the NGA. CNGT filed on October 21,
1994 in Docket No. CP95-32-000, a proposal to abandon these facilities located in Boone, Kanawha, and
Raleigh Counties, West Virginia. While Cabot is the party having agreed to purchase these assets from CNGT, the parties
anticipate that if this petition is granted, the pipeline and compressor facilities will actually be conveyed to
Cabot's subsidiary Big Sandy, and the reserves and wells will be conveyed to Cabot. 

The Commission, in Docket Nos. CP93-198-000 and CP93-200-000, issued an order on July 21,
1994, (68 FERC 61,194, currently pending rehearing) preliminarily approving CNGT's application to abandon certain
other gathering facilities Big Sandy proposes to acquire from CNGT. In that same order, the Commission declared that
upon their acquisition by Big Sandy, the gathering facilities would be exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction
under the NGA (``Big Sandy I''). 

Big Sandy says that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (Cabot) and that Big Sandy owns
no jurisdictional facilities. 

Big Sandy argues that the facilities to be transferred to Big Sandy meet the physical and non-physical criteria for
determining gathering as set forth in 

Farmland Industries, Inc., 

23 FERC 61,063 (1983), as modified by subsequent Commission orders. Big Sandy states that the diameters and lengths
of the facilities to be acquired are consistent with the conclusion that the facilities are primarily gathering facilities.
Most of the lines are less than 1 mile in length. More than three-fourths of the pipe to be acquired are 12 inches or less
in diameter. Most is six inches or less in diameter. There are no processing plants on or connected to the facilities.
There is one compressor station, Whitesville, that functions as a field compressor. The wellhead pressure feeding
into the Whitesville System is very low, operating at approximately 50 pounds per square inch-gauge. The Whitesville
Compressor Station is at the terminus of a portion of the facilities to be acquired. It is in the middle of another CNGT
production area and is connected to CNGT's 12'' TL-263 line which, Big Sandy argues, likely would also be found
to be gathering. Big Sandy says that when considered in the context of the entire area in which they are located, the
facilities are in the central portion of a producing region surrounded by and connected to wells and other gathering
lines. Big Sandy states that the system is akin to a ``spider web'' and that the facilities to be acquired do not even
comprise the whole spider web. Only a part of CNGT's facilities in this area are being acquired by Big Sandy. 

With respect to non-physical criteria, Big Sandy notes that it operates exclusively in West Virginia, and when it
acquires the Big Sandy I facilities that are currently pending rehearing, it will own exclusively gathering facilities.
Big Sandy argues that in 

Koch Hydrocarbon Co., 

56 FERC 61,374, 62,432 (1991), and 

Tom Brown, Inc., 

57 FERC 61,103, 61,400 (1990), the Commission declared both facilities in question to be gathering facilities, noting
that Koch previously had limited its service in the area to gathering, and that Brown had limited its activities in
the area to exploration and production. Further, Big Sandy states that the Commission found as well that Brown neither
owned nor provided any jurisdictional service nor owned any jurisdictional facilities.

Big Sandy has agreed in writing to provide non-jurisdictional gathering services on an open-access basis for all
of CNGT's existing customers at rates no higher than those currently being charged by CNGT. Big Sandy says that it intends
to operate the facilities to be acquired in Big Sandy I in conjunction with the facilities that are the subject of the
instant petition. As a result, Big Sandy states that shippers shall only pay a single rate for gathering services regardless
of the distance and facilities over which the gas must flow. Big Sandy says that those entities now relying upon service
will be assured of continuing to receive such service by execution of a gathering agreement neither materially different
from nor more expensive than they currently receive from CNGT. As for service to Hope Gas, Inc., (Hope) an affiliate
distribution company with sales meters on the facilities to be acquired, Big Sandy states that service will be continued
through a gas sales contract between a Big Sandy affiliate and Hope. 



Comment date: 

November 28, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. 



[Docket No. CP95-47-000] 



Take notice that on November 2, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Company (Williston Basin), 200 North Third Street,
Suite 300, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP95-47-000
pursuant to Section 157.211(a)(1) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization
to deliver natural gas to Montana-Dakota Utilities Company (Montana-Dakota) under the blanket certificate issued
in Docket No. CP82-487-000, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection. 

Williston Basin proposes to transport up to 50 Mcf per day of natural gas to Montana-Dakota, a local distribution company,
for ultimate use by the residents of the Trestle Valley Heights Subdivision (Trestle alley), southwest of Minot,
North Dakota. Williston Basin would provide natural gas transportation deliveries to Montana-Dakota under Rate
Schedules FT-1 and/or IT-1 of Williston Basin's FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1. The delivery
point for the gas to serve Trestle Valley is an existing tap, so there would be no construction costs. 



Comment date: 

December 22, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



3. Williams Natural Gas Co.



[Docket No. CP95-48-000] 



Take notice that on November 2, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG), P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed
in Docket No. CP95-48-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to install a 4-inch tap, approximately 2,000
feet of 6-inch-diameter lateral pipeline, measuring and appurtenant facilities to deliver transportation gas
to Ag Processing Inc. (Ag Processing) in Buchanan County, Missouri, under WNG's blanket certificate issued in Docket
No. CP82-479-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request
that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

WNG proposes to install the facilities on WNG's 8-inch-diameter line XS-2 in Section 30, Township 57 South,
Range 35 West, Buchanan County, Missouri to deliver transportation gas to Ag Processing for its soybean processing
plant. The annual volume delivered is estimated by WNG to be approximately 126,000 Dth initially and increase to 1,440,000
Dth by the third year. The initial peak day volume is estimated by WNG to be 1,030 Dth and increase to 6,890 Dth by the third
year. WNG states that the total volume to be delivered to Ag Processing will not exceed the total volume authorized
prior to this request. WNG states the cost to construct the facilities is approximately $74,900 which will be reimbursed
by Ag Processing. 

WNG states that this change is not prohibited by an existing tariff, and that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish
the deliveries specified without detriment or disadvantage to its other customers. 

WNG also states that this proposal will not significantly affect a sensitive environmental area.

1. NorAm Gas Transmission Co. 



[Docket No. CP95-42-000] 



Take notice that on October 31, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed in Docket No. CP95-42-000 a request pursuant to   157.205, 157.208 and 157.216 of the
Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.208, 157.216) for authorization to construct
and operate facilities and to abandon facilities under NGT's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-384-000,


et al

., pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

NGT proposes to replace and rearrange certain marketing lateral segments located in Stephens County, Oklahoma.
NGT describes the pipe segments as generally being old and deteriorated.

1

 NGT advises that delivery points for two of Arkla's domestic customers and one 6-inch check meter on Line 10 would be
relocated to the new Line 10 segment. 





NGT states that the project would involve the installation of approximately 5,050 feet of 10-inch pipe (replacement
Line 10 segment) and 20 feet of 8-inch pipe (to connect Line ADT-8 to Line 11-3 at pipeline station no. 611+20).
NGT states that it would abandon in place the following: 

(1) Two segments of Line 10, totaling 5,034 feet of 6-inch pipe, 

(2) Two segments of Line 10-1, totaling 2,035 feet of 8-inch pipe, 

(3) A segment of Line 11-3, totaling 2,980 feet of 10-inch pipe, except for the Hell Creek crossing which would
be used as part of replacement Line 10,

2

 and 





(4) A segment of Line ADT-8, totaling 610 feet of 8-inch pipe. 

NGT explains that the project would permit it to consolidate the operations of the abandoned segments to continue
service within the existing certificated entitlement to Arkla, through the new 10-inch segment of Line 10. NGT estimates
that the total cost of the replacement facilities would be $244,743.

2. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. 



[Docket No. CP95-49-000] 



Take notice that on November 3, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252,
filed in Docket No. CP95-49-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205(b) and 157.212 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205(b) and 157.212) for authorization to operate three existing
delivery point facilities that were initially constructed under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978
(NGPA), all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

The request for authorization states that Tennessee has constructed a number of delivery points under Section 311(a)
of the NGA for use in the transportation of natural gas under Subpart B of Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations.
Since Tennessee now renders significant transportation of natural gas under its Subpart G blanket certificate,
it states it is imperative that maximum flexibility be attained so that its facilities can be used for the benefit of
all customers on Tennessee's system. 

Tennessee states that the location of the delivery points are in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana
and Albany County, New York. 

It is stated that delivery volumes through the existing delivery points would not impact Tennessee's peak day and
annual deliveries; that the proposed activity is not prohibited by its existing tariff; and that it has sufficient
capacity to accommodate the changes proposed herein without detriment or disadvantage to Tennessee's other customers.

<DOCTITLE>Koch Gateway Pipleline Co.; Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>



November 9, 1994.



Take notice that on October 27, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway), P.O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas
77251-1478, filed in Docket No. CP95-40-000 a request pursuant to   157.205 and 157.211
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.211) for authorization to acquire
a six-inch metering and regulating station from Gulf South Pipeline Company (Gulf South), under Koch Gateway's blanket
certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-430-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Koch Gateway states that the metering and regulating station is located on its Index 198-3 transmission line
in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. Koch Gateway proposes to acquire and operate as its own jurisdictional facility,
a skid-mounted dual six-inch metering and regulating station and appurtenances from Gulf South, an intrastate pipeline
company. The meter station currently serves Vista Chemical Corporation (Vista), and end user, near Lake Charles
in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana with natural gas deliveries under Koch Gateway's ITS Rate Schedule which was authorized
in Docket No. ST94-3043.

Koch Gateway states that the acquisition will not require any construction or ground disturbance. There is not to
be any impact on Koch Gateway's curtailment plan since there are no changes proposed in the existing level of service.
The service provided through these facilities will remain within the current entitlements provided in the existing
ITS agreement with Koch Gateway. The capacity is sufficient enough for Koch Gateway to render the proposed service
without detriment or disadvantage to its other existing customers.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Imidacloprid; </DOCTITLE>
Solicitation of Public Comment 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (hereafter
referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827-78-9) to treat up to 50,000
acres of tomatoes to control the sweet potato whitefly (also referred to as the silverleaf whitefly.) The Applicant
proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting
public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to Section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on tomatoes to control the sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly. Information
in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request.



Whiteflies have been a problem in the ``desert-cropping systems'' in California and Arizona for some time, but in
the late 1980s, a new strain was discovered, which appears to be much more prolific than the standard strain, and resistant
to many insecticides. Whiteflies are common on many wild and cultivated crops such as tomatoes, cotton, cucurbits
and solanaceae. The Applicant states that this pest first caused economic impacts in Florida in 1987, and since then,
its impacts have rapidly expanded over the total production area. This whitefly causes direct damage to the tomato
plant through its feeding activity and the production of honeydew which enhances sooty mold development. This pest
also causes a physiological disorder resulting in irregular ripening of fruit, believed to be caused by transmission
of a geminivirus. The Applicant claims that significant economic losses will occur without adequate control, which
is not being achieved with the currently registered compounds.

Along with this request, the Applicant has also requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical (fenpropathrin)
on tomatoes, also for control of whiteflies. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that
the imidacloprid would be applied at or near transplanting, as a soil-incorporated treatment; since imidacloprid
is a systemic, it would be taken up by the small tomato transplants, and protect them from whitefly feeding during this
early stage of development. The Applicant states that fenpropathrin, being nonsystemic, is only of use as a foliar
spray, which is of little value during the early phase of development, as there is limited leaf area at that time. Thus
the Applicant proposes that use of fenpropathrin be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment, to maintain
season-long control. The Applicant indicates that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar
spray, because its mode of action is such that resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid
will not support the use of this chemical further into the growing season for this reason. The Applicant claims that
without control of this pest, individual fields could experience 100 percent yield loss. Irregular ripening can
reduce yields by 36 to 100 percent; and direct feeding losses can be as much as 10 to 15 percent. 

The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.25 lb. (dry) active ingredient (16 fluid oz. of
product) per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on up to 50,000 acres of tomatoes. Therefore, use
under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 12,500 lbs. of active ingredient, or 6,250 gal.
of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on tomatoes, and an exemption
was issued for this use last year. Additionally, the Applicant requested, and was granted, specific exemptions for
the use of fenpropathrin for whitefly control in tomatoes for the past 4 years (this is the fifth consecutive year for
this request for fenpropathrin).

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require publication of a notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing the first food use of an active ingredient.
Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above.

The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by PMC Specialties Group, Inc., to conditionally
register four pesticide products containing a new active ingredient not included in any previously registered products
pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22160), which announced that PMC Specialties Group, Inc., 501 Murray Road, Cincinnati, OH
45217, had submitted four applications to conditionally register the pesticide products ReJeX-iT AP-50, ReJeX-iT
TP-40, ReJeX-iT MA, and ReJeX-iT AG-36 (File Symbols 58035-A, 58035-T, 58035-I, and 58035-O),~
containing the active ingredient methyl anthranilate (CAS No. 134-20-3) at 50, 40, 100, and 14.5 percent
respectively, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered products. 
~~~~~~~~~


The applications ~listed below were approved on September 16, 1994, for the following products: 

1. ReJeX-iT AP-50 for the reduction of bird activity on temporary pools of water, except those bordering airports
(EPA Reg. No. 58035-6). 

2. ReJeX-iT AP-40 for the reduction of bird activity on landfills, tailing ponds, and impoundments (EPA Reg. No. 58035-7).


3. ReJeX-iT MA for formulation use only of registered, end-use products for bird control (EPA Reg. No. 58035-8).


4. ReJeX-iT AG-36 for use to repel birds such as Canada geese from golf courses and other turf areas (EPA Reg. No. 58035-9).


A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do
not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration
period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of methyl anthranilate,
and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency
has considered the nature and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential
exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that
use of methyl anthranilate during the period of conditional registration will not cause any unreasonable adverse
effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is, in the public interest. 
Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 
These products are conditionally registered in accordance with FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(C). Only the first two studies
listed below are required for these products, except for ReJeX-iT AG-36 which requires all three studies. Within
1-year of registration, or October 1, 1995, the following studies must be submitted:

1. Avian Acute Oral (Guideline Reference Number 154-6).
2. Acute Freshwater Fish LC-

50

 (154-8).
3. Beneficial Insect (Honey Bee Acute Contact LD-

50

 Study (141-1). 

More detailed information on this conditional registration is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on methyl anthranilate.

A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703-305-5805).
Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed
to the Freedom of Information Office (A-101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Such requests should: (1) Identify
the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired.

 Notice of informational meeting on Draft Soil Screening Guidance. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will hold an informational meeting on December 1, 1994, to present a document
entitled ``Draft Soil Screening Guidance.'' This guidance is intended to serve as a tool to expedite the evaluation
of contaminated soils at sites addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA), commonly known as Superfund. While the guidance is intended to be used as a screening tool to determine
if further study is warranted at a site, it does not represent clean-up standards for a site. Such guidance is not intended
to have the force of a regulation and today's notice is not a proposed rule. A subsequent 

Federal Register

 notice, forthcoming in several weeks, will announce the availability of and seek public comment on this draft guidance
and a supporting Technical Background Document. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Introduction 


The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responds to uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances under the
authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980. CERCLA
or Superfund, as it is commonly known, requires that the response to hazardous substances be performed in accordance
with regulations found in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan or NCP. The NCP process
requires that a remedial investigation be performed to identify the nature and extent of contamination at National
Priorities List (NPL) sites. From sampling results, as well as site observations obtained in the field, specific
contaminants and exposure pathways of concern are identified and used in a baseline risk assessment performed to
determine whether remedial action is warranted.

1,2


Today's 

Federal Register

 notice announces an informational public meeting to introduce a draft of a new tool called the ``Draft Soil Screening
Guidance.'' This guidance may reduce significantly the time it takes to complete soil investigations and cleanup
actions, as well as improve the consistency of these actions across the nation. The draft guidance has been written
for remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) work at Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites.
This guidance on developing soil screening values is expected to assist site managers in quickly identifying contaminated
soil of potential concern and in screening out from further consideration those soils that do not warrant additional
study. 
The Draft Soil Screening Guidance will present three methods which may be used to develop risk based, soil screening
level values. These values are then compared to on-site soil contaminant levels. The framework provides the three
methods for developing soil screening levels, but focuses on a simple, site-specific approach. Areas of a site which
fall below such levels may be screened out from further assessment, while areas above the SSL values must undergo further
assessment. While the guidance is intended to be used as a screening tool to determine if further study is warranted
at a site, it does not represent clean-up standards for a site. The formulae and most of the exposure assumptions upon
which the draft guidance is based have been taken from the Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund

1,2

 and have been widely accepted in the Superfund program for a number of years.

<DOCTITLE>National Capacity Assessment Report; Availability of Draft </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 104(c)(9) of CERCLA requires states to provide an assurance in a contract or 
cooperative agreement of the availability of hazardous waste treatment or disposal capacity to 
manage the hazardous wastes expected to be generated within their State for 20 years before 
EPA can expend any Superfund remedial action Trust funds in the States. The 1993 Guidance 
for Capacity Assurance Planning (OSWER Directive 9010.02) presented a national approach for 
determining capacity to treat and dispose of hazardous wastes reasonably expected to be 
generated during this period. This notice announces the availability of the draft National 
Capacity Assessment Report. Based on the preliminary assessment that the draft Report 
presents, the Agency believes there is sufficient national capacity to manage all hazardous 
wastes projected to be generated through 2013. EPA will utilize the draft assessment, together 
with other data that becomes available, in evaluating whether the assurance requirement of 
CERCLA Section 104 (c)(9) has been met when entering into contracts or cooperative 
agreements with States. Based on the comments received on this draft Report, the Agency will 
modify, as appropriate, the National Assessment and make available any revised assessment by 
publishing a notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

. If any revised assessment identifies a 
shortfall in any management categories, those states contributing to the shortfall(s) will be 
notified by the Agency to submit additional information that addresses any identified 
shortfall(s). Methods for obtaining a copy of the draft Assessment Report are described below. 
The information collection activities for the 1993 Capacity Assurance Planning process have 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control Number 
2050-0099.

Exchange, Kansas City Board of Trade, MidAmerica Commodity Exchange and Singapore International Monetary Exchange.
These activities will be conducted world wide.




Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.




Applicant states that the Board previously has approved providing the proposed FCM execution, clearance and advisory
services with respect to nonfinancial commodity contracts. 

See

 Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993); 

J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994)(

J.P. Morgan

). Applicant has stated that Company would provide the proposed services in accordance with 

J.P. Morgan

, except that Company would provide FCM services to commodity pools that are owned or sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated
with, Applicant. 
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Applicant
believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular,
Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Applicant to offer its customers a broader
range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects
such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound
banking practices. 
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than December 2, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be
accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

not requested hearings. The agency has not, at this time, determined whether to grant the one pending hearing request
concerning Category IIIB injectable Poison Ivy Extract. The license at issue in this hearing request is not at this
time being revoked.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of January 23, 1985 (50 FR 3082), FDA announced its intention to revoke product licenses (hereinafter referred to
as the 1985 proposal), or the authorization of manufacturers to produce individual products under their licenses
for the manufacture of allergenic extracts, for any allergenic extract classified into Category IIIB. The proposed
action was based on the conclusions and recommendations of the Panel on Review of Allergenic Extracts (the Panel),
including the Panel's conclusions that data were insufficient to classify certain products as safe and effective
and that the products have an unfavorable benefit-to-risk potential. The conclusions and recommendations of the
Panel are contained in a report to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs which was reprinted in the 1985 proposal. Those
products with insufficient data and an unfavorable benefit-to-risk potential, which the Panel believed should
not continue to be marketed during the development of data to resolve whatever safety and effectiveness questions
exist, were classified in Category IIIB.
FDA also announced in the 1985 proposal that the Panel recommended that two products be classified into Category II
(unsafe, ineffective, or misbranded). However, the license for one of the products was revoked at the request of the
manufacturer during the Panel's review. The other product had been classified as Category II for a specific indication
for immunotherapy that had not previously been approved by FDA, and the agency is not aware of such immunotherapeutic
use of the product. Therefore, no action was proposed on the two products.
Many allergenic extracts were classified by the Panel in Category IIIA, designating products for which the available
data are insufficient to determine whether the product license should be revoked or affirmed and which may be marketed
pending the completion of further testing. Under  601.26 (21 CFR 601.26), all biological products recommended
for Category IIIA are to be reclassified into Category I or Category II. The Panel established to reclassify Category
IIIA allergenic extracts has completed its review and submitted its recommendations to FDA. The agency will announce
its proposed response to the recommendations for reclassification of Category IIIA allergenic extracts in a future
issue of the 

Federal Register

.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 9, 1985 (50 FR 32314), FDA published a notice of opportunity for hearing (hereinafter referred to as the 1985
notice), concerning specified allergenic extracts that the agency had proposed for inclusion in Category IIIB in
the 1985 proposal. Approximately 280 of the 1,600 generic allergens representing almost 6,000 individual company
allergenic extracts reviewed by the Panel had been classified into Category IIIB. The 1985 notice included a listing
of all licensed manufacturers and the products classified as Category IIIB.


A. Requests for Hearings


In response to the 1985 notice, FDA received four requests for hearings from licensed manufacturers of allergenic
extracts. The following manufacturers submitted requests:
1. Antigen Laboratories, Inc., 30-34 South Main, P.O. Box 123, Liberty, MO 64068, submitted a request for hearing
dated August 30, 1985, on several unspecified products placed into Category IIIB for diagnostic use. In a subsequent
letter dated March 22, 1988, Antigen Laboratories, Inc., withdrew its hearing request.
2. Barry Laboratories, Inc., P.O. Box 1967, Pompano Beach, FL 33061, submitted a request for hearing dated December
11, 1985, on its Poison Ivy-Oak-Sumac Extracts, combined, injection in almond oil (Rhus-All Antigen

TM

), License No. 119. At the manufacturer's request, the establishment and product licenses issued to Barry Laboratories,
Inc., were revoked on January 19, 1988. The pending request for hearing would have determined whether the product
and establishment licenses issued to Barry Laboratories, Inc., should be revoked. The request for license revocation
constitutes a withdrawal of the request for a hearing, and consideration of the data is unnecessary.
3. Mulford Colloid Laboratories, Division of Lemmon Co., Inc., Cathill and Lonely Rds., Sellersville, PA 18960,
submitted a request for hearing dated September 5, 1985, on the Category IIIB classification of its Poison Ivy Extract,
injection in hydro-alcoholic solution (Rhustox Antigen

TM

), License No. 102. At the manufacturer's request, the establishment and product licenses issued to Mulford Colloid
Laboratories, Division of Lemmon Co., Inc., were revoked on January 28, 1992. The pending request for hearing would
have determined whether the product and establishment licenses issued to Mulford Colloid Laboratories, Division
of Lemmon Co., Inc., should be revoked. The request for license revocation constitutes a withdrawal of the request
for a hearing, and consideration of the data is unnecessary.
4. Parke-Davis, Division of Warner-Lambert Co., 201 Tabor Rd., Morris Plains, NJ 07950, submitted a request for hearing
dated September 6, 1985, on the Category IIIB classification of its Poison Ivy Extract, injection in almond oil, License
No. 1. Parke-Davis submitted data to support its request for hearing on its injectable Poison Ivy Extract. FDA is reviewing
the data submitted and has not yet reached a decision on the request for hearing. Therefore, under 21 CFR 12.38(b),
FDA will issue a separate notice regarding the hearing request on the injectable Poison Ivy Extract produced by Parke-Davis,
Division of Warner-Lambert Co. The effective date of this notice does not apply to this product.


B. Comments


The 1985 notice also requested comments regarding the 1985 proposal to revoke product licenses for all allergenic
extracts classified into Category IIIB. FDA received approximately 1,700 comments in response to the 1985 notice.
All of the comments received concerning the Category IIIB classifications were evaluated by FDA in developing the
agency's conclusions set forth in this order and notice. Summaries of the comments and the agency's responses follow:
1. The majority of comments concerning the classification of products into Category IIIB were testimonial in nature,
most of them form letters submitted by physicians and their patients. Most of the comments expressed concern that
some of the Category IIIB products would no longer be available for medical use. No new and relevant data that had not
been previously available to the Panel or FDA were submitted by the comments. A summary of these general comments related
to Category IIIB classifications follows:
a. Several comments supported the Category IIIB classification of winged whole body hymenoptera insect extracts;
several comments opposed the classification of these products. Data were submitted in support of the Category IIIB
classification of these whole body extracts and in support of the use of pure venom extracts rather than whole body
extracts for the diagnosis and treatment of insect sting allergy.
b. Over 1,000 of the comments, a majority of which were form letters, opposed the Category IIIB classification of food
extracts. Some of the comments made reference to specific food extracts, including food extracts not proposed for
classification in Category IIIB, and other comments referred to food extracts in general.
The 1985 proposal discussed the Panel report, which stated that extracts of manufactured foods or undefined source
materials which are mixtures or whose composition may vary from time-to-time should be discontinued (50 FR 3082 at
3247). The comments did not appear to recognize that native, single food extracts were not classified in Category
IIIB and will remain on the market until reclassification procedures are completed. All Category IIIB food extracts
are derived from processed foods or mixtures. Examples of processed foods or mixtures are those that are canned or
contain added chemicals or preservatives.
Five of the comments opposing the Category IIIB classification of food extracts referred to information in published
journal articles. None of the articles contained data or information demonstrating that any food extract classified
in Category IIIB is safe and effective for the uses described in the products' labeling. The journal articles failed
to cite data with satisfactory controls, did not identify the manufacturers of the food extracts, or used allergenic
products in the studies that were not Category IIIB products.
c. Many of the same comments that opposed the Category IIIB classification of food extracts also opposed the Category
IIIB classification of trichophyton, oidiomycin, and epidermophyton (T.O.E.)
 molds involved in dermatomycosis. A small number of the comments opposed the Category IIIB classification of certain
extracts of animal epidermals, plant oleoresins, insects other than winged whole body hymenoptera insects, and
miscellaneous inhalants. Several of the comments referred to specific products that were not classified in Category
IIIB and were not subject to the 1985 notice.




Until data from further studies are developed to resolve questions of safety and effectiveness, FDA cannot agree
with the comments opposing the final classification of Category IIIB allergenic extracts. The Panel, with public
participation, carefully reviewed the available data on these products. The Panel concluded that further testing
was required and that because of questionable benefit and/or potential risk, these products should be removed from
the market until the questions concerning their safety and effectiveness were resolved. The comments submitted
no additional data to resolve the remaining questions. Applicable provisions of the Public Health Service Act and
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations require that biological drug products be demonstrated
to be safe and effective through adequate studies and that such products not be misbranded. In the absence of adequate
data, FDA cannot determine, based on testimonials alone, that the statutory requirements have been met.
2. One comment questioned whether sheep wool extract that is prepared from unprocessed sheep shearings, rather than
from processed wool, should be classified as Category IIIB. Manufacturers of sheep wool extract did not provide any
data on the safety and effectiveness of their products for diagnostic or therapeutic use. FDA is not aware of any data
to support distinguishing the safety and effectiveness of extracts prepared from processed sheep wool from the extracts
prepared from freshly clipped sheep shearings. The 1985 proposal discussed suggestions by the Panel that unprocessed
source materials from sheep be investigated (50 FR 3082 at 3179). Until appropriate studies are performed to establish
the safety and effectiveness of these extracts, all sheep wool and other sheep epidermal extracts are classified
as Category IIIB.
3. Washington Homeopathic Pharmacy, Inc., submitted a comment to the 1985 notice, asking FDA to permit the firm to
market its preparation of Poison Ivy Extract, License No. 392, (Homeopathic Rhus Tox. 3X Pills) as a homeopathic preparation
and not as a licensed biological product. Subsequently, at the manufacturer's request, the establishment and product
licenses were revoked on August 5, 1994.
The Panel recommended placing this product in Category IIIB because there was no evidence of effectiveness of the
product for either prophylactic treatment or treatment of active contact dermatitis. However, the Panel stated
that FDA may wish to consider this product differently because it is a homeopathic remedy that is highly diluted in
accordance with homeopathic principles (50 FR 3082 at 3271).
In the 1985 proposal the agency recognized the Panel's suggestion that FDA may wish to consider this homeopathic product
differently. FDA responded by proposing that ``* * * this biological product should be subject to
the same regulatory procedures as other Category IIIB biologicals'' (50 FR 3082 at 3282). The 1985 proposal stated
``* * * The regulations in  601.25 (21 CFR 601.25) make no separate provision for standards of effectiveness
for homeopathic drugs'' (50 FR 3082 at 3271). Because FDA has reviewed the data concerning the safety and efficacy
of Poison Ivy Extract, manufactured by Washington Homeopathic Pharmacy, Inc., License No. 392, and determined that
there was no evidence of effectiveness for either prophylactic treatment or treatment of active contact dermatitis,
FDA is denying the manufacturer's request to permit the firm to market its Poison Ivy Extract, License No. 392, as an
over-the-counter (OTC) homeopathic preparation. 
4. Several comments expressed the view that some Panel members were biased regarding their recommendations for Category
IIIB classification of certain extracts and that the Panel did not represent a wide divergence of responsible medical
and scientific opinion from various medical groups or societies.
FDA disagrees with these comments. The Panel members were selected on the basis of their qualifications to review
allergenic extracts to determine if they are safe, effective, and not misbranded for their labeled uses. The members
were not selected as representatives of various medical societies. The members have had experience with allergenic
extracts and are exceptionally well qualified in the fields of allergy, immunology, pediatrics, and the proper methodology
for conducting scientific investigations. Most of the members are physicians who were engaged in active medical
practice during their Panel membership. FDA believes that the expertise of the Panel members qualified them to review
the safety and effectiveness data related to all allergenic extracts. FDA finds no reason to believe that the members
did not represent an appropriate divergence of responsible viewpoints.
5. A number of comments acknowledged the need for additional studies to be performed on certain Category IIIB products.
Several of the comments stated that certain food extract products are effective when used with techniques that are
not indicated in the approved labeling of the products.
Additional studies need to be performed on any allergenic extract classified as Category IIIB. The Panel reviewed
allergenic extracts to determine whether the licensed products are safe and effective for their labeled uses. There
are allergenic extracts currently approved by FDA for use in the diagnosis and immunotherapy of immunoglobulin E-mediated
(IgE-mediated) allergy to the respective ingested food. The Panel was not charged with reviewing food extracts for
uses not contained in the approved product labeling. Nevertheless, the Panel considered the use of food extracts
in both IgE and non-IgE-mediated allergy. Food extracts were discussed at 16 of the 32 Panel meetings and all persons
who requested an opportunity to appear were given time to appear before the Panel. Although the non-IgE-mediated
uses discussed in the comments were contained in the approved product labeling, the lack of available data on such
uses justifies the Category IIIB classification of those food extracts of processed foods or extract mixtures prepared
from undefined and variable source materials. If studies are conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness
of an allergenic extract for uses not indicated in the current labeling, the data accumulated from the studies as well
as revised labeling and other necessary information should be submitted in the license application. Guidance on
study design may be found in the recommendations of the Panel, as discussed in the 1985 proposal concerning further
testing (50 FR 3082 at 3116 to 3123), and FDA's ``Draft Guideline for the Design of Clinical Trials for Evaluation of
the Safety and Efficacy of Allergenic Products for Therapeutic Uses'' (53 FR 48727, December 2, 1988). Any person
who is considering performing further studies may wish to consult with the agency concerning requirements.
6. One comment asked FDA to use the same standards for reviewing Category IIIB products that reclassification panels
used to reclassify Category IIIA products, including establishing a new panel to review them, if necessary.
The issue raised by this comment was addressed in the final rule establishing the reclassification procedures under
 601.26, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 5, 1982 (47 FR 44062 at 44065). The agency's position has not changed since publication of that final rule.
Products placed in Category IIIB differ from products that had been placed in Category IIIA in that the Category IIIB
designation represents a finding that the potential risks of marketing a product outweigh the potential benefits
and, therefore, the Category IIIB products should not be marketed pending the completion of additional studies.
However, interested persons may at any time submit to the agency for evaluation evidence that would be appropriate
to support the relicensing of a Category IIIB product.


C. Manufacturers and Products Affected


The 1985 notice included a listing of the Category IIIB products, most of which were classified by allergen, rather
than by manufacturer generically. Where the extract is licensed to a particular manufacturer under a specific product
license or the specific manufacturer's product was reviewed by the Panel, the listing includes the name of the manufacturer
along with that specific extract. The other Category IIIB classifications for products listed generically represent
Category IIIB classifications for the corresponding specific company products of each licensed manufacturer of
allergenic extracts. Some products were listed generically in Category IIIB for therapy and in a different category
(Category I or Category IIIA) for diagnosis. Other products are manufactured and approved only for immunotherapy.
Some of the companies produce only a few Category IIIB extracts or none at all. A company is subject to this notice only
to the extent that the company produces a product or products classified in Category IIIB. The currently licensed
manufacturers of allergenic extracts are again being listed below, for informational purposes only: 




Since the Panel completed its review, Cutter Laboratories, Inc., including its Hollister-Stier Laboratories Division,
has become a part of Miles Inc., and the combined operations are now licensed under License No. 008. In the following
discussions and listings the references to specific products manufactured by Hollister-Stier Laboratories, or
by Miles Inc., apply to the products manufactured by those companies at the time the Panel completed its review and
prior to the merger of the two companies. This notice of revocation of licenses concerning any products manufactured
by either of the two companies during the Panel's review applies to the current company (Miles Inc.) licensed under
License No. 008.
In addition, 11 manufacturers that each held a license for the manufacture of allergenic extracts when the Panel was
meeting, requested that their establishment and product licenses be revoked as follows: 




On November 2, 1984, Optimal, Inc., was approved for licensure of allergenic extracts (License No. 992). At the request
of Optimal, Inc., its establishment and product licenses were revoked on January 28, 1992. 
On April 20, 1988, Hermal Kurt Herrmann was approved for licensure of the Allergen Patch Test (License No. 1056). Similarly,
on July 12, 1990, Kabi Pharmacia Operations AS (now known as Kabi Pharmacia Services A/S, as of November 2, 1993), was
approved for licensure of the Allergen Patch Test (License No. 1110). Neither Hermal Kurt Herrmann nor Kabi Pharmacia
Services A/S, holds a license for allergenic extracts.
The following listing represents the agency's final determination of products designated as Category IIIB except
for the IIIB product discussed earlier for which a hearing request is pending. Products listed in Category IIIB Extracts
of Food are foods that are processed, mixtures, or have undefined ingredients.
The allergenic extracts placed in Category IIIB for their particular uses are listed as follows: 














D. Category IIIB Alum Precipitated Extracts


In addition, alum precipitated allergenic extracts (Center-Al

TM

), licensed for use in immunotherapy only, to Center Laboratories, Division, EM Industries, Inc., Hawthorne, NY
11050, are placed in Category IIIB whenever the corresponding aqueous products are classified as Category IIIB.
Alum precipitated allergenic extracts, (Allpyral

TM

) licensed to Miles Inc., are placed in Category IIIB if the corresponding aqueous products are classified as Category
IIIB. The only exception to this statement is that Alum-precipitated Allpyral short ragweed pollen extract is classified
as Category IIIB because the Allpyral short required pollen extracts have been studied most extensively and information
suggests that this product is not effective even though the corresponding aqueous extract is currently classified
in Category IIIA.


E. Extracts Recommended for Category IIIB by the Panel, but Placed in Category IIIA by FDA, Subject to Reclassification


The Panel recommended that extracts of Cockroach, American; Cockroach, German; and Cockroach, Oriental be placed
into Category IIIB for immunotherapy and Category I for diagnosis. However, after the Panel completed its review,
new relevant data were published that justify reconsideration of the generic classification of these products.
A copy of these published data has been placed on file with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and
Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. The Panel on Review of Allergenic Extracts
(Reclassification Panel) recommended that Cockroach, American; Cockroach, German and Cockroach, Oriental extracts
be placed in Category I for immunotherapy. Accordingly, licenses for Cockroach, American; Cockroach, German; Cockroach,
Oriental; and mixtures consisting of such extracts are not at this time being revoked pending reclassification into
either Category I or Category II.
In addition, the Panel recommended that extracts of beechnut (Fagus sylvatica), coffee (Coffea arabica), licorice
(Glycyrrhiza glabra), and butterfly be placed into Category IIIB for both diagnosis and therapy. However, the data
relating to these products were rereviewed by the Reclassification Panel, which has recommended reclassification
of these products into Category I for diagnostic use. Therefore, FDA believes that the licenses for these products
for diagnostic use should not be revoked at this time, pending review by the agency of the final report of the advisory
committee containing the recommendations for reclassification.


II. Findings


Based on the Panel's report and recommendations published in the 1985 proposal, and the agency's review of comments
received regarding the 1985 proposal and affected products, the product licenses for Category IIIB allergenic extracts
affected by this notice and the authorization of manufacturers to produce the specific products under a general product
license for allergenic extracts are revoked. Except for the outstanding request for a hearing from Parke-Davis,
Division of Warner-Lambert Co., Inc., concerning its injectable Poison Ivy Extract, injection in almond oil, and
the pending reclassification of specific cockroach extracts and extracts of beechnut, coffee, licorice, and butterfly
for diagnostic use, the revocation of licenses for the Category IIIB products listed or discussed above represents
the agency's final action on those allergenic extracts recommended by the Panel for classification into Category
IIIB. Any allergenic extract placed into Category IIIB and subject to this notice may not be lawfully marketed for
its Category IIIB indication(s) (diagnosis and/or therapy). However, if a product is approved for diagnosis but
classified into Category IIIB for therapy, a manufacturer may continue to produce and market that product for diagnostic
use if the labeling for the product is amended to reflect only the approved diagnostic use of the product. Specifically,
the container and package labels and the ``Indications and Usage'' section of the package insert must state prominently,
``FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY.'' This statement should immediately follow the proper name ``Allergenic Extract'' or
``Allergenic Extract Alum Precipitate,'' in the same size and type of print as the proper name. The ``Indications
and Usage'' section of the package insert must also include a statement that the product has not been shown by adequate
data to be safe and effective for therapeutic use. These labeling requirements will be reconsidered by FDA if a manufacturer
presents acceptable evidence obtained from future studies demonstrating that such labeling is no longer appropriate.
Labeling amendments for such products were required to be submitted to and approved by the Director, Office of Biologics
Research and Review (HFN-825), Center for Drugs and Biologics, by February 5, 1986. Under an organizational
change separating the Center for Drugs and Biologics, labeling amendments are now submitted to the Director, Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM-481), 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 20852-1448.
The authorization for a manufacturer to produce a product for which the labeling is not changed will be revoked upon
the effective date of this order. Any biological product marketed without an approved license is subject to regulatory
action.
FDA notes that the lists of allergens in the published documents related to the Panel's recommendations may not include
all marketed specific products, partially because of the various systems of classifications that have been used.
For example, because of the large number of pollen extracts available (at least 777 different pollen extracts are
listed in manufacturers' catalogs), those extracts were reviewed by the Panel according to the botanical family
of the plant producing the pollen. The list of products in the 1985 proposal did not include each specific pollen extract
marketed. Consistent with the Panel's own review, FDA will consider the data and information that are available for
any product not included in the Panel's list of products in determining the classification of such a product. Any manufacturer
that is uncertain whether one of its products is included in the Category IIIB classification should request a decision
on the product's status from FDA. The request should be submitted in writing to the Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (address above).
Except for an outstanding request for a hearing from Parke-Davis, Division of Warner-Lambert Co., Inc., concerning
its injectable Poison Ivy Extract, injection in almond oil, and the pending reclassification of specific cockroach
extracts and extracts of beechnut, coffee, licorice, and butterfly for diagnostic use, the revocation of licenses
for the Category IIIB products listed or discussed above represents the agency's final action on those allergenic
extracts recommended by the Panel for classification into Category IIIB. FDA advises that any allergenic extracts
placed into Category IIIB shall not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for its
IIIB indications on or after (

insert date 30 days after date of publication in the 

Federal Register

).
This notice is issued under the Public Health Service Act (sec. 351 as amended (42 U.S.C. 262)) and the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201, 502, 505, 701 as amended, 1050-1053 as amended, 1055-1056 as amended
(21 U.S.C. 321, 352, 355, 371)) 21 CFR part 12, 21 CFR 314.200, 21 CFR 601.7, 601.8, 601.25, and under authority delegated
to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10).

<DOCTITLE>Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Zerit

 

</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Zerit

 

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Zerit

 

 (stavudine). Zerit

 

 is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are intolerant
of approved therapies with proven clinical benefit or who have experienced significant clinical or immunologic
deterioration while receiving these therapies or for whom such therapies are contraindicated. Subsequent to this
approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Zerit

 

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,978,655) from Yale University, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance
in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated September 28, 1994, FDA advised
the Patent Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval
of Zerit

 

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period. 
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Zerit

 

 is 1,984 days. Of this time, 1,805 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 179
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: January 19, 1989. The applicant claims March 1, 1989, as the date investigational new drug application (IND) for
Zerit

 

 (IND 32,486) became effective. However, FDA records indicated that IND 32,486 was received by the agency on December
16, 1988. It was placed on clinical hold on January 3, 1989, and was removed from hold on January 19, 1989. Therefore,
the IND effective date was January 19, 1989.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: December 28, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the new drug application (NDA) for Zerit

 

 (NDA 20-412) was initially submitted on December 28, 1993. 
3. 

The date the application was approved

: June 24, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20-412 was approved on June 24, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 188 days of patent term
extension. 


Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before January 17, 1995, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before May 15, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces forthcoming meetings of public advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
This notice also summarizes the procedures for the meetings and methods by which interested persons may participate
in open public hearings before FDA's advisory committees.


FDA has established an Advisory Committee Information Hotline (the hotline) using a voice-mail telephone system.
The hotline provides the public with access to the most current information on FDA advisory committee meetings. The
advisory committee hotline, which will disseminate current information and information updates, can be accessed
by dialing 1-800-741-8138 or 301-443-0572. Each advisory committee is assigned a 5-digit
number. This 5-digit number will appear in each individual notice of meeting. The hotline will enable the public to
obtain information about a particular advisory committee by using the committee's 5-digit number. Information
in the hotline is preliminary and may change before a meeting is actually held. The hotline will be updated when such
changes are made.

committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Delay in Implementation of the Medicare-Medicaid Coverage Data Bank Requirements




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of our delay of the implementation of section 1144 of the Social Security
Act, which requires employers to report information about all individuals covered by group health plans to a newly
established Medicare-Medicaid Coverage Data Bank. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 7, 1994, we published the information below in the Commerce Business Daily concerning delaying the implementation
of the Medicare-Medicaid Coverage Data Bank. We are repeating the information here for general information. 



Section 1144 of the Social Security Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the Medicare-Medicaid
Data Bank to be composed of information supplied by employers for the purpose of establishing third party liability
for health care costs. Initial reports by employers were required to be filed by February 28, 1995. The Conference
Report accompanying the Department's Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1995 indicated Congressional intention
that no funds be expended by the Department in the fiscal year to implement this requirement. H.R. Rep. No. 103-733,
103rd Congress, 2nd Session, page 22. In light of this statement, we have agreed to stay any administrative action
to implement the current requirements, including the promulgation of reporting forms and instructions. Therefore,
we will not expect employers to compile the necessary information or file the required reports. Likewise, of course,
no sanctions will be imposed on employers for failure to file such reports. 

 




Authority:

 Section 1144 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-14).

<DOCTITLE>Prospective Grant of Partially Exclusive Patent License </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, 
DHHS. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) 
and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating 
the grant of a partially exclusive license in a limited field of 
use to practice the inventions embodied in U.S. Patent 5,104,977 
(formerly U.S. Patent Application 06/423,203) entitled ``Purified 
Transforming Growth Factor Beta'' and its foreign counterparts, 
including inventions deriving priority from U.S. Patent 
Applications 06/500,832 and 06/500,927, to Celtrix 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. having a place of business at Santa Clara, 
California. The patent rights in these inventions have been 
assigned to the United States of America. 



The prospective partially exclusive license will be for the field 
of ophthalmology. It will be royalty-bearing and will comply 
with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 

The prospective partially exclusive license may be granted 
unless, within sixty days from the date of this published Notice, 
NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that 
the grant of the license would not be consistent with the 
requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 

This invention relates to a protein known as transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGF-beta) and its uses. The U.S. patent (5,104,977) 
issued on April 14, 1992 and has a divisional (USPA 07/816,563) 
and two continuations (08/048,956 and 08/267,227) currently 
pending at the U.S. PTO. The invention contains both composition 
of matter and method of using claims to TGF-beta. The invention 
facilitates studies relating TGF-

b

's normal physiological 
function, and structural analysis, which could provide 
information on cloning of the TGF-

b

 protein. Production of TGF-

b

 
in mass quantities might have useful therapeutic application in 
enhancement of wound healing and tissue repair. Requests for a 
copy of the above identified patent applications, inquiries, 
comments and other materials relating to the contemplated license 
should be directed to: Dr. Carl Floyd, Office of Technology 
Transfer, National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive 
Boulevard, Box 13, Rockville, Maryland 20852-3804 (telephone: 
(301) 496-7735 ext. 246; FAX: (301) 402-0220). A signed 
Confidential Disclosure Agreement will be required to receive 
copies of the patent application(s). Properly filed competing 
applications for a license filed in response to this notice will 
be treated as objections to the grant of the contemplated 
license. Only written comments and/or applications for a license 
which are received by the NIH Office of Technology Transfer on or 
before January 17, 1995 will be considered.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period on draft stock assessments and Potential Biological Removal (PBR) workshop report.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Service is extending the comment period on the stock assessments for Service marine mammal species and the PBR
workshop report in consideration of the complexity of the issues surrounding both the stock assessments and the PBR
workshop report.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 23, 1994, the Service published a 

Federal Register

 notice announcing the availability of draft stock assessments for Service species (i.e., polar bear, Pacific walrus,
northern sea otter in Alaska, West Indian manatees, California sea otter, and northern sea otter in Washington State)
and the PBR workshop report (59 FR 43353). The stock assessments are required under new Section 117 of the Marine Mammal
Protection Act as amended in 1994 (Pub. L. 103-238). A summary of the draft stock assessments specifying geographical
range, regional designation, minimum abundance estimate, PBR level, estimated annual average human-caused mortality,
and whether or not the stock would be regarded as strategic or nonstrategic was included in the 

Federal Register

 notice. The PBR workshop, composed of National Marine Fisheries Service and Service scientists, was convened to
develop an initial approach for promoting consistent national interpretation of parameters to be used in draft stock
assessments, including the calculation of PBR levels.





The initial comment period for draft stock assessments for 
Service species and PBR workshop was scheduled to end on November 21, 1994. In response to concern that the public comment
period was inadequate, given the scope of the issues surrounding the stock assessments and the PBR workshop reports,
the Service hereby extends the comment period and welcomes comments received by December 1, 1994. Subsequent to the
close of the extended period, the Service will provide copies of public comments to members of the Alaska, Pacific,
and Atlantic Scientific Review Groups, as appropriate, for their consideration prior to the next scheduled meeting
of these groups.



Comments must be received in the appropriate office as identified in the 

ADDRESSES 

Section above by December 1, 1994, to be fully considered. Therefore, those submitting comments close to that date
should FAX their comments or call to ensure receipt of their comments.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rate Increase.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The BIA is proposing to increase the Colorado River Indian Irrigation Project's operation and maintenance assessment
rate per assessable acre for the first 5 acre feet of water to $30.00 in 1995, $31.50 in 1996, $33.00 in 1997, $34.50 in
1998, and $36.00 in 1999 and thereafter until further notice. The $3.00 increase to the current rate of $27.00 per acre
in 1995 and the $1.50 increase per acre per year for the next four years 1996 through 1999 will offset cost increases
for personnel, supplies, materials and services. The charge per acre foot of water in excess of this annual apportionment
will be $11.00 per acre foot in 1995, $12.50 per acre foot in 1996, $14.00 per acre foot in 1997, $15.50 per acre foot in
1998, and $17.00 per acre foot in 1999 and thereafter, until further notice. The $3.00 increase to the current rate
of $8.00 per acre foot in 1995 and the $1.50 increase per acre foot per year for the next four years 1996 through 1999 will
offset cost increases for personnel, supplies, materials and services. 


The energy costs for pumped water will not be paid by the Project but will be billed directly to those receiving pumped
water by the electric utility.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The authority to issue this document is vested in the Secretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and the Act of August 14,
1914 (38 Stat. 583, 25 U.S.C. 385) and has been delegated to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs pursuant to Part
209 Departmental Manual Chapter 8.1 A and Memorandum, dated January 25, 1994, from the Chief of Staff, Department
of the Interior, to Assistant Secretaries and Heads of Bureaus and Offices. The assessment is based on an estimate
of the cost of normal operation and maintenance of the irrigation Project. Normal operation and maintenance is defined
as the cost of all activities involved in delivering irrigation water, including the actual costs for labor, materials,
equipment, services, energy, equipment replacement and reserves to cover emergency expenses. 


The Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) and water users were notified of the proposed changes in the operation and
maintenance assessment and excess water rates by letter to CRIT dated March 25, 1994, at the March 16, 1994, CRIT Irrigation
Committee Meeting, and at the Pink Boll Worm and White Fly Eradication Committee Meeting for Parker Valley growers
on March 22, 1994. 
The current operation and maintenance assessment rate of $27.00 became effective January 1, 1994. Since January
1, 1984, when the operation and maintenance assessment rate was raised to $22.00, there had been no other increases
in the assessment rate or the excess water rate. The 1994 increase was not sufficient to offset the accumulated annual
cost increases for labor, materials, equipment, energy, and services. Costs have depleted reserves and continue
to exceed revenue from current assessments. 
The basic operation and maintenance assessment for a given year is calculated by using the estimated cost of Project
operation for that calendar year divided by the assessable acreage. 


Basic Assessment 


The basic assessment rate against the land to which water can be delivered under the Colorado River Indian Irrigation
Project, Arizona, for operation and maintenance of the Project is hereby fixed at $30.00 per acre for 1995, $31.50
per acre for 1996, $33.00 per acre for 1997, $34.50 per acre for 1998, and $36.00 per acre for 1999 and thereafter until
further notice. The assessment is due whether water is used or not. Payment of this assessment will entitle the water
user to up to 5 acre-feet of water per year per assessable acre of land. 


Excess Water Charge 


If and when available, water in excess of the basic allotment may be delivered upon written request to the Superintendent
by landowners or users at the following rates per acre foot or fraction thereof: $11.00 per acre foot in 1995, $12.50
per acre foot in 1996, $14.00 per acre foot in 1997, $15.50 per acre foot in 1998, and $17.00 per acre foot in 1999 and thereafter
until further notice. The excess water charge is payable at the time of written request for such water and must be paid
prior to delivery. 


Pumped Water Energy Charges 


The energy costs for pumped water will not be paid by the Project but will be billed directly to those receiving pumped
water by the electric utility. 


Effective Period 


The assessments and water charges above shall become effective for each Calendar Year 1995 through 1999 and thereafter
until further notice. 


Distribution and Apportionment 


All Project water is considered a common water supply in which all assessable lands of the Project are entitled to share
equally. Such water will be distributed to the lands of the Project as equitably as physical conditions permit.

<DOCTITLE>Power Rate Adjustment: Mission Valley Power Utility, Montana</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rate Increase.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is proposing to increase the cost of electric power (energy) to customers of Mission Valley
Power (MVP), the entity operating the power facility of the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project of the Flathead Reservation.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has been informed that the Montana Power Company (MPC), which sells electric power
to MVP, has raised its wholesale power rates by approximately 2.0 percent. The MPC increase went into effect on September
5, 1994, and is based on adjustments in the Consumer Price index pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
license for MPC's Kerr Dam Hydroelectric Facility. Accordingly, the BIA is proposing to adjust the local retail power
rates charged by MVP to reflect the increased cost of purchased power. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The authority to issue this document is vested in the Secretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301; the Act of August 7, 1946,
c. 802, Section 3 (60 Stat. 895; 25 U.S.C. 385c); the Act of May 25, 1948 (62 Stat. 269); and the Act of December 23, 1981,
section 112 (95 Stat. 1404). The Secretary has delegated this authority to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs
pursuant to part 209 Departmental Manual, Chapter 8. 1A and Memorandum dated January 25, 1994, from Chief of Staff,
Department of the Interior, to Assistant Secretaries, and Heads of Bureaus and Offices. The approximate 2.0 percent
MPC increase causes the BIA to raise its retail rates to recover $24,529 which is the financial impact of that increase.
Accordingly, the proposed rate increase will flow through MVP to MPC to offset the increased cost of wholesale energy.
This proposed adjustment is the result of an increase in the electric power rates charged by MPC, one of three sources
of electric power marketed by MVP. The MPC increase, which went into effect on September 5, 1994, is based on adjustments
in the Consumer Price index pursuant to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for MPC's Kerr Dam Hydroelectric
Facility. The following table illustrates the financial impact of the new retail rates on each rate class.

ACTION:

 Notice





Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 of the intent to repatriate
a cultural item presently in the possession of the Arizona State Capitol Museum, Phoenix, AZ, that meets the definition
of ``sacred object'' under section 2 of the act.
The coiled basket has a flared shape, plaited rim, and dark brown design of connected diamonds on a light brown background.
Four sets of 12 carved and painted sticks are sewn equidistant around the interior of the basket. The basket was purchased
by the State of Arizona in 1938 from photographer Edward Curtis. The basket was transferred from the Research Library,
Department of Library, Archives & Public Records in 1982 to the Museum Division. Museum records identify the
basket with accession number 1982.035.035.
Representatives of the Navajo Nation have identified the basket as one needed by Navajo religious leaders for the
practice of the Yeibichai ceremony by present day adherents. 
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Arizona State Capitol Museum have determined that, pursuant
to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between the basket
and the Navajo Nation. Officials of the Arizona State Capitol Museum have also determined that the basket meets the
definition of sacred object pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (3)(C).
This notice has been sent to officials of the Navajo Nation, Ramah Navajo Chapter, and the Colorado River Indian Tribes.
Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this cultural item
should contact Michael Carman, Museum Director, Arizona State Capitol Museum, 1700 W. Washington, Phoenix Arizona
85007 (602)542-4675 before December 16, 1994. Repatriation of the cultural item to the Navajo Nation may begin
after that date if no additional claimants come forward.

Fresh Garlic From the People's Republic of China


Determination


On the basis of the record

1

 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines, pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act
of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)) (the Act), that the industry in the United States producing fresh garlic

2

 is materially injured by reason of imports from the People's Republic of China (China) of fresh garlic, as defined
by the Department of Commerce (Commerce), that have been found by Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than
fair value (LTFV).

3, 14

 The Commission also determines, pursuant to section 735(b)(4)(a), that critical circumstances do not exist such
that it is necessary to impose the duty retroactively.







Chairman Watson, Vice Chairman Nuzum, and Commissioners Bragg, Rohr, and Newquist find that the industry in the United
States producing dehy garlic

5

 is not materially injured or threatened with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States
is not materially retarded, by reason of LTFV imports from China.

6

 Chairman Watson, Vice Chairman Nuzum, and Commissioners Bragg, Rohr, and Newquist also find that the industry in
the United States producing seed garlic

7

 is not materially injured or threatened with material injury, and the establishment of an industry in the United States
is not materially retarded, by reason of LTFV imports from China.

8










Background


The Commission instituted this investigation effective July 11, 1994, following a preliminary determination by
the Department of Commerce that imports of fresh garlic from China were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section
733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of
a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary,
U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1994 (59 F.R. 39674). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on September 27, 1994, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on November 7, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2825 (November 1994), entitled ``Fresh Garlic from
the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731-TA-683 (Final).''



Issued: November 7, 1994.

Illinois Central Railroad Company and New Orleans Public Belt Railroad_Joint Relocation Project Exemption_In
New Orleans, LA


On October 17, 1994, Illinois Central Railroad Company (IC) and New Orleans Public Belt Railroad (NOPB) jointly filed
a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate lines of railroad in New Orleans, LA. The joint relocation
project is an integral component of the Tchoupitoulas Corridor Project (TCP), a major public works program between
state and local governmental agencies, to relieve traffic congestion and to improve access to New Orleans' port facilities.
Consummation has been scheduled to take place no earlier than October 24, 1994.
IC is a class I railroad, operating approximately 2,600 miles of rail line in six midwestern states, and NOPB is a class
III terminal switching railroad owned by the City of New Orleans. NOPB operates approximately 25 miles of rail line
in and around New Orleans.
Within the City of New Orleans, IC and NOPB own and operate adjacent parallel mainlines lying in the city-owned Leake
Avenue right-of-way, which is not used as a street or roadway in the project area (Leake Avenue ROW). Part of the TCP
involves the reconfiguration of railroad tracks and operations on the Leake Ave ROW.

1

 IC and NOPB will exchange ownership of certain tracks in the Leake Avenue ROW between Octavia and Jena Streets.




Under the joint project, IC and NOPB propose the following transactions: (1) IC will acquire NOPB's line of railroad
along the northern edge of the Leake Avenue ROW between approximately Octavia Street and Valence Street, a distance
of approximately .78 miles; (2) NOPB will acquire IC's parallel double track line to the south of the aforementioned
line between approximately Octavia Street and Jena Street, a distance of approximately .86 miles; (3) IC will grant
NOPB trackage rights over IC's new mainline between a point near Valence Street (station 175+68.09) and the connection
with NOPB's locomotive maintenance facility lead track near Upperline Street, including head room (station 163+80),
a distance of approximately .23 miles; (4) NOPB will grant IC trackage rights over NOPB's existing River Main between
the end of IC's track near Valence Street (station 175+68.09) and the connection with new IC yard lead tracks (station
182+02.44), a distance of approximately .12 miles, and over NOPB's existing parallel City Main between the end of
IC's track near Valence Street (station 175+68.09) and the connection with the western Hayes Dockside Warehouse
lead track, including head room (station 214+60), a distance of approximately .74 miles; (5) IC will abandon and remove
its spur track between station 240+00 and the connection with the eastern Hayes Dockside Warehouse lead track (station
232+37), a distance of approximately .14 miles; and (6) IC and NOPB will perform such incidental construction and
relocation of trackage at various locations along the Leake Avenue ROW as necessary to complete the proposed reconfiguration
of tracks contemplated under the TCP.
This transaction will simplify rail operations through the affected area and accommodate the goals of the TCP. No
shippers will be adversely affected by this relocation or lose access to any rail service currently provided by IC
or NOPB.
The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment or construction components of a relocation project,
and require separate approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to
shippers, expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See, 

generally, Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt. Proj._Relocation Over BN,

 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may embrace trackage rights transactions
such as the one involved here. See 

D.T.&I.R._Trackage Rights,

 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental abandonment, construction, and trackage
rights components require no separate approval or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt
service to shippers and thus qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5).
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN,

 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate,

 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980).
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: William C. Sippel, Two Prudential
Plaza, 45th Floor, 180 North Stetson Ave., Chicago, IL 60601 and Raymond J. Salassi, Jr., 202 St. Charles Ave., 50th
Floor, New Orleans, LA 70170-5100.

On October 20, 1994, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) and Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) filed a notice
of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate a line of railroad at Salina, in Saline County, KS.
 The joint relocation project involves the: (1) acquisition by MP/UP of overhead trackage rights on approximately
1.7 miles of parallel line belonging to the Central Kansas Railway L.L.C. (CK) between mileposts 20.4 and 22.1; (2)
construction of a new connection at milepost 186.63 on UP's east-west main line, just to the south of the jointly owned
CK/UP Union Depot, to give MP/UP access to the CK trackage rights; and (3) incidental abandonment and discontinuance
by MP of a 0.78-mile portion of its Trigo Industrial Lead between milepost 494.65 and milepost 495.43. The parties
have stated their intention to consummate the transaction on or after the October 27, 1994 effective date of the exemption.
The Railway Labor Executives' Association petitioned for imposition of labor protective conditions. 





MP/UP contend that service to shippers will not be disrupted and otherwise that there will be no adverse effect on shippers.
The proposed joint relocation project is intended to facilitate their interchange capabilities, and the connecting
track will give them access to the Trigo Industrial Lead to ensure continued rail service to MP's customers. Citing


Denver & R.G.W.R. Co.-JT. Proj.-Relocation Over BN

, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987) (

Joint Project

), they further contend that the proposed joint relocation project will not involve a change in service to shippers,
an expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. 

The Commission generally does not assume jurisdiction over the incidental abandonment, discontinuance, and construction
components of a relocation project if, as alleged here, none of the criteria set out in 

Joint Project

 will be triggered. Accordingly, the proposed abandonment, discontinuance, and construction are not subject to
Commission jurisdiction. 

The remainder of the joint relocation project involves UP/MP's acquisition of overhead trackage rights from CK.
The Commission has determined that line relocations may also embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one
proposed here. 

See D.T. & I.R._Trackage Rights

, 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Because the joint relocation project will not disrupt service to shippers, the proposed trackage
rights qualify for exemption under the class exemption procedures at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). 

As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions imposed in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN

, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operation

, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Joseph D. Anthofer, and Jeanna
L. Regier, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179.

<DOCTITLE>Norfolk and Western Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_Between Wenonah Spur Junction and Wenonah, WV </DOCTITLE>



Norfolk and Western Railway Company
 (NW) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_

Exempt Abandonments

 to abandon a 1.4-mile line of track between milepost BW-20.1 at Wenonah Spur Junction and milepost BW-21.5
at Wenonah, in Mercer County, WV.







NW has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) no overhead traffic has moved
over the line and, if there were any, could be rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail
service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service
over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the
complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8
(historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1)
(notice to governmental agencies) have been met. 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under


Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 

Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on December 16, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,
 formal expressions of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2),
 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29
 must be filed by November 28, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must
be filed by December 6, 1994, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission,
Washington, DC 20423. 







A copy of any pleading filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: James R. Paschall,
Norfolk Southern Corporation, Three Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 23510. 

If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void 

ab initio. 

NW has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environmental and
historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by
November 21, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce
Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEA, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on
environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public.

Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where
appropriate, in a subsequent decision. 

 


Decided: November 7, 1994.



By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act (CERCLA)</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7 and 42 U.S.C. 9622(d), notice is hereby given that a proposed consent
decree in 

United States 

v. 

AMF Reece, et al., 

Civil Action No. 94-12153 (EFH) was lodged on October 28, 1994, with the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts. The consent decree settles an action brought under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601 

et seq., 

and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6901 

et seq., 

for injunctive relief and reimbursement of costs. The PSC Resources Superfund Site was operated as a waste oil recycling
facility from 1970 to 1978 and is located in Palmer, Massachusetts. As a result of the waste oil operations, the Site
became contaminated with hazardous substances and was placed on the National Priorities List. The Environmental
Protection Agency performed a removal action and a remedial investigation and feasibility study to identify the
nature and extent of the contamination at the Site and to examine how best to remediate the Site.

Under the terms of the proposed decree, eleven defendants (``Performing Settling Defendants'') will perform the
required remediation of the Site. The remediation is today estimated to cost $7.35 million. A remedial trust fund
will be established to fund the remedy. Approximately one hundred and forty-five (145) 

de minimis

 settling defendants will contribute $3,755,484 to the remedial trust fund. The New Jersey Department of Transportation
will contribute $3.5 million and the federal agencies will contribute $625,152, respectively, to the remedial trust
fund. The Performing Settling Defendants and settling federal agencies will pay $3,175,000 to the Environmental
Protection Agency and Commonwealth of Massachusetts for costs incurred in performing the RI/FS, removal activities
and for other past costs and interest, totalling $4,291,333. The Performing Settling Defendants within 30 days of
entry of the decree will also pay $153,720 to the Department of Interior in compensation for natural resource damages.
Additionally, over the course of the remediation, the Performing Settling Defendants will pay $537,500 of an estimated
$575,000 in oversight costs to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commonwealth.

The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment

<DOCTITLE>United States v. General Electric Co., et al.; Proposed Termination of Final Decree </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that defendant General Electric Company (GE) has filed with the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, a motion to terminate the Final Decree in 

United States 

v. 

General Electric Company, et al.

, In Equity No. 8120, which was entered on October 12, 1911, and the Department of Justice (Department), in a stipulation
also filed with the Court, has tentatively consented to termination of the Final Decree, but has reserved the right
to withdraw its consent based on public comments and for other reasons. 

The complaint in 

United States 

v. 

General Electric Company, et al.

, filed on March 3, 1911 and brought against GE and other lamp manufacturers, alleged, 

inter alia, 

that GE acquired interests in and control over other lamp companies, but concealed its ownership interests in them
in order to give the impression of competition among numerous, independent lamp manufacturers. The complaint also
alleged conspiracies to restrain trade and to monopolize. The conduct was charged as violating the Sherman Act of
1890. 

The Final Decree prohibits GE from conducting its incandescent lamp business except in its own name, and enjoins certain
practices, including price fixing, resale price maintenance, price discrimination, tying and exclusive dealing
arrangements. 

The United States has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why the United States believes that
termination of the Final Decree would serve the public interest. Copies of the complaint and Final Decree, motion
papers, the stipulation containing the United States' consent, the United States' memorandum and all further papers
filed with the Court in connection with this motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division,
Department of Justice, 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (telephone 202-514-2481),
and at the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division,
201 Superior Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44114 (telephone 216-522-4355). Copies of any of these materials
may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set by Department of Justice
regulations. 

Interested persons may submit comments regarding the proposed termination of the Final Decree to the United States.
Such comments must be received within the sixty day period established by court order, and will be filed with the court
by the United States. Comments should be addressed to J. Robert Kramer, II, Chief, Litigation II Section, Antitrust
Division, Department of Justice, 1401 H Street, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (telephone 202-307-0924).

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Determinations Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA Transitional
Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Labor herein presents summaries
of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for trade adjustment assistance for workers (TA-W) issued
during the period of November, 1994.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for worker adjustment
assistance to be issued, each of the group eligibility requirements of Section 222 of the Act must be met.

(1) That a significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
have become totally or partially separated,

(2) That sales or production, or both, of the firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and

(3) That increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm or appropriate
subdivision have contributed importantly to the separations, or threat thereof, and to the absolute decline in sales
or production.



Negative Determinations for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In each of the following cases the investigation revealed that criterion (3) has not been met. A survey of customers
indicated that increased imports did not contribute importantly to worker separations at the firm.

In order for an affirmative determination to be made and a certification of eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA
the following group eligibility requirements of Section 250 of the Trade Act must be met:
(1) That a significant number of proportion of the workers in the workers' firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof,
(including workers in any agricultural firm or appropriate subdivision thereof) have become totally or partially
separated from employment and either_
(A) That sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely,
(B) That imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm
or subdivision have increased.
(C) That the increase in imports contributed importantly to such workers' separations or threat of separation and
to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or 
(2) That there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like
or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.

<DOCTITLE>Pennzoil Products Co., Bradford, PA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>




By an application dated September 14, 1993, Local 

#

6990 of the United Electrical Workers (UE) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for
trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on August 16, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 2, 1994 (59 FR 45711).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.

The investigation findings show that the workers were primarily engaged in employment related to the production
of crude oil. Some natural gas was produced.

The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the increased import criterion
of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. The ``contributed importantly'' test is generally
demonstrated through a survey of the workers' firm's customers.

The Department's survey of the Pennzoil's customers shows that all of its crude oil was shipped to a corporate refinery
who does not import crude oil. The Department's survey of the natural gas customers shows that they did not increase
their imports of natural gas while reducing their purchases from Pennzoil during the relevant periods.

The union claims that the international price of crude oil affects the price of domestic crude oil and was responsible
for the worker separations at Pennzoil.

Price is not a criterion for a worker group certification. Also, Pennzoil shift from domestic production to overseas
exploration and production would not form a basis for a worker group certification.

The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition
but only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like
or directly competitive products which ``contributed importantly'' to declines in sales or production and employment.



Conclusion



After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.





Signed at Washington, D.C., this 7th day of November 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Union Pacific Oil and Gas Co. (Formerly Amax Oil and Gas Co.) Houston, TX; Operating in the State of Oklahoma; Amended
Certification Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on July 20, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 28, 1994 (59 FR 38495).

At the request of the company, the Department again reviewed its certification for the workers of Union Pacific Oil
and Gas in Houston, Texas. New findings show that several workers were laid off in Oklahoma.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending its certification to include worker separations in Oklahoma.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,657 is hereby issued as follows:




``All workers of Union Pacific and Gas, formerly Amax Oil and Gas Company, Houston, Texas and in the state of Oklahoma
who were engaged in employment related to the production of crude oil and natural gas who became totally or partially
separated from employment on or after March 16, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section
223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio; Confirmatory Order Modifying License, Effective Immediately


I. 


The Ohio State University (Licensee) is the holder of eight NRC materials licenses, including broadscope License
No. 34-00293-02; License No. 34-00293-14, authorizing use of cobalt-60 sources in a wet storage
irradiator for in-water irradiation studies; and License No. 34-00293-15, authorizing use of a cobalt-60
source in a teletherapy unit for treatment of animals. The broadscope license authorizes the Licensee to possess,
in part: (1) Radiopharmaceuticals and brachytherapy sources in quantities as needed for medical diagnosis and therapy;
(2) ten curses (370 GBq) of iridium-192 in a remote afterloading brachytherapy device for therapeutic treatments;
(3) curie quantities of any byproduct materials (with atomic numbers 1 to 83) in any form for research and development
(R&D) pursuant to 10 CFR 30.4, and for student instruction and calibration of instruments; (4) curie quantities
of any byproduct material (with atomic numbers 3 to 83) in the form of irradiated metals for R&D; and (5) millicurie
to curie quantities of specifically-listed sealed and unsealed byproduct materials for use in analytical instruments,
gauging devices, and for instrument calibration, student instruction and R&D. The broadscope license was issued
on July 19, 1956, and is due to expire on June 30, 1997. License Nos. 34-00293-14 and 34-00293-15
expire on July 31, 1996 and December 31, 1996, respectively.


II.


Between September 27 and November 4, 1993, the NRC conducted a safety inspection of licensed activities at the Ohio
State University authorized under License Nos. 34-00293-02, 34-00293-14 and 34-00293-15.
Numerous violations and other concerns were identified during the inspection. The findings of the inspection were
documented in Inspection Report Nos. 030-02640/93001, 030-31605/93001 and 030-32479/93001,
issued to the Licensee on December 16, 1993.
The problems identified during the inspection were discussed with the Licensee during an Enforcement Conference
held at the NRC Region III office on March 7, 1994. During the Enforcement Conference, the Licensee presented various
corrective actions that were taken or were planned to be taken to prevent recurrence of the violations, ensure compliance
with NRC requirements and strengthen its overall NRC-licensed programs.
On June 10, 1994, the NRC issued a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) in the amount
of $17,750 (EA 94-032). The Notice listed 32 violations covering numerous areas, including decommissioning
funding, radiation safety requirements for irradiators, and medical quality management program requirements.
The violations represented a significant breakdown in the management of the radiation safety program and consequently
were of significant regulatory concern. The significant of the inspection findings was exacerbated because many
of the violations appeared to have been known or suspected to exist by those responsible for the radiation protection
program, yet continued uncorrected. Moreover, conditions such as a lack of radiation safety office staff and adequate
radiation safety office facilities were also known but were not corrected in a timely fashion. The root cause of the
problems identified during the inspection was a lack of effective management involvement with NRC-licensed
activities, coupled with a failure to provide sufficient resources for the radiation protection program.
The June 10, 1994, Notice required the Licensee to respond to the specific violations. In addition to that response,
the NRC requested that, within 60 days of the Notice, the Licensee develop and submit a detailed Radiation Safety Improvement
Plan (RSIP) that includes a description of the changes to be implemented, the specific improvements in management
oversight, and the additional resources to be dedicated to upgrade the radiation safety program. The RSIP was to address
several specific topics including a program of audits and surveillances to assess program effectiveness, a schedule
for completing all actions described in the plan, and a system for monitoring and tracking the plan's completion status.


III.


On July 8, 1994, the Licensee provided a written response to the Notice and remitted full payment of the $17,750 proposed
civil penalties. The Licensee did not contest the violations in the Notice except for one violation pertaining to
the failure to complete an evaluation of radiation doses incurred by an individual in September 1991. The NRC responded
to the Licensee's July 8, 1994, submittal in a letter dated August 18, 1994.
On August 2, 1994, the Licensee submitted the requested RSIP. Following discussion of the RSIP with the Licensee,
the Licensee submitted supplemental information in a letter dated September 15, 1994. Key elements of the RSIP include:
(1) A system of ongoing evaluations of the radiation safety program to determine compliance with NRC regulations
and license conditions; (2) an assessment of personnel training and improvements in user training including cross-training
of radiation safety office health physicists; (3) a compilation of radiation safety deficiencies identified during
program evaluations and a description of short term and long term corrective actions necessary to address those deficiencies
for lasting corrective action; (4) an increase in health physicist, technician and support staff for the radiation
safety office; and (5) enhanced facilities and equipment for the radiation safety office.
In light of the violations underlying the June 10, 1994, enforcement action, the public health and safety require
improvement of the Licensee's radiation safety program. The NRC staff has reviewed the Licensee's RSIP, as supplemented,
and finds that the commitments as set forth in its letters of August 2, 1994, and September 15, 1994, are acceptable
and conclude that if these commitments are effectively implemented, the public health and safety are reasonably
assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's
commitments in its August 2, 1994, and September 15, 1994, letters be confirmed by this Order.

The Licensee consented to the issuance of this Confirmatory Order during a telephone call between Ms. B.J. Holt and
Mr. Wayne Slawinski, of the NRC Region II staff, and Dr. Cecil Smith, Assistant Vice President for Environmental Health
and Safety, and Mr. Joseph Allgeier, Radiation Safety Officer, of the Licensee's staff on November 4, 1994. Pursuant
to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that, based on the Licensee's consent to this Order and the significance of the
necessary program improvements described above, the public health and safety require that this Order be immediately
effective.



IV.




Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 20, 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that, effective immediately,
License Nos. 34-00293-02, 34-00293-14 and 34-00293-15 are modified as follows:


The Licensee shall complete the specific action items within the time limitations stated in the Radiation Safety
Improvement Plan submitted to the NRC in its letter dated August 2, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated September
15, 1994. If additional time is required to meet a step or goal, a prior written request must be submitted with the reason
for the request and the new time frame for completion. Until approved in writing by the Regional Administrator, Region
III, the previously approved schedule must be met. The Regional Administrator, Region III, may relax or rescind,
in writing, any aspect of the above condition upon a showing by the Licensee of good cause.



V.




Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than the Licensee, may request a hearing within 20
days of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, D.C. 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for
Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region III, 801 Warrenville Road,
Lisle, Illinois 60532-4351, and to the Licensee. If such a person requests a hearing, that person shall set forth
with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).


If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating
the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this
Confirmatory Order should be sustained.


Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), any person other than the Licensee adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.


In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this Order.




Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of November 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Philadelphia Electric Co.; Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2</DOCTITLE>


Exemption


I.


Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85,
which authorize operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2. The licenses provide, among other things,
that the license is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. 
The facilities consist of two boiling water reactors located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. 


II.


It is stated in 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors
against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical
protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities
involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable
risk to the public health and safety.'' 
It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), that ``The licensee shall control all
points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that ``A numbered
picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas
without escort * * *.'' It also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors)
may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon
entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area * * *.''

The licensee proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badge with them when departing the site. 
An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges
offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated August 10, 1994, the licensee requested an
exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose. 


III.


Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide measures for protection against radiological sabotage provided
the licensee demonstrates that the measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological
sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. 
At the LGS units, unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination
badge and keycard. (Hereafter, these are referred to as badge.) The security officers at each entrance station use
the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees
and contractor personnel, who have been granted unescorted access, are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit
location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In
accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance
with the plant's physical security plans, neither licensee employees nor contractors are allowed to take badges
offsite. 
Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have
the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control
system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system
would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared
with the previously stored template in the access control system to verify authorization for entry. Individuals,
including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the
site and thus eliminate the process to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges
do not carry any information other than a unique identification number.

All other access processes, including search function capability, would remain the same. This system would not be
used for persons requiring escorted access, i.e. visitors.


Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91_0276
UC_906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on the licensee's experience with the current photo-identification
system, the licensee demonstrated that the false-accept rate for the hand geometry system will be better than is achieved
by the current system. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department of
Energy facilities. The licensee will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall
level of performance equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plans for Limerick Generating
Station, Units 1 and 2 will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system
and to allow licensee employees and contractors to take their badges offsite.

The licensee will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security personnel
through the use of a badge and verification of hand geometry. A numbered picture badge identification system will
continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges will continue
to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.



IV.



Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide for a positive verification process and potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the
badge offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas. 


For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures
for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against
radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. 


Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Philadelphia Electric Company an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5)
relating to the returning of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by
the licensee, i.e., contractors, who are authorized unescorted access into the protected area, can take their badges
offsite.


Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 55863).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Valley Authority; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 1 </DOCTITLE>



Order 



Tennessee Valley Authority (the permittee) is the current holder of Construction Permit No. CPPR-91, issued
by the Atomic Energy Commission on January 23, 1973, for construction of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Unit 1. The facility
is currently under construction at the permittee's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately 50 miles
northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee. 

On September 19, 1994, the permittee filed a request pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55(b) for an extension of the completion
date from December 31, 1994 to December 31, 1995. The proposed action is needed because the construction, modification,
and preoperational testing of the facility is not yet fully completed. Following completion of hot functional testing,
the permittee conducted an extensive review of the remaining scope of work required to complete the unit. The review
indicates fuel load for the unit will occur in the spring of 1995. The requested extension period includes contingency
in case any adjustments to the schedule are needed. The NRC staff has concluded that good cause has been shown for the
delays, and that the extension is for a reasonable period. The basis for these conclusions is set forth in the staff's
evaluation. The staff has further concluded that the requested extension involves no significant hazards consideration
and that, therefore, no prior public notice is needed. 

The NRC staff has prepared an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, which was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on November 8, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that extending the construction completion
dates will have no significant impact on the environment. 

The applicant's letter dated September 19, 1994, and the NRC staff's letter and Safety Evaluation of the request for
extension of the construction permit, dated November 8, 1994, are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Chattanooga-County Library,
1001 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402. 



It is hereby ordered 

That the latest completion date for Construction Permit No. CPPR-91 is extended to December 31, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Revision of SF 85, SF 85P, and SF 86</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a proposed
revision of three forms that collect information from the public.




The Standard Form 85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, is completed by appointees to Non-Sensitive duties
with the Federal Government. Information collected on this form is used by the Office of Personnel Management and
by other Federal agencies to initiate the background investigation required to determine basic suitability for
Federal employment in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302, and E.O. 10577 (5 CFR Rule V). The number of respondents
annually who are not Federal appointees is expected to be 10 with total reporting hours of 5.0.

The Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, is completed by persons seeking placement in positions
currently labeled ``public trust'' positions because of their enhanced responsibilities, and for certain sensitive
positions that do not require access to classified information. Information collected on this form is used by the
Office of Personnel Management and by other Federal agencies to initiate the background investigation required
to determine suitability for placement in public trust/other sensitive, non-access positions in accordance with
5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302, E.O. 10577 (5 CFR Rule V), and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-130, Management
of Federal Information Resources, revised June 25, 1993, and its Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Computer
Systems, issued December 12, 1985. The number of respondents annually who are not Federal employees is expected to
be 1500 with total reporting hours of 1500.

The Standard Ford 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, is completed by persons performing, or seeking
to perform, national security duties for the Federal Government. This information collection also includes Standard
Form 86A, Continuation Sheet for Questionnaires SF 86, SF 85P, and SF 85, which is used to provide formatted space to
continue answers to questions. Information collected on this form is used by the Office of Personnel Management and
by other Federal agencies to initiate the background investigation required to determine placement in national
security positions in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2165, 22 U.S.C. 2584, 50 U.S.C. 781 to 887, and E.O. 10450, Security
Requirements for Government Employment, issued April 27, 1953. The number of respondents annually who are not Federal
employees is expected to be 172,150 with total reporting hours of 258,225.

For copies of this proposal call Doris Benz on (703) 908-8564.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OPM is proposing for public comment new standard questionnaires that will be used by all Federal agencies as the basis
for individual background investigations. The Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) is designed
for use by all Federal agencies as the basis for investigations preliminary to granting an individual access to classified
national security information or access to sensitive nuclear information or materials. The Questionnaire for Public
Trust Positions (SF 85P) will similarly serve as the basis for investigations concerning suitability for positions
requiring special public trust where suitability for positions requiring special public trust where such positions
do not involve access to classified national security information, such as those in law enforcement. The third form,
the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF 85), is signed for positions not involving special public trust
or requiring access to classified national security information.



The proposed forms where developed both to reduce the intrusiveness of investigations without compromising security
and to facilitate the portability of security clearances within the Federal Community. The forms will replace separate
forms currently used by the Department of Defense, the Office of Personnel Management, and other Federal agencies,
as well as supplemental forms used by some agencies. They will become the only such questionnaires used by Federal
agencies for this purpose.



Use of Less Intrusive Forms



Currently, individuals who have ``sensitive'' duties as well as individuals who have access to national security
information are required to complete the most intrusive forms, such as the current SF 86. We are revising this approach
so that only individuals needing a security clearance for access to classified national security information will
be required to complete the SF 86. Individuals who perform sensitive duties, such as those who may work in a sensitive
facility, that do not require access to classified national security information will use a less intrusive form,
the SF 85P.



Use of Existing Forms



During the course of developing the proposed forms, it became apparent that there was some confusion as to the appropriate
use of the current forms. In some cases, contractors were inappropriately using the SF 86 as a job application to screen
prospective employees. Additionally, some agencies were using the SF 86 where immediate access to classified national
security information was not needed. The instructions on each of the new forms have been clarified to show that they
will be used only after an individual is employed or has been given a conditional offer of employment. furthermore,
each new form explains precisely the types of positions for which the form is to be used. The SF 86 will be used only for
those positions requiring access to classified national security information or access to sensitive nuclear information
or materials. The SF 85P will be used for positions of public trust where access to classified national security information
is not required. The SF 85 will be used for other non-sensitive positions.



Mental Health Inquiries



Questions have also been raised concerning a negative perceptions of mental health counseling to which the existing
forms may be contributing. In addition, concerns were raised about the expansive and intrusive nature of current
mental health inquiries.

Some individuals apparently have the impression that consulting a mental health professional can jeopardize one's
ability to obtain or retain a security clearance. Not only is this impression incorrect, but seeking such help can
be a positive factor in a clearance adjudication.

Several revisions have been made to the mental health question to help communicate this message. The mental health
question itself has been changed so it does not refer to ``problems''. Instead, it simply asks about any concerning
mental health conditions.

Significantly, the revised forms will reduce the number of people questioned about mental health treatment. This
is because an inquiry into past mental health consultations is not relevant in all cases. Where a job's duties include
access to classified national security information, the SF 86, which contains the mental health question, will be
used. The SF 85P or SF 85, however, do not include mental health questions. If an agency decides that an individual's
duties require a mental health inquiry, the agency must justify its need to the Office of Personnel Management. If
it successfully does so, it may then use a supplemental form which contains the question.

<PARENT> FR941116-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Where a mental health question is used, certain kinds of counseling need not be reported. Specifically, the question
exempts marital, family and grief counseling not related to violent acts by the individual under investigation from
being reported. This is because such information is not relevant to a determination as to whether an individual obtains
a security clearance. In addition, the mental health question will now refer only to treatment/consultation received
within the past seven years, rather than one's entire life.

Finally, even where the mental health question is asked and answered affirmatively, an Investigator's inquiry into
the relevant mental consultation will be limited. A separate Authorization for Release of Information must be signed
by the subject of the investigation which authorizes an Investigator to seek mental health information from a mental
health care provider. That release will only authorize an Investigator to ask three specific questions. This narrower
release will place limits on the authority granted to Investigators without depriving them of relevant information.



Drug Use Inquiries



The questions on both the SF 86 and the SF 85P concerning illicit drug use include language that grants the respondent
immunity from criminal prosecution based upon a truthful answer to the questions. This addition has been made principally
to improve the accuracy of responses to this question, and thus enhance the reported in response to this question has
not been used for criminal actions against individuals.

The scope of the question about past drug use has been limited to 7 years on the SF 86, to be consistent with the proposed
revised scope of a national security investigation. In addition, the question concerning 

past

 drug use (more than one year ago), will not be asked on the SF 85P. Like the mental health question, it will only be asked
after an agency justifies use of the supplemental form based on the duties of the individual and receives approval
from OPM.



Simplification of Other Questions



Several of the forms being replaced inquire into areas such as past drug use, foreign countries visited, charges for
minor arrest offenses, or credit records over an individual's entire life. The proposed SF 86 limits the time of inquiry
on such questions to the most recent seven years. This change represents a significant reduction in the information
required by current forms without depriving adjudicators of relevant, probative information.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. Relating to the Short Sale of Securities in the Nasdaq National Market.</DOCTITLE>


November 7, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 25, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The CBOE proposes to amend the definition of ``designated Nasdaq National Market (``Nasdaq/NM'') security,'' contained
in CBOE Rule 15.10, to include all Nasdaq/NM securities underlying options classes for which an Exchange options
market-maker holds an appointment pursuant to CBOE Rule 8.7. The Exchange also proposes to add Interpretation and
Policies .02 and .03 to CBOE Rule 15.10, which in very limited circumstances expand the Nasdaq/NM securities which
may qualify for the exemption provided in paragraph (c)(2) of the Rule; specifically, market-maker options transactions
which facilitate an off-floor order, and market-maker transactions for nominees of the same market-maker organization.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange is amending its Rule 15.10 to expand the definition of ``designated Nasdaq/NM security'' to include
all Nasdaq/NM securities which underlie the options classes for which a market-maker holds an appointment. In practice
the CBOE has found the current definition, which limits designated Nasdaq/NM securities to no more than three (3)
trading stations of a market-maker, to be unnecessarily restrictive.
 Although not identical, the expansion of the definition to include underlying Nasdaq/NM securities for all appointed
options classes of a market-maker is consistent with the application of the exemption for options market-makers
in other similar markets.






Proposed Interpretation .02 to CBOE Rule 15.10 would permit an options market-maker, with prior notice to a Floor
Official or Order Book Official, to facilitate an off-floor order and contemporaneously hedge the resulting options
position with a short sale in applicable Nasdaq/NM securities as if such securities were designated securities under
paragraph (c)(2) of the Rule. This treatment is consistent with the NASD's interpretation concerning the hedging
of options facilitation transactions.





Proposed Interpretation .03 to CBOE Rule 15.10 would allow a nominee of a market-maker organization to effect short
sales as bid test exempt in a Nasdaq/NM security which the market-maker nominee has not designated as qualifying for
the exemption contained in paragraph (c)(2), provided that such security is a designated Nasdaq/NM security for
another nominee of the market-maker organization and such other nominee is not also present or represented by a Floor
Broker in the applicable trading station at the time of the bid test exempt sale. This interpretation will allow the
market-maker organization the ability to manage effectively its obligations when nominees are absent from the trading
floor due to illness, personal or other business, and is consistent with the intent of the exemption, in that the exemption
continues to be limited to those Nasdaq/NM securities which are used to hedge options transactions in the primary
classes in which the market-maker organization makes markets.
The CBOE believes that its proposal is consistent with and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in
that the rule change will promote maintenance of fair and orderly markets on the CBOE and will contribute to the protection
of investors and the public interest.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


CBOE Does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is proposing to amend its Resolution of the Board of Governors_Notice to Membership and Press Suspensions,

* * * * *



Resolution of the Board of Governors

Notice to Membership and Press of Suspensions, Expulsions, Revocations, and Monetary Sanctions and Release of Certain
Information Regarding Disciplinary History of Members and Their Associated Persons



The Association shall, in response to a written inquiry or telephonic inquiry via a toll-free telephone listing,
release certain information as contained in its files regarding the employment and disciplinary history of members
and their associated persons, including information regarding past and present employment history with NASD members,
all final disciplinary actions taken by federal or state or foreign securities agencies or self-regulatory organizations
that relate to securities or commodities transactions; all pending disciplinary actions that have been taken by
federal or state securities agencies or self-regulatory organizations that relate to securities and commodities
transactions and have been reported on Form BD or U-4 and all foreign government or self-regulatory organizations
disciplinary actions that are securities or commodities related and reported on Form BD or U-4; and all criminal
indictments, informations or convictions reported on Form BD or Form U-4. The Association will also release
information concerning civil judgments and arbitration decisions in securities and commodities disputes involving
public customers.

The Association shall report to the membership and to the press pursuant to the procedures and at the times outlined
herein any order of suspension, cancellation or expulsion of a member; or suspension or revocation of the registration
of a person associated with a member; or suspension or barring of a member or person associated with a member from association
with all members; or imposition of monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more upon a member or person associated with a member.
The Board of Governors may, in its discretion, determine to waive the notice provisions set forth herein as to an order
of imposition of monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more upon a member or person associated with a member, under those
extraordinary circumstances where notice would violate fundamental notions of fairness or work an injustice.

If a decision of a District Business Conduct Committee is not appealed to or called for review by the NBCC, the order
of the District Business Conduct Committee shall become effective on a date set by the Association but not before the
expiration of 45 days after the date of decision. Notices of decisions imposing monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more
or penalties of expulsion, revocation, suspension and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members
shall promptly be transmitted to the membership and to the press, concurrently; provided, however, no such notice
shall be sent prior to the expiration of 45 days from the date of the said decision.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, expulsions and bars imposed pursuant to the provisions of Article II,
Sections 10 and 11 of the Code of Procedure shall become effective upon approval or acceptance by the National Business
Conduct Committee, and publicity regarding any sanctions imposed pursuant to Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the
Code may be issued immediately upon such approval or acceptance.

If a decision of a District Business Conduct Committee is appealed to or called for review by the Board of Governors,
the order of the District Business Conduct Committee is stayed pending a final determination and decision by the Board
and notice of the action of the District Business Conduct Committee shall not be sent to the membership or the press
during the pendency of proceedings before the Board of Governors.

If a final decision of the Association is not appealed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the sanctions specified
in the decision (other than bars and expulsions) shall become effective on a date established by the Association but
not before the expiration of 30 days after the date of the decision, unless the decision specifies otherwise. Notices
of decisions imposing monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more on penalties of expulsion, revocation, suspension and/or
the barring of a person from being associated with all members shall promptly be transmitted to the membership and
to the press, concurrently; provided, however, no such notice shall be sent prior to the expiration of 30 days from
the date of 

a 

[said] decision 

imposing sanctions other than expulsion, revocation, and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all
members.

If a decision of the Board of Governors imposing monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more or a penalty of expulsion, revocation,
suspension and/or barring of a member from being associated with all members is appealed to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, notice thereof shall be given to the membership and to the press as soon as possible after receipt by the
Association of notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission of such appeal and the Association's notice shall
whether the effectiveness of the Board's decision has or has not been stayed pending the outcome of proceedings before
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In the event an appeal to the courts is filed from a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case previously
appealed to it from a decision of the Board of Governors, involving the imposition of monetary sanctions of $10,000
or more or a penalty of expulsion, revocation, suspension and/or barring of a member from being associated with all
members, notice thereof shall be given to the membership as soon as possible after receipt by the Association of a formal
notice of appeal. Such notice shall include a statement that the order of the Commission has or has not been stayed.
Any order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of revocation or suspension of a member's broker/dealer
registration with the Commission; or the suspension or expulsion of a member from the Association; or the suspension
or barring of a member or person associated with a member from association with all broker/dealers or membership;
or the imposition of monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more shall be made known to the membership of the Association
through a notice containing the effective date thereof sent as soon as possible after receipt by the Association of
the order of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Cancellations of membership or registration pursuant to the Association's By-Laws, Rules or Regulations shall
be sent to the membership and, when appropriate, to the press as soon after the effective date of the cancellation as
possible.
Notices to the membership and releases to the press referred to above shall identify the section of the Association's
Rules and By-Laws or the Securities and Exchange Commission Rules violated, and shall describe the conduct constituting
such violation. Notices may also identify the member with which an individual was associated at the time the violations
occurred if such identification is determined by the Association to be in the public interest.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The Resolution requires that a final NASD decision of the National Business Conduct Committee (``NBCC'') or the Board
of Governors of the NASD (``Board'') imposing monetary sanctions of $10,000 or more or penalties of expulsion, revocation,
suspension and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members be promptly transmitted to the membership
and to the press, concurrently; provided, however, no such notice shall be sent prior to the expiration of 30 days from
the date of the said decision. Upon review, the Association has determined that the elimination of the 30 day notification
delay regarding NASD final decisions ordering the most serious sanctions (i.e., expulsion, revocation, and/or
the barring of a person from being associated with all members) would further investor protection and the public interest
and that notification to the membership and to the press should be made promptly upon issuance of such final decisions.
The NASD, therefore, proposes to amend the Resolution to provide that no such notice shall be sent prior to the expiration
of 30 days from the date of a decision imposing sanctions other than expulsion, revocation, and/or the barring of a
person from being associated with all members. Such sanctions generally are imposed immediately.
The proposed rule change would not amend the Resolution's current 30 day notification delay on final decisions of
the NBCC or the Board regarding the lesser sanctions, nor amend the procedures with respect to decisions of the District
Business Conduct Committees.
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act which
provides that the rules of the association are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that the proposed rule change would amend the Resolution
to provide that notice of the issuance of a final decision of the NBCC or the Board ordering an expulsion, revocation,
and/or the barring of a person from being associated with all members would not be subject to the current 30 day notification
delay to the membership and to the press. The NASD believes that prompt notification to the membership and the press
of final decisions regarding such sanctions against members or persons associated with members will provide important
information to investors and further the public interest.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Expansion of the Exchange's Auto-Ex System Capacity to 20 Contracts</DOCTITLE>



November 7, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on June 20, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to amend PSE Rule 6.87, ``Automatic Execution System,''
to allow the Options Floor Trading Committee (``OFTC'') to be authorized to increase, on an issue-by-issue basis,
the size of the equity option orders that may be eligible to be executed through the Exchange's Automatic Execution
System (``Auto-Ex'') up to a maximum of 20 contracts.






The proposal was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34702 (September 22, 1994), 59 FR 49729
(September 29, 1994). The Commission received one comment letter on the proposal,
 in addition to the PSE's response to the letter.







The Auto-Ex system, a feature of the PSE's Pacific Options Exchange Trading System (``POETS''), permits eligible
market or marketable limit orders sent from member firms to be executed automatically at the displayed bid or offering
price. Participating market makers are designated as the contra side to each Auto-Ex order.
 Participating market makers are assigned by Auto-Ex on a rotating basis, with the first market maker selected at random
from the list of signed-on market makers. Auto-Ex preserves public Limit Order Book (``Book'') priority in all options.
If Auto-Ex determines that the Book price is at or better than the market quote, the Auto-Ex order is executed against
the Book. Automatic executions through Auto-Ex are currently available for public customer orders of 10 contracts
or less in all series of options traded on the PSE's options floor.





The Exchanges proposes to amend PSE Rule 6.87 to increase the maximum size of equity option orders eligible for Auto-Ex
and to provide the OFTC with the authority to designate such changes on an issue-by-issue basis. Under the proposal,
the OFTC is authorized to increase the size of orders eligible for an execution on Auto-Ex to a size of up to 20 contracts
without separate approval from the Commission.
 The PSE states that the proposed rule change is designed to enhance the Exchange's ability to compete for options order
flow.





The PSE believes that any implementation of the proposal by the OFTC will not impose any significant additional burdens
on the operation and capacity of the POETS system in general or on the Auto-Ex system in particular. In that regard,
the Exchange has submitted a separate capacity statement to the Commission setting forth the basis for this contention.
 The exchange also represents that the OFTC will determine that adequate market making capacity exists prior to increasing
Auto-Ex order size eligibility. The OFTC will make such a determination notwithstanding the fact that floor officials
may require market makers who are members of a trading crowd to which a particular option class is assigned to log onto
Auto-Ex in the event that there is inadequate participation in that options class.

<DOCNO> FR941116-2-00100 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941116-2-00076 </PARENT>

The PSE believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with Section 6(b)(5),
in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to promote just and equitable principles
of trade.

As noted above, the Commission received one comment letter concerning the proposal.
 In his September 12 Letter, the commenter argues that the proposal violates certain provisions of the Exchange's
Certificate of Incorporation. Specifically, the commenter states that floor brokers in the trading crowd have no
opportunity to participate in trades that are eligible for automatic execution through Auto-Ex unless they ``book''
their orders. Notwithstanding this, because certain types of orders, such as contingent orders and spreads, cannot
be placed on the book, book orders represented in the crowd are not eligible for execution against orders entered through
Auto-Ex. Therefore, the commenter believes that as a member of the Exchange, he should have an equal opportunity to
participate in trades that occur on the Exchange floor. Finally, the commenter questions why the semi-Auto-Ex function,
which would solve his concerns, has not been utilized on the PSE.





On October 31, 1994, the PSE submitted a letter responding to the comment letter.
 In its October 31 Letter, the PSE states that the Commission has approved automatic execution systems on other options
exchanges and, in approving POETS, has concluded that POETS provides substantial benefits to public customers.
In addition, the Exchange argues that providing floor brokers with the opportunity to participate in all trades on
the Exchange floor would require the elimination of Auto-Ex, which would be inconsistent with the Commission's determination
to give priority to small public customer orders and would place the PSE at a competitive disadvantage with the other
options exchanges. In response to the commenter's statement about semi-Auto-Ex, the PSE notes that the semi-Auto-Ex
feature of POETS has never been implemented and that the Exchange continues to study the software and precise mechanism
necessary to implement semi-Auto-Ex. Finally, the PSE argues that POETS and Auto-Ex has been approved previously
by the Commission, and therefore that the arguments raised by the commenter are untimely.





The Commission has considered carefully the opinions of the commenter and the PSE and finds, for the following reasons,
that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent
with Section 6 and Section 11A of the Act.
 The Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation of Auto-Ex provides for more efficient
handling and reporting of orders in PSE equity options through the use of new data processing and communications techniques,
thereby improving order processing and turnaround time. The Commission believes that Auto-Ex has benefitted public
customers by ensuring that a POETS order will be executed at the current disseminated quotation, and by allowing small
public customer orders to receive immediate executions and nearly instantaneous confirmations of orders.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that expanding the eligibility of Auto-Ex to public customer orders of up to
20 contracts for all PSE-traded equity options is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) in that it will extend the benefits
of automatic execution in equity options to a greater number of public customer orders while continuing to ensure
adequate limit order protection.






In regard to the commenter's specific concern, the Commission previously has approved small order execution systems
for option exchanges. For all of these systems, the Commission has found that interaction with the limit order book
was sufficient to provide limit order protection. Merely increasing the size of Auto-Ex eligible orders to 20 contracts
does not change the character of Auto-Ex orders sufficiently to warrant a reexamination of whether Auto-Ex orders
should interact with trading crowd orders. Orders of 20 contracts or less are still small sized orders, and truly large
orders will continue to interact with the trading crowd.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941116-2-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941116-2-00076 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Commission believes that the proposal will facilitate transactions in securities and promote competition
among options markets by placing the PSE in an equal competitive posture with the other options exchanges when competing
for order flow in equity options. In this regard, the Commission notes that the American Stock Exchange's and the Chicago
Board Options Exchange's automatic execution systems both have Commission approval to accommodate public customer
equity option orders of up to 20 contracts, and that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's automatic execution system
has Commission approval to accommodate public customer equity option orders of up to 25 contracts.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that the PSE's proposal is consistent with the Act because it eliminates constraints
in the PSE's rules that restrict the Exchange's ability to compete for order flow in equity options. The Commission
believes that enhanced competition among the exchanges for options order flow, in turn, should benefit public investors
and the public interest.





Finally, the Commission believes, based on representations by the Exchange, that expanding the order eligibility
size of Auto-Ex to 20 contracts for all equity options will not expose the PSE's options markets or equity markets to
risk of failure or operational break-down. The Exchange also states that the OFTC will determine that adequate market
making capacity exists prior to increasing the order size eligibility for any issue pursuant to the proposal.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-94-18) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Laredo Northwest International Bridge (Bridge IV), Laredo, TX: Issuance of Presidential Permit


<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of State is announcing the issuance of a Presidential Permit for the Laredo Northwest International
Bridge (Bridge IV) project sponsored by the City of Laredo, Texas. The permit was issued on October 7, 1994, pursuant
to the International Bridge Act of 1972, (33 U.S.C. 535 

et seq.

) and E.O. 11423, 33 FR 11741 (1968) as amended by E.O. 12847, 58 FR 96 (1993).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice of the application by the City of Laredo, Texas for a permit to build a new bridge, with access road, to be constructed
across the Rio Grande river between Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico was published in the Federal
Register on October 3, 1991, at 56 FR 50148. The bridge will carry pedestrian and commercial vehicular traffic, and
is intended to relieve the traffic burden on existing bridges and the downtown area. As a condition for the Presidential
Permit, the City of Laredo has agreed to route all commercial traffic to this new bridge or to the Colombia Bridge, which
is between the City of Laredo and the State of Nuevo Leon. Further, the City has agreed that all hazardous materials
will be directed to Colombia where the U.S. Customs Service has a hazardous materials containment facility. The new
bridge is needed because the two existing international bridges between downtown Laredo and Nuevo Laredo cannot
accomodate additional traffic without further safety and environmental degradation.


The application for the Presidential Permit was reviewed and approved by over two dozen federal, state, and local
agencies. The final application and environmental assessment were reviewed and approved or accepted by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, General Services Administration, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture,
Department of Commerce, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Highway Administration, Food and Drug Administration,
International Boundary and Water Commission_U.S. Section, Department of Defense, Department of Transportation,
the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of State, and the appropriate Texas State agencies_the Parks
and Wildlife Department, the Department of Transportation, and the Natural Resource Conservation Commission.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of State is announcing a finding of no significant impact on the environment for the Laredo Northwest
International Bridge (Bridge IV) project sponsored by the City of Laredo, Texas. An environmental assessment of
the proposed Laredo Northwest International Bridge project was prepared by Parsons Brinkerhoff, Quade & Douglas,
Inc. of Austin, Texas, for the sponsor, the City of Laredo, Texas. The draft environmental assessment was reviewed
by over two dozen federal, state, and local agencies. After revisions based on comments received from interested
agencies and other parties, the final assessment was reviewed and approved or accepted by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, General Services Administration, Department of Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce,
U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Highway Administration, Food and Drug Administration, International
Boundary and Water Commission_U.S. Section, Department of Defense, Department of Transportation, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Department of State, and the appropriate Texas State agencies_the Parks and Wildlife Department,
the Department of Transportation, and the Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Based on the environmental
assessment, information developed during the review of the City's application and environmental assessment, and
comments received, the Department has concluded that issuance of the permit will not have a significant effect on
the quality of the human environment within the United States. An environmental impact statement will not be prepared.

Proposed Action 
 


The City of Laredo, Texas, has requested a permit to build a new bridge, with access road, to be constructed across the
Rio Grande between Laredo, Texas, USA, and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The bridge is to be located 9.35 river
miles north along the Rio Grande from the existing Laredo International Bridge I. Initially, it will carry pedestrian
and freight traffic only, and is intended to relieve the traffic burden on existing bridges in downtown areas. As a
condition of issuance of the Presidential Permit, the City of Laredo has agreed to ban all commercial traffic from
the two existing bridges in downtown Laredo. The work will include the following items: The bridge structure, the
U.S. Customs Border Import lot facilities, a City Toll Plaza and Export lot facilities, water and sewer facilities
and a State Highway facility (Extension of FM 3464) connecting to FM 1472. The new bridge is needed to provide an alternate
route for existing commercial truck traffic, which currently passes from the two downtown bridges through the city
streets of Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. Increases in truck traffic at Laredo have averaged 19 percent over the past five
years, and can reasonably be expected to continue increasing with the entry into force of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

Factors Considered



The Department of State (``the Department'') is charged with issuance of Presidential Permits for the construction
of international bridges under the International Bridge Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 731; 33 U.S.C. 535 

et seq.,

 and Executive Order 11423, 33 FR 11741 (1968), as amended by Executive Order 12847 of May 17, 1993, 33 FR 96 (1993). The
Department considered four alternative actions in this case: (1) Denial of a Presidential Permit (the ``no action;''
alternative), (2) the City providing public transportation services between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, (3) issuance
of a Presidential Permit with a condition requiring diversion of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown
bridges in Laredo and (4) issuance of a Presidential Permit without a condition requiring the diversion of all commercial
traffic from the two existing downtown bridges.

In considering the ``no action'' alternative, and the alternative of the City providing public transportation services
between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, the Department noted the continuing increases in commercial truck traffic on the
existing Laredo bridges. Truck traffic (southbound only) increased from 274,743 trucks in 1987 to 781,332 in 1993.
It also noted the implementation of NAFTA beginning January 1, 1994, which it believes will further stimulate the
growth of truck traffic through Laredo. Approximately 60 percent of the commercial truck traffic between the United
States and Mexico already passes through Laredo and Nuevo Laredo. The population of the Laredo Metropolitan Statistical
Area increased from 99,258 in 1980 to 133,239 in 1990 and is expected to increase to 259,000 by the year 2010. The City
of Nuevo Laredo in Mexico has also seen considerable growth in the last ten years; its population is expected to increase
to as much as 350,000 by 2010. The increasing population, urbanization and commerce in the Laredo area mean that existing
problems of air pollution, traffic congestion, and danger from hazardous waste caused by heavy truck traffic will
continue to cause the quality of the environment of the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo downtown areas to deteriorate if no acceptable
alternative route for such traffic is provided.

The third alternative considered and the alternative chosen was to issue a Presidential Permit for construction
of a bridge with a condition requiring diversion of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges
in Laredo. The advantage of issuing a permit with such a condition is that it virtually eliminates the above-mentioned
problems of air pollution, traffic congestion and danger from hazardous waste from the Laredo downtown area, insofar
as these problems are caused by commercial truck traffic. The City has agreed to designate the new facility as a commercial
crossing only and to route all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges.

The fourth alternative considered was the issuance of a Presidential Permit without a condition requiring the diversion
of all commercial traffic from the two existing downtown bridges. Under this alternative, the environmental effects
would be essentially the same as described below, except that benefits to the environment of downtown Laredo would
not be as great as in the third alternative, as there is no assurance that commercial trucks would leave the downtown
area and use the new bridge. Except as a condition of issuance of a Presidential Permit, the Department of State has
no authority to require the City of Laredo to reroute traffic from the downtown bridges. If the new bridge is not constructed,
the City of Laredo is under no obligation to ban commercial truck traffic from the downtown bridges at all, and such
traffic would not be diverted to other bridges in the area, such as the Colombia/Solidarity bridge.

The Environmental Assessment submitted by the City provides information on the environmental effects of the construction
of a new bridge. On the basis of the Environmental Assessment, and information developed by the Department and the
other federal and state agencies in the process of reviewing the Environmental Assessment, the Department makes
the following conclusions regarding the impact of construction of a new international bridge at the proposed location.



Air Quality



Webb County, Texas, within which the proposed bridge is located, is designated as an attainment area for National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Since Webb County is in attainment, meeting the currently established National
Ambient Air Quality Standards, the U.S. Clean Air Act does not mandate that the State Implementation Plan (SIP) address
non-attainment requirements. Virtually all the air pollution caused by the City's proposal would be vehicle emissions.
As noted above, rerouting commercial truck traffic from downtown Laredo bridges to this bridge and the Colombia/Solidarity
bridge will have a positive impact on air quality in downtown Laredo. Overall emissions in Laredo would be reduced
because of reductions in idling time, startups and stops associated with long waits for inspection at the existing
bridges. Construction of the bridge and related infrastructure will have some transient impacts on air quality but
it is not expected that the ambient pollutants will cause violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
Based on the project descriptions provided, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission does not expect
that air emissions associated with the project will substantially impact ambient air quality.

<TEXT>
 

River Channel and Floodplains



Construction of the bridge involves placing of concrete piers and may have some minor short-term effects on the Rio
Grande channel. However, the City states that the bridge when constructed will not alter the existing hydrogeological
characteristics and will not increase backwater elevation in the Rio Grande by more than one foot. The bottom of the
structure will be 12.13 feet above the International Boundary and Water Commission's required water surface elevation
and will permit passage under the bridge of the 100-year flood of 181,000 cubic feet per second. The proposal was reviewed
by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, each of
which have concurred in the issuance of a Permit. Final design of the bridge will require the approval of the IBWC. 



Historical and Archaeological Resources



A programmatic agreement has been executed among the Department of State, the Advisory Council in Historic Preservation,
the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer, the Texas Department of Transportation and the City of Laredo, addressing
to the satisfaction of those agencies the City's obligation to avoid, minimize or mitigate the effects of the bridge
project on known and potential historic and archaeological resources within the construction area. The Presidential
Permit contains a provision that the City notify the United States Coast Guard if before or during construction historic
or archaeological properties are located and, if construction has already started, cease construction immediately
and prepare a Section 4(f) statement.



Land Use



The bridge and border station site are in an undeveloped area within the city limits. The City's Future Land Use Plan
shows the project area as open space along the Rio Grande floodplain, retail/office and warehouse/light industrial.
The site is predominantly native range and brush land. The general trend of growth of the City of Laredo indicates that
the area between the Mines Road and the Rio Grande is likely to be developed for warehouse, industrial and commercial
uses even in the absence of a border crossing. The opening of a border crossing will probably accelerate that development.
The project will not alter any park or recreational lands or significantly reduce any land suitable for agricultural
crops.



Threatened and Endangered Species



Construction of the project and subsequent development will not result in a significant reduction in range and brush
land available for habitat. As noted above, given the trends in growth of the City of Laredo, such habitat loss as may
occur is likely to occur even without construction of the bridge. Short-term disruption of narrow bands of vegetation
and thickets along the Rio Grande may occur in the course of construction of the bridge and supporting piers. However,
no permanent structures, other than bridge piers will be placed in this area, and after construction of the bridge,
the area is expected to revegetate. The City has committed to maintaining the Rio Grande as a corridor for wildlife.
In a seven point mitigation plan accepted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on August 24, 1994, the City agreed,
among other measures, to amend its Land Use Plan, designating the floodplains areas along the Rio Grande and the arroyos
located in the vicinity of the proposed project as open space. This was accomplished by City Council resolution of
June 27, 1994. The mitigation plan is part of the City's bridge permit application.



Noise



Modeling of the expected traffic noise levels in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively predicts an hourly A-weighted
sound level of 71 to 72 dBA, respectively. These levels do not exceed noise abatement criteria established by the FHWA.
The closest residential area receptor to the proposed project is a residential unit located approximately 2,050
feet north of the proposed project site. There is a three decibel reduction in noise every time the distance between
the noise source and the receptor is doubled. Assuming the noise analysis was conducted on the centerline of a 300 feet
wide right-of-way, the predicated 71 dBA would be reduced to approximately 30 dBA at the residential unit. Given reference
noise levels of 80 dBA, 77.5 dBA or 75 dBA at 50 feet from trucks accelerating or decelerating, the noise levels anticipated
at the residential unit would be 64, 61 and 59 dBA respectively, noise levels that are acceptable for picnic areas,
recreation areas, playgrounds, active sports areas and parks.



Water Quality/Public Water Supply



The area of the bridge and associated development will be served by the sewage system of the City of Laredo. Existing
water treatment facilities are adequate to handle the increased waste loads anticipated to be produced as a result
of the project. Construction activities may result in transient impacts on water quality. The Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission has stated that its concerns regarding water quality, including any discharges which may
originate from the project, have been met. 



Wetlands



Some minor wetlands are located along the banks of the Rio Grande. As noted above, construction may have some transient
effects on these areas, but no permanent construction other than bridge piers will occur in this area which might reduce
or otherwise affect the wetlands. 



Finding of the Environmental Assessment



On the basis of the Environmental Assessment, information developed during the review of the City's application
and environmental assessment, and comments received, a finding of no significant impact (``FONSI'') is adopted
and an environmental impact statement will not be prepared.

Notice of Application for Approval, Pursuant to Sections 608, 804(a), and 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936,
as Amended, for the Transfer of Certain Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreements to OMI Corp. and Operation of
Vessels in the Foreign and Domestic Trades, Respectively 



Notice is hereby given that by application dated November 3, 1994, OMI Corp. (OMI), acting on its own behalf and as attorney-in-fact
for Vulcan Carriers, Ltd. (Vulcan) requests, pursuant to section 608, section 804 and section 805(a) of the Merchant
Marine Act, 1936, as amended (Act), 46 U.S.C. sections 1178, 1222 and 1223, Article II-16 of Operating-Differential
Subsidy Agreements (ODSAs) MA/MSB-167(a), (b), (c), and (d), and Article 36 of Bareboat Charters between OMI
Patriot Transport, Inc. (OMI Transport), OMI Courier Transport, Inc. (OMI Courier Transport), OMI Rover Transport,
Inc. (OMI Rover Transport), or OMI Missouri Transport, Inc. (OMI Missouri Transport), and Vulcan, (1) permission
to assign the ODSAs to OMI; and (2) following assignment of the ODSAs to OMI, a waiver of section 804(a) for OMI to operate
vessels in the foreign trade and permission pursuant to section 805(a) for OMI to operate vessels in the coastwise
trade. 


Transfer of the ODSAS 


Article 36 of the Bareboat Charters dated February 5, 1990, between OMI Patriot Transport, OMI Courier Transport,
OMI Rover Transport (formerly subsidiaries of OMI Bulk Transport, Inc. and now subsidiaries of OMI Corp., collectively
the ``OMI subsidiaries''), or OMI Missouri Transport and Vulcan (collectively, ``the Bareboat Charters'') authorizes
the OMI subsidiaries and OMI Missouri Transport, with the consent of OMI Oriole Transport, Inc. (OMI Oriole Transport)
as time charterer, to name a successor bareboat charterer for the vessel named in the Bareboat Charter. The vessels
named in the repective Bareboat Charters include the PATRIOT, COURIER, RANGER, ROVER, OMI MISSOURI and OMI SACRAMENTO
(Official numbers 571049, 578746, 573810, 577241, 662123, and 662124, respectively.) These vessels operate under
a subsidy sharing agreement pursuant to the terms of the ODSAs. 

Further, a successor bareboat charterer can be named, without cause, at any time after the first anniversary of the
effective date of the Bareboat Charters, upon 90 days written notice. 

In support of its instant application, OMI points out that it is an established vessels operator with over 25 years
in operating experience. In addition, it is the second largest U.S. independent operator of bulk vessels. OMI notes
in this regard that it has the ability, experience, financial resources, and other qualifications necessary to become
an ODS operator. OMI is a citizen under the provisions of section 905(c) of the Act, and OMI's citizenship affidavit
is on file with the Maritime Administration. OMI states that information on the experience and background of its personnel
responsible for the administration of the ODSAs will be submitted prior to approval of the assignment of the ODSAs
to OMI. 


Waiver of Section 804 


In addition to the transfer of the respective ODSAs to OMI, OMI requests a waiver of the provisions of section 804(a)
for its continued operation of foreign-flag vessels. OMI requests that this waiver be valid for the duration of the
ODSAs. The termination dates are April 2, 1996 (PATRIOT), July 30, 1996 (RANGER), January 26, 1997 (COURIER), and
January 28, 1997 (ROVER). 

OMI currently operates 34 owned and chartered-in foreign-flag vessels, primarily crude and product tankers and
dry bulk vessels. OMI also has one foreign-flag vessel on order. OMI advises that operation of its foreign-flag vessels
permits it to help cover administrative expenses related to the operation of U.S.-flag vessels. 

OMI believes that authorizing it to continue to operate foreign-flag vessels subsequent to the transfer of the ODSAs
will not harm any U.S.-flag service. Moreover, no new service will be provided and no new vessels are being added to
a trade.

OMI asserts that given the limited time remaining on the ODSAs, the lack of negative effect of permitting it to continue
operating foreign flag vessels and the substantial benefit it can derive by spreading overhead costs associated
with its U.S.-flag vessels, good cause and special circumstances should be found for the requested waiver. In order
to retain its growth possibilities, OMI requests that its section 804 waiver permit OMI to operate up to 60 foreign-flag
vessels for the time remaining on the term of the ODSAs. 



Permission To Operate Coastwise Vessels 


OMI also requests permission pursuant to Section 805(a) to continue operating vessels in the coastwise trade following
OMI's approval as operator of the ODSAs for the limited time remaining on the ODSAs. 

OMI currently owns in its U.S.-flag fleet one crude oil tanker, three chemical/product tankers, four product tankers,
and three dry bulk carriers. The crude oil tanker operates primarily in the Alaska oil trade. The three chemical carriers
are operated through a joint marketing arrangement and carry cargoes primarily from the Gulf of Mexico to the east
and west coast. The three dry bulk carriers operate in the cargo preference trade and in the subsidized foreign trade
under the subsidy sharing arrangements of the ODSAs. The four product tankers, bareboat operated by Vulcan, participate
primarily in the vegetable oil trade in South America. 

In OMI's view, simply changing the operator of the ODSAs will not change the competitive marketplace for any U.S.-flag
vessel operating in markets with the U.S.-flag vessels operated by OMI. These vessels, according to OMI, will face
exactly the same competitive conditions after the transfer of the ODSAs as they did prior to the transfer. 
OMI states that permitting it to continue to operate U.S.-flag vessels following the transfer will not be prejudicial
to the objects and policies of the Act. OMI states that it is a well established vessel owner and operator with a history
of U.S.-flag operations. Thus, OMI asserts that permitting it to continue in that endeavor for the duration of the
ODSAs will further the operation of the U.S. merchant marine. 
OMI advises that no subsidy received by it pursuant to the ODSAs will be used to benefit OMI's non-subsidized coastwise
operations. In this connection, OMI points out that under current accounting practices, the use of subsidized funds
can be audited easily and companies can provide needed assurances that funds will not be used for non-subsidized purposes.

Finally, OMI notes that its request for permission under section 805(a) does not involve any issue of material fact
that cannot be resolved on the basis of available information. 
Any person, firm, or corporation having any interest in the application for section 804(a) waiver and/or section
805(a) permission and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must file written comments in triplicate,
to the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7210, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC
20590, by the close of business on November 30, 1994. The Maritime Administration, as a matter of discretion, will
consider any comments submitted and take such action with respect thereto as may be deemed appropriate. 
If such comments deal with section 805(a) issues, they should be accompanied by a petition for leave to intervene.
The petition should state clearly and concisely the grounds of interest and the alleged facts relied on for relief.
If no petitions for leave to intervene on section 805(a) issues are received within the specified time, or if it is determined
that petitions filed do not demonstrate sufficient interest to warrant a hearing, the Maritime Administration will
take such action as may be deemed appropriate. In the event petitions regarding the relevant section 805(a) issues
are received from parties with standing to be heard, a hearing will be held, the purpose of which will be to receive evidence
under section 805(a) relative to whether the proposed operations (a) could result in unfair competition to any person,
firm or corporation operating exclusively in the coastwise or intercoastal service, or (b) would be prejudicial
to the objects and policy of the Act relative to domestic operations.

ACTION: 

Notice of Receipt of petition for decision that nonconforming 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars
are eligible for importation. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars that were not originally manufactured to comply with all
applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United States because (1)
they are substantially similar to vehicles that were originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States and that were certified by their manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) they are
capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards. 
 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
 
 
Background 
 


Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I)) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable federal motor
vehicles safety standards. 
 
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA published notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then published this decision in the 

Federal Register

. 
 
J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer 90-006) has petitioned NHTSA to
decide whether 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United
States. The vehicles that J.K. believes are substantially similar are the 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4
passenger cars that were manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by their
manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. 
 
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger
cars to their U.S. certified counterparts, and found the vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most Federal motor vehicle safety standards. 
 
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1972 and 1973 Ferrari
Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger cars, as originally manufactured, conform to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards
in the same manner as their U.S. certified counterparts, or are capable of being readily altered to conform to those
standards. 
 
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1972 and 1973 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB/4 passenger
cars are identical to their U.S. certified counterparts with respect to compliance with standards Nos. 102

Vol. 59, No. 220



Wednesday, November 16, 1994








DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD



Pursuant to the provisions of the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b), notice is hereby given of a meeting
of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board described below concerning the Board's fifth annual report to be submitted
to Congress under 42 U.S.C. 2286e note. 




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

An independent agency within the Executive Branch, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board provides advice
and recommendations to the President and the Secretary of Energy regarding public health and safety issues at Department
of Energy (DOE) defense nuclear facilities. 



Broadly, the Board reviews operations, practices, and occurrences at DOE's defense nuclear facilities and makes
recommendations to the Secretary of Energy that are necessary to protect public health and safety. If, as a result
of its reviews, the Board determines that an imminent or severe threat to public health or safety exists, the Board
is required to transmit its recommendations directly to the President, as well as to the Secretaries of Energy and
Defense. 

The Board's enabling statute, 42 U.S.C. 2286, requires the Board to review and evaluate the content and implementation
of health and safety standards, including DOE'S Orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating to the design,
construction, operation, and decommissioning of DOE's defense nuclear facilities. The Board must then recommend
to the Secretary of Energy any specific measures, such as changes in the content and implementation of those standards,
that the Board believes should be adopted to ensure that the public health and safety are adequately protected. The
Board is also required to review the design of new defense nuclear facilities, and to recommend changes necessary
to protect health and safety. 

The Board may conduct investigations, issue subpoenas, hold public hearings, gather information, conduct studies,
establish reporting requirements for DOE, and take other actions in furtherance of its review of health and safety
issues at defense nuclear facilities. The ancillary functions of the Board and its staff all relate to the accomplishment
of the Board's primary functions, which is to assist DOE in identifying and correcting health and safety problems
at defense nuclear facilities. 

This public meeting is being held to obtain information from the Department of Energy that will assist the Board in
preparing its fifth annual report to be submitted to Congress under 42 U.S.C. 2286e note. The Board's fifth annual
report must include: 




``(1) an assessment of the degree to which the overall administration of the Board's activities are believed to meet
the objectives of Congress in establishing the Board;

(2) recommendations for continuation, termination, or modification of the Board's functions and programs, including
recommendation for transition to some other independent oversight arrangement if it is advisable ; and 

(3) recommendations for appropriate transition requirements in the event that modifications are recommended.''




The Secretary of Energy, her designated representatives and other witnesses will be called to assist the Board in
answering these questions. Among the topics witnesses will be asked to testify on are the following:




1. Whether the Board has assisted the Department of Energy in identifying significant nuclear safety problems and
helped the Department in correcting such problems through the recommendation process. 

2. Whether DOE believes the objectives of Congress in establishing the Board are being met. 

3. Whether the Board's activities over the past five years, or the new mission of the defense nuclear complex, indicate
that Congress should provide for some other regulatory or oversight arrangement. 

4. The transition requirements if some other regulatory or oversight arrangement is appropriate. 

5. Descriptions of the basic safety management system that the DOE currently has in place for satisfying its responsibilities
under the Atomic Energy Act ``to protect or to minimize danger to life and property.''

6. The role of oversight and enforcement of safety requirements in regulating DOE's defense nuclear facilities.
This discussion should provide the Board with an understanding of DOE's recently revised policy and programs for
oversight and enforcement dealing with contractor noncompliance with DOE's health and safety Orders, rules and
regulations. The presentation should include DOE's assessment of the impact DOE's past oversight and enforcement
programs have had upon DOE's efforts to protect the public and safety at its defense nuclear facilities and any prospective
changes that may be contemplated.




The Board specifically reserves its right to further schedule and otherwise regulate the course of the meeting, to
recess, reconvene, postpone or adjourn the meeting, conduct further reviews, and otherwise exercise its power under
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.

COOPERATIVE STATE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND EXTENSION SERVICE



Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program; Fiscal Year 1995; Solicitation of Applications



Purpose



Proposals are invited for competitive grant awards under the Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program
(the ``Program'') for fiscal year 1995. The authority for the Program is contained in section 1668 of Public Law 101-624
(the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. 5921). The Program is administered by the Cooperative
State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. (The CSREES was established by Pub. L. 103-354, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform
and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, and the functions of the Cooperative State Research Service
were transferred to the CSREES by the Secretary of Agriculture's Memorandum 1010-1.)

The purpose of the Program is to assist Federal regulatory agencies in making science-based decisions about the safety
of introducing genetically modified plants, animals, and microorganisms into the environment. The Program accomplishes
this purpose by providing scientific information derived from the risk assessment research conducted under it.
Research proposals submitted to the Program must be applicable to the purpose of the Program to be considered. Proposals
based upon field research and whole organism-population level studies are strongly encouraged. Awards will not
be made for clinical trials, commercial product development, product marketing strategies, or other research not
appropriate to risk assessment. Proposals should be applicable to current regulatory issues surrounding the ecological
impacts of genetically modified organisms, with special emphasis on natural ecosystem consequences.



Applicant Eligibility



Proposals may be submitted by any United States public or private research or educational institution or organization.



Available Funding



The amount available for support of the Program in fiscal year 1995 is approximately $1.7 million.

Pursuant to Section 712 of Public Law 103-330 (the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995), funds available in fiscal year 1995 to pay indirect costs on research
grants awarded competitively by CSREES may not exceed 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each
award.

In addition, pursuant to Sec. 719(b) of Public Law 103-330, in the case of any equipment or product that may be
authorized to be purchased with the funds provided under this Program, entities are encouraged to use such funds to
purchase only American-made equipment or products.



Program Description



Under the Program, USDA will competitively award research grants to support science-based biotechnology regulation
and thus help address concerns about the effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the environment
and to help regulators develop policies concerning such introduction. Proposals are invited in the area of biotechnology
risk assessment research as appropriate to agricultural plants, animals and microbes. Emphasis will be given to
risk assessment research involving genetically modified organisms, but model systems using nongenetically modified
organisms also will be considered if they can provide information that could lead to improved assessment of potential
risks associated with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment. 

Proposals will be evaluated by the Administrator assisted by a peer panel of scientists for science quality, relevance
for current regulatory issues, and intent to advance the safe application of biotechnology to agriculture by providing
new knowledge for science-based regulatory decisions. The development of better risk assessment methods for field
testing genetically modified organisms will also be considered.

Areas of Research to Be Supported in Fiscal Year 1995



Proposals addressing the following research topics are requested:

1. Development of new risk assessment methods (e.g., monitoring organism escape, measuring biological impacts),
and risk assessment procedures (e.g., comparative analysis of ecosystems, models to predict risks) that could be
used in risk assessment of genetically modified fungi, bacteria, viruses (including animal vaccines), plants,
arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals. Applicants should address the need for, and development of, such new risk assessment
methods in the course of addressing a specific and defined risk assessment issue, especially as pertains to genetically
modified organisms.

2. Creation of information systems and computer models to support regulatory agency decision-making in regards
to potential impacts to the environment over time (e.g., computer models to describe the interaction of environmental
and organismal factors especially for establishment and dispersal of the organism).

3. Risk assessment of the environmental fate (e.g., survival, reproduction fitness, genetic stability, horizontal
gene transfer) as correlated with effects (e.g., loss of genetic diversity, enhanced competition) of genetically
modified fungi, bacteria, viruses, plants, arthropods, fish, birds and mammals introduced into the environment
(i.e., not in a contained laboratory, greenhouse or building); and studies or identification of traits which may
influence fate and effects.

In response to requests to Program Directors and Federal regulatory agencies, as stipulated in the authorizing legislation
for the Program, section 1668 of Public Law 101-624, the following specific areas of risk assessment research
have been identified as eligible for competition as research topics for this year.

4. The bidirectional rates, effects of selection pressures, mechanisms and impact of gene transfer between currently
genetically transformable crop species and existing North American wild relatives of those crops including studies
of methods of mitigation of potential gene exchange. Species specifically identified by the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service include rye, oats, barley, sorghum and turfgrasses. Research could rely on reanalysis of published
information and/or laboratory/field studies.

5. The potential for recombination between plant viruses and plant-encoded noncapsid viral genes (e.g., replicase),
especially for those viruses in supergroup B (carmovirus, tombusvirus, luteovirus, sobemovirus). Such studies
should identify recombination potentials and, if demonstrated, define frequencies and effect on symptom expression.

6. The potential for plants to express nonviral genes using noncoding regulatory sequences (promoters, translational
enhancers, termination sequences) derived from plant viruses that naturally infect the plants (e.g., cauliflower
mosaic virus and 

Brassica 

spp.). The potential for changes in expression of introduced genes or other aspects of host physiology when the transgenic
plant becomes infected with plant viruses, especially those from which the noncoding sequence was derived or from
related viruses.

7. Changes in viral host ranges or the types of viral vectors as a result of the use of transgenic plants expressing viral
genes.

8. The potential for nontarget effects of introduced plant-defense compounds expressed in genetically modified
plant-associated microorganisms (e.g., compounds in phyllosphere or rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria) or in
plants (e.g., 

Bacillus thuringiensis 

delta-endotoxin), especially in regard to persistence of the organisms and material in the environment.

9. Identification of genes which can confer additional pathogenicity to animal pathogens. Pathogenic organisms
specifically identified by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as being of interest are Marek's disease
virus, laryngo tracheitis virus, bovine leukemia virus, eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, bovine diarrhea
virus, 

Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae

 and 

Haemophilus somnus.

10. Environmental risk analysis of large scale deployment of genetically engineered organisms, especially commercial
uses of such organisms, with special reference to considerations that may not be revealed through small scale evaluations
and tests.


All research proposals submitted should include a statement describing the relevance of the proposed project to
one or more of the research topics requested. When appropriate, detailed descriptions of statistical analyses to
be done should be included in the proposal. The inclusion of statisticians as co-principal investigators or contractors
is encouraged.






Note:

 Individual investigators whose research projects are funded under the Program will be required to attend and present
data on the results of their research at an Annual Conference. Attendance costs at such a conference do not need to be
included in the budgets of proposed research projects; such costs will be paid from funds provided under a cooperative
agreement between CSREES and the University of Maryland for an annual risk assessment symposium. Additionally,
a final project report on research results will be required in a fixed protocol, electronic format, suitable for distribution
by USDA on CD-ROM.

Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)


As outlined in 7 CFR Part 3407 and 7 CFR Part 520 (the CSREES and ARS regulations implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969), environmental data for any proposed project is to be provided to CSREES and ARS so that CSREES and
ARS may determine whether any further action is needed. The applicant shall review the following categorical exclusions
and determine if the proposed project may fall within one of the categories.


(1) Department of Agriculture Categorical Exclusions


(7 CFR 1b.3)


(i) Policy development, planning and implementation which are related to routine activities such as personnel,
organizational changes, or similar administrative functions;
(ii) Activities which deal solely with the funding of programs, such as program budget proposals, disbursements,
and transfer or reprogramming of funds;
(iii) Inventories, research activities, and studies, such as resource inventories and routine data collection
when such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity;
(iv) Educational and informational programs and activities;
(v) Civil and criminal law enforcement and investigative activities;
(vi) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other agencies and public and private entities; and
(vii) Activities related to trade representation and market development activities abroad.


(2) CSREES and ARS Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 3407.6 and 7 CFR 520.5


Based on previous experience, the following categories of CSREES and ARS actions are excluded because they have been
found to have limited scope and intensity and to have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality
of the human environment:
(i) The following categories of research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term
effects on the environment:
(A) Research conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse, or other contained facility where research practices
and safeguards prevent environmental impacts;
(B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes
in the environment; and
(C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar
chemicals or biological materials.
(ii) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition
and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity.
In order for CSREES and ARS to determine whether any further action is needed with respect to NEPA, pertinent information
regarding the possible environmental impacts of a particular project is necessary; therefore, a separate statement
must be included in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project falls within a
categorical exclusion and the reasons therefor. If it is the applicant's opinion that the project proposed falls
within the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusions must be identified. The information submitted shall
be identified as ``NEPA Considerations'' and the narrative statement shall be placed after the coversheet of the
proposal.
Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSREES and ARS may determine that an Environmental
Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for an activity, if substantial controversy on environmental
grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present which may cause such activity to
have a significant environmental effect.


Proposal Submission


What to Submit


An original and 14 copies of a proposal must be submitted. Each copy of each proposal must be stapled securely in the
upper lefthand corner (DO NOT BIND). All copies of the proposal must be submitted in one package.

AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; selection of center sites.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Labor requests assistance in identifying sites for locating four new Job Corps centers. This notice
specifies the requirements and criteria for selection.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of Labor (Department) is soliciting proposals for sites to establish four new Job Corps centers. The
Job Corps program is designed to serve disadvantaged young women and men, 16 through 24, who are in need of additional
educational, vocational and social skills training, and other support services in order to gain meaningful employment,
return to school or enter the Armed Forces. The program is primarily a residential program operating 24 hours per day,
7 days per week with non-resident enrollees limited by legislation to 20 percent of national enrollment. However,
while the 20-percent level should be used as a guideline, the percentage of non-residents can vary from center to center,
depending upon local needs.



To assist potential applicants, the Department of Labor will conduct an orientation session from 9 a.m. to 12 noon
on December 14, 1994 in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Training Center, room G440, Postal Square Building at 2nd and
Massachusetts Avenue, Washington, DC (photo I.D. required for entrance). The orientation will enable prospective
proposers to obtain clarification of the information provided in this Notice. If you plan to attend, please notify
Mr. Peter E. Rell at the phone number listed above by December 9, 1994.

From this solicitation, the Department intends to select four localities for locating new centers. One of the four
localities is intended to be a replacement site for the Chesapeake Job Corps Center, which was located in Maryland
and was closed in 1989 for reasons unrelated to performance.

This solicitation is for site selection only and 

not

 for the operation of these Job Corps centers. A competitive contract procurement for selection of a center operator
at each site will be initiated and completed well after the site selection process has been completed.

Congress continued the Job Corps expansion authorized in previous years by appropriating $10 million in the Fiscal
Year 1995 Department of Labor Appropriations Act to initiate four additional new Job Corps centers. The accompanying
congressional report language described the use of a competitive process in selecting these sites and said that the
Department should give priority to those localities having a high level of organized community support for a center
and which are:

 In States with less than 2 percent of eligible youth currently served by the Job Corps program;

 In States which can demonstrate a high incidence of minority or other youth unemployment;

 In States that currently have two or fewer Job Corps centers and have not recently been selected for a new center
in the Department's selection process; and

 In States with high percentages of non-urban youth.






Also, the report language instructed the Department to give consideration to proposed sites that will serve individuals
with limited English proficiency.

<DOCNO> FR941116-2-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941116-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The determination of need will be made by analyzing State-level rural poverty and overall poverty rates for youth,
ages 16 through 24, youth unemployment, and limited English proficiency levels, using standardized uniform data
available through federal agencies, such as 1990 census data, Bureau of Labor Statistics publications, and existing
Job Corps centers, slots and locations.

In addition to the requirements in the appropriations language, the Department will assess the facilities at proposed
sites. The assessment will be in terms of property acquisition costs, the cost and suitability of existing structures
and the need for, and cost of, new construction and renovation.

Further, the Department will assess each jurisdiction's plan to use State and local resources, both public and private,
through contributions/linkages that will reduce the Federal cost of operating a Job Corps center. Such contributions/linkages
may include, but are not limited to, the provision of child care services by local jurisdictions, provision of health
services, alcohol and drug counseling, referral of eligible youth to Job Corps, and job placement assistance after
leaving Job Corps, as well as arrangements with public school systems, community college networks, social service
agencies, business and industry, and other training programs to provide such services as classroom training, vocational
training, advanced learning opportunities, and co-enrollment arrangements with appropriate JTPA programs. Contributions
of this nature will make maximum use of available statewide and community resources in meeting the needs of these youth.

Finally, additional points will be awarded for proposed sites located in empowerment zones and enterprise communities
in accordance with guidelines in ``Building Communities: Together,'' published by the U.S. Departments of Housing
and Urban Development and Agriculture in the spring of 1994. Under this program, the Federal Government will designate
up to 104 areas that meet certain poverty and distress criteria and prepare creative strategic plans for revitalization.
The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will designate up to six urban Empowerment Zones and 65 Enterprise
Communities and the Secretary of Agriculture will designate up to three rural Empowerment Zones and 30 Enterprise
Communities. Announcement of these is expected to be made in December 1994.

Eligible applicants for proposing sites are units of State and/or local governments. A Federal agency also may propose
sites to the extent that such sites are located on public land which is under the jurisdiction of the agency. In addition,
proposals submitted by Federal agencies must have the support of appropriate State and local governments.

Since Job Corps is primarily a residential program and provides academic education, vocational training, and extensive
support services, space and facilities suitable for the following types of utilization are required for a Job Corps
center.

 

Residential_

Adequate housing, including bath and lounge facilities, as well as appropriate administrative space.

 

Academic Education_

Space for classrooms, computer labs, and library resources.

 

Vocational Training_

Classroom and shop space to satisfy the needs of specific vocational training areas (

e.g., 

carpentry, clerical, painting, culinary arts, health education). The configuration of the vocational area, with
regard to classroom and shop areas, is determined by the ultimate vocational mix offered at the center. In this regard,
heavy trades, such as construction and automotive, require shop areas, while lighter trades, such as clerical and
retail sales, require only classroom space.

 

Food Services_

Cafeteria, including food preparation and food storage areas.

 

Medical/Dental_

Medical examining rooms, nurses' station, infirmary space for male and female students, and dental facilities.

 

Recreation_

Gymnasium/multi-purpose recreational facility and large, level outdoor area.

 

Administration_

General office and conference space.

Storage/Support

_Warehousing and related storage including operations and maintenance support.

 

Parking

_Sufficient for a minimum of 70 vehicles. Other factors that influence the suitability and cost of facilities necessary
to operate a Job Corps center include the following:



Configuration of Facility



The preferred configuration of a facility is a campus-type environment permitting a self-contained center with
all space requirements located on-site. Low-rise buildings such as those commonly found in public school and college
settings are preferred.

The Office of Job Corps has developed prototype designs for selected facilities where new construction is necessary.
Parties interested in obtaining copies of these designs may do so by contacting the Office of Job Corps at the address
shown above.



Location of Facilities



Facilities should be located in areas where neighbors are supportive and no major pervasive community opposition
exists. Past experience indicates that commercial, light industrial, and rural locations are most desirable in
this regard, while high-value residential locations are the least conducive to community acceptance. In addition,
access to emergency medical services and fire and law enforcement assistance should be within reasonable distances.
If non-residential enrollment is planned, direct and easy access to the center by public transportation is an important
consideration. Moreover, proposed sites should be within reasonable commuting distance of planned linkages with
other programs and services and easy access to transportation to these linkages should be available. Locations with
major environmental issues, zoning restrictions, flood plain and storm drainage requirements, or uncertainty
regarding utility connections that cannot be resolved efficiently and in a timely manner are less than desirable.
Likewise, a facility with buildings which are eligible under the National Historical Preservation Act may receive
less than favorable consideration, due to restrictions on and costs for renovation. Communities are encouraged
to hold public hearings in close proximity to the facilities being proposed to ascertain the level of community support
for a Job Corps center. The Office of Job Corps has developed a 12-minute video (available in English and Spanish) which
provides an overview of the Job Corps program and can be useful in informing the local community about Job Corps. Any
proposer interested in obtaining a copy of either version of this video may contact the Office of Job Corps at the address
shown above.



Own/Lease



Ownership is preferred over leased facilities, since most facilities will require a substantial investment of construction
funds to make the site suitable for Job Corps utilization. Exceptions are long-term leases (

e.g.

, 25 years or longer) at a nominal cost (

e.g.,

 $1/year).



Size



The size (capacity) of Job Corps centers can vary substantially. However, centers with a capacity of less than approximately
275 students are relatively cost-inefficient in terms of operating cost. Centers above approximately 500 students
are less desirable from a programmatic and management standpoint.

The following table shows the approximate gross square feet (GSF) required for the various types of buildings. The
examples shown are for centers with 100-percent residential capacity of 275 and 500 students, respectively. The

Note: 

Space requirements for child care and single parent dormitories are included in the event these activities are proposed.
