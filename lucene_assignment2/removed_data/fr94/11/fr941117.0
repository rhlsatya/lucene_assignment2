NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION







Corporate Credit Unions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NCUA is amending its regulations governing corporate credit unions to reduce the close ties between many corporate
credit unions and credit union trade associations. The final rule requires that at least a majority of a corporate
credit union's directors, including the chair, be representatives of member credit unions. The rule provides that
a majority of a corporate credit union's directors may not be individuals who also serve as officers, directors, or
employees of the same trade association or affiliated trade associations. The rule requires that the chief executive
officer of a corporate credit union answer solely to the board of directors and not also serve as an employee of a trade
association. While the rule imposes these and other requirements to ensure corporate credit union governance is
controlled by member credit unions, substantial revisions from the Board's earlier proposed rule have been made
to address concerns raised by commenters.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



A. Background




 On April 12, 1994, the NCUA Board issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) regarding the relationship
between corporate credit unions and credit union leagues and trade associations. 59 FR 18503, April 19, 1994. The
ANPR noted that approximately half of the corporate credit unions are closely tied to leagues and trade associations,
through integrated boards or management relationships. The ANPR requested comment on whether Part 704 should be
amended to require that the board of directors of a corporate credit union be independently elected by its members,
with the condition that a majority of the board seats be held by representatives of member credit unions, that all or
a majority of the corporate credit union board be comprised of representatives who do not also serve on the board of
a league or trade association, and that management of a corporate credit union report solely to the board of the corporate
credit union.

NCUA received 400 comment letters in response to the ANPR, 115 expressing general support for the proposed changes,
278 expressing general opposition, and 7 commenting on tangential issues. Remaining concerned that a corporate
credit union system independent of trade association control is important to the safety and soundness of the credit
union system, the Board determined to request comment on specific proposed changes. Accordingly, on September 16,
1994, the Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking. 59 FR 48832, September 23, 1994.

It was proposed that the definition of ``corporate credit union'' be amended by providing that a corporate credit
union could not require its members to belong to any other organization. It was proposed that at least a majority of
a corporate credit union's directors, including the chair, be individuals who represented member credit unions
and who were not officers, directors, or employees of a credit union-related organization. ``Credit union-related
organization'' was proposed to be defined as a credit union league or trade association, an affiliate of a credit union
league or trade association, or an entity operated or controlled by a credit union league, trade association, or affiliate.
For purposes of meeting the required majority, it was proposed that an individual be prohibited from serving as a director
of a corporate credit union if another individual from his or her credit union was serving as an officer, director,
or employee of a credit union-related organization.

To implement the existing requirement that elections be conducted by mail ballot, revisions were proposed to the
standard corporate federal credit union bylaws. In addition, it was proposed that state chartered corporate credit
unions be required to comply with those bylaws. It was proposed that if an individual ceased to be the representative
of an organization for any reason, his or her seat would be declared vacant and filled by the corporate credit union
board in accordance with the bylaws. Finally, it was proposed that the recusal provision be strengthened, that management
report solely to the board, and that no management official or other employee of a corporate credit union could be an
employee or official of a credit union-related organization.

NCUA received 417 comments on the proposed rule: 330 from natural person credit unions, 29 from corporate credit unions,
33 from credit union trade associations, 10 from state regulatory agencies, 10 from individuals, 3 from central credit
unions, 1 from a chapter of a state league, and 1 from a bank trade association. Of the commenters 291 were opposed to
any NCUA regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance, 95 supported some regulation in that area but
stated that the proposed regulation went too far, and 31 supported the proposed regulation with no or only minor modifications.

Many of the commenters who objected to any regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance expressed the
view that the Board should not go forward with a proposed regulation in the face of opposition by the majority of commenters
on the ANPR. Some suggested that the decision to go forward was an indication that the Board did not bother to consider
the comments and that commenting was useless. In fact, the Board took very seriously the comments of interested parties,
and relied on them to produce what it considers to be a better product. The regulatory process, while allowing interested
parties to participate in rule making through submission of written data, views, and arguments, does not bind the
Board to abide by such submissions. Having solicited comments, the Board, as an independent regulatory body, must
then act in its best judgment to establish policies that it believes will ensure the safety and soundness of federally
chartered and insured credit unions.

The Board has concluded that because the interests of trade associations (which are basically political organizations)
and financial institutions often conflict, trade association control of a corporate credit union can cause, and
in several instances has caused, improper allocation of corporate resources. By this rule, the Board seeks to position
corporate credit unions to remain free of conflicts of interest and to avoid the appearance of such conflicts that
could diminish public confidence in the credit union system.

The commenters on the proposed rule who objected to any regulation on interlocks did so primarily on the basis that
corporate credit union governance is not a safety and soundness issue. The fact is that trade association control
of corporate credit unions is a safety and soundness issue. Less than arms length financial transactions, and problems
of financial and fiduciary accountability and control in corporate credit unions with close board and management
ties to trade associations, can affect resource allocation decisions. The Board is well aware of several instances
where such misallocations have occurred. To prevent both the real and apparent conflicts of interest, the Board has
determined that regulatory changes are in order.

The commenters who were in favor of some regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance tended to believe
that the proposed regulation was on the right track but that some of its provisions were too broad. The commenters argued
that the proposed rule could be modified and still meet the goal of eliminating trade association control of corporate
credit unions. The Board agrees and has amended the proposed rule as discussed below.



C. Section-by-Section Analysis


Section 704.2 Definitions



The final rule retains the proposed addition to the definition of ``corporate credit union'': the requirement that
a corporate credit union may not condition a credit union's eligibility to join the corporate credit union on that
credit union's membership in any other organization. Most of the commenters who favored some regulation in this area
supported the amendment. In a first step in providing a clearer definition of what a corporate credit union is, the
final rule also adds two new elements to the definition. These are that a corporate credit union is chartered by state
or federal law as a credit union and that it provides share and loan services to other credit unions.

Among the commenters who favored some regulation, many suggested that the term ``credit union-related organization''
was confusing. Accordingly, that term has been eliminated and replaced with the term ``trade association,'' which
is defined in the final rule to include entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a trade association.
When used in the regulation, ``trade association'' is modified by the words ``credit union.'' ``Credit union trade
association'' includes, but is not necessarily limited to, state credit union leagues and league service corporations,
national credit union trade associations and their affiliates and service organizations, and local, state, and
national special interest credit union associations and organizations.



Section 704.12(a) Board Representation



The proposed rule provided that the board was to be determined as stipulated in the standard federal corporate credit
union bylaws. Some commenters objected to requiring state chartered corporate credit unions to comply with federal
bylaws. The Board is sensitive to state interests but believes it is critical that each corporate credit union follow
election procedures that will provide an opportunity for full participation by all members. At the same time, the
Board does not wish to intrude unnecessarily on a state's prerogative, so the final rule makes clear that state chartered
corporate credit unions need only follow the federal bylaws which govern elections. These would be the notice provisions
of Article IV, Section 2, and Article V, both as amended in the final rule. Since these bylaws provide for elections
by mail ballot, with procedures for nominations by petition, Section 704.12(a)(2) of the proposed rule has been deleted
as unnecessary.

In response to comments, the Board has also substantially revised the other elements of proposed Section 704.12(a).
The Board agrees that proposed Section 704.12(a) went beyond preventing trade association control and in fact prevented
individuals who serve on the corporate credit union board from serving in other capacities in the credit union system
and, in addition, prevented other individuals from their credit unions from serving in the system.

Since corporate credit unions should exist to serve the interests of natural person credit unions and their members,
Section 704.12(a)(1) of the final rule retains the requirement that a majority of corporate credit union board members,
including the chair, must be representatives of member credit unions. Section 704.12(a)(2) of the final rule, however,
only prohibits the board chair from serving in a trade association, on the theory that the chair should be an individual
whose loyalty is in no way divided between the corporate credit union and a trade association.

Rather than prohibiting the majority of board members who represent member credit unions from any service in the credit
union system, Section 704.12(a)(3) of the final rule simply prohibits a majority of board members from serving with
a given credit union trade association or its affiliates, excluding chapters. The Board believes that a corporate
credit union's board should not be controlled or overly influenced by individuals who represent a particular trade
association.

League chapters were excluded from the restriction because individuals serving as officers of such chapters generally
are not involved in setting policy or making decisions for the league. Individuals who serve on league committees
are likewise excluded because the regulation only applies to officers, directors, and employees of a trade association.
The proposed prohibition against a majority of board members serving as ``agents'' of a trade association has been
deleted. The provision was unclear in its meaning and unnecessary, given the rule against a majority serving as officers,
directors, or employees of the same or affiliated trade associations.

State leagues that are members of the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) are considered to be affiliated with
CUNA and with each other. Thus, for example, a five-member corporate credit union board could not have two members
who serve on the boards of different state leagues and one member who serves on the board of CUNA. A five-member board
could, however, have two members who serve on the boards of different state leagues, and one member who serves on the
board of another, unaffiliated trade association. Thus, individual leaders in the credit union system would retain
the ability to serve in various capacities, but a corporate credit union could not be dominated by a given trade group.

Section 704.12(a)(4) of the final rule operates to prevent the limitations of paragraphs (2) and (3) from being circumvented
by placing a senior employee of a credit union on a trade association board and a subordinate employee of the same credit
union on a corporate credit union board. For example, again in the case of a corporate credit union with a five-member
board, it would not be permissible to have the following combination of board members: one corporate board member
who also serves on the board of CUNA, one board member who also serves on the board of a state league, and one corporate
board member who is an employee of a credit union whose CEO serves on the board of a state league. This same example would
become permissible, however, if the credit union CEO were on the corporate credit union board and the vice president
were on the league board, or if either or both of the two individuals were board members at their natural person credit
union instead of employees. This distinction is based on the belief that only superior to subordinate employee relationships
result in the kind of domination that would subvert the rule.

Section 704.12(a)(5) of the final rule is a new requirement which provides that in the case of any corporate credit
union whose membership is comprised of more than 25% non credit unions, the majority of directors representing member
credit unions must be elected only by those member credit unions. At least 80% of the membership of all corporate credit
unions but U.S. Central consists of credit unions. Approximately 60% of U.S. Central's membership, however, consists
of individuals or organizations that are not credit unions and that, for the most part, are officials or affiliates
of CUNA, CUNA Mutual, the World Council of Credit Unions, and the leagues. In the absence of some special rule for U.S.
Central, this majority would be able to elect, to the majority of board seats that must be held by representatives of
member credit unions, representatives of their choosing, thus removing control from U.S. Central's member credit
unions.

Other than requiring the use of the bylaw provisions regarding mail ballots and nomination by petition, the Board
will not prescribe specific procedures for achieving the requirements of Section 704.12(a). Each corporate credit
union has the freedom to develop its own election procedures, subject to the requirements of the rule and the bylaws.



Section 704.12(b) Representatives of Organizational Members



Proposed Section 704.12(b) has been carried through to the final rule with the addition of a sentence clarifying that
an organizational member of a corporate credit union is a member that is not a natural person. In response to comments,
proposed Section 704.12(b)(2) has been amended to make it clear that in filling vacancies, the board of a state chartered
corporate credit union is free to use the credit union's own bylaws, as long as the substantive requirements of the
rule are met.



Section 704.12(c) Recusal Provision



Again, most commenters who supported regulation in the area of corporate credit union governance agreed with the
proposal to require recusal for all matters involving the pecuniary interest of an organization in which a corporate
official is interested, rather than just matters where the amount in question exceeds 5% of the corporate's capital.
The final rule makes this change. As noted in the supplementary information section of the proposed rule, a healthy
and independent credit union movement depends, in part, on preventing even the appearance of conflicts of interest.
A strong recusal provision is necessary to achieve this goal. Under the recusal provision, an individual who is interested
in a matter may not deliberate or vote on the matter, or otherwise attempt to influence its outcome.

The final rule has been amended to clarify that the recusal provision does not apply when the matter involves general
policy applicable to all members, rather than a specific action regarding one member. In addition, the word ``agent''
has been deleted as being vague and potentially overly broad.

The proposed definition of ``interested'' has been made final, with the clarification that recusal is only required
when a director, committee member, officer, or employee of a corporate credit union has a relationship with someone
and knows that that person has in interest in an entity whose interest will be affected by an action of the corporate
credit union.



Section 704.12(d) Administration



Section 704.12(d) of the proposed rule required the management official of the corporate credit union to report solely
to the board and prohibited any management official, officer, agent, or employee of the corporate credit union from
being a management official, officer, agent, or employee of a trade association. In response to comments, the final
rule prohibits only the chief executive officer of a corporate credit union from serving as an employee of a trade association.

The provision was narrowed because of the criticism that prohibiting sharing of employees and resources with leagues
or other organizations would put small corporate credit unions out of existence. It was argued that small corporate
credit unions have a place in the future of the credit union system because large, regional or national corporate credit
unions may not devote as much time and resources to providing service to small natural person credit unions. To address
this concern, the final rule does not prohibit sharing of employees below the level of the chief executive officer
of the corporate credit union. The CEO of the corporate credit union, who may not be an employee of a trade association,
must report to the corporate board, which cannot be dominated by persons associated with any given trade association.
With those restrictions in place, a corporate credit union should be allowed, based on its business judgment, to share
employees and other resources with any other organization.

To clarify that the provision applies to the top paid employee of the corporate credit union, not the chair of the board,
the final rule substitutes ``chief executive officer'' for ``management official.''

As discussed earlier, Section 704.12(e), the definition of ``credit union-related organization,'' has been deleted
from the final rule.



D. Applicability to State Chartered Corporate Credit Unions



The final rule applies to all federally insured corporate credit unions. (Non federally insured corporate credit
unions must comply with the rule in order to receive funds from federal credit unions.) The Board acknowledges the
strong sentiment against NCUA applying this rule to state chartered corporate credit unions. The Board's rationale
for applying this rule to such credit unions is provided in the analysis of Executive Order 12612, set forth below.



E. Effective Date



This rule will not take effect until January 1, 1996. Board members in the midst of their terms on that date need not leave
the board, even if that means the corporate credit union does not meet Section 704.12(a) of the rule. Elections held
after the effective date, however, must be conducted so as to bring the corporate credit union into compliance with
the regulation. For example, on a nine-person board where each member serves as a director of Trade Association A,
members serve three-year terms, and three members are elected each year, the three individuals elected in 1996 must
not serve as officers, directors, or employees of Trade Association A or its affiliates. Two of the individuals elected
in 1997 also must not serve in those capacities for the trade association. At that time, the majority of the board will
not be serving as officers, directors, or employees of the same or affiliated trade association, a condition which
must be maintained in subsequent elections. The requirement for an independent chair of the board would have to be
met at the earliest possible date, the 1996 election in this example.

Corporate credit unions must come into compliance with the other provisions of the rule on the effective date.



F. Regulatory Procedures



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The NCUA Board certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on small credit unions (those
under $1 million in assets). The rule applies only to corporate credit unions, all of which have assets well in excess
of $1 million. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The final rule does not impose any paperwork requirements.



Executive Order 12612



Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. It states, ``Federal
action limiting the policy-making discretion of the states should be taken only where constitutional authority
for the action is clear and certain, and the national activity is necessitated by the presence of a problem of national
scope.'' The risk of loss to federally insured credit unions and the NCUSIF caused by actions of corporate credit unions
are concerns of national scope. The final rule will help ensure that proper safeguards are in place to ensure the safety
and soundness of corporate credit unions.

The rule applies to all federally insured corporate credit unions, including those that are state-chartered. State-chartered
corporate credit unions enjoy the same benefits provided by the NCUSIF as do federally chartered corporate credit
unions. The benefits are provided through a federal system, the responsibility for which lies with the NCUA Board.
The Board believes that those who benefit from the system should bear its burdens equally. The rule also affects, indirectly,
non federally insured state-chartered corporate credit unions, which, pursuant to 12 CFR Part 703, must comply with
the rule in order to receive funds from federally chartered credit unions. The final rule does not impose additional
costs or burdens on the states or affect the states' ability to discharge traditional state government functions.

The Board has determined, pursuant to Executive Order 12612, that the final rule may have an occasional direct effect
on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Further, the final amendments may supersede provisions
of state law or regulation concerning federally insured state-chartered corporate credit unions.

(1) An organizational member of a corporate credit union is a member that is not a natural person. An organizational
member may appoint one of its members or officials as a representative to the corporate credit union. The representative
shall be empowered to attend membership meetings, to vote, and to stand for election on behalf of the member. No individual
may serve as the representative of more than one organizational member in the same corporate credit union.

by majority vote, all the powers of the board with respect to the matter under consideration. Where all of the directors
are disqualified, the matter must be decided by the members of the corporate credit union.
(4) In the event of the disqualification of any committee member by operation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
the remaining qualified committee members, if constituting a quorum with the disqualified committee members, may
exercise, by majority vote, all the powers of the committee with respect to the matter under consideration. Where
all of the committee members are disqualified, the matter shall be decided by the board of directors.
(d) 

Administration._

A corporate credit union shall be under the direction and control of its board of directors. While the board may delegate

Note:

 The following appendix will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations



Appendix to the Preamble of the Final Rule



The document entitled ``Corporate Federal Credit Union Bylaws'' is amended by revising Article IV, Section 2, and
Article V, Sections 1 and 2, and adding Article V, Section 4, to read as follows:



Article IV. Meetings of Members



* * * * *


Section 2. At least 75 days before the date of any annual meeting or 10 days before the date of any special meeting of the
members, the recording officer shall cause written notice to be mailed to each member at the address that appears on
the records of this credit union. Such notice shall state the date, time, and location of the meeting and such other
information as the board of directors shall determine consistent with these bylaws. The written notice for the annual
meeting shall advise the members of the deadlines for elections. Any meeting of the members, whether annual or special,
may be held without prior notice, at any time or place, if all members entitled to vote and who are not present at such
meeting shall, in writing, waive notice thereof, before, during, or after such meeting.


* * * * *



Article V. Elections



Section 1. At least 120 days prior to each annual meeting the board of directors shall appoint a nominating committee
of not fewer than three from among the members. It shall be the duty of the nominating committee to nominate at least
one eligible candidate for each vacancy, including any unexpired-term vacancy, for which elections are being held,
and to determine that the candidates nominated are agreeable to the placing of their names in nomination and will accept
office if elected. The nominating committee shall file its nominations with the recording officer at least 90 days
prior to the annual meeting, and the recording officer shall notify in writing all members eligible to vote at least
75 days prior to the annual meeting that nominations for vacancies may also be made by petition signed by 5 percent of
the members with a minimum of 5 members and a maximum of 100 members.

The written notice shall indicate that the election will not be conducted by ballot and there will be no nominations
from the floor when there is only one nominee for each position to be filled. A brief statement of qualifications and
biographical data in such form as shall be approved by the board of directors will be included for each nominee submitted
by the nominating committee with the written notice to all eligible members. Each nominee by petition shall submit
a similar statement of qualifications and biographical data with the petition. The written notice shall state the
closing date for receiving nominations by petition. The period for receiving nominations by petition shall, in all
cases, extend at least 30 days from the date the petition requirement and the list of nominating committee nominees
are mailed to all members. To be effective, such nominations shall be accompanied by a signed certificate from the
nominee or nominees stating that they are agreeable to nomination and will serve if elected to office. Such nominations
shall be filed with the recording officer at least 40 days prior to the annual meeting.

In carrying out their responsibilities, the nominating committee and board of directors must ensure that the requirements
of 12 CFR  704.12(a) are satisfied.

Section 2. All elections shall be determined by plurality vote and shall be by mail ballot except where there is only
one nominee for each position to be filled. Nominations shall not be made from the floor unless sufficient nominations
have not been made by the nominating committee or by petition to provide for one nominee for each position to be filled
or circumstances prevent the candidacy of the one nominee for a position to be filled. Only those positions without
a nominee shall be subject to nominations from the floor. In the event nominations from the floor, when permitted herein,
result in more than one nominee for a position to be filled, and when nominations have been closed, tellers shall be
appointed by the board of directors, ballots shall be distributed, the vote shall be taken and tallied by the tellers,
and the results announced. When only one member is nominated for each position to be filled, the chair may take a voice
vote or declare each nominee elected by general consent or acclamation at the annual meeting.


* * * * *


Section 4. Except as provided in Section 2 of this article, all elections shall be by mail ballot, subject to the following
conditions.
(a) The tellers of election shall be appointed by the board of directors;

Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; 
Treatment of Augmented Veterans Benefits, Anderson, et al. v. Sullivan 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These final regulations set out our policy, under the supplemental security income (SSI) program, regarding the
treatment of veterans benefits that are increased (``augmented'') to provide for dependents. The effect of these
regulations is to clarify our treatment of the ``dependent's portion'' of the veterans benefits.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Section 1612 of the Social Security Act (the Act) specifies certain items that are included as earned and unearned
income under the SSI program. Section 1612(a)(2)(B) provides that unearned income includes, among other things,
payments received as an annuity, pension, retirement, or disability benefit, including veterans compensation
and pensions. 


With regard to veterans benefits, in certain situations the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse's benefits
are augmented on account of the dependents of the veteran. Prior to November 1981, the Social Security Administration
(SSA) counted the entire benefit, including the augmented portion, as income to the veteran or veteran's surviving
spouse for SSI purposes. In 1981, after the policy was successfully challenged in the courts, SSA changed its policy,
effective November 1, 1981, and published a ruling (SSR 82-31) which explained that for SSI purposes the dependent's
portion of an augmented veterans benefit would not be counted as unearned income to the veteran or the veteran's surviving
spouse but as unearned income to the dependent. 



The Anderson Case 


SSA was challenged in 

Anderson, et al. 

v. 

Sullivan, 

No. CV-88-036-GF (D. Mont., Nov. 21, 1989), for not applying the policy published in SSR 82-31
to a nationwide class of recipients of veterans pensions known as ``protected pensions.'' The protected pensions
under Pub. L. 95-588 include pensions which are means-tested and paid under provisions that predate the current
``improved pension'' program. In 

Anderson,

 the plaintiff was a veteran's widow who received a veterans protected pension and SSI disability benefits. Her pension
was augmented due to the presence of a dependent in her household. SSA considered the full amount of the veterans pension,
including the dependent's portion, as income to Mrs. Anderson in determining the amount of her SSI benefits. She filed
suit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) seeking relief from our practice of counting
the dependent's portion of her veterans protected pension as income to her. SSA had counted this as income to her because
of incomplete information received from the computer match between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and SSA
with regard to veterans protected pensions. On November 21, 1989, the court in 

Anderson

 ordered the Secretary to promulgate, within 6 months, interim final regulations that provide that the augmented
portion of a veterans pension is not to be counted as unearned income to the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse.



Provisions of the Regulations Under Anderson 


Interim final regulations implementing the 

Anderson

 order were published on May 18, 1990 (55 FR 20598). Consistent with that order, we revised section 416.1123 of our regulations,
which sets out how we count unearned income. We added a new paragraph (e) to explain that if you receive a veterans benefit
that includes an amount paid to you because of a dependent, we do not count as your unearned income the amount paid to
you because of the dependent. 


The Paxton Case 


The treatment of the dependent's portion of an augmented benefit was also challenged in 

Paxton 

v. 

Secretary of Health and Human Services, 

856 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1988). In 

Paxton,

 the plaintiff was an SSI recipient. Mr. Paxton, the plaintiff's husband, received a pension from the VA. In determining
the amount of Mrs. Paxton's SSI benefit in accordance with SSR 82-31, SSA reduced her SSI benefit by the amount
of the dependent's portion attributable to her from her husband's veterans pension. Mrs. Paxton filed suit against
the Secretary seeking relief from the practice of counting as her unearned income that portion of her husband's veterans
pension that was attributed to her. 
The court in 

Paxton

 held that, as written, the current regulations did not support counting the dependent's portion of the veterans pension
directly as unearned income to the dependent. On the same date that we published the interim final regulations pursuant
to the 

Anderson

 court order, we also published an NPRM at 55 FR 20612 to clarify our policy on the treatment of augmented benefits to
prevent future misinterpretation of the regulations, as occurred in 

Paxton.

 Further, we published Acquiescence Ruling AR 90-1(9) on July 16, 1990 (55 FR 28946) to reflect the decision of
the Ninth Circuit in 

Paxton.

 Under AR 90-1(9), we do not count the dependent's portion of the veterans benefit as unearned income to the dependent
in the Ninth Circuit. Upon the effective date of these regulations, we will rescind 
AR 90-1(9) and supersede SSR 82-31 with a ruling that contains only the policy of the obsoleted SSR 82-31
that is not the subject of these regulations.

Implementing These Regulations in the Ninth Circuit 


Some recipients in the Ninth Circuit may lose SSI benefits as a result of the rescission of AR 90-1(9). To lessen
the effect of the rescission on those recipients, we will apply these regulations to them only prospectively upon
routine redetermination of eligibility. While we realize that, due to variances in the dates of redetermination,
some of these individuals will benefit more from this treatment than others, none of these individuals will lose any
more SSI benefits than if these regulations were applicable to them on publication, rather than on redetermination,
and most will lose less. Moreover, since the publication date will not be used as the effective date of these regulations
for these individuals, our implementation will avoid the negative consequences of overpayment determinations.
This method of implementation was not contained in the NPRM. However, 
AR 90-1(9) was published subsequent to the publication of the NPRM, and accordingly, the NPRM did not contemplate
the effect of the AR's rescission upon some recipients to whom the AR applied. In order to fully apprise the affected
claimants of the impact of these new rules, we decided that the publication of our plan for implementing the regulations
prospectively at redetermination for those to whom AR 90-1(9) had been applied should be part of the final rules.



Public Comment 


Both the interim final rule and the NPRM which were published on May 18, 1990, provided for a 60-day comment period.
We received one comment in response to the NPRM and it was relevant to both the interim final rule and the NPRM. This comment
was from an assistant director for a State agency that serves individuals with mental retardation and developmental
disabilities. The comment generally supported the regulations, but recommended further changes. We have summarized
and responded to the comment below. 


Comment:

 
The commenter believes the proposed regulations may be inequitable to those dependents who neither receive nor materially
benefit from their portion of the augmented veterans benefit. The commenter cited case experience of dependents
living apart from the veteran who did not receive any benefit from their dependent's portion of the augmented veterans
benefit. He proposes that the regulations also provide that the dependent's portion will not be counted as the dependent's
income when it can be documented that such portion has not been made available to the dependent or that the dependent
has not received in-kind income equal in value to the dependent's portion. 


Response:

 
We agree it may not be appropriate to count the dependent's portion of the augmented veterans benefit payment as income
to the dependent in those cases where the dependent lives apart from the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse
and does not receive the benefit of his or her portion. If all or part of the dependent's portion is not available for
the benefit of the dependent, but is counted as the dependent's unearned income for SSI purposes, he or she may experience
hardship and the inability to meet daily needs. Such a result could be viewed as inconsistent with the purpose of the
SSI program which is to provide for the beneficiary's current needs when his or her income and resources are below specified
amounts. 
However, where the dependent lives with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse and the dependent's augmented
portion of the veterans benefit is included in the veteran's or the veteran's surviving spouse's check, we believe
that it is reasonable to assume that the dependent benefits from his or her portion in this living arrangement by the
dependent having and using, for example, heat, electricity, food, and space. Not only is it likely that the dependent
would be advantaged in some way from living with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse, but it would be administratively
onerous to monitor the exact percentage of food, electricity, and heat used by the dependent and the designated beneficiary
of the veterans benefit in order to document to what extent the augmented portion is used on the support and maintenance
of the dependent. In those cases in which the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse provides cash or in-kind support
to a dependent who does not reside with him or her, we will count such support under other SSI income rules appropriate
to the nature of the support. We believe that this interpretation is consistent with the statutory requirements of
the SSI program.

Therefore, we are responding to this comment by revising  416.1123(e)(2) to provide that the dependent's portion
will be counted as the dependent's unearned cash income if the dependent resides with the veteran or the veteran's
surviving spouse, or if the dependent receives his or her own portion in a separate payment from the VA. 
The United States Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have held that it is reasonable
to count the augmented portion of VA benefits as unearned income of the dependent on whose behalf it is paid, in 

White 

v. 

Shalala, 

7 F.3d 296 (2nd Cir. 1993), 

Kennedy 

v. 

Shalala, 

995 F.2d 28 (4th Cir. 1993), 

Inman 

v. 

Shalala, 

Nos. 93-2305 and 93-2941 (7th Cir., July 19, 1994), and 

Ryder 

v. 

Shalala, 

25 F.3d 944 (10th Cir. 1994). 
We are aware that the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida has rejected this reasoning in


Fair 

v. 

Shalala, 

No. 90-1263-CIV-T-22A (M.D. Fla., Aug. 2, 1993). We have sought appellate review in this case,
but will apply the operative court order pending the resolution of the appeal. 
Except for the changes noted above and several nonsubstantive technical revisions, we are adopting the rules as proposed
on May 18, 1990, at 55 FR 20612 and are restating the interim final rule published on that same date at 55 FR 20598. 


Regulatory Procedures 


Executive Order 12866 


We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria
for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


These final regulations impose no reporting/recordkeeping requirements requiring OMB clearance. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


We certify that these final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities because these regulations will affect only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis
as provided in Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, is not required.

Arkansas Regulatory Program

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule; approval of amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Arkansas regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Arkansas
program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Arkansas proposed revisions to
the Arkansas statute pertaining to the small operator's assistance program (SOAP). The amendment is intended to
revise the Arkansas program to be consistent with SMCRA and incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA,
as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background on the Arkansas Program



On November 21, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Arkansas program. General background
information on the Arkansas program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Arkansas program can be found in the November 21, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 77003). Subsequent actions concerning Arkansas' program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 904.12
and 904.15.



II. Submission of Proposed Amendment



By letter dated March 31, 1993, Arkansas submitted a proposed amendment to its program to SMCRA (administrative record
No. AR-496). The proposed amendment relates to financial assistance to small operators. Arkansas submitted
the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intent of making its program consistent with SMCRA, as amended
by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486). Arkansas proposed to amend the Arkansas Surface Coal Mining
and Reclamation Act of 1979 at Arkansas Code Annotated (ACA) 15-58-104(11), by redefining the term ``small
operator,'' and ACA 15-58-503(a)(2), by expanding the permitting activities eligible for funding under
SOAP.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the April 22, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 21552; administrative record No. AR-500) and in the same document opened the public comment period and
provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment
period closed on May 24, 1993. No substantive comments were received. The public hearing, scheduled for May 17, 1993,
was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.

During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to, among other things, SOAP funding for (1)
the cost of the preparation of the results of test borings and core samplings at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(B)
and (2) the development of cross section maps and plans at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(D). In addition,
OSM required that Arkansas include, at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2), the requirement for a coal operator
to reimburse the State for SOAP expenses if the operator's coal production exceeds the allowable limit. OSM notified
Arkansas of these concerns by letter dated June 23, 1993 (administrative record No. AR-507).

By letter dated July 22, 1993, Arkansas responded to OSM's concerns by submitting revisions to its proposed program
amendment (administrative record No. AR-505).

Based upon the revisions to the proposed program amendment submitted by Arkansas, OSM reopened the public comment
period in the August 23, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44477; administrative record No. AR-511). The public comment period closed on September 7, 1993.

During its review of the revised amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to, among other things, the coal operator's
liability for reimbursement of the cost of SOAP services at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2). OSM notified
Arkansas of these concerns by letter dated October 19, 1993 (administrative record No. AR-513).

By letter dated August 26, 1994, Arkansas responded by submitting additional revisions to its proposed amendment
that replaced in their entirety the previously proposed revisions (administrative record No. AR-521).

Based upon the revisions to the proposed program amendment submitted by Arkansas, OSM reopened the public comment
period in the September 29, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 49615; administrative record No. AR-525). The public comment period closed on October 14, 1994.



III. Director's Findings



As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program
amendment submitted by Arkansas on March 31, 1993, and as revised by it on July 22, 1993, and August 26, 1994, is no less
stringent than SMCRA, as amended. Thus, the Director approves the proposed amendment.



1. Typographical Errors in Arkansas' Codification at Proposed ACA 15-58-104(11) and ACA 15-58-503(a)



In its August 26, 1994, proposed amendment, Arkansas submitted proposed revisions at paragraph (12) of ACA 15-58-104
and paragraph (c) of ACA 15-58-503. However, in the published ACA, the language that Arkansas has proposed
to revise occurs at paragraph (11) of ACA 15-58-104 and paragraph (a) of ACA 15-58-503. In addition,
in its proposed amendment as originally submitted on March 31, 1993, and subsequently revised on July 22, 1993, Arkansas
submitted revisions at paragraph (a) of ACA 15-58-503.

OSM concluded that these discrepancies occurred as a result of typographical errors and that Arkansas intended to
propose revisions at ACA 15-58-104(11) and ACA 15-58-503(a) rather than at ACA 15-58-104(12)
and ACA 15-58-503(c) in its August 26, 1994, proposed amendment. For this reason, in findings Nos. 2 through
5 below and elsewhere throughout this document, OSM addresses Arkansas' proposed revisions at ACA 15-58-104(11)
and ACA 15-58-503(a).

OSM recommends that when Arkansas promulgates its proposed amendment as submitted on August 26, 1994, Arkansas correct
these typographical errors and ensure that it promulgates the correct codification for the proposed revisions to
the published ACA.



2. ACA 15-58-104(11), Definition of ``Small Operator''



Arkansas proposed revisions to ACA 15-58-104(11), redefining ``small operator'' to mean




an operator whose probable annual production at all locations will not exceed 300,000 tons of coal per year.




Although there is no counterpart definition in SMCRA, Arkansas' proposed definition is consistent with section
507(c)(1) of SMCRA, which identifies coal operations that qualify for SOAP as those where the probable total annual
production at all locations of a coal surface mining operator will not exceed 300,000 tons. Therefore, the Director
finds that proposed ACA 15-58-1-104(11) is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, and
approves it.



3. ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi), Permitting Activities Eligible for Payment Under SOAP



Arkansas proposed at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi) to expand those activities associated
with the development of a surface coal mining and reclamation permit application that are eligible for funding under
SOAP. As discussed below, Arkansas proposed at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (v) to provide funding
under SOAP for certain permitting activities that are included by reference in the counterpart sections 507(c)(1)
(A) through (E) of SMCRA. And, as discussed below, Arkansas proposed at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(vi) to
provide funding under SOAP for certain permitting activities that are substantively identical to the permitting
activities identified in the counterpart section 507(c)(1)(F) of SMCRA.

a. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A), General requirements for activities eligible for funding under SOAP.

 Arkansas proposed to revise ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A) to (1) add the requirement that the activities specified
in proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A) (i) through (vi) must be performed by a qualified public or private
laboratory or such other public or private qualified entity designated by Arkansas and (2) delete the language that
limits the activities eligible for funding under SOAP to the determination of probable hydrologic consequences
and preparation of the result of test borings and core samplings. The added requirement is substantively identical
to the requirement concerning qualified laboratories or entities in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. The deletion of
the language concerning the activities that may be funded is consistent with Arkansas' proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)
(i) through (vi) and section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act.

Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed revisions of ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A) are no less stringent
than the requirements of section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA, and approves them.

b. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(i), Determination of probable hydrologic consequences.

 Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(i) that provides funding under SOAP
for the costs of the determination of probable hydrologic consequences required by ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A),
including the engineering analyses and designs necessary for the determination.

<TEXT>
 

Proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(i) is identical to section 507(c)(1)(A) of SMCRA, with the exception
that section 507(c)(1)(A) of SMCRA references the requirements for the determination of probable hydrologic consequences
at section 507(b)(11) of SMCRA. Arkansas' existing requirements for the determination of probable hydrologic consequences
at referenced ACA 15-58-503(a)(2) are substantively identical to the requirements at referenced section
507(b)(11) of SMCRA.

Therefore, the Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(i) are substantively
identical to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(A) and 507(b)(11) of SMCRA. The Director
approves the proposed requirements.

c. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii), Development of cross-sections, maps, and plans.

 Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii) that provides funding under SOAP
for the costs of the development of permit application cross-sections, maps, and plans of land to be affected by a surface
coal mining and reclamation permit. Arkansas proposed at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii) to (1) require
that these cross-sections, maps, and plans




shall be prepared by or under the direction of a qualified registered professional engineer or geologist with assistance
from experts in related fields such as land surveying and landscape architecture,




and (2) specify certain information that must be depicted in the cross-sections, maps, and plans.



Section 507(c)(1)(B) of SMCRA provides funding under SOAP for the costs of the development of permit application
cross-sections, maps, and plans of land to be affected by a surface coal mining and reclamation permit. Section 507(c)(1)(B)
of SMCRA references the requirements for the development of cross-sections, maps, and plans at section 507(b)(14)
of SMCRA.

Arkansas proposed requirements at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii) that are, with one exception, substantively
identical to the requirements for cross-sections, maps, and plans in section 507(c)(1)(B) of SMCRA and referenced
section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA. The exception is that Arkansas' proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii) does
not require that the cross-sections, maps, and plans be 

certified

 by a qualified registered professional engineer, or professional geologist as does section 507(b)(14) of SMCRA.
However, in its regulations at section 779.25(l) of the Arkansas Surface Mining and Reclamation Code, Arkansas requires
that all maps required by section 779.25, which includes those same features required to be depicted by the cross-sections,
maps, and plans in proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii), must be




prepared by or under the direction of and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer or professional
geologist, with assistance from experts in related fields such as land surveying and landscape architecture and
shall be updated as required by the Director.




Therefore, the Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(ii), in conjunction
with the requirements of section 779.25(l) in the Arkansas regulations, are substantively identical to and no less
stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(B) and 507(b)(14) of SMCRA. The Director approves the proposed
requirements.

d. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iii), Geologic drilling and statement of results of test borings and core samplings.

 Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iii) that provides funding under
SOAP for the costs of geologic drilling and the statement of results of test borings and core samplings from the permit
area, including logs of drill holes; the thickness of the coal seam found, and analysis of the chemical properties
of such coal; the sulfur content of any coal seam; chemical analysis of potentially acid or toxic-forming sections
of the overburden; and chemical analysis of the stratum lying immediately underneath the coal to be mined. Proposed
ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iii) also provides that its provisions may be waived by the Director of the Arkansas
Department of Pollution Control and Ecology with respect to a specific application by a written determination that
such requirements are unnecessary.

Section 507(c)(1)(C) of SMCRA provides for the funding of geologic drilling and the statement of results of test borings
and core samplings required by section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. Section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA requires that a permit application
include a statement of the result of test borings or core samplings from the permit area, including logs of drill holes;
the thickness of the coal seam found, and analysis of the chemical properties of such coal; the sulfur content of any
coal seam; chemical analysis of potentially acid or toxic-forming sections of the overburden; and chemical analysis
of the stratum lying immediately underneath the coal to be mined. Section 507(b)(15) of SMCRA also states that its
provisions may be waived by the regulatory authority with respect to the specific application by a written determination
that such requirements are unnecessary.

The Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iii) are substantively
identical to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(C) and 507(b)(15) of SMCRA. The Director
approves the proposed requirements.

e. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iv), Collection of archaeological information.

 Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iv) that provides funding under SOAP
for the costs of the collection of archaeological information and any other historical information needed to prepare
accurate maps to an appropriate scale clearly showing all manmade features and significant known archaeological
sites existing on the date of the application and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA provides for funding of the collection of archaeological information required by
section 507(b)(13) of SMCRA and any other archaeological and historical information required by the regulatory
authority, and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby. Section 507(b)(13) of SMCRA requires accurate maps
that include all manmade features and significant known archaeological sites existing on the date of application.

Section 507(b)(13) of SMCRA also requires maps or plans that shall, among other things specified by the regulatory
authority, show all boundaries of the land to be affected, the boundary lines and names of present owners of record
of all surface areas abutting the permit area, and the location of all buildings within 1000 feet of the permit area.
These additional maps and plans are extraneous to the requirements at section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA concerning SOAP
funding for the collection of archaeological information. Therefore, the fact that these other maps or plans are
not included for SOAP funding at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iv) is consistent with the provisions
for SOAP funding under section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA.

Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the provisions of proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(iv)
are no less stringent than the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(D) and 507(b)(13) of SMCRA, and approves them.

f. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(v), Preblast surveys.

 Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(v) that provides funding under SOAP
for the costs of preblast surveys requested by residents or owners of manmade dwellings or structures within 1/2 mile
of any portion of the permitted area. Proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(v) also requires that the applicant
or permittee shall conduct the preblast survey of such structures and submit the survey to the Director of the Arkansas
Department of Pollution Control and Ecology and a copy to the resident or owner making the request.

Section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA provides for the funding of preblast surveys required by section 515(b)(15)(E) of
SMCRA. Section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA requires that, upon the request of a resident or owner of a manmade dwelling
or structure within 1/2 mile of any portion of the permitted area, the applicant or permittee shall conduct a preblasting
survey of such structures and submit the survey to the regulatory authority and a copy to the resident or owner making
the request.

The Director finds that the requirements of proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(v) are substantively identical
to and no less stringent than the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(E) and 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA. The Director
approves the proposed requirements.

g. 

ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(vi), Collection of site-specific resource information and production of protection
and enhancement plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values.

 Arkansas proposed to add a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(vi) that provides funding under SOAP
for the costs of the collection of site-specific resource information and production of protection and enhancement
plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values.

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Arkansas' proposed provision is substantively identical to section 507(c)(1)(F) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director
finds that proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(A)(vi) is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(F) of SMCRA,
and approves it.



4. 

ACA15-58-503(a)(2)(B), The Cost of Training and the Obligation to Ensure That Qualified Coal Operators
Are Aware of SOAP Assistance



Arkansas proposed a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(B) concerning the responsibility to (1) provide
or assume the costs of training coal operators that meet the qualifications under SOAP regarding the preparation
of permit applications and compliance with the regulatory program, and (2) ensure that qualified coal operators
are aware of the available assistance.

Section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA states that the Secretary of the Interior shall provide or assume the cost of training coal
operators that meet the qualification stated in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA concerning the preparation of permit
applications and compliance with the regulatory program, and shall ensure that qualified coal operators are aware
of the assistance available under this subsection. With two exceptions, which are discussed below, proposed ACA
15-58-503(a)(2)(B) is substantively identical to section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA.

The first exception is that, at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(B), Arkansas specifies that it is the Arkansas
Department of Pollution Control and Ecology's responsibility rather than the Secretary of the Interior's responsibility
to provide or assume the cost of training operators and ensure that operators are aware of the available assistance.
OSM is provisionally interpreting section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to specify that it is a requirement for State regulatory
authorities in primacy states to assume these responsibilities. OSM intends to clarify this requirement when it
promulgates implementing rules.

The second exception is that, at proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(B), Arkansas uses the term ``small operator''
in place of the phrase ``coal operators that meet the qualifications stated in [section 507(c)(1)]'' that is used
in section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. As discussed in finding No. 2 above, Arkansas' proposed definition of ``small operator''
is consistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA.

Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(B) is no less stringent than the requirements
of section 507(c)(2) SMCRA, and approves it.

5. ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(C), An Operator's Obligation to Reimburse the Department for the Cost of the Services
Rendered under SOAP



Arkansas proposed a new paragraph at ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(C) that requires a coal operator that has received
assistance under SOAP to reimburse the State for the cost of the services rendered if Arkansas finds that the operator's
actual and attributed annual production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during the 12 months immediately
following the date on which the operator is issued the surface coal mining and reclamation permit. Proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(C)
is substantively identical to section 507(h) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15-58-503(a)(2)(C)
is no less stringent than section 507(h) of SMCRA, and approves it.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Following are summaries of all substantive written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM,
and OSM's responses to them.



1. Public Comments



OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received (administrative record Nos. AR-507,
AR-513, and AR-525.



2. Federal Agency Comments



Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with
an actual or potential interest in the Arkansas program (administrative record Nos. AR-497, AR-506,
and AR-523).

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded on April 19, 1993, that its management responsibilities would not be
impacted by the proposed amendment (administrative record No. AR-498).

The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on April 27 and August 11, 1993, and October 12, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative
record Nos. AR-499, AR-508, AR-528).

The U.S. Soil Conservation Service responded on May 5 and August 10, 1993, and October 24, 1994, that it had no comments
(administrative record Nos. AR-501, AR-509, and AR-530).

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) responded on May 11, 1993, that, because the proposed amendment should provide
for improved fish and wildlife protection plans and increased reclamation efforts on abandoned mined lands, it concurred
with it (administrative record No. AR-502). Additionally, the U.S. FWS responded on October 12, 1994, that
it had no comments (administrative record No. AR-527).

The U.S. National Park Service responded on May 14, 1993, that it had no comments (administrative record No. AR-503).

The U.S. Forest Service responded on May 14, 1993, that it had no comments (administrative record No. AR-504).



3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM is required to solicit comments on the proposed amendment from EPA.

None of the revisions that Arkansas proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. OSM did solicit comments from EPA on the proposed amendment (administrative
record Nos. AR-497, AR-506, and AR-523).



EPA responded on October 25, 1993, that because the amendment demonstrates legal authority, administrative capability,
and technical conformity with controlling National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System regulations necessary
to maintain water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended, it concurred
with the proposed amendment (administrative record No. AR-514).





4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)




Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and ACHP (administrative
record Nos. AR-497, AR-506, and AR-523). The ACHP did not respond to OSM's request.





SHPO responded on August 27, 1993, that, although the revisions did not directly address cultural resources issues
in Arkansas, it wanted to remind OSM of the need to be responsive to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA, administrative record No. AR-510). SHPO further commented that because NHPA
requires Federal agencies to give due consideration to historic properties when those historic properties may be
affected by the undertakings of the agency, surface mining activities that may have the result of affecting historic
properties should be submitted to its office for review and comment prior to their commencement.



As SHPO is award, the NHPA definition of ``undertaking'' at 16 U.S.C. section 470w(7) was expanded by 1992 amendments
to include those projects, activities, or programs funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction
of a Federal agency, including, among other things, ``those subject to State or local regulation administered pursuant
to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency'' (see 16 U.S.C. section 470w(7)(D)). This new statutory language
encompasses State permitting actions carried out under SMCRA. As a result of the 1992 NHPA amendments, OSM has taken
action to clarify that the State permitting activities are Federal undertakings subject to the section 106 review
and consultation requirements of NHPA. OSM, in conjunction with ACHP, the National Council of SHPO's, and others,
has developed a draft programmatic Agreement as the preferred alternative for implementing OSM's responsibilities
under the 1992 NHPA amendments. The draft agreement has undergone public review and the agencies involved in its development
are currently reviewing public comments. Upon completion, the agreement will assist OSM, through coordination
with the States, in fulfilling OSM's responsibilities under section 106 of NHPA.





V. Director's Decision






Based on the above findings, the Director approves Arkansas' proposed amendment as submitted on March 31, 1993, and
as revised on July 22, 1993, and August 26, 1994.





The Director approves the statutes as proposed by Arkansas with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical
form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.




The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 904, codifying decisions concerning the Arkansas program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.





VI. Procedural Determinations

1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the State must be based solely on a determination of
whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements
of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Partial stay of final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action promulgates a temporary stay of certain federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofit of appliances
containing ozone-depleting substances contained in the regulations implementing the National Recycling Program.
EPA has already issued an action staying the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), as they apply to industrial process
refrigeration equipment only, including the applicable compliance dates, for a period of three months, pursuant
to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay
the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration (August 17, 1994, 59 

FR

 42169). 


This action promulgates a partial stay of the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), and applicable compliance dates,
beyond the three months pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), but only to the extent
necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules in question.

IV. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay

I. Background 


On July 13, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) sent to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) a petition for reconsideration of the Refrigerant Recycling Rule, promulgated May 14, 1993, (58 

FR 

28660), particularly the leak repair provisions under 40 CFR 82.156(i) as they concern industrial process refrigeration
equipment.

1

 On that same date, CMA filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking
review of this Refrigerant Recycling Rule (

Chemical Manufacturers Association 

v. 

Browner, et al., 

D.C. Cir. Docket 93-1444.) As part of a settlement agreement signed by EPA and the CMA on May 20, 1994, EPA agreed
to propose changes to the appropriate sections of the rules. A notice of the settlement agreement was published on
June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30584), pursuant to the Clean Air Act section 113(g). Although several comments regarding the
settlement agreement were submitted during the notice and comment period, none of them opposed the settlement or
suggested that EPA not revise the regulation. 




The settlement agreement set a tight deadline for the completion of rulemaking, requiring EPA to propose changes
by December 1, 1994,

2

 and to take final action by June 1, 1995. EPA has issued a temporary stay of  82.156(i) as it relates to industrial
process equipment, and initiated reconsideration of this provision. 




II. Rules To Be Stayed and Reconsidered 


Final regulations published on May 14, 1993 (58 

FR 

28660), establish a recycling program for ozone-depleting refrigerants recovered during the servicing and disposal
of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Together with the prohibition on venting during the service,
repair, and disposal of class I and class II substances (see the listing notice January 22, 1991; 56 

FR 

2420) that took effect on July 1, 1992, these regulations should substantially reduce the emissions of ozone-depleting
refrigerants. The petition filed by the CMA seeks for reconsideration of leak repair provisions under  82.156(i)
as they relate to industrial process refrigeration equipment. In particular, the petitioners raised concerns regarding
the ability to repair or retrofit some industrial process refrigeration equipment within the timeframes established
by the final rule. CMA's concerns involve the need to shut down equipment and/or obtain custom built parts within the
appropriate timeframes. CMA also raised the possibility of delays caused by other regulatory requirements related
to changes at plants.

EPA has evaluated information contained in CMA's petition and is now reconsidering the leak repair provisions. Moreover,
EPA believes that this information warrants review and response pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air
Act. In order to review and evaluate the ability of the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration equipment
to comply with the leak repair provisions when extenuating circumstances exist, EPA will reconsider the regulatory
requirements applicable to repairing leaks in accordance with section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act. 



III. Issuance of a Three-Month Stay 



On August 17, 1994, EPA issued a three-month administrative stay effective September 16, 1994, of provisions of  82.156(i)
as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment, including all applicable compliance dates. These
provisions had been promulgated as final federal rules requiring the reduction of emissions of ozone-depleting
substances during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment (August 17, 1994,
59 

FR 

42169). EPA is reconsidering these rules, as discussed above and, following the notice and comment procedures of
section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action.

3

 





IV. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay 



EPA will not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules stayed
by the Administrator within the three-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). That stay will expire
on December 16, 1994. Therefore, EPA believes it is appropriate to extend temporarily the stay of the effectiveness
of the leak repair requirements for industrial process refrigeration and applicable compliance dates from December
16, 1994, until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. 

Because the settlement agreement between EPA and CMA set a tight deadline for the completion of the rulemaking, EPA
is reconsidering the rules in question as expeditiously as practicable. However, EPA will not be able to complete
the reconsideration process during the three-month administrative stay of these regulations. EPA will not be able
to issue proposed action, seek public comment, and take final action before the temporary stay expires on December
16, 1994. 

As proposed, this action will only remain effective to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration of the rules
in question. The settlement agreement between EPA and CMA expressly requires that final action regarding reconsideration
be signed by June 1, 1994. Therefore, the stay would expire when the final action regarding the reconsideration of
the leak repair requirements become effective. 



V. Comments Received 



EPA received five comments concerning the proposal to extend the administrative stay beyond the three months expressly
provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). All the commenters agreed with the need for such an extension. Two comments discussed
some of the specific reasons why it is not practical for the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration
equipment to comply with the requirements originally promulgated under  82.156(i). The reasons included,
but were not limited to: 




_the need for a process shutdown in order to complete certain repairs; 

_delays stemming from compliance with other applicable federal, state, or local regulations; and 

_the inability to receive the necessary parts and/or appropriate replacement refrigerant within the specified
times. 




In addition, one commenter addressed the need for a stay to ensure that no enforcement action was initiated by EPA or
undertaken in response to citizen suits, during the reconsideration of the leak repair requirements. The commenter
was particularly concerned with the potential for unfair imposition of penalties during the pendency of the reconsideration.
The commenter stated that while compliance personnel may have been advised of the settlement agreement, they are
not legally required to refrain from imposing penalties. Penalties stemming from actions undertaken during reconsideration
could be substantial. 



VI. Response to Comments 



EPA agrees with the five commenters concerning the need for a stay. EPA believes that it is essential to continue staying
the effectiveness of  82.156(i) and the applicable compliance dates, as these provisions relate to industrial
process refrigeration equipment only. Therefore, through this action, EPA is extending the stay of  82.156(i)
and the applicable compliance dates, for industrial process refrigerant only, until EPA completes reconsideration
of these regulations in accordance with the settlement agreement reached between EPA and CMA. This stay will expire
when the final action regarding  82.156(i) and compliance dates, with respect to industrial process refrigeration
equipment are completed and effective. 

Based on internal Agency review, the regulatory language of this stay has been slightly modified for purposes of clarification.




VII. Effective Date 



This action will become effective on December 16, 1994, the date on which the administrative stay expires.

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Grants for Prevention and Control Projects



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is amending the regulations governing grants awarded by the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for prevention and control projects in order to conform the regulations to minor
changes made to the NHLBI authority by the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 and add a reference to the NIH policy on the
inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in clinical research.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 419 of the PHS Act authorizes NHLBI to make prevention and control grants. Section 505 of the NIH Revitalization
Act of 1993, which was enacted on June 10, 1993, amended section 419 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act by making
minor changes to the NHLBI Prevention and Control authority. The NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 also added section
492B to the PHS Act which requires the Director of NIH, in conjunction with the Director of the Office of Research on
Women's Health and the Director of the Office of Research on Minority Health, to establish guidelines on the inclusion
of women and minorities as subjects in clinical research supported by NIH. In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 28, 1994 (59 FR 14508), NIH announced the establishment of those guidelines. Additionally, in a notice published
in the 

Federal Register

 of March 7, 1994 (59 FR 10648), the Assistant Secretary for Health enunciated PHS policy concerning the establishment
and maintenance of a smoke-free workplace and the promotion of the non-use of tobacco products by recipients of PHS
grants. Further, Public Law 103-227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in
which minors will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions
of that law. Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients
to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.



We are amending regulations at 42 CFR part 52e governing grants for prevention and control projects to refer to the
NIH policy on the inclusion of women and minorities as subjects in clinical research, and to make minor changes in the
NHLBI Prevention and Control authority. Specifically, we are amending  52.8 by adding the word ``policies''
to the heading and amending the text of  52e.8 by adding reference to the new NIH guidelines on the inclusion of
women and minorities as subjects in clinical research. We are also revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of  52e.1
to conform them to amended section 419 of the PHS Act.

Notice, public comment, and delayed effective date procedures are being waived for this amendment based on a finding
of good cause. These procedures for ensuring public participation in the rulemaking process and time for compliance
are unnecessary because the substantive changes have already been made by the NIH Revitalization Act and this technical
amendment changes the regulation to conform with the statutory changes. Similarly, the addition of a reference to
a recently issued policy does not impose any new substantive requirements upon applicants.

The following statements are provided for information of the public. 



Regulatory Impact Statement 



Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, requires us to prepare an analysis for
any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria for a significant regulatory action; that is, that may_

Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal,
governments, or communities; 

Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

Materially alter the budgetary impact of grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 

Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in E.O. 12866. 

In addition, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of
1980 (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), if the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.


For the reasons outlined below, we do not believe this rule is economically significant nor do we believe that it will
have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, this rule is not inconsistent with
the actions of any other agency. 

This rule makes minor changes to conform existing regulations to the current statute and to refer to a recently issued
NIH policy. While these grants benefit those segments of the public afflicted by heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood
diseases, and community-based and population-based programs carried out in cooperation with other Federal agencies,
with public health agencies of State or local governments, with nonprofit private entities that are community-based
health agencies, or with other appropriate public or non-profit private entities, these grants do not have a significant
economic or policy impact on a broad cross-section of the public. Furthermore, this rule would only affect those few
institutions interested in obtaining financial assistance to carry out authorized prevention and control projects,
subject to the normal accountability requirements for grant funds. No entity is obligated to apply for grant support.


For these same reasons, we certify this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, and that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Aid to Families With Dependent Children; Extension of Medicaid When Support Collection Results in Termination of
Eligibility


AGENCIES: 

Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS.



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These final rules interpret section 20 of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, as amended by section
303(e) of the Family Support Act of 1988, and section 8003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. The 1984
law extended Medicaid coverage for a period of four months to certain dependent children and adult relatives who become
ineligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) as a result, wholly or partly, of the collection or increased
collection of child or spousal support under title IV-D of the Social Security Act (the Act). The regulations
are applicable to the AFDC and Medicaid programs in all jurisdictions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Statutory Authority


Section 20 of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-378) amended both the AFDC and
Medicaid titles of the Act. Title IV-A (AFDC) was amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to section 406 of the Act.
This new paragraph provides that: ``[e]ach dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is living (including
the spouse of such relative as described in subsection (b)), who becomes ineligible for aid to families with dependent
children as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under
Part D, and who has received such aid in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which such
ineligibility begins, shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children for purposes of
title XIX for an additional four calendar months beginning with the month in which such ineligibility begins.''
Section 20 of Public Law 98-378 also amended section 1902(a)(10(A)(i)(I) to require Medicaid coverage of eligible
individuals pursuant to section 406(h) of the Act. Both amendments apply only to those individuals who became ineligible
for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984, the date of enactment of Public Law 98-378, and before October 1, 1988, and
who received AFDC in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month of ineligibility.
Section 303(e) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-485) amended section 20 of the Child Support
Enforcement Amendments of 1984 to extend for one year, through September 30, 1989, the authority of this provision.
Section 8003 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-239) removed the sunset date for
this section, thus making it a permanent provision of the Act.


Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)


A NPRM was published in the 

Federal Register 

on November 27, 1992 (57 FR 56294), amending 45 CFR Part 233 and 42 CFR Parts 435 and 436 to set forth the circumstances
under which individuals become eligible for the four-month period of extended Medicaid coverage because they have
lost AFDC as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support. The
proposed rules interpreted the statute to require either the new receipt of, or an increase in, the collection of child
or spousal support which renders the family ineligible for AFDC.
As required by statute, the proposed rules provide that individuals must have received AFDC in at least three of the
six months immediately preceding the month in which AFDC ineligibility begins in order to qualify for the extended
Medicaid coverage. As we pointed out in the preamble to the proposed rules, individuals who do not actually receive
an AFDC payment for any month because of the rounding of the payment amount to zero, the recoupment of an overpayment,
or the elimination of payments for those who are eligible for amounts less than $10 are deemed to be AFDC recipients
for that month for purposes of determining eligibility for continued Medicaid coverage under this provision.
Also under the proposed rules, continued Medicaid under this provision ends for any individual family member who
moves to another State. In the preamble to the proposed rules, we stated that Medicaid ends effective with the month
following the month the individual moves to the new State. Although benefits end when an individual moves to another
State, eligibility can be reinstated in the State in which he or she was entitled to the extended coverage if the individual
re-establishes residence there before the end of the four-month period. It was the Department's view that extended
Medicaid benefits are available only in the State in which the family became ineligible for AFDC benefits. For example,
if a family moved to another State in March, the first month of the extended period, and moved back in May, the third month
of the extended period, they would be eligible for extended Medicaid benefits for the months of May and June.

The preamble to the proposed rules recognized that States require collection of support made by absent parents and
spouses to be paid directly to the IV-D agency. Nevertheless, AFDC recipients occasionally receive child or
spousal support directly. Because current regulations require that these payments must be turned over to the IV-D
agency, we consider direct payments which are properly turned over to the IV-D agency to be collections of support
for the purposes of this provision. Thus, extended Medicaid coverage will be provided when collections of child or
spousal support are received by the eligible assistance unit and are turned over to the IV-D agency if these payments
result (wholly or partly) in the loss of AFDC.
The proposed rules indicated that section 406(h) of the Act provides certain individuals with extended Medicaid
if they lose AFDC eligibility ``

as a result 

(wholly or partly) 

of the collection 

or increased collection of child or spousal support * * *'' (emphasis added). They separately specified
the circumstances under which AFDC ineligibility would be considered to be due ``wholly'' to a collection and when
they would be considered to be due ``partly'' to a support collection. They also discussed at length examples of cases
in which the child or spousal support collection ``wholly'' or ``partly'' affected the family's AFDC eligibility
and made a clear distinction between the ``wholly'' or ``partly'' cases.
Our interpretation of Congressional intent as it relates to the term ``wholly'' or ``partly'' limits the Medicaid
extension under this provision to cases where ineligibility can be attributed, at least partly, to the initiation
of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support collection. The proposed and final regulations both reflect
our position that the collection of support must actually cause or actively contribute to ineligibility for AFDC,
even if there are other factors which also contribute to ineligibility or could simultaneously cause it.
The proposed rules provided that extensions of Medicaid eligibility pursuant to expiration of the earnings disregards
as set forth in 45 CFR 233.20(a)(14) or pursuant to section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-485)
are not affected by this provision. Thus, if a family is entitled to extended Medicaid as a result of earned income under
section 303(a) and is also simultaneously entitled to extended Medicaid as a result of the initiation of or a change
in the amount of the child or spousal support collection, the assistance unit would be entitled to the full twelve-month
extension of Medicaid available under the section 303(a) transitional provision if it meets the requirements of
section 1925 of the Act. However, the periods run concurrently so that one extended period cannot be delayed until
the end of the other extended period.


Response to Specific Individual Comments


We received five comments on the proposed rules. Three were from State government agencies, one was from an advocacy
group and one was from a health services organization. A discussion of these comments and our responses follows.


Comment: 

One advocacy group requested that the Department clarify the definition of support collections which would trigger
entitlement to extended Medicaid coverage. It recommended that the change must be in the 

amount of support collected. 

The advocacy group was concerned that the language in the discussion of the proposed regulations referring to an increase
in the ``ongoing support payment'' may be read as referring to an increase in the amount the absent parent has to pay,
rather than an increase in the amount which is collected in a given month.


Response: 

We have eliminated any reference to an increase in an ``ongoing support payment.'' We believe this will eliminate
any confusion between support ordered and support collected. The amount of support ordered is not material when establishing
eligibility for extended benefits. This eligibility is based on the amount of support which is collected.


Comment: 

One State agency recommended a change in the definition of ``collection'' of child or spousal support to cover situations
where collections of child or spousal support contribute to a loss of eligibility but no initiation of or increase
in collections occurred. Another State agency believed that the proposed definition is more restrictive than the
wording of the statute and that there was no legislative history presented to conclude that Congress intended to define
the entitlement as narrowly as proposed.


Response: 

As a condition of extended Medicaid coverage, the final regulations continue to require that ineligibility for AFDC
must result from a change in support collection; that is, either the new receipt of, or an increase in, the amount of
a child or spousal support collection. As we stated in the preamble to the proposed rules, we believe that the Conference
Report, H.R. Rep. No. 925, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984), contemplates a change in the amount of the child or spousal support
collection. In describing the House bill, the Conference Report states that ``[i]f a family loses AFDC eligibility
as the result (wholly or partly) of 

increased 

collection of support payments * * *, the State must continue to provide Medicaid benefits * * *.''


Id. 

at 55 (emphasis added). The Conference Agreement followed the House bill, but with an amendment limiting the application
of the provision to families who become ineligible for AFDC before October 1, 1988.
Similarly, the Report of the Committee on Ways and Means, H.R. Rep. No. 527, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. at pages 11, 23, 52,
and 56 refers repeatedly to either an ``increase in child support payments'' or to ``a change in child support levels.''


Comment: 

Two State agencies believed that the definition of ``collection'' was convoluted, unnecessarily complex, and difficult
to administer. One agency believed the definition would make automation more difficult and expensive.


Response: 

We believe that any difficulty in the proposed definition stemmed from our attempt to interpret the law broadly. The
interpretation requires States to compare the different possible causes for the loss of AFDC, but was designed to
allow continued eligibility under a number of different circumstances.

We could have interpreted section 406(h) to mean that continued eligibility is available only when changes in support
collections alone lead to a loss of AFDC. Extended coverage would not have been available if any other factors contributed
to or caused ineligibility. We instead chose to cover individuals who lose AFDC under any circumstances in which the
change in support either causes or contributes to the loss of AFDC. This interpretation, by its nature, has increased
the complexity of the rule.

We have attempted in the final regulation to express these concepts more simply and concisely. We have done so by removing
the emphasis in the proposed regulation on the distinction between the loss of AFDC which results ``wholly'' instead
of ``partly'' from support collections. Instead, we have placed the emphasis on extended Medicaid whenever a support
collection has either caused or actively contributed to the loss of AFDC. As in the proposed regulation, a family can
qualify for extended Medicaid when the support collection alone causes ineligibility for AFDC or when the support
collection, in conjunction with other changes in income or family circumstances, contributes to ineligibility.
The following examples demonstrate these concepts, as we have revised them. They are keyed to the regulations at   435.115(h)(1),
436.114(h)(1) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A).

An example of how the final rule would apply in   435.115(h)(1)(i), 436.114(h)(1)(i) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A)(1)
is an assistance unit which receives $250 in countable child support collections monthly. The applicable standard
of need is $375. In the next month the countable child support collection increases to $400. In this example, the resulting
ineligibility is due to the collection of child support, and the Medicaid extension would apply.

Another illustration includes a situation which conforms to   435.115(h)(1)(i), 436.114(h)(1)(i)
and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A)(1) of the final regulations. An assistance unit receives $200 in countable child support
collections and $100 in title II benefits monthly. The applicable standard of need is $325. In the next month both the
child support collection and title II increase by $75, for a total increase of $150 a month. Here, the resulting ineligibility
is due to the child support collection because the change in support by itself, when added to the unchanged title II
benefit, would cause ineligibility. Thus, the Medicaid extension would apply.

An example of how the definition of ``collection'' applies in combination with other changes in family circumstances,
as indicated in   435.115(h)(1)(ii), 436.114(h)(1)(ii) and 233.20(a)(15)(iii)(A)(2), would be as
follows. An assistance unit received $275 in countable child support collections and the applicable standard of
assistance was $375. In the next month, the countable child support collection increased to $325 and at the same time
one of the older children left home. As a result, the applicable standard of assistance was reduced to $300. The countable
child support collection of $325 exceeded the new standard of $300 and resulted in the assistance unit's ineligibility.

Under the clarified definition of ``collection'' in the final regulation, the family would be eligible for extended
Medicaid, since the collection of child support increased and contributed to the ineligibility. In this instance,
the reduction in the standard of assistance worked in combination with the increased collection of support to cause
the ineligibility. It thus contributed to the family's ineligibility. Neither change would have caused ineligibility
by itself.

However, suppose that in this example the $275 received by the assistance unit was raised to $325 and the $375 standard
of assistance was reduced to $250. In this case, the increase in child support would have no effect on eligibility for
AFDC. That is because the change in the standard of assistance would have caused ineligibility even before the child
support collection was raised from $275 to $325. Because the change in the support collection neither caused nor contributed
to ineligibility for AFDC, the family would not be eligible for extended Medicaid.

Thus, under the definition included in the final rule, other changes affecting eligibility and occurring in conjunction
with a change in the amount of the support collection would not negate the family's entitlement to extended Medicaid,
as long as the support collection contributes to ineligibility for AFDC.



Comment: 

One State questioned the discussion of payments made by absent parents directly to the AFDC recipient. The State asserted
that 

if these payments are turned in as required

, the money flows through the child support mechanism as would money collected by the State directly from the absent
parent. As such it represents a ``collection'' under title IV-D. If the money is not forwarded to the State agency,
it is budgeted accordingly (as income to the family), and penalties (for non-cooperation) are imposed as appropriate.
The regulations are silent on the issue of monies not forwarded so the State assumes there is no intent to provide the
extension when the support causes ineligibility when budgeted, since to provide such an extension in this case would
be contrary to the statute.



Response:

 There is no intent to provide the extension in such situations. The State is correct that monies not forwarded to the
State agency would not constitute a ``collection'' under title IV-D, as required by the statute. Such monies
would be budgeted as income to the family in a IV-A income State, with sanctions for non-cooperation imposed
as appropriate. In a IV-D recovery State, the IV-D agency must recover all such payments. The IV-D
agency would enter into a repayment agreement with the custodial parent in accordance with 45 CFR 303.80. We have revised
the regulation in several places in order to make it clear that support collections must be child or spousal support
collected under title IV-D.



Comment: 

One State agency commented that, given the erratic nature of child support payments, the proposed policy could result
in disparate treatment for clients with equal amounts of child support. Another State agency expressed concern that
the application of the proposed regulations may provide an incentive for an absent parent not to pay child support
when a child is approaching the age of majority or some other income change is expected to occur.



Response: 

Because of the sporadic nature of the receipt of support payments and other changes in family circumstances, it would
be difficult to determine when such a situation might occur. Nevertheless, it is true that, in some cases, an increase
in support collection would coincide with other circumstances affecting AFDC eligibility. The statute places no
special requirements on the circumstances which resulted in the increased support collection which, in turn, triggered
the four-month period. If a family receives a change in support payments which in some way 

causes

 that family to lose AFDC, regardless of the circumstances, then that family is entitled to four extra months of Medicaid
coverage. The statute places no relevance on the regularity or timing of payments.



Comment: 

Two commenters suggested that extended Medicaid should be continued when a family or individual moves out of the State
and is no longer a resident of the State. One commenter suggested that the State where the individual was originally
eligible for extended Medicaid should be responsible for providing any remaining months of extended Medicaid, particularly
where the individual was enrolled in a managed care organization. The other commenter suggested that the new State
should be automatically responsible for paying for the remaining months of the extended period.



Response: 

In the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking, HCFA took the position that ``[c]ontinued Medicaid under this
provision ends for any individual who moves to another State.'' The preamble further provided, however, that eligibility
could be reinstated if the individual returns to the State and the individual would be entitled to any remaining months
of extended benefits. We believe that it is reasonable to allow States to terminate families who become residents
of other States during the extended Medicaid period.

Nothing in section 406(h) explicitly requires a State to continue extended benefits for an individual who has moved
to another State. In addition, our interpretation of this provision conforms with the longstanding policy that States
are only required to provide Medicaid to their own residents. The Medicaid statute establishes a framework of cooperative
federalism in which each state develops a plan for providing medical assistance for its residents. The statute establishes
a general framework for the State's Medicaid program; however, States have some flexibility to tailor the program
to meet the particular needs of their residents. As a result, each State plan is different.

From the outset of the Medicaid program, State residency has been an important aspect of Medicaid eligibility. Section
1902(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(b)(2), prohibits the Secretary from approving a plan which imposes any residency
requirement which excludes individuals who reside in the State, regardless of whether or not the residence is maintained
permanently or at a fixed address. On the other hand, there has never been any general statutory requirement that a
State cover individuals who are not its residents or continue to cover those who are no longer its residents. Indeed,
section 1902(b)(2) implicitly recognizes that States may limit Medicaid coverage to their own residents.

Moreover, the statute requires the State plan to include provisions for furnishing medical assistance under the
plan ``to individuals who are 

residents

 of the State but are absent therefrom'' (section 1902(a)(16); 42 U.S.C. section 1396a(a)(16)). This provision recognizes
a State's continued responsibility for its Medicaid eligible residents during temporary periods of absence in another
jurisdiction, but only as long as they remain residents. In light of these rules, we have for many years taken the position
that the Secretary is permitted to approve a plan which limits eligibility to all State residents and consequently
denies medical assistance to individuals who do not reside in the State. It is our understanding that most States expressly
require individuals to be residents of the State in order to receive medical assistance under the State plan, although
they could choose to cover non-residents.

The right to continued receipt of Medicaid normally ends when an individual establishes residency in a new State.
If an individual seeks medical assistance in the new State, eligibility is determined based on the State plan of the
new State. If Congress had intended in section 406(h) a major departure from this traditional role of States under
the Medicaid statute, we believe this would have been clear from either the statute or legislative history. Our review
of the statute and the legislative history for section 406(h) does not reflect that Congress intended this result.

We also do not believe that section 406(h) requires an individual's new State of residence to provide continued Medicaid
coverage. This provision simply deems an individual to be an AFDC recipient for Medicaid purposes for an 

additional

 four calendar months; that is, as an add-on to the period of coverage the individual has already received under the
State plan of his or her original State. HCFA does not regard section 406(h) as creating a portable status that entitles
the individual to different Medicaid coverage in a different State.

The fact that an individual is an AFDC recipient in State A does not get that individual Medicaid benefits in State B.
Similarly, the fact that an individual is 

deemed

 to be an AFDC recipient in State A would not necessarily get that individual Medicaid benefits in State B (unless State
B chooses to cover the individual or has an interstate agreement which does so). If the individual is deemed to be an
AFDC recipient for Medicaid purposes for an additional four months, the individual should therefore receive extended
Medicaid only in the State in which he or she lost AFDC status and was granted the four months of extended coverage.

One commenter also raised the question of whether our policy has constitutional implications because the commenter
believes that it violates an individual's right to interstate travel. The commenter points out that other residents
in the new State would be eligible for extended benefits while the newly arrived individuals with exactly the same
circumstances would not be eligible. We believe that the commenter is incorrect in assuming that the individual who
has moved is equally situated with other residents of the new State who are receiving the additional four months of
Medicaid. The individual's former State may well have had a higher AFDC eligibility standard than the new State, which
enabled the individual to get Medicaid in the old State before he or she lost AFDC because of a support payment. In the
new State, the individual may never have been eligible for AFDC even without the increased collection.

We do not believe the residency requirement for extended Medicaid has any significant effect on managed care. Ordinarily,
an HMO will lose an enrollee when he or she has moved to another State, because HMOs have defined service areas and provider
networks. In most cases, when a recipient enrolled in an HMO moves to another State, he or she would no longer be in the
service area of the HMO. As such, the recipient would no longer be qualified to remain in the HMO, regardless of the residency
requirement. In addition, the effect of the residency requirement on recipients of extended Medicaid is no different
from the effect of the residency requirement on any Medicaid eligible HMO recipient who moves from the State.



Regulatory Procedures



Executive Impact Analysis



These regulations have been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12866 to ensure their consistency with the priorities
and principles set forth in that Executive Order. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective
and least burdensome while achieving the regulatory objectives.



Paperwork Reduction Act



There will be no reporting or record keeping requirements imposed on the public or States which would require clearance
by the Office of Management and Budget.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these final rules is
on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect benefits to individuals and payments to States.
Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Public Law 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),
is not required.

Section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital which is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

42 CFR Chapter IV



PART 435_ELIGIBILITY IN THE STATES, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS, AND AMERICAN SAMOA



1. The authority citation for Part 435 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

Section 1102 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302).




2. Section 435.115 is amended by adding new paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) to read as follows:



 435.115

Individuals deemed to be receiving AFDC.



* * * * *



(f) The State must deem an individual to be receiving AFDC if a new collection or increased collection of child or spousal
support under title IV-D of the Social Security Act results in the termination of AFDC eligibility in accordance
with section 406(h) of the Social Security Act. States must continue to provide Medicaid for four consecutive calendar
months, beginning with the first month of AFDC ineligibility, to each dependent child and each relative with whom
such a child is living (including the eligible spouse of such relative as described in section 406(b) of the Social
Security Act) who:

(1) Becomes ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and

(2) Has received AFDC for at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which the individual becomes
ineligible for AFDC; and

(3) Becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the initiation of or an increase in the amount of the child
or spousal support collection under title IV-D.

(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, individuals who are eligible for extended Medicaid
lose this coverage if they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they move back to and reestablish
residence in the State in which they have extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining in the
4-month period in which they are residents of the State.

(2) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to non-residents, the State may continue to provide the
4-month extended benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.

(h) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section:

(1) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility
when it actively causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:

(i) The change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even
if the support collection must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other independent factors,
alone or in combination with each other, might simultaneously cause ineligibility; or

(ii) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility
must result when the change in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other circumstances and
the other changes in income or circumstances cannot alone or in combination result in termination without the change
in support.

(2) In cases of increases in the amounts of both support collections and earned income, eligibility under this section
does not preclude eligibility under 45 CFR 233.20(a)(14) or section 1925 of the Social Security Act (which was added
by section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 1396r-6)). Extended periods resulting from both
an increase in the amount of the support collection and from an increase in earned income must run concurrently.

section does not preclude eligibility under 45 CFR 233.20(a)(14) or section 1925 of the Social Security Act (which
was added by section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 1396r-6)). Extended periods resulting

 233.20

Need and amount of assistance.


(a) * * *
(15) For Medicaid eligibility only, pursuant to section 406(h) of the Act:
(i) Each dependent child and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the eligible spouse of such relative
pursuant to section 237.50(b) of this chapter) who becomes ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly because of the initiation
of or an increase in the amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D will be deemed to be receiving
AFDC, but only for purposes of this paragraph (a)(15), for a period of four consecutive calendar months beginning
with the first month of AFDC ineligibility. To be eligible for extended Medicaid coverage pursuant to this paragraph
(a)(15), each dependent child and relative must meet the following conditions:
(A) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC on or after August 16, 1984; and
(B) The individual must have received AFDC in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which
the individual becomes ineligible for AFDC; and
(C) The individual must have become ineligible for AFDC wholly or partly as a result of the initiation of or an increase
in the amount of a child or spousal support collection under title IV-D.
(ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(15)(ii)(B) of this section, individuals who are eligible for extended
Medicaid lose this coverage if they move to another State during the 4-month period. However, if they move back to and
reestablish residence in the State in which they have extended coverage, they are eligible for any of the months remaining
in the 4-month period in which they are residents of the State.
(B) If a State has chosen in its State plan to provide Medicaid to non-residents, the State may continue to provide the
4-month extended benefits to individuals who have moved to another State.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section:
(A) The new collection or increased collection of child or spousal support results in the termination of AFDC eligibility
when it actively causes or contributes to the termination. This occurs when:
(

1

) the change in support collection in and of itself is sufficient to cause ineligibility. This rule applies even if
the support collection must be added to other, stable income. It also applies even if other independent factors, alone
or in combination with each other, might simultaneously cause ineligibility; or
(

2

) The change in support contributes to ineligibility but does not by itself cause ineligibility. Ineligibility must
result when the change in support is combined with other changes in income or changes in other circumstances and the
other changes in income or circumstances cannot alone or in combination result in termination without the change
in support.
(B) In cases of increases in the amounts of both the support collections and earned income, eligibility under this
section does not preclude eligibility under paragraph (a)(14) of this section or section 1925 of the Social Security
Act (which was added by section 303(a) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 139r-6)). Extended periods
result from both an increase in the amount of the support collection and from an increase in earned income must run concurrently.

Modification of Test of MidRange Procurement Procedures



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, NASA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Federal Procurement Policy approved a test of NASA's MidRange Procurement Procedures in 1993. This
modification of the procedures is a result of OFPP's approval to expand the test to all NASA centers and addresses other
editorial and substantive changes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The MidRange Procurement Procedures were published in 58 FR 54300, October 21, 1993.





Comments on the test procedure had been requested in 57 FR 57845, December 7, 1992. The following substantive changes
are being made to the MidRange Procurement Procedures: (1) Authority to utilize these procedures at all NASA centers
is provided, (2) construction and A&E contracts may now be done under MidRange, (3) the Best Value Selection procedures
have been simplified to limit the value characteristics, and (4) the Electronic Bulletin Board aspects of MidRange
have been clarified since we will be using Internet in lieu of a separate bulletin board. The use of the Electronic Bulletin
Board was approved as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. NASA is in the process of developing the Bulletin
Board and will provide industry notice of its use through the Commerce Business Daily. NASA will continue publishing
synopses in the Commerce Business Daily until that notice is provided.

1871.101

Purpose.


The purpose of this part is to establish policies and procedures that implement the MidRange procurement process.
This will be a pilot test program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).


1871.102

Authority.


The Office of Federal Procurement Policy has provided authority for NASA to conduct a pilot test of a new procurement
process within the scope of this part.


1871.103

Applicability.


(a) This part applies to all acquisitions, as described in 1871.103(b), conducted at NASA installations.
(b) This part applies to all contract actions, the aggregate amount of which is greater than the small purchase limitation
((FAR) 48 CFR Part 13) and not more than $500,000 in basic value. For service contracts (exclusive of R&D and construction
for which options are not permitted), up to four annual options of not more than $500,000 each are permitted where the
option requirements are substantially the same as the basic requirement. For supply contracts, four options of not
more than $500,000 each are permitted when not more than $500,000 in funding is to be required in any fiscal year. The
total amount of the basic award plus options may not exceed $2,500,000 in either the case of supplies or services except
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) When the Government estimate for the basic award amount or any option amount, if any, exceeds the limits of 1871.103(b),
the procurement will be processed under FAR and NFS procurement procedures applicable to large procurements (see
(FAR) 48 CFR Parts 14 and 15). When the estimate is within the range of 1871.103(b) and the procurement was started using
these procedures but the offered prices/costs exceed the MidRange ceiling, the procurement may continue under MidRange
procedures, provided that:
(1) The price/cost can be determined to be fair and reasonable,
(2) The successful offeror accepts incorporation of required FAR and NFS clauses applicable to large procurements,
and
(3) The procurement does not exceed $750,000 for the basic requirement (and each option, if any) or $3,750,000 for
the total requirement.


1871.104

not exceeding $750,000.
(f) The NABB will be used to the maximum extent practicable to disseminate advance procurement information and conduct
part 1871 procurements.
(g) Use of locally generated forms is encouraged where their use will contribute to the efficiency and economy of the
process. NASA Forms 1667, Request for Offer, and 1668, Contract, or computer generated versions of these forms shall
be used as the solicitation and contract cover sheets, respectively. Contractor generated forms or formats for solicitation
response should be allowed whenever possible. There is no requirement for uniform formats (see (FAR) 48 CFR 15.406).


Subpart 1871.2_Planning and Requirements Process


1871.201


Use of buying team.

<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00042 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

MidRange procedures are based on the use of a buying team to conduct the procurement. The concept is to designate individuals
who are competent in their respective functional areas, provide those individuals with the basic authority to conduct
the procurement and hold them accountable for the results. The buying team will normally consist of one technical
member and one procurement member, but may be augmented with additional members as necessary. Personnel providing
normal functional assistance to the team (e.g., legal, financial) will not be considered a part of the team unless
so designated. To function properly, the team should be given the maximum decision authority in matters related to
the procurement. When higher level management approvals remain essential, it will be incumbent upon the functional
team member to obtain such approvals. The team may accept, as final, the decision of the responsible buying team member.



1871.202

Organizational responsibilities.



1871.202-1


Requiring organization.



The requirements organization shall appoint, by name, the technical member of the buying team. This individual will
normally be an end user or the one most familiar with the technical aspects of the requirement. The individual appointed,
whatever the relationship with the procured item, is expected to totally fulfill the responsibilities to the buying
team. If the requiring organization elects not to appoint a technical member to the buying team, standard interfaces
and authorities applicable to large procurements will be used. The procedures in this part will be used to the extent
practical; however, priority will be afforded to procurements fully using buying teams.



1871.202-2


Procurement organization.



The procurement organization shall appoint the procurement member of the buying team. This individual shall be a
warranted contracting officer or a contract specialist with broad latitude to act for the contracting officer. The
procurement member shall be the team leader with the ultimate responsibility to conduct the procurement.



1871.202-3


Supporting organizations.



Buying team members may require additional team members to perform specialized functions or to assist in the evaluation
of offers. Requests for supporting members shall be made by the organization identifying the need for the support
and directed to the appropriate management level in the supporting organization. Supporting team members, once
designated for the team, shall fulfill all applicable responsibilities to the team as other members.



1871.202-4


Center management.



Center managers shall, to the maximum extent practical and consistent with their responsibilities to manage the
Center mission, convey sufficient authority to members of the buying team to conduct the procurement. Administrative
or technical approvals should be minimized, and where deemed essential, facilitated to the maximum extent practicable.
Center managers should lend their full support to the buying team should problems arise from the procurement.



1871.203


Buying team responsibilities.



(a) The buying team shall conduct the procurement in a manner that best satisfies the user requirements and meets the
norms expected of a Government procurement. Team members should develop open communications, rely on decisions
of other responsible functional team members and meet their obligations to the team. The team will typically_

(1) Refine the final specifications for the solicitation;

(2) Decide the most appropriate solicitation method;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Establish milestones for the procurement;

(4) Finalize the evaluation criteria;
(5) Develop the RFO and model contract; and
(6) Evaluate offers and determine the awardee.

(b) The procurement member of the buying team shall lead clarifications, discussions, and negotiations; shall be
the source selection official; and shall conduct debriefings.



1871.204 

Small business set-asides.



(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, each MidRange acquisition of supplies and services
shall be reserved exclusively for small business concerns.
(b) The requirement for small business MidRange set-asides does not relieve the buying office of its responsibility
to procure from required sources of supply, such as Federal Prison Industries, Industries for the Blind and Other
Severely Handicapped, and mandatory multiple award Federal Supply Schedule contracts.
(c) Procurement not conducted as small business set-asides and under less than full and open competition require
a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition pursuant to (FAR) 48 CFR part 6.
(d) If the buying team procurement member determines there is no reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from
two or more responsible small business concerns that will be competitive in terms of market price, quality, and delivery,
the buying team need not proceed with the small business set-aside and may purchase on an unrestricted basis utilizing
MidRange procedures. The buying team procurement member shall document the contract file with the reason for the
unrestricted procurement.
(e) If the buying team proceeds with the small business MidRange set-aside and receives an offer from only one responsible
small business concern at a reasonable price, the contracting officer will normally make an award to that concern.
However, if the buying team does not receive a reasonable offer from a responsible small business concern, the buying
team procurement member may cancel the small business set-aside and complete the procurement on an unrestricted
basis utilizing MidRange procedures. The buying team procurement members shall document in the file the reason for
the unrestricted purchase.

(f) Each model contract under a small business MidRange set-aside shall contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219-6,
Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside.



Subpart 1871.3_Publicizing of Solicitation



1871.301 

Publicizing policy.



Use of the MidRange procedure is intended to streamline and expedite the acquisition process. Presolicitation publication
requirements are streamlined; however, it is in the Government's interest to provide as much advance notice as possible
of a pending acquisition in order for the Government to obtain maximum competition. As soon as practicable after a
requirement has been finalized and before the RFO is ready for release, a presolicitation notice of the procurement
action shall be published on the NABB.



1871.302 

Publicizing procedure.


(a) Synopses are not to be sent or published in the Commerce Business Daily.
(b) A separate pre-solicitation notice for each requirement shall be published on the NABB. The pre-solicitation
notice shall be published prior to the actual release of the solicitation.

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) The presolicitation notice will comply with the requirements set forth in (FAR) 48 CFR 5.207(b).

(1) Include a statement that the solicitation will be released via the NABB, that potential offerors will be responsible
for downloading their own copy of the solicitation, and that hard copies of the solicitation shall be made available
on request, but the closing date will be the same as that required for the NABB released solicitation; and

(2) State the projected solicitation release date, provide notice that it is the offeror's responsibility to monitor
the NABB for solicitation release as the solicitation will be released as soon as permissible whether prior or subsequent
to the projected date, and identify the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact. The presolicitation
notice shall be updated to reflect significant changes to the original notice.



Subpart 1871.4_Request for Offer (RFO)



In MidRange procedures, solicitation of sources shall be accomplished by use of an RFO. The RFO will be solely a solicitation
document incorporating only those elements of information required to solicit the offer. Offers will be provided
on a model contract furnished with the RFO.



1871.401 

Types of RFO'S.



The RFO may be used for all types of procurements to which MidRange is applicable. The distinguishing difference will
be the evaluation and award criteria specified in the RFO. This, in turn, will be driven by the buying team's decisions
on the extent of discussion required, the amount of non-price factors that will influence the award and the amount
of competition available. If the conditions in (FAR) 48 CFR 6.401(a) are met, the RFO's described in 1871.401-1
and 1871.401-2 shall be used; otherwise, RFO's described in 1871.401-3, 1871.401-4, or 1871.401-5
may be used. Once the evaluation and award criteria have been specified in the RFO, the procurement must conform to
the procedures applicable to these criteria, unless changed by formal amendment to the RFO.



1871.401-1 

Sealed Offers.



(a) 

Policy. 

RFO's may specify that award will be made to the low, responsive, responsible offeror providing the most advantageous
offer considering only price and price-related factors. This method shall be used when (1) time permits the solicitation,
submission, and evaluation of sealed offers; (2) award will be made on the basis of price and other price-related factors;
(3) conducting discussions with the offerors is not necessary; and (4) a reasonable expectation of receiving more
that one offer exists. The RFO shall be in compliance with the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR part 14 relating to Sealed
Bidding.

(b) 

Procedures. 

(1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide both a technical and price offer by the closing date specified.

(2) In accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR Part 14, offers (whether received by facsimile or sealed envelope delivery) shall
be publicly opened at the designated time and place. Interested members of the public will be permitted to attend the
opening. Offers shall be abstracted pursuant to (FAR) 48 CFR part 14 and be available for public inspection. For unclassified
acquisitions, a summary abstract, containing offerors, prices and any essential information specific to that procurement
shall be posted on the NABB. The abstract shall be included in the contract file.

(3) All offers shall be examined for mistakes in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 14.406. The buying team shall determine
that a prospective contractor is responsible and that the prices offered are reasonable (see (FAR) 48 CFR 14.407-2).

(4) The Government will award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the
RFO and will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors included
in the solicitation

1871.401-2


Two-Step competitive procurement. 


(a) 

Policy. 

(1) RFO's may specify that evaluation and award may be conducted in two distinct steps, similar in concept to ``Two
Step Sealed Bidding.'' The MidRange Two Step process should be used when it is desirable to award to the lowest, responsive,
responsible offeror after determining that the initial technical offer, or the revised technical offer, is acceptable.

(2) The procedures of (FAR) 48 CFR 14.503-2(a) shall be used once Step two of this process begins. 
(b) 

Procedures. 

(1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide both a technical and a price offer by the closing date specified. Price
offers are requested to ensure that they are accomplished in a timely manner and to reduce the time required for Step
Two. 
(2) 

Step One. 

The technical offer will be evaluated to determine if the product or service offered is acceptable. The buying team
may proceed directly to Step Two if there are sufficient acceptable offers to ensure adequate price competition,
and if further time, effort and delay to make additional offers acceptable and thereby increase competition would
not be in the Government's interest. If this is not the case, the buying team procurement member shall enter into discussions
and request offeror(s) whose offer(s) is susceptible to being made acceptable to submit additional clarifying or
supplementing information to make it acceptable (see (FAR) 48 CFR 14.503-1). It is expected that these discussions
will be conducted on an informal basis. After completion of discussions, the buying team shall proceed to Step Two.

(3) 

Step Two. 

The buying team shall afford all offerors who have submitted acceptable offers and those offers with whom discussions
were conducted, an opportunity, by a common date, to revise their price offers. No changes to technical offers will
be permitted during this process. A reasonable amount of time (normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded
for the revision. The amount of time given shall be the same for each offeror. The procedures at 1871.401-1(b)(2)
and (3) shall then be followed. 
(4) The Government will award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the
RFO and will be most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price-related factors included
in the solicitation. 


1871.401-3 


Competitive negotiated procurement not using qualitative criteria. 


(a) 

Policy. 

(1) RFO's may provide for discussion of all aspects of the offer but award is based on the lowest priced (or most probable
cost) technically acceptable offer. This method should be used when qualitative factors are not material in the award
decision, but it is important to assure that technical offers and contract terms are fully compliant with the Government's
needs. This method also permits direct discussion of price with offerors and is particularly appropriate when different
approaches can be offered to satisfy the Government's need. 
(2) The RFO should reserve the right to award without discussion based on the initial offers submitted. (FAR) 48 CFR
52.215-16, Alternate III will be included in all RFO's for competitive negotiated procurements not using qualitative
criteria. 
(b) 

Procedures. 

(1) The RFO shall request offerors to provide both a technical and a price offer by the closing date specified. 

(2) 

Initial evaluation. 

The offer shall be reviewed to determine if all required information has been provided. No further evaluation shall
be made of any offer that is deemed unacceptable because it does not meet the technical requirements of the RFO and is
not reasonably susceptible to being made so. Offerors may be contacted for clarification purposes only during the
initial evaluation. Offerors determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of their rejection and the reasons
therefor and excluded from further consideration. Documentation for such rejection should consist of one or more
succinct statements of fact that show the offer is not acceptable. No documentation is required if all offers are deemed
to be acceptable or reasonably susceptible to being made so. 
(3) 

Determination of finalists. 

From among the acceptable offers and those susceptible to being made acceptable, the buying team shall rank the offers
based on price (or most probable cost) and exclude any whose price/most probable cost precludes any reasonable chance
of being selected for final award. The remaining offers constitute the ``finalists'' for the contract. Only in exceptional
cases will this number be less than two offers. The procurement buying team member shall succinctly record the basis
for the decision.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) 

Discussions. 

Discussions may be used if it is necessary to request the offeror to submit additional clarifying or supplementing
information to make an offer acceptable. The procurement buying team member shall lead discussions with each finalist.
The discussions are intended to assist the buying team in fully understanding each finalist's offer and to assure
that all finalists are competing equally on the basis intended. Care must be exercised to ensure these discussions
adhere, to the extent applicable, to the guidelines set forth in 1815.613-71(b)(5) for the applicable contract
type. Technical transfusion, technical leveling, and auction techniques are prohibited. It is expected that discussions
will be conducted on an informal basis with each finalist. After completion of discussions, each finalist shall be
afforded an opportunity to revise its offer to support and clarify its offer. A reasonable amount of time (normally
less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. The amount of time given shall be the same for each finalist.
Such discussions are not required if there are sufficient acceptable offers to ensure adequate price competition,
and if further time, effort and delay to make additional proposals acceptable and thereby increase competition,
would not be in the Government's interest.



(5) The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations with all acceptable offerors without a determination
of finalists. This could particularly apply when few offers were received.

(6) 

Selection. 

The procurement team member shall be the source selection official. The source selection official may elect to make
selection in lieu of determining finalists provided that it can be demonstrated that (i) selection of an initial offer(s)
will result in the lowest price/cost to the Government and (ii) discussions with other acceptable offerors are not
anticipated to change the outcome of the initial evaluation relative to evaluated price/cost. It is expected that
the source selection statement will not ordinarily exceed one page and that the basis for the decision will be apparent
upon review of the informal worksheets used in the evaluation process. These informal worksheets shall be included
in the contract file.


(7) The names of offerors determined to be finalists, selected for parallel negotiations, or selected for negotiations
and/or final contract award will be electronically transmitted to the offerors. This will serve as notification
to those offers that were not selected for further evaluation (see 1871.505).





(8) 

Negotiation methods and procedures. 

The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations of complete contracts with those offerors determined
to be finalists or with all acceptable offerors, including offers susceptible to being made acceptable. The buying
team may discuss any aspect of the offer during parallel negotiations. The objective of the negotiations should be
to achieve revisions to the offer, consistent with the RFO, that are more favorable to the Government. Technical transfusion,
technical levelling, and auction techniques are prohibited. Upon conclusion of negotiations with each offeror,
the offeror shall be asked to submit a revised offer (in full or amended) reflecting the results of negotiations, and
including the offeror's signature on the negotiated contract. A reasonable amount of time (normally less than 5 working
days) will be afforded for the revision. Award will be made to the lowest priced (or most probable cost), technically
acceptable offer.

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Policy.

 (1) MidRange procurements shall normally use the BVS source selection method, prescribed in 48 CFR part 1871, subpart
1871.6 when it is desirable to base evaluation and award on a combination of price and non-price qualitative criteria.

(2) The RFO should reserve the right to award without discussion based on the initial offers submitted. (FAR) 48 CFR
52.215-16, Alternate III will be included in all RFO's for competitive negotiated procurements using qualitative
criteria.

(3) In exceptionally complex procurements where it is desirable to use a highly structured approach and multiple
evaluators, a source selection method following the principles specified in NASA Source Evaluation Board Handbook,
48 CFR 1870.303, Appendix I, may be more appropriate than BVS. This may be appropriate in cases in which the following
factors cannot be accommodated within the MidRange/BVS selection methodology:

(i) The ability to predefine the value characteristics that will constitute the discriminators among the offers;


(ii) The complexity of the interrelationships that must be evaluated; 

(iii) The number of evaluators required to address the disciplines that will be involved in the offers; or

(iv) The impact that the procurement may have on higher level mission management (level of selection official) or
future procurements.

(4) A source selection process combining the mid-range and the NASA Source Evaluation Board Handbook (48 CFR 1870.303,
Appendix I) approaches shall not be used.

(b) 

Procedures.

 (1) The buying team will determine which of the source selection methodologies is most appropriate to the specific
procurement.

(2) The team shall record its rationale for selecting the SEB methodology rather than BVS. Once this decision is made,
the team shall no longer function as a MidRange buying team, but shall follow the instructions prescribed in the local
procedures for the source selection method.



1871.401-5 

Noncompetitive negotiations.



(a) 

Policy.

 (1) The RFO may be used as the solicitation method for noncompetitive procurements.

(2) MidRange procedures may be used in noncompetitive acquisitions to the extent they are applicable.

(b) 

Procedures.

 (1) Posting a presolicitation notice on the NABB meets the requirement of (FAR) 48 CFR 5.201 and complies with the notice
required by the Competition in Contracting Act. A presolicitation notice is not required if one of the exceptions
of (FAR) 48 CFR 5.202 is met.

(2) The buying team shall require submission of certified cost and pricing data in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 15.804-2.

(3) The technical member of the buying team shall provide technical assistance to the procurement member during evaluation
and negotiation of the contractor's offer.



1871.402 

Preparation of the RFO.



(a) The RFO shall provide all standard information required for the offeror to submit an offer.

(b) The RFO shall contain space for all necessary additional instructions to offerors. As a minimum, the RFO shall
contain the following:

(1) Incorporation by reference of all required standard provisions.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) A provision notifying offerors that standard Representations and Certifications will be required from the successful
offeror, or from all offerors selected for parallel negotiations, prior to award of the contract.

(3) Evaluation and award criteria.

(4) A provision requiring offerors to submit offers on an attached model contract.

(c) Requirements for the content and format of the offer should be the minimum required to provide for proper evaluation.
Offerors' formats should be allowed to the maximum extent possible.

(d) Facsimile offers, defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation 48 CFR 14.202-7 and 15.402(i), shall normally
be authorized for MidRange procurements. In special circumstances, the buying team may elect to require only original
offers.



1871.403

Offer preparation period and limitations.



The buying team should establish deadlines for receipt of offers based on an assessment of the minimum amount of time
required to respond to the solicitation. The time required will depend on the complexity of the requirement and amount
of cost and technical information required to be submitted. The information required shall be limited to the amount
required to conduct a proper evaluation. The offer preparation period established in the RFO shall not be less than
15 calendar days unless the procurement is urgent and the reasons for urgency are documented in the contract file.



1871.404

Protection of offers.



A facsimile machine(s) shall be dedicated for receipt of offers and placed in a secure location where offers received
on it can be safeguarded. All offers submitted shall be recorded, sealed in an envelope marked with the RFO number and
taken to the buying team procurement member. Facsimile attendants shall make a good faith effort to inspect the document
for completeness and legibility. If the attendant believes there are missing or illegible pages, the document will
be promptly referred to the buying team procurement member for notification to the offeror that it should resubmit
the offer. The Government shall not assume responsibility for proper transmission.



1871.405

Model contract.



MidRange procedures use a simplified contract format. The simplified contract format may be used with any type of
contract, as long as the clauses and provisions appropriate to the contract type are included.



1871.406

RFO by electronic bulletin board.



1871.406-1

Methods of disseminating information.



(a) In accordance with 1871.302, presolicitation notices of solicitations for MidRange procurements shall be posted
on the NABB. The presolicitation notice shall include the information required by 1871.302(c).

(b) Solicitations for MidRange Procurements shall be made available on the NABB. Paper copies shall be mailed within
5 working days from the date the RFO is posted on the NABB or receipt of the request, whichever is later.

(c) Solicitations available on the NABB are exempt from the requirement in (FAR) 48 CFR 14.203-1 that delivery
of the solicitations be made pursuant to (FAR) 48 CFR 14.205.

(d) For the purposes of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.402(a), a solicitation posted on the NABB is a written solicitation.

(e) Solicitations posted on the NABB in accordance with these regulations are exempt from the requirement in (FAR)
48 CFR 15.408(a) to issue solicitations using the procedures in (FAR) 48 CFR Part 5.

1871.406-2

Special situations.


Notices for special situations as described in (FAR) 48 CFR 5.205 involving MidRange Procurements must be published
in the Commerce Business Daily. Such special situations include R&D sources sought, intent to sponsor or change
the mission of an Federally Funded Research and Development Center, effort to locate commercial sources under OMB
Circular No. A-76, and Section 8(a) competitive national buy acquisitions.


1871.406-3

Publicizing and response time.


In accordance with 18.403, contracting activities shall allow at least 15 calendar days response time for receipt
of offers from the date of posting of the solicitation on the NABB. Contracting activities shall check the NABB immediately
after uploading a solicitation to assure that the solicitation is properly posted.


1871.406-4

Method of soliciting offers.


(a) Solicitations and solicitation amendments for MidRange procurements shall be generated in, or converted to,
electronic files and uploaded to the NABB. Each contracting activity will designate two or more individuals to perform
the upload and check the uploaded files to assure that the data was not corrupted during transmission.
(b) Amendments to a solicitation posted on the NABB shall be uploaded to the NABB, and the solicitation and amendment
number shall be added to the index of amended solicitations.


Subpart 1871.5_Award


1871.501

Representations and certifications.


Upon determination of the successful offeror, or all offerors selected for parallel negotiations, the buying team
procurement member will determine if the offeror has on file valid Representations and Certifications. If the offeror
has not completed the required forms, or they have expired, the offeror will be requested to provide the forms promptly.
Should the offeror fail to provide the required Representations and Certifications or fail to meet a required condition,
the buying team may reject the offer and proceed to the next highest ranked offeror who is responsive and responsible.


1871.502

Determination of responsible contractor.


Contractor responsibility shall be determined in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR Part 9.


1871.503

Negotiation documentation.


The prenegotiation memorandum, if required, and the results of negotiation will be in abbreviated form and will be
approved by the buying team.


1871.504

Award documents.


Contract award shall be accomplished by Contracting Officer execution of the contract document and providing a paper
copy to the successful offeror. If facsimile documents were used in the evaluation process, the successful offeror
may be required to execute original copies of the contract to facilitate legibility during the administration phase
of the contract.


1871.505

Notifications to unsuccessful offerors.


For solicitations that were posted on the NABB, a preaward notice shall be electronically transmitted to the offerors.
This notice meets the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.1001. However, the preaward notice in a small business set-aside
must allow unsuccessful offerors 5 working days to challenge the small business status of the successful offeror.
The procedures of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.1001(c)(2) shall be followed for procurements subject to the Trade Agreements Act.

Publication of award.



An award notice shall be posted on the NABB for seven (7) calendar days after posting, if the contract offers subcontracting
opportunities or if it is subject to the Trade Agreement Act. The information required by (FAR) 48 CFR 5.207 shall be
included in the award notice in abbreviated form.



1871.507

Debriefing of unsuccessful offerors.



If the procurement method used provides for a debriefing of unsuccessful offerors, the procedures applicable to
that selection process shall be used in the debriefing. The procurement buying team member shall conduct debriefings.



Subpart 1871.6_``Best Value Selection''



1871.601

General.



(a) Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit
of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government.

(b) BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of MidRange procurements and predefines the value characteristics
which will serve as the discriminators among offers. It eliminates the use of area evaluation factors and the highly
structured scoring.



1871.602

Specifications for MidRange procurements.



BVS refines the traditional approach to preparing specifications. BVS envisions that the specification will focus
on the end result that is to be achieved and will serve as a statement of the Government's baseline requirements. The
offeror will be guided in meeting the Government's needs by a separate set of value characteristics which establish
what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer. These value characteristics will be performance based and
will permit the selection of the offer which provides better results for a reasonable marginal increase in price.



1871.603

Establishment of evaluation criteria.



(a) The requiring organization will provide, along with the specification, a list of value characteristics against
which the offers will be judged. There is no limit to the number or the type of characteristics that may be specified.
The only standard will be whether the characteristic is rationally related to the need specified in the specification.
Characteristics may include such factors as improved reliability, innovativeness of ideas, speed of service, demonstrated
delivery performance, higher speeds, ease of use, qualifications of personnel, solutions to operating problems,
level of service provided on previous similar contracts, or any of numerous other characteristics that may be of value
to the Government in satisfying its needs.

(b) Cost and technical will be considered equal in importance. The value characteristics will not be assigned weights.

(c) All subsequent evaluations will consider these characteristics when determining the finalists or making the
final selection for award. Additional characteristics, not listed in the RFO, shall not be used as a basis for discriminating
among proposals.



1871.604

Evaluation phases.



1871.604-1

Initial evaluation.



(a) Offers will be reviewed to determine if all required information has been provided and the offeror has made a reasonable
attempt to present an acceptable offer. Offerors may be contacted only for clarification purposes during the initial
evaluation. No further evaluation shall be made of any offer that is deemed unacceptable because:

(1) It does not represent a reasonable effort to address itself to the essential requirements of the RFO or clearly
demonstrates that the offeror does not understand the requirements of the RFO;

(2) It contains major technical or business deficiencies or omissions or out-of-line costs which discussions with
the offeror could not reasonably be expected to cure; or

(3) In R&D procurement, a substantial design drawback is evident in the offer and sufficient correction or improvement
to consider the offer acceptable would require virtually an entirely new offer.

(b) Offerors determined not to be acceptable shall be notified of their rejection and the reasons therefor and excluded
from further consideration.

(c) 

Documentation. 

If it is concluded that all offers are acceptable, then no documentation is required and evaluation proceeds. If one
or more offers are not acceptable, the procurement member of the team will notify the offeror of the rejection and the
reasons therefor. The documentation should consist of one or more succinct statements of fact that show the offer
is not acceptable.

1871.604-2 

Determination of ``Finalists''.



(a) All acceptable offers will be evaluated against the specifications and the value characteristics. Based on this
evaluation, the team will identify the finalists from among the offers submitted. Finalists will include all offers
having a reasonable chance of being selected for final award, as prescribed in 1815.613-71(b)(4)(i) for competitive
range. Generally, finalists will include the offer having the best price (or lowest most probable cost) and the offer
having the highest qualitative merit, plus those determined to have the best combination of price and merit. Offers
not qualifying as finalists will be excluded from the balance of the evaluation process. 

(b) Whenever possible, the buying team will conduct parallel negotiations of complete contracts with all finalists
as discussed in 1871.605. This approach, which provide for the negotiation of definitive contracts prior to selection,
serves to maintain the competitive environment among offerors throughout the acquisition cycle. 

(c) In some cases, the buying team may choose to conduct discussions with the finalists as opposed to conducting parallel
negotiations of complete contracts. This may be appropriate when: (1) Certain aspects of offers are unclear and clarifying
the offers could determine that a finalist actually has no reasonable chance of being selected for final award; or
(2) the finalists are so numerous that negotiating complete contracts with all finalists is not practical considering
the time and resources available. Discussions shall be conducted in accordance with 1871.604-3. 

(d) The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations with all acceptable offerors without a determination
of finalists. This could particularly apply where few offers were received. 

(e) The selection official may elect to make selection in lieu of determining finalists, provided it can be clearly
demonstrated that (1) selection of an initial offer(s) will result in the best value for the Government, considering
both price and non-price qualitative criteria; and (2) discussions with other acceptable offerors are not anticipated
to change the outcome of the initial evaluation relative to the best value offer(s). 

(f) 

Documentation. 

If finalists are identified as discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, the documentation expected and required
to result from this phase of evaluation is approximately one-quarter of a page for each finalist. The documentation
shall succinctly describe how the value characteristics in the RFO were provided by the offeror and cost/price considerations
that caused the offer to qualify as a finalist. The evaluator(s) shall not be required to justify why other offers provided
less qualitative merit. It is expected that, should the decision be challenged, the documented reason for selection,
when compared with the non-selected offer, shall clearly demonstrate the difference that resulted in non-selection.
It is expected and recommended that all informal worksheets used in the evaluation process be included in the contract
file for use in any debriefings requested. When selection of the successful offeror(s) is made, the buying team shall
document the selection in accordance with 1871.604-4(c). 

(g) The names of offerors determined to be finalists, selected for parallel negotiations, or selected for negotiations
or final contract award will be electronically transmitted to the offerors. This will serve as notification to those
offerors that were not selected for further evaluation (see 1871.505). 



1871.604-3 

Discussions with ``Finalists''. 



(a) The procurement team member shall lead discussions with each finalist. The discussions are intended to assist
the buying team in fully understanding each finalist's offer and to assure that the meanings and points of emphasis
of the RFO have been adequately conveyed to the finalists so that all are competing equally on the basis intended. Care
must be exercised to ensure these discussions adhere, to the extent applicable, to the guidelines set forth in 1815.613-71(b)(5)
for the applicable contract type. Technical transfusion, technical leveling, and auction techniques are prohibited.
It is expected that these discussions will be conducted on an informal basis with each finalist.

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) After completion of discussions, each finalist shall be afforded an opportunity to revise its offer to support
and clarify its offer. A reasonable amount of time (normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision.
The amount of time given shall be the same for each finalist.



1871.604-4 

Selection of ``Best Value'' Offer.



(a) The procurement team member shall be the source selection official.

(b) The BVS source selection is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit,
award will be made to the offer with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts) or the Government-determined
most probable cost (cost type contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher
qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider
making award to an offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and
other offers warrant doing so.


(c) 

Documentation.

 Rationale for selection of the successful offeror shall be recorded in a selection statement which succinctly records
the value characteristics upon which selection was made. The statement need not and should not reveal details of the
successful offer that are proprietary or business sensitive. Since the value characteristics are expressed in performance
terms, the reasons for selection can focus on results to be achieved, rather than the detailed approach the offeror
will use. The statement shall also comment on the rationale used to equate cost and qualitative merit. Little or no
comment would be required when the selected offeror possessed the highest merit and lowest price. When a marginal
analysis is made between value characteristics and price (or cost)_in most cases this will be a subjective, integrated
assessment of all pertinent factors_specific rationale should be provided to the extent possible. It is expected
that the statement will not ordinarily exceed one page. Where the procurement is closely contested, it would be prudent
to expand on the rationale provided in the statement.

(d) The name of the offeror(s) selected for award and the selection statement shall be electronically transmitted
to the offerors which will serve as a notification to those offerors that were not selected (see 1871.505).



1871.605 

Negotiation methods and procedures.



(a) 

Policy.

 (1) The buying team may choose to conduct parallel negotiations of complete contracts with those offerors determined
to be finalists or with all acceptable offerors. Parallel negotiation may also be used where more than one offeror
is selected for negotiations after discussions. Use of parallel negotiations takes advantage of the competitive
atmosphere and the responsiveness of offerors in completing negotiations. It also provides the selection official
a higher confidence in the offer, since only the contracting officer's signature is required to make the offer a binding
contract.

(2) When the selection official has chosen to make selection in lieu of conducting parallel negotiations, negotiations
may be conducted with the successful offeror(s) to resolve any open issues necessary to effect a binding contract(s).
This may be typical of R&D and service contracts where the Government desires to negotiate changes in emphasis
or orientation in an otherwise superior offer(s).

(b) 

Procedure.

 (1) Upon conclusion of parallel negotiations with each offeror, the offeror shall be asked to submit a revised offer
(in full or amended) reflecting the results of the negotiations, and including the offeror's signature on the negotiated
contract. A reasonable amount of time (normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. The amount
of time given shall be the same for each offeror. Upon receipt of all offers, the procurement member of the buying team
shall make selection and document as required in 1871.604-4(c). Upon selection, the contracting officer shall
execute the selected contract.



(2) If negotiation is conducted after selection, the buying team shall first select the offer and document as required
in 1871.604-4(c), then negotiate the terms of the contract. The offeror shall be asked to submit a revised offer
reflecting the results of negotiation, and including the offeror's signature on the negotiated contract. A reasonable
amount of time (normally less than 5 working days) will be afforded for the revision. After receipt of the revised offer,
the contracting officer shall execute the contract.



1871.606 

Debriefings.



In addition to electronically transmitting the selection statement to the offerors, a debriefing, a debriefing
will be provided by the buying team procurement member to any offeror submitting a written request. The debriefing
will concentrate on the reasons why the successful offeror was selected. If the contract is unclassified, the debriefer
may reveal any aspect of the contract and how it relates to the merits used to select the successful offer. If the successful
offer had value characteristics which are proprietary or business sensitive, and had an impact on the selection,
the debriefer should so state and summarize the results which are expected to accrue to the Government. The debriefer
shall not divulge the details of the proprietary or business sensitive information.

Qualification of Drivers; Vision Deficiencies; Waivers 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Determination and change in research plan.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA announces its Final Determination which validates waivers issued to certain drivers of commercial motor
vehicles (CMV) from the date of this notice until March 31, 1996. This action is directed solely at those drivers who
had been granted temporary waivers to participate in the previously authorized vision waiver study, who numbered
2,399 as of November 5, 1994. This action follows, and is consistent with, the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in the case captioned 

Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety

 v. 

Federal Highway Administration,

 28 F.3d 1288, D.C. Cir. 1994, which vacated the rule authorizing the temporary waivers and remanded the matter to the
agency for further action not inconsistent with the Court's ruling. This notice also announces a basic change in the
purpose for which data on the waived drivers are being collected and the intention of the FHWA to develop criteria for
the imposition of additional conditions for maintaining the waivers and to improve monitoring of the performance
of the waived drivers to identify and exclude those drivers who do not meet these conditions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, (MCSA) Pub. L. No. 98-554, 98 Stat. 2832 (codified at 49
U.S.C. 31136(e), formerly 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(f)), allows the Secretary of Transportation to grant waivers from
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations only after a determination that such waivers are not contrary to the
public interest and are consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. Historically, except for a limb-handicap waiver
program established in 1979 (49 CFR 391.49), the agency granted no individual waivers to drivers who did not meet the
physical qualification requirements set forth at 49 CFR 391.41. 


Vision Waiver Study 


The FHWA announced its vision waiver study in a Notice of Intent to accept applications for waivers on March 25, 1992,
(57 FR 10295). This vision waiver study was initiated as part of an overall regulatory review of the medical qualification
standards applicable to interstate CMV drivers. For a complete description of the waiver program, see the FHWA's
October 6, 1994, Notice of Determination; request for comments, at 59 FR 50887. 


Court Decision 


The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (hereinafter Advocates or AHAS) filed suit in the United States Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, requesting a review of the FHWA's notice of final disposition granting waivers to individuals
who otherwise did not meet the Federal vision standard required for the qualification of CMV drivers in interstate
commerce. The Court found that the FHWA's notices of the program did provide for meaningful opportunity for comment
and that the comments received were given due consideration. The Court also held that the FHWA's approach, given the
conflicting policy demands, was reasonable, and therefore not arbitrary and capricious. The Court observed, however,
that the FHWA ``initiated a program to issue temporary waivers to visually impaired drivers in order to procure the
hard evidence needed to determine the effect of visual deficiencies on safety. Yet, before it may grant a waiver, the
Safety Act required the agency to determine that such waiver * * * is consistent with the safe operation
of commercial motor vehicles.'' 28 F.3d at 1294. The Court found that the agency's ``determination that the waiver
program will not adversely affect the safe operation of CMVs is devoid of empirical support in the record,'' 28 F.3d
at 1294, and that ``the FHWA has failed to meet the exacting requirements of section 2505(f) [now 49 U.S.C. 31136(e)].''
28 F.3d at 1294. Consequently, the Court concluded that the FHWA's adoption of the waiver program was contrary to law,
and vacated and remanded the rule to the agency. 


Proceedings after the Court Decision 


On October 6, 1994, the FHWA published a Notice of Determination, request for comments in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 50887), extending the validity of the vision waivers for a thirty-day period. The Notice also provided for a
15-day comment period to consider whether the agency had sufficient empirical evidence to allow the waiver program
to continue until March 31, 1996. On the same day, the Advocates filed an emergency motion requesting that the Court
issue and enforce a mandate in this case that would, in effect, halt the waiver program. The Court issued a mandate on
October 21, 1994. That mandate simply restated that the rule authorizing the vision waivers is vacated and remanded
the case to the agency. On October 24, 1994, the Court denied the Advocates' emergency motion. 


Comments 


The FHWA received 19 comments to the docket in response to the October 6 Notice of Determination. Fourteen commenters
favored continuing the vision waiver program, while five commenters asserted that the program should be discontinued.
Commenters in favor of continuing the program include the National Private Truck Council, the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers, the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, the Tennessee Public Service
Commission, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), John Murphy (a driver participating
in the waiver program), Thomas Breth and James Strickland (drivers not participating in the waiver program), Altim,
Inc., Mixson Oil Company, the State of Indiana Department of Motor Vehicles, Daily Express, Inc., and the American
Optometric Association. 
Commenters urging the agency to discontinue the vision waivers are the Advocates (two separate comments), the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the American Movers Conference, the American Trucking Association (ATA),
and Dr. Arthur M. Keeney, Dean Emeritus, University of Louisville. Their comments addressed the study design, the
lack of a control group, the use of interim data, and other factors which, they contend, require the study's termination,
or at a minimum, a restructuring of the method for conducting research. 
These comments are more fully discussed below.

Discussion of the Comments 


A. In favor:
The State of Indiana Department of Motor Vehicles emphasizes the importance of the vision waiver as a tool to accurately
assess the vision standards for commercial drivers, specifically addressing the condition known as amblyopia,
or ``lazy eye.'' The State acknowledges that persons with less than perfect vision often develop scanning techniques
to compensate for their disability, and that such techniques may actually increase their awareness of traffic and
other conditions. The Tennessee Public Service Commission commented that it has grandfathered vision impaired
CMV drivers and found no increase in incidents or accidents as a result. 
OOIDA, a national trade association representing the interests of a large number of independent owner-operators
at both the Federal and State level, urged the FHWA to revalidate the waivers of the affected drivers because delay
and uncertainty cause them significant harm. OOIDA believes that the FHWA's proposal ``strikes a careful balance
between safety * * * and the federal policies underlying the Americans with Disabilities Act and the
Rehabilitation Act.'' 
The American Optometric Association (AOA) supports the FHWA effort to study the performance of visually impaired
drivers. The AOA believes ``it is virtually impossible to unequivocally delineate a visual standard,'' and therefore,
contends that a waiver system is needed. 
Daily Express, Inc., Mixson Oil Company, Inc. and Altim, Inc. offer the performance of their employees with waivers
as examples of the ability of drivers to compensate for their disability and remain safe operators of CMVs. These companies
express concern over replacing waived drivers with known safety records with other drivers whose safety record is
not of the same high caliber.
 
The National Private Truck Council (NPTC) also expressed support for the continuation of the vision waivers. The
NPTC stresses the need for the type of data being collected from the waived drivers, as no such information currently
exists. The NPTC believes that the FHWA's qualifying conditions for drivers, as well as the post-waiver conditions,
ensure that those drivers holding waivers are safe operators of CMVs. The Association for the Advancement of Automotive
Medicine also expresses the need for the data being gathered, although it has some reservations regarding the agency's
study methodology. 
Individual drivers Thomas Breth, James Strickland and John M. Murphy also commented favorably to the October 6 notice.
The latter commented on his own behalf and on behalf of a freightline company he owns and operates with his brothers.
Mr. Breth, who petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit because he was excluded from the vision waiver
study because he did not timely file, submitted extensive records relating to that litigation. Although he supports
the waivers, he opposes limiting them to those drivers originally granted the waivers under the determination that
was invalidated by the D.C. Circuit in 

AHAS, supra. 
The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers supports the 30-day extension of the waivers, but does not comment
on the extension of the waivers through March 31, 1996. 
B. In opposition:
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety accurately portrays the FHWA's premise for its ``consistent with safety''
determination as being that drivers with relatively clean driving records are at a lower risk for future accidents
and that this is borne out in the crash experience of drivers in the waiver group as compared with the general commercial
driver population. It concedes that the studies cited by the FHWA and other studies

1

 referred to in the IIHS comments ``(r)epeatedly * * * have shown that prior citations and crashes can
be used as predictors of future crash risk (citations omitted),'' and acknowledges that such research ``amply justifies
driver control policies based on driver records, such as point systems, suspensions, and revocations.'' 




The IIHS, however, goes on to contend that these justifications are specious. It cites several studies which show
that many drivers with clean driving records are involved in accidents, and that many drivers with poor driving records
over a three-year period experience accident-free periods of equal length. A 1994 California report is cited which
``did find that crash risk increases as a function of the number of crashes and citations on a drivers prior record.
Of the two, prior citations is a slightly better indicator of subsequent crash risk, but subsequent crash risk can
be more accurately predicted from a combination of prior crash and prior citation information than from either alone.''
Significantly, it is this combination that the FHWA relied upon to reach its ``consistent with safety'' determination.
The IIHS contends that none of the findings in the California report support the proposition that ``the absence of
citations or crashes can be used to predict a crash-free future.'' 
It is apparent from its comments that the IIHS believes that the FHWA, in order to reach a ``consistent with safety''
determination, was bound to predict with some certainty that the waived drivers would be accident-free. The FHWA
rejects this contention. The FHWA's determination is based on a reasonable expectation, supported by the studies
cited both in the October 6 notice and in the IIHS comments, that the waived drivers with relatively clean driving records,
as a group, would present less of a risk to public safety than a representative group of drivers, meeting existing standards,
to be used in place of the waived drivers. 
The IIHS also faults the FHWA for ignoring the data gathered to date on fatal crash involvement of the waived group.
Because of reporting errors by the drivers, which were detected and corrected through the FHWA back-up monitoring
systems, much of the information on fatal accident involvement was not available by the time ``The Third Interim Monitoring
Report on the Drivers of Commercial Motor Vehicles Who Receive Vision Waivers'' was completed on June 27, 1994. That
report analyzes data collected from July, 1992, through February, 1994. The Fourth Interim Monitoring Report, which
has been placed in the docket, includes both the fatal and non-fatal accident rates resulting from all data accumulated
through June 30, 1994. The fatal accident rate for the waived group of drivers is indeed slightly higher than the general
truck driving population. However, in none of the fatal accidents was the waived driver issued a citation or found
by the reporting police officer to have been at fault.

Finally, the IIHS is critical of the study methodology and faults the FHWA for its failure to use a control group as originally
planned. The FHWA will more fully address this in the methodology to be developed to establish parameters for a performance-based
vision standard. 

The American Trucking Associations, Inc., a national trade association of the trucking industry, also commented
in opposition to the FHWA proposal. The ATA had participated in the D.C. Circuit case, 

AHAS 

v. 

FHWA, supra

., by filing an 

amicus curiae

 brief in support of the petitioner's challenge to the waiver study. The ATA contends that the decision of the Court
of Appeals in 

AHAS 

was broad enough to preclude the FHWA's present proposal. The FHWA disagrees for the reasons stated herein and in its
filings with the D.C. Circuit in opposition to the AHAS motion for issuance and enforcement of a mandate, which the
court dismissed. The filings in that matter are recorded in the docket. 

The ATA suggests that pooling of the waived drivers may mask poor performance by individual members of the pool, and
that comparisons with general populations are faulty because the waived group contains only experienced drivers.
The ATA then significantly concedes that ``(a) pool of experienced drivers will also appear to be safer than the national
pool which includes new drivers and drivers with various driving experience.'' That is precisely the point. The FHWA's
``consistent with safety'' determination is based on the premise. The waived drivers had all been operating commercial
motor vehicles on the highways when the waivers were issued to them. If they were required to stop driving they would
have to be replaced by drivers drawn from the general population of truck drivers or new drivers. This is particularly
true in this era of driver shortages which the ATA has publicly and repeatedly proclaimed. (See, e.g.,

The ATA also faults the study design because it will never be probative of ``the ability of visually impaired drivers,
in general, to operate CMVs safely.'' The ATA states that this is because ``the study is limited to the experiences
of these apparently better-than-average drivers.'' Once again, the ATA makes the FHWA's point. The ``consistent
with safety'' determination relates to the issuance of the waivers, and not to the design or conclusions to be drawn
from the study. The FHWA recognizes that the study as presently fashioned has some problems, which the FHWA is taking
steps to correct. The FHWA also recognizes that its group of waived drivers may include some subpar performers who
individually may present an unacceptable risk to safety. The FHWA is taking steps to identify and exclude such drivers,
while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the overall waiver program. 

Finally, the ATA contends that the FHWA proposal is an attempt to give retroactive effect to its previous waiver rule,
and that this is violative of the Administrative Procedure Act, citing 

Georgetown University Hosp.

 v. 

Bowen

, 821 F.2d 750 (D.C. Cir. 1987), 

aff'd.

, 488 U.S. 204 (1988). The 

Georgetown 

case involved a rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that affected the formula under which
hospitals were to be reimbursed for the provision of certain health services. After the rule was invalidated because
it was issued without opportunity for public comment, the HHS issued a new rule retroactive to an earlier date. On the
basis of this new rule, the HHS then sought reimbursement from the hospitals for payments made before the date of the
new rule which were greater than would be allowable under the new formula. 

The FHWA's decision allowing waived drivers to operate in interstate commerce until March 31, 1996, has no retroactive
effect whatsoever. It speaks only prospectively. On September 30, the FHWA validated the waivers for a 30-day period
and requested comments. 

Moreover, the rule in this instance was not vacated for procedural error, as it was in the 

Georgetown

 case. In this instance, the rule was vacated after the court determined that the agency did not have the necessary empirical
evidence in the record to support its assertion that the waivers were consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. The
Notice published on October 6 provided the necessary empirical evidence for the future effect of the waivers, including
data on the driving performance of the waived group of drivers as a whole, which clearly indicates that allowing this
group to continue operating in interstate commerce is consistent with the safe operation of CMVs. (See 59 FR 50887
at 50889, 50890, October 6, 1994). In providing the necessary empirical evidence, the agency cured the defect and
now validates the waivers through March 31, 1996. Consequently, this action is entirely consistent with the APA.


The comments of the American Movers Conference merely voice its support for the position taken by the ATA. 

Arthur H. Keeney, M.D., D.Sc., a Distinguished Professor of Ophthalmology and Dean Emeritus of the University of
Louisville Department of Ophthalmology urged the FHWA to hold to its previously established physiologic standards
without further reduction. Dr. Keeney suggested that the FHWA might grandfather the remaining waived drivers into
the system as a means of proceeding away from the agency's current course, but recommended against enrolling any more
``monocular blind or ``visually deficient drivers' who may be interpreted as otherwise qualified to meet occupational
requirements.'' Dr. Keeney also submitted a recently prepared but thus far unpublished paper entitled ``The Monocular
Quandary'' which includes an extensive bibliography. The paper supports the current standard and explores operational
problems, particularly associated with individuals with no vision in one eye. The FHWA believes the comments and
the research paper of Dr. Keeney will be useful in its pursuit of performance-based vision standards. 

Strong opposition to the FHWA proposal was also received from the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (AHAS), the
petitioner in the D.C. Circuit case referred to throughout this notice. The AHAS reargues its position in the court
proceeding both before and after judgment and urges a broader interpretation of the court's decision.

The Advocates also believe that the waived drivers could have been ``grandfathered'' into a qualified status, and,
indeed, that such an alternative is still available to the FHWA. It is unclear how the effect of this approach would
differ in any significant degree from that of the route chosen by the FHWA. The Advocates contend that the FHWA misused
the data from the vision waiver study, ignoring the advice of its own experts in the process. We believe the AHAS is confusing
the basis for a ``consistent with safety'' determination to justify the issuance of the waivers in order to conduct
the study with prejudging the outcome of the study. As mentioned above, the FHWA concedes that the study, as currently
designed, will not produce, by itself, sufficient evidence upon which to develop a new vision standard, and the FHWA
has never claimed that the study was intended to create a standard, per se, for issuing waivers. 

Finally, the AHAS criticized the FHWA for not being candid with the data it has obtained during the course of the vision
waiver study. It claims that the FHWA has underreported fatalities. The FHWA has made every attempt to be forthcoming
regarding the data and accident information compiled. In fact, the State police and accident reports referred to
in comments by the Advocates were provided promptly and directly to the AHAS by the agency. This issue, however, has
convinced the agency to take steps to improve its monitoring systems. 

The Fourth Interim Report has been completed by the contractor and covers cumulative activities and mileage through
June 30, 1994. Since the June 30 date, another waived driver has been involved in a fatal accident. As of June 30, the
fatal accident rate for waived drivers is 0.034 per million vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as compared to the national
rate computed from GES data of 0.026. The total accident rate for drivers in the waived group is 1.636 per million VMT
compared with the rate of 2.531 per million VMT computed from GES data. Given the small number of fatal accidents that
have occurred, these rates can represent only approximate estimates of what may actually be expected to occur on the
highways. Therefore, conclusions drawn solely from them must be cautiously interpreted. 

Additionally, the fatal accidents that have occurred were not necessarily related to the drivers' vision impairments.
The most recent fatality, which was promptly reported by the waived driver involved, occurred when an automobile
collided with the rear end of the truck operated by the waived driver. The police accident report indicated there was
no fault on the part of the truck driver. A review of the police accident reports of the previous 6 fatal accidents in
which waived drivers were involved also reveals that none of the waived drivers was found to be at fault by the reporting
police officer. 


Status of the Waived Drivers 



The FHWA has reviewed all the comments carefully, conferred with its contractor administering the agency's vision
waiver program and conducted peer reviews regarding the studies and other evidence submitted by the commenters.
The FHWA believes that continuing to allow those drivers operating commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce
while holding Federal vision waivers is consistent with the two-pronged test set forth in the Motor Carrier Safety
Act of 1984 (49 U.S.C. 31136(e) (1994)). 

As discussed above, even the comments opposing the vision waivers did not refute the premise upon which the ``consistent
with safety'' determination articulated in the October 6 notice was based. The studies referred to by the FHWA to support
the proposition that a group of experienced drivers with clean driving records over a 3-year period will present less
of a risk than a group of drivers selected from the general truck driving population to replace them over a similar 3-year
period were not contradicted. In fact, studies referred to by some of the commenters opposing the vision waivers bolstered
this position. The opposing commenters did, however, point out some weaknesses in monitoring the performance of
the waived drivers which can be corrected to assure the continued safety of these drivers. 

To correct these and assure the continued safety of the drivers, the FHWA will, within the next 60 days, undertake a
close review of the data gathered thus far and develop additional criteria which the waived drivers will be required
to meet as conditions of retaining the waiver. These conditions will be communicated directly to the waived drivers.
In those 60 days, the FHWA will also improve its monitoring systems to enable the agency to more promptly identify subpar
performers among the waived group to ensure that safety is maintained. 



Determination 



The FHWA has determined that the issuance of waivers to the 2,399 drivers remaining in the study group is consistent
with the public interest and the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. This determination is based on studies
referred to herein and data gathered during the course of the last two years which support the proposition that a group
of experienced drivers of commercial motor vehicles with clean driving records, including both accident and citation
records over the previous three years, will present a lower risk to safety over the following 3 years than a group of
the same size comprised of drivers representing the general truck driving population, including new drivers, over
the same 3-year period. The statistics that have been gathered from the waived drivers to date indicate that this class
of drivers has performed and continues to perform more safely than those drivers in the general population of commercial
drivers.

The waivers were issued to these drivers following an individual determination of each driver's capability to operate
a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safely. This individual determination consisted of a review of each individual's
vital statistics, employment history, status of driving privilege as recorded on the licensing State's MVR and the
license status for the past three years, and expert medical opinion by an ophthalmologist or optometrist attesting
to the visual acuity of each driver and its effect on his or her ability to perform the driving task safely. Once a driver
was granted a waiver, he or she was, and is, required to submit monthly driving reports and be examined annually by an
ophthalmologist or optometrist and submit the results of that examination to the FHWA. Failure to report timely as
required will result in the initiation of a process to revoke the waiver. Moreover, the FHWA's contractor periodically
verifies the waived drivers reported accidents and citations through each driver's State motor vehicle record (MVR).
Medical reports are also verified. The drivers holding waivers from the Federal vision standards, as is true of all
drivers in the general population, are not immune from State or Federal enforcement or licensing sanctions by virtue
of their participation in the waiver study, and are subject to the penalty provisions of the commercial drivers' license
regulations (49 CFR Part 383), State and local licensing sanctions, as well as the penalty provisions set forth as
conditions of the waiver. 

In addition, the FHWA believes that the continued employment of individuals with proven safe driving records is in
the public interest. The comments to the docket reflect several instances where companies employing waived drivers
rely heavily upon their waived drivers because these drivers are consistently safe operators of CMVs. Permitting
waived drivers to continue operating in interstate commerce is also consistent with the public interest policy of
employing persons with disabilities, which is evidenced in both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans
with Disabilities Act. 


Status of the Study 



The agency believes that the observations made by the Advocates, the ATA, the IIHS and others regarding flaws in the
current research method have merit. In addition, several experts reviewed the studies and data upon which the FHWA
based its ``consistent with safety'' determination and were unanimous in finding (1) the waived drivers as a group
would be expected to perform as well as or better than a group of equal size drawn at random from the general truck driving
population because of the preselection criteria and conditions; and (2) the data developed by the study will never
answer the question as to what the standards should be. Consequently, the FHWA has decided to develop and implement,
with the input of these commenters and others, a new research method that will address the concerns of these commenters.


The FHWA will undertake comprehensive research to develop parameters for performance-based visual standards for
all commercial drivers. The agency anticipates that any new vision standards will consider at least three critical
aspects of visual performance: static acuity, dynamic acuity, and useful field of view. The vision standard found
at 49 CFR  391.41(b)(10) will remain in effect until the completion of this research and the implementation
of any new standard. The agency's ultimate goal is to adopt driver physical qualification standards that are performance-based;
that is, they will reflect the actual physical requirements that fosters safe operation of commercial vehicles.


Development of standards will begin with an analysis of the existing body of knowledge, including knowledge gained
from this project when completed, and from analogous applications of visual standards in other environments (e.g.,
Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, and National Aeronautical and Space Administration).
The final standards will be developed in careful consideration of the practical constraints of driver vision testing,
cost, examiner training, testing time, and requirements for development of new testing equipment, all of which will
be balanced against projected safety improvements. 

The FHWA will proceed within the following framework: 

 FHWA will develop a sound methodology, based on accepted experimental and statistical practices, for developing
visual standards. 

 The development process will include consideration of the collected accident experience of commercial vehicle
operators, including the drivers holding vision waivers. 

 Before a final method and design for developing standards is determined, FHWA will announce its proposed method
and design for discussion at a public meeting to be held in the Spring of 1995. The proposed method will be open to public
scrutiny. The final methodology will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 

 The FHWA will announce the results of the study, the proposed standards and a proposed plan for implementing
the standards at the completion of this study. 


Public Hearing on Vision Standard and Waiver Program 



As mentioned earlier, the FHWA intends to announce its proposed revisions to the research method at a public hearing
to be held in Spring 1995. The FHWA is eager to gain a broader perspective of the public's viewpoint concerning other
studies, data and experiences which will enhance the agency's knowledge on the subject of a performance-based vision
standard. The FHWA is also interested in sharing its data with other researchers and agencies which may undertake
useful analyses and initiate studies leading to new approaches in establishing future physical qualification standards,
standards that are both necessary and valid to increasing opportunities in the truck-driving profession while ensuring
that society's high expectations of CMV safety are realized. Notice of the hearing will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and will contain further questions to which the agency seeks responses, as well as directions on how to obtain information
about the data collected during the vision waiver study. 


Conclusion 



Based upon the comments to the docket and the empirical evidence gathered to date, the FHWA will allow those drivers
currently holding waivers from the Federal vision standard to continue to operate in interstate commerce until March
31, 1996. This permission is conditioned upon each driver's continued compliance with the reporting requirements
outlined in the 

Federal Register

 on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31458) and again on October 6, 1994 (59 FR 50887) and such further conditions and monitoring as
may be imposed by the FHWA in the interest of safety. Waived drivers also remain subject to State or Federal enforcement
or licensing sanctions. Additionally, the FHWA will concurrently undertake research to develop comprehensive,
performance-based visual standards for all commercial drivers. This proposed analysis and research method will
be presented at a public hearing to be held in Spring 1995, and the public will be invited to comment on the research method.
And finally, the FHWA, within the next 60 days, will complete a review of the performance data on the waived drivers
to develop criteria which will form the basis for further conditions which will be imposed directly on the waiver holders
and will further reduce the safety risks to these drivers and highway users.

Summary of the Report and Order



1. The 

Report and Order

 is a comprehensive, top-to-bottom rewrite of part 22 of the Commission's Rules. The topics which were the most controversial
are treated in the 

Report and Order

, while the less controversial changes are explained in Appendix A of the 

Report and Order

. Among other things, the 

Report and Order

 modifies the application processing procedures for 931 MHz paging applications by requiring that applicants specify
the channels for which they seek authorization, prescribing a 30-day filing period for initial applications and
providing for auctions as the means for selecting the winner among mutually exclusive initial applications. Applications
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, which is a fixed as opposed to a mobile radio service, will be selected on a first-come,
first-served basis. The first-come, first-served procedures allow an application to be granted if it is not mutually
exclusive with another application filed on the same or on a previous day and if the applicant in question is qualified
to be a Commission licensee. Further, under these procedures, mutually exclusive rural radiotelephone applications
received on the same day would, absent a negotiated settlement among the parties, be designated for a comparative
hearing to determine which application should be granted.

2. The 

Report and Order

 also requires that, by the end of their authorized construction periods, licensees of public mobile stations must
not only complete construction of their facilities, as is now required, but must also actually commence provision
of service to subscribers. In addition, the 

Report and Order

 eliminates the remaining traffic loading study requirements for Paging and Radiotelephone Services licensees
seeking additional channels for traditional two-way mobile radio services and provides technical channel assignment
rules for Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems (BETRS), which is a radio technology that provides basic telephone
service to remote and rural areas.

3. The 

Report and Order

 explicitly requires that cellular telephones be designed and manufactured in such a way that the electronic serial
number is permanently programmed into the equipment at the factory and is physically unalterable. This requirement
is intended to help reduce fraud in the use of cellular equipment due to tampering with the electronic serial numbers.

4. The 

Report and Order

 also removes the existing prohibition against the concurrent use and licensing of Part 22 facilities for both common
carrier and non-common carrier services, affirmatively allows the use of multi-channel transmitters, and permits
licensees to make certain minor modifications to their stations and add ``internal'' transmitters to existing systems
without notifying the Commission.



Ordering Clauses



Accordingly, it is ordered that the rule changes made herein will become effective on January 1, 1995.

 22.108

 Parties to applications.



Each application for an authorization, assignment of authorization, or for consent to transfer of control in the
Public Mobile Service must disclose fully the real party or parties in interest to the application. Such disclosure
must include:

(a) A list of the applicant's subsidiaries, if any. For the purposes of this section, a subsidiary is any business for
which the applicant or any officer, director, stockholder or key manager of the applicant owns 5% or more of the stock,
warrants, options or debt securities. This list must include a description of each subsidiary's principal business
and relationship to the applicant.

(b) A list of the applicant's affiliates, if any. For the purposes of this section, an affiliate is:

(1) Any business that holds a 5% or more interest in the applicant; or,

(2) Any business in which a 5% or more interest is held by a business that also holds a 5% or more interest in the applicant.

(c) A list of the names, addresses, citizenship and principal business of any person holding 5% or more of each class
of stock, warrants, options or debt securities of the applicant, indicating the amount and percentage held, and providing
the name, address, citizenship and principal place of business of any person, if other than the holder, for whose benefit
such interest is held. If any such persons are related by blood or marriage, the relationship must be disclosed.

(d) For initial cellular applications, the name and address of each partner, his or her citizenship and the share or
interest participation in the partnership. This information must be provided for all partners, regardless of their
respective ownership interests in the partnership. A signed and dated copy of the partnership agreement must be included
in the application. See  22.953(a)(5)(v).



 22.115

 Content of applications.



Applications must contain all applicable information requested on the standard form and any additional information
required by the rules in this part.

(a) The following requirements are common to all Public Mobile Services:

(1) 

Site availability.

 At the time of filing, applicants must have obtained reasonable assurance that all antenna sites specified in their
applications are available for the proposed use.

(2) 

Antenna structure drawing.

 Applications proposing a new antenna structure or a change in the overall height of an existing antenna structure
must contain a vertical profile drawing of the antenna structure. (Applications proposing to use an existing structure,
without changing the overall height of the structure, need not contain a drawing.) If appropriate, the standard drawings
on Schedule F of FCC Form 401 should be used to satisfy this requirement. Otherwise, the applicant may submit an exhibit
containing the required drawing. The drawing must be labeled to show the overall structure height including appurtenances,
the height of the tip(s) of the proposed antenna(s), the height of any supporting building (or other man-made structure
other than an antenna tower), and the ground elevation. Heights must be given in meters above ground level (AGL) and
meters above mean sea level (AMSL). The ground elevation must be given in meters AMSL.

(3) 

FAA notification.

 Before construction of new antenna structures or increases in the height of existing structures is authorized by
the FCC, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determination of No Hazard to Air Navigation may be required. To
apply for this determination, applicants must notify the FAA of the planned construction. Criteria used to determine
whether FAA notification is required for a particular antenna structure are contained in part 17, subpart B of this
chapter. Applications proposing a new antenna structure or an increase in the height of an existing antenna structure
must state whether FAA notification is required. If available, a copy of the FAA determination should be included
in the application. If FAA notification is required, but the FAA determination is not available at the time the application
is filed, the application must include the following information in regard to the FAA notification: the name of the
person that submitted the notification, the date the notification was submitted, and the location of the FAA office
to which the notification was submitted.

(4) 

Antenna locations.

 Applications for stations at fixed locations must describe each transmitting antenna site by its geographical coordinates
and also by its street address, or by reference to a nearby landmark. Geographical coordinates must be specified in
degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude.






Note

 to paragraph (a)(4) of  22.115: The FAA has announced that effective October 15, 1992, it will use geographic
coordinates based on the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83). Until further notice, however, the FCC will continue
to use geographical coordinates based the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27). Applicants may supply geographical
coordinates based on NAD83 in addition to those required (NAD27).




(5) 

Environmental concerns.

 Each applicant is required to indicate at the time its application is filed whether or not an FCC grant of the application
may have a significant environmental effect, as defined by  1.1307 of this chapter. If answered affirmatively,
an Environmental Assessment, required by  1.1311 of this chapter, must be filed with the application and environmental
review by the FCC must be completed prior to construction.

(b) 

Reference to material on file. 

Questions on application forms that call for specific technical data, or that can be answered yes or no or with another
short answer, must be answered on the form. Otherwise, if documents, exhibits, or other lengthy showings already
on file with the FCC contain information required in an application, the application may incorporate such information
by reference, provided that:

(1) The reference information comprises more than one 81/2
'
' x 11
'
' page and is current and accurate in all material respects; and,

(2) The reference states specifically where the referenced information can actually be found, including:

(i) The station call sign or application file number, if the reference is to station files or previously filed applications;

(ii) The title of the proceeding, the docket number, and any legal citations, if the reference is to a docketed proceeding.

(c) 

Service specific requirements. 

Applications for authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must contain specific information as required
by  22.929 and  22.953. Applications for authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service must
contain specific information as required by  22.529,  22.559 and  22.589. Applications for authorization
in the Rural Radiotelephone Service must contain the information required by  22.709. Applications for authorization
in the Offshore Radio Service must contain the information required by  22.1037. Applications for authorization
in the Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service must contain specific information as required by  22.803 and  22.875,
as appropriate.



 22.117

Content of notifications.



Notifications must contain all applicable information requested on the standard form and any additional information
required by the rules in this part. See   22.124, 22.137, 22.142, 22.163, 22.165, 22.941, and 22.946.



 22.119 

Requests for rule waivers.



The FCC may waive the requirements of rules in this part on its own motion or upon written request.

(a) Requests for waiver of rules must contain a complete explanation as to why the waiver is desired. The FCC may grant
a request for waiver if it is shown that:

(1) The underlying purpose of the rule(s) would not be served or would be frustrated by application to the instant case,
and that a grant of the requested waiver would be in the public interest; or 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) In view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the instant case, application of the rule(s) would be inequitable,
unduly burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or that the applicant has no reasonable alternative.

(b) The FCC, in its discretion, may give public notice of the filing of a waiver request and seek comment from the public
or affected parties.

(c) Denial of a rule waiver request associated with an application renders that application defective unless it contains
an alternative proposal that fully complies with the rules, in which event the application is processed using the
alternative proposal as if the waiver had not been requested. Applications rendered defective may be dismissed without
prejudice.



 22.120

Application processing; initial procedures.



This section contains rules governing the initial processing of applications for authority to operate a station
in the Public Mobile Services.

(a) 

File numbers.

 Applications received by the FCC are assigned file numbers. Assignment of a file number to an application is for administrative
convenience and does not constitute a determination that the application is acceptable for filing. Assignment of
a file number does not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of an application. For administrative efficiency,
the FCC, in its discretion, occasionally consolidates separate applications filed simultaneously by the same applicant
into a single application (with one file number) and splits applications comprising two or more severable proposals
into separate applications (with different file numbers).

(b) 

Received date.

 The FCC records the date on which each application is received. This date is used to determine compliance with applicable
cut-off dates or filing windows and for other purposes.

(c) 

Initial review for completeness (prescreening).

 Each application is reviewed for completeness. The purpose of this initial review is to identify applications that
are defective in an obvious way (e.g. not signed, missing pages, improper or missing fee payment). Applications found
to be defective in this review are unacceptable for filing and may be returned to the applicant with a brief statement
indicating the nature of the defect(s) found. Applications for which no obvious defects are discovered in the initial
review are acceptable for filing.

(d) 

Public notice; acceptance for filing.

 The FCC periodically issues Public Notices that list applications that are acceptable for filing. The listing of
an application on a Public Notice as acceptable for filing provides notices to the public that the application has
been filed; it does not preclude dismissal of the application if it is subsequently found to be defective or otherwise
subject to dismissal under  22.128.



 22.121 

Repetitious, inconsistent or conflicting applications.



Repetitious, inconsistent or conflicting applications are not accepted for filing by the FCC. Unless the FCC in a
particular case determines otherwise, such applications are not returned to the applicant.

(a) While an application is pending, any subsequent inconsistent or conflicting application submitted by, on behalf
of, or for the benefit of the same applicant, its successor or assignee will not be accepted for filing.

(b) If an applicant has been afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to an application for a new station or
an enlargement of service area, and the FCC has, after hearing or default, denied the application or dismissed it with
prejudice, the FCC will not consider a like application for service of the same type to the same area by that applicant,
or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of the parties in interest to the original application,
until one year after the effective date of the FCC's action on the original application.

(c) If an appeal has been taken from the action of the FCC denying a particular application, a like application for service
of the same type to the same area, in whole or in part, filed by that applicant or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf
or for the benefit of the parties in interest to the original application, will not be considered until the final disposition
of such appeal.

(d) If an authorization is voluntarily cancelled or automatically terminated because of failure to commence service
to subscribers (see  22.144), the FCC will not consider an application for another authorization to operate
a station on the same channel (or, in the case of a 931 MHz paging station, the same frequency range) in the same geographical
area by that party, or by its successor or assignee, or on behalf of or for the benefit of the parties in interest to the
terminated authorization, until one year after the date the authorization terminated. This paragraph does not apply
to authorizations in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.



 22.122 

Amendment of applications.



Pending applications may be amended as a matter of right if they have not been designated for hearing or listed in a Public
Notice for a random selection or competitive bidding process, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
section and in  22.949.

(a) If a petition to deny or other formal objection has been filed, a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be served
on the petitioner. If the FCC has issued a Public Notice stating that the application appears to be mutually exclusive
with another application (or applications), a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be served on any such mutually
exclusive applicant (or applicants).

(b) Amendments to applications that resolve mutual exclusivity may be filed at any time, subject to the requirements
of  22.129.

(c) Amendments to applications designated for hearing may be allowed by the presiding officer and amendments to applications
selected in a random selection process may be allowed by the FCC for good cause shown. In such instances, a written petition
demonstrating good cause must be submitted and served upon the parties of record.

 22.123 

Classification of filings as major or minor.



Applications and amendments to applications are classified as major or minor. Categories of major and minor filings
are listed in section 309 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 309). In general, a major filing is
a request for an FCC action that has the potential to affect parties other than the applicant. Filings are minor if they
are not classified as major.

(a) 

Ownership or control change. 

Filings are major if they specify a substantial change in beneficial ownership or control (

de jure 

or 

de facto

), unless such change is involuntary or if the filing merely amends an application to reflect a change in ownership
or control that has already been approved by the FCC.

(b) 

Developmental.

 Applications are major if they request a developmental authorization pursuant to  22.409, or a regular authorization
for facilities operating under a developmental authorization.

(c) 

Renewal.

 Applications of renewal of authorizations are major.

(d) 

Environmental.

 Filings are major if they request authorization for a facility that would have a significant environmental effect,
as defined by   1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.

(e) 

Paging and Radiotelephone Service.

 In the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, filings are major if they:

see

  22.150) to change the technical proposal substantially from that which was coordinated with other users.

(f) 

Rural Radiotelephone Service.

 In the Rural Radiotelephone Service, filings are major if they:

(1) Request an authorization for a new central office or subscriber station;

(2) Request an authorization that would extend the interfering contours of an existing station beyond the composite
interfering contours of station(s) authorized to the filer on a requested channel;

(3) Request an authorization that would increase the effective radiated power or antenna height above average terrain
in any azimuth from an existing transmitter authorized to the filer;

(4) Request an authorization that would relocate an existing transmitter;

(5) Amend a pending application to change a requested channel;

(6) Amend a pending application in a way that would extend the interfering contours of a station on a requested channel
beyond_

(i) The composite interfering contours of that station as previously proposed in the application and_

(ii) The composite interfering contours of any other stations authorized to the filer on a requested channel; or,

(7) Amend a pending application to increase the proposed effective radiated power or antenna height above average

(g) 

Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

 In the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, filings are major if they:

(1) Request an authorization to operate a new cellular system;

(2) Request an authorization for facilities that would expand the cellular geographic service area (CGSA) of an existing
cellular system, except during the applicable five year build-out period, if any;

(3) Request an authorization for facilities that would produce a 

de minimis

 service area boundary extension (see  22.911(c)(1));

(4) Request that a CGSA boundary or a portion of a CGSA boundary be determined using an alternative method (see  22.911(b));

(5) Amend a pending application to change the requested channel block; or,

(6) Amend a pending application by modifying the CGSA of the proposed cellular system to include area that_

(i) Was not included in the CGSA as previously proposed in the application and_

(ii) Is not included in the currently authorized CGSA, if any.

(h) 

Air-ground Radiotelephone.

 In the Air-ground Radiotelephone 
Service, filings are major if they:

(l) Request an authorization for a new General Aviation ground station or to relocate an existing General Aviation
ground station;

(2) Request the first authorization for a new Commercial Aviation ground station at a location other than those listed
in  22.859;

(4) Amend a pending application to change the requested channel or channel block.

(i) 

Offshore Radiotelephone.

 In the Offshore Radiotelephone Service, filings are major if they:



(1) Request an authorization for a new offshore central or subscriber station;

(2) Request authorization to add a channel to or change a channel of an existing offshore central or subscriber station;
or,

(3) Amend a pending application to change the technical proposal substantially from that which was coordinated with
other users prior to filing.

(j) 

Clerical errors.

 Amendments are classified as minor if they only correct typographical, transcription or similar clerical errors
that are clearly demonstrated (e.g. by reference to other parts of the application) to be mistakes, and whose discovery
and correction does not change information previously listed in a Public Notice.



 22.124 

Notification processing.



This section contains rules governing the processing of notifications (filed on FCC Form 489) in the Public Mobile
Services.

(a) 

File numbers.

 Notifications received by the FCC are assigned file numbers. Assignment of a file number to a notification is for administrative
convenience and does not constitute a determination that the notified action has been examined and not rejected by
the FCC. Assignment of a file number does not preclude the return of a notification subsequently found to be defective.

(b) 

Defective notifications.

 A notification is defective if:

(1) It is unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to questions, informational showings, or other
matters of a formal character;

(2) It notifies of an action that does not comply with one or more of the FCC rules;

(3) It notifies of an action for which an application for authorization is required;

(4) It is submitted without the required microfiche; or,

(5) It is untimely filed.

(c) 

Review.

 After a file number is assigned, each notification is reviewed. The purpose of this review is to identify notifications
that are unacceptable (e.g. not signed, missing pages, improper or missing fee payment). Notifications found to
be unacceptable may be returned to the licensee with a brief statement describing the deficiency. If a notification
is found to be unacceptable, the FCC may direct the licensee to return the station to compliance with its previous license
terms. Acceptable notifications are added to the appropriate station files.



 22.125 

Application for special temporary authorizations.



In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of Public Mobile Services stations, carriers may request
special temporary authority (STA) to operate new or modified equipment. Such requests may be submitted as informal
applications (see  22.105) and must contain complete details about the proposed operation and the circumstances
that fully justify and necessitate the grant of STA. Such requests should be filed in time to be received by the FCC at
least 10 days prior to the date of proposed operation or, where an extension is sought, 10 days prior to the expiration
date of the existing STA. Requests received less than 10 days prior to the desired date of operation may be given expedited
considerations only if compelling reasons are given, in writing, for the delay in submitting the request. Otherwise,
such late-filed requests are considered in turn, but action might not be taken prior to the desired date of operation.
Requests for STAs must be accompanied by the proper filing fee.

(a) 

Grant without Public Notice.

 STAs may be granted without being listed in a Public Notice, or prior to 30 days after such listing, if:

(1) The STA is to be valid for 30 days or less and the applicant does not plan to file an application for regular authorization
of the subject operation;

(2) The STA is to be valid for 60 days or less, pending the filing of an application for regular authorization of the subject
operation;

(3) The STA is to allow interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide substantially
the same service as previously authorized; or

(4) The STA is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the public interest
and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public interest.

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Limit on STA term. 

The FCC may grant STAs valid for a period not to exceed 180 days under the provisions of  309(f) of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, (47 U.S.C. 309(f)) if extraordinary circumstances so require, and pending the filing of an
application for regular operation. The FCC may grant extensions of STAs for a period of 180 days, but the applicant
must show that extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension.



 22.127 

Public notices.



Periodically, the FCC issues Public Notices listing major filings and other information of public significance.
Categories of Public Notice listings are as follows:

(a) 

Accepted for filing. 

Acceptance for filing of applications and major amendments thereto.

(b) 

Actions. 

FCC actions on pending applications previously listed as accepted for filing.

(c) 

Informative listings. 

Information that the FCC, in its discretion, believes to be of public significance. Such listings do not create any
rights to file oppositions or other pleadings.



 22.128 

Dismissal of applications.



The FCC may dismiss any application for authorization, assignment of authorization, or consent to transfer of control
in the Public Mobile Services, upon request by the applicant, or if the application is untimely filed, or if the application
is mutually exclusive with another application that is selected or granted in accordance with the rules in this part,
or for failure to prosecute, or if the requested spectrum is not available, or if the application is found to be defective.
Such dismissal may be ``without prejudice,'' meaning that the FCC may accept from the applicant another application
for the same purpose at any later time, or ``with prejudice,'' meaning that the FCC will not accept from the applicant
another application for the same purpose for a period of one year. Unless otherwise provided in this part, a dismissed
application will not be returned to the applicant.

(a) 

Dismissal at request of applicant. 

Any applicant may request that its application be returned or dismissed. A request for the return of an application
after it has been listed on Public Notice as tentatively accepted for filing is considered to be a request for dismissal
of that application without prejudice.

(1) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application with prejudice, the FCC will dismiss that application
with prejudice.

(2) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application without prejudice, the FCC will dismiss that application
without prejudice, unless:

(i) It has been designated for comparative hearing;

(ii) It has been selected in a random selection process; or,

(iii) It is an application for which the applicant submitted the winning bid in a competitive bidding process.

(3) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application for which it submitted the winning bid in a competitive
bidding process, the FCC will dismiss that application with prejudice. If the applicant requests dismissal of its
application after that application has been designated for comparative hearing or selected in a random selection
process, it may submit a written petition requesting that the dismissal be without prejudice. Such petition must
demonstrate good cause and comply with  22.129 and be served upon all parties of record. The FCC may grant such
petition and dismiss the application without prejudice or deny the petition and dismiss the application with prejudice.

(b) 

Dismissal of mutually exclusive applications not granted. 

The FCC may dismiss mutually exclusive applications:

(1) For which the applicant did not submit the winning bid in a competitive bidding process;

(2) That are included in a random selection process but are not granted; or,

(3) That receive comparative consideration in a hearing but are not granted by order of the presiding officer.

(c) 

Dismissal for failure to prosecute. 

The FCC may dismiss applications for failure of the applicant to prosecute or for failure of the applicant to respond
substantially within a specified time period to official correspondence or requests for additional information.
Such dismissal will generally be without prejudice if the failure to prosecute or respond occurred prior to designation
of the application for comparative hearing or prior to selection of the application in a random selection process,
but may be with prejudice in cases of non-compliance with  22.129. Dismissal will generally be with prejudice
if the failure to prosecute or respond occurred after designation of the application for comparative hearing or after
selection of the application in a random selection process. The FCC may dismiss applications with prejudice for failure
of the applicant to comply with requirements related to a competitive bidding process.

(d) 

Dismissal as defective. 

The FCC may dismiss without prejudice applications that it finds to be defective. Applications for authorization
or assignment of authorization are defective if:

(1) They are unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to questions, informational showings, or other
matters of a formal character; or,

(2) They request an authorization that would not comply with one or more of the FCC rules and do not contain a request
for waiver of these rule(s), or in the event that the FCC denies such a waiver request, do not contain an alternative
proposal that fully complies with the rules;

(e) 

Dismissal because spectrum not available. 

The FCC may dismiss applications that request spectrum which is unavailable because:

(1) It is not allocated for assignment in the Public Mobile Services (see Part 2 of this chapter);

(2) It was previously assigned to another licensee on an exclusive basis or cannot be assigned to the applicant without
causing interference; or

(3) Reasonable efforts have been made to coordinate the proposed facility with foreign administrations under applicable
international agreements, and an unfavorable response (harmful interference anticipated) has been received.

(f) 

Dismissal as untimely.

 The FCC may dismiss without prejudice applications that are prematurely or late filed, including applications filed
prior to the opening date or after the closing date of a filing window, or after the cut-off date for a mutually exclusive
application filing group.



 22.129 

Agreements to dismiss applications, amendments or pleadings.



Parties that have filed an application in the Public Mobile Services that is mutually exclusive with one or more other
applications, and then enter into an agreement to resolve the mutual exclusivity by withdrawing or requesting dismissal
of the application or an amendment thereto, must obtain the approval of the FCC. Parties that have filed or threatened
to file a petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading against a pending application in the Public Mobile
Services and then seek to withdraw or request dismissal of, or refrain from filing, the petition, either unilaterally
or in exchange for a financial consideration, must obtain the approval of the FCC.

(a) The party withdrawing or requesting dismissal of its application, petition to deny, informal objection or other
pleading or refraining from filing a pleading must submit to the FCC a request for approval of the withdrawal or dismissal,
a copy of any written agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:

(1) A certification that neither the party nor its principals has received or will receive any money or other consideration
in excess of the legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in preparing and prosecuting the application, petition
to deny, informal objection or other pleading in exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition
to deny, informal objection or other pleading, or threat to file a pleading, except that this provision does not apply
to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to 

bona fide

 merger agreements;

(2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or promised;

(3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks reimbursement; and

(4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal
objection or other pleading or threat to file a pleading.

(b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant's or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining
party to any written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:

(1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals has paid or will pay money or other consideration
in excess of the legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for withdrawing or dismissing the application,
petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading; and

(2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal
objection or other pleading.

(c) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing
a petition to deny, informal objection, or any other pleading against an application. For the purposes of this section,
reimbursement by an applicant of the legitimate and prudent expenses of a potential petitioner or objector, incurred
reasonably and directly in preparing to file a petition to deny, will not be considered to be payment for refraining
from filing a petition to deny or an informal objection. Payments made directly to a potential petitioner or objector,
or a person related to a potential petitioner or objector, to implement non-financial promises are prohibited unless
specifically approved by the FCC.

(d) For the purposes of this section:

(1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by the filing party, if an individual, a partner having
personal knowledge of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge of the facts, if a corporation
or association.

(2) Applications, petitions to deny, informal objections and other pleadings are deemed to be pending before the
FCC from the time the application or petition to deny is filed with the FCC until such time as an order of the FCC granting,
denying or dismissing the application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading is no longer subject
to reconsideration by the FCC or to review by any court.

(3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing,
prosecuting and/or settling its application, petition to deny, informal objection or other pleading for which reimbursement
is sought.

(4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets
or the provision of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that confer any type of benefit
on the recipient.



 22.130 

Petitions to deny, responsive pleadings.



Petitions to deny any major filing may be filed by parties able to demonstrate standing to file such petitions. Responsive
pleadings to such petitions may be filed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(a) 

Content and requirements.

 Petitions to deny and responsive pleadings must:

<TEXT>
 

(1) Clearly identify the pertinent major filing(s); 

(2) Comply with all applicable requirements of  1.41 through  1.52 of this chapter; 

(3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, are supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which are sufficient to demonstrate that
the petitioner (or respondent) is a party in interest and that a grant or other FCC action regarding the major filing
would be inconsistent with the public interest; 

(4) Be filed within 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the major filing; and. 

(5) Contain a certificate of service showing that a copy has been mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing
with the FCC. 

(b) 

Expansion

. Petitions to deny a major amendment to an application may raise only matters directly related to the major amendment
that could not have been raised in connection with the application as originally filed. This paragraph does not apply
to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment. 

(c) 

Dismissal

. The FCC may, by letter, dismiss any petition to deny a major filing if the petition does not comply with the requirements
of this section, if the issues raised become moot, or if the petitioner or his/her attorney fails to appear at a settlement
conference pursuant to  22.135. The reason(s) for the dismissal are stated in the letter. When a petition to
deny is dismissed, any related responsive pleadings are also dismissed. 



 22.131 


Mutually exclusive applications. 



Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant of one application would effectively preclude
the grant of one or more of the others under the rules governing the Public Mobile service involved. 

(a) 

Procedures

. Procedures for disposing of mutually exclusive applications are prescribed in the subparts of this part governing
the individual Public Mobile Services and in part 1 of this chapter. The FCC may first dismiss any applications that
are untimely filed or otherwise subject to dismissal under  22.128. If any remaining applications continue
to be mutually exclusive, the FCC may grant one of the mutually exclusive applications and dismiss the rest pursuant
to  22.128. In selecting the application to grant, the FCC may use competitive bidding, random selection processes
or comparative hearings, depending on the nature of the mutually exclusive applications involved. 

(b) 

Separate applications

. Applicants that file an application, knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications, should
not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for other channels of facilities that would not, by themselves,
render the application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels
or facilities should be filed in a separate application. 



 22.132 


Grant of applications. 



Applications for authorization may be granted thirty days after the issuance date of a Public Notice listing an application
or the latest filed major amendment thereto as acceptable for filing. 

(a) 

Criteria for grants

. The FCC grants applications without a hearing if, after examination of the application and consideration of any
petitions or other pleadings and of such other matters as it may officially notice, the FCC finds that: 

(1) A grant will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity; 

(2) There are no substantial and material questions of fact presented; 

(3) The applicant is eligible and qualified under applicable FCC regulations and policies; 

(4) The application is acceptable for filing, and complies with the FCC rules and other applicable requirements;


(5) The application has not been designated for a hearing after being selected in a random selection process; 

(6) There are no applications entitled to comparative consideration with the application being granted; and 

(7) Operation of the proposed station would not cause interference to any authorized station(s). 

(b) 

Grant of petitioned applications

. The FCC may grant, without a formal hearing, applications against which petitions to deny has been filed. If any petition(s)
to deny are pending (i.e. have not been dismissed pursuant to  22.130(c) or withdrawn by the petitioner) when
an application is granted, the FCC denies the petition(s) and issues a concise statement of the reason(s) for the denial,
disposing of all substantive issues raised in the petitions. 

(c) 

Partial and conditional grants

. The FCC may grant applications in part, and/or subject to conditions other than those normally applied to authorizations
of the same type. When the FCC does this, it will inform the applicant of the reasons therefor. Such partial or conditional
grants are final unless the FCC revises its action in response to a petition for reconsideration. Such petitions for
reconsideration must be filed by the applicant within thirty days after the date of the letter or order stating the
reasons for the partial or conditional grant, and must reject the partial or conditional grant and return the instrument
of authorization. 

(d) 

Designation for hearing

. The FCC may designate applications for a hearing, specifying with particularity the matters in issue, if, after
consideration of the application, any petitions or other pleadings, and other matters which it may officially notice,
the FCC is unable to make one or more of the findings listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The FCC may grant, deny or
take other action with respect to applications designated for a hearing. 



 22.135 


Settlement conference. 



Parties are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution procedures to settle disputes (see subpart E of part
1 of this chapter). In any contested proceeding, the FCC, in its discretion, may direct the parties or their attorneys
to appear before it for a conference. 

(a) The purposes of such conferences are: 

(1) To obtain admissions of fact or stipulations between the parties as to any or all of the matters in controversy;


(2) To consider the necessity for or desirability of amendments to the pleadings, or of additional pleadings or evidentiary
submissions; 

(3) To consider simplification or narrowing of the issues; 

(4) To encourage settlement of the matters in controversy by agreement between the parties; and 

(5) To consider other matters that may aid in the resolution of the contested proceeding.

(b) Conferences are scheduled by the FCC at a time and place it may designate, to be conducted in person or by telephone
conference call.

(c) The failure of any party or attorney, following reasonable notice, to appear at a scheduled conference will be
deemed a failure to prosecute, subjecting that party's application or petition to dismissal by the FCC pursuant to
 22.128(c) or  22.130(c).



 22.137

Assignment of authorization; transfer of control.



Authorizations in the Public Mobile Services may be assigned by the licensee to another party, voluntarily or involuntarily,
directly or indirectly, or by transfer of control of a licensee holding such authorizations, only upon approval by
the FCC. The assignee is responsible for ascertaining that the station facilities are and will remain in compliance
with the terms and conditions of the authorization to be assigned.

(a) 

Application required.

 The assignor or transferor must file an application for approval of assignment or transfer of control (FCC Form 490).
In the case of involuntary assignment, such application must be filed no later than 30 days after the event causing
the assignment. The assignee or transferee must file a report qualifying it as a common carrier (FCC Form 430) unless
a current report is already on file with the FCC.

(b) 

Notification of completion. 

Assignments and transfers of control must be completed within 60 days of FCC approval. The assignee or transferee
must notify the FCC by letter of the date of completion of the assignment or transfer of control. If an assignment or
transfer of control is not completed within this time, the assignor or transferor must so notify the FCC by letter,
and the assignee or transferee must submit the authorization(s) to the FCC for cancellation or request an extension
of time to complete the assignment or transfer of control. If the assignment or transfer of control is not completed,
the authorization(s) remain with the assignor or transferor.

(c) 

Partial assignment of authorization. 

If the authorization for some, but not all, of the facilities of a Public Mobile Services station is assigned to another
party, voluntarily or involuntarily, such action is a partial assignment of authorization.

(1) To request FCC approval of a partial assignment of authorization, the following must be filed in addition to the
forms required by paragraph (a) of this section:

(i) The assignor must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) of the facilities to be deleted from its authorization upon completion
of the assignment.

(ii) The assignee must apply for authority (FCC Form 401) to operate a new station including the facilities for which
authorization is assigned, or to modify the assignee's existing station to include the facilities for which authorization
was assigned.

(2) Partial assignments must be completed within 60 days of FCC approval. If an approved partial assignment is not
completed within this time, the assignor must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489), and the assignee must submit the authorization(s)
to the FCC for cancellation or request an extension of time to complete the assignment. If the assignment is not completed,
the authorization(s) remain with the assignor.

(d) 

Limitations. 

The FCC may deny applications for assignment of authorization or consent to transfer of control if:

(1) The FCC is unable to make the findings contained in  22.132(a) with respect to both parties to the assignment
or transfer;

(2) The authorization was obtained for the principal purpose of speculation or profitable resale, rather than provision
of common carrier telecommunication services to the public; or,

(3) The authorization is for a commercial aviation system in the Air-ground Radiotelephone Service or an unserved
area cellular system in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service and the system has not been constructed or operated,
or has been operated for less than one year.

(i) Licensees must not enter into agreements (e.g. option agreements or management contracts) to assign authorizations
before or during the first year of operation, even if the assignment is to take place after the first year of operation.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) Notwithstanding the introductory texts of paragraphs (d) and (d)(3) of this section, the FCC may grant applications
for 

pro forma

 assignments during the first year of operation.



 22.139 

Trafficking.



Carriers must not obtain or attempt to obtain an authorization in the Public Mobile services for the principal purpose
of speculation or profitable resale of the authorization, but rather for the provision of common carrier telecommunication
services to the public.

(a) Applications for approval of assignment of authorization may be reviewed by the FCC to determine if the circumstances
indicate trafficking in Public Mobile services authorizations.

(b) The FCC may require submission of an affirmative, factual showing, supported by affidavit of persons with personal
knowledge thereof, to demonstrate that the assignor did not acquire the authorization for the principal purpose
of speculation or profitable resale of the authorization. This showing may include, for example, a demonstration
that the proposed assignment is due to changed circumstances (described in detail) affecting the licensee after
the grant of the authorization, or that the proposed assignment is incidental to a sale of other facilities or a merger
of interests.



 22.142 

Commencement of service; notification requirement.



Stations must begin providing service to subscribers no later than the date of required commencement of service specified
on the authorization. If service to subscribers has not begun by the date of required commencement of service, the
authorization terminates, in whole or in part, without action by the FCC, pursuant to  21.144. Additional requirements
for construction of facilities apply to cellular systems (see  22.946) and commercial aviation air-ground
systems (see  22.873).

(a) 

Construction period.

 The period between the date of grant of an authorization and the date of required commencement of service is referred
to as the construction period. The terms of construction periods are given in the subparts of this part governing each
Public Mobile Service.

(b) 

Notification requirement.

 Licensees must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) of commencement of service to subscribers. The notification must be mailed
or delivered to the filing place (see  22.106) no later than 15 days after service begins.

(1) The notification must state whether the station was constructed exactly as authorized or with minor changes.

(2) If service to subscribers has begun using some, but not all, of the authorized transmitters, the notification
must show to which specific transmitters it applies. Additional notifications must be filed if and when other transmitters
commence providing service to subscribers. If the licensee no longer intends to construct and/or operate the remaining
authorized transmitters, the notification should so state.

(3) This section does not require licensees to notify the FCC of facilities added or modified pursuant to the provisions
of   22.163 and 22.165. It applies only to facilities specifically listed in authorizations for which
a construction period is provided.

(c) 

Requests for extension.

 Before the date of required commencement of service, licensees may file an application (FCC Form 401) requesting
an extension of the construction period.

(1) The FCC may grant applications for extension of the construction period if the licensee shows that failure to commence
providing service to subscribers is due to causes beyond its control.

(2) The FCC does not grant applications for extension of the construction period if failure to commence providing
service to subscribers is due to delays caused by lack of financing, failure to obtain an antenna site, or failure to
order equipment in a timely manner. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days of authorization grant, a presumption
of diligence is created.

(3) The FCC does not grant applications for extension of the construction period if the licensee fails to commence
providing service to subscribers because it intends to assign the authorization. The FCC does not grant applications
for extension of the construction period solely to allow an assignee to complete facilities the assignor failed to
construct.

(d) 

Automatic extension for relocation.

 If, prior to the end of the construction period, a licensee files an application (FCC Form 401) to relocate a transmitter
because of involuntary loss of the proposed site or for other reasons due to causes beyond the licensee's control,
the construction period is automatically extended pending disposition of that application.

(1) Extension of the construction period for one transmitter under this paragraph does not extend the construction
period for other transmitter under the same authorization that are not to be relocated.

(2) The filing of applications for modifications other than involuntary relocation does not automatically extend
the construction period.



 22.143 

Construction prior to grant of application.



Applicants may construct facilities in the Public Mobile services prior to grant of their applications, subject
to the provisions of this section, but must not operate such facilities until the FCC grants an authorization. If the
conditions stated in this section are not met, applicants must not begin to construct facilities in the Public Mobile
Services.

(a) 

When applicants may begin construction.

 An applicant may begin construction of a facility 35 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the application
for that facility as acceptable for filing, except that an applicant whose application to operate a new cellular system
was selected in a random selection process may begin construction of that new cellular system 35 days after the date
of the Public Notice listing it as the tentative selectee.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Notification to stop.

 If the FCC for any reason determines that construction should not be started or should be stopped while an application
is pending, and so notifies the applicant, orally (followed by written confirmation) or in writing, the applicant
must not begin construction or, if construction has begun, must stop construction immediately.
(c) 

Assumption of risk.

 Applicants that begin construction pursuant to this section before receiving an authorization do so at their own
risk and have no recourse against the United States for any losses resulting from:
(1) Applications that are not granted;
(2) Errors or delays in issuing Public Notices;
(3) Having to alter, relocate or dismantle the facility; or
(4) Incurring whatever costs may be necessary to bring the facility into compliance with applicable laws, or FCC rules
and orders.
(d) 

Conditions.

 Except as indicated, all pre-grant construction is subject to the following conditions:
(1) The application is not mutually exclusive with any other application, except for successful bidders and tentative
selectees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service;
(2) No petitions to deny the application have been filed;
(3) The application does not include a request for a waiver of one or more FCC rules;
(4) For any construction or alteration that would exceed the requirements of  17.7 of this chapter, the licensee
has notified the appropriate Regional Office of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Form 7460-1), filed
a request for antenna height clearance and obstruction marking and lighting specifications (FCC Form 854) with the
FCC, PRB, Support Services Branch, Gettysburg, PA 17325;
(5) The applicant has indicated in the application that the proposed facility would not have a significant environmental
effect, in accordance with   1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter; and,
(6) Under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, individual coordination of the proposed channel
assignment(s) with a foreign administration is not required.


 22.144 

Termination of authorizations.


Authorizations in the Public Mobile Services remain valid until terminated in accordance with this section, except
that the FCC may revoke an authorization pursuant to section 312 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C.
312).
(a) 

Expiration.

 Authorizations automatically terminate, without specific FCC action, on the expiration date specified therein,
unless a timely application for renewal is filed (see  22.145). No authorization granted under the provisions
of this part shall be for a longer term than ten years. See 47 U.S.C. 307(c).
(b) 

Failure to commence providing service to subscribers.

 Authorizations automatically terminate, in whole or in part, without specific FCC action, on the date of required
commencement of service, if service to subscribers is not commenced by that date (see  22.142), except as provided
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(1) Authorizations do not terminate while a timely filed application for extension of the construction period is
pending (see  22.142(c)).
(2) If a timely filed application for extension of the construction period is dismissed or denied, the authorization
automatically terminates, in whole or in part, without specific FCC action, on the day after the applicant or the applicant's
attorney is notified of the FCC's action dismissing or denying the application for extension of the construction
period.
(c) 

Service discontinued.

 Authorizations automatically terminate, without specific FCC action, if service is permanently discontinued
as provided in  22.317.
(d) 

STAs.

 Special Temporary Authorizations (STAs) automatically terminate, without specific FCC action, at the end of the
period specified therein, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or upon failure to comply with the
terms and conditions therein.
(1) STAs do not terminate while a timely filed request for an extension of the STA term, in accordance with  22.125(b),
is pending.
(2) If a timely filed request for extension of the STA term is dismissed or denied, the STA automatically terminates,
without specific FCC action, on the day after the applicant or the applicant's attorney is notified of the FCC's action
dismissing or denying the request for extension.
(e) 

Cancellation.

 Authorizations submitted by licensees for cancellation terminate when the FCC gives Public Notice of such action.


 22.145 

Renewal application procedures.


Applications for renewal (FCC Form 405) of expiring authorizations must be filed by the licensee prior to, but no earlier
than 30 days before, the expiration date of the authorization. A separate application is required for each authorization
(call sign). Competing applications from parties wishing to challenge the renewal must be filed during the same 30
day period. Additional renewal requirements applicable only to specific Public Mobile Services are set forth in
the subparts governing those services.

 22.150

Standard pre-filing technical coordination procedure.



For operations on certain channels in the Public Mobile Services, carriers must attempt to coordinate the proposed
use of spectrum with other spectrum users prior to filing an application for authority to operate a station. Rules
requiring this procedure for specific channels and types of stations are contained in the subparts governing the
individual Public Mobile Services.

(a) Coordination comprises two steps_notification and response. Each step may be accomplished orally or in writing.

(b) Notification must include relevant technical details of the proposal. At minimum, this should include the following:

(1) Geographical coordinates of the antenna site(s).

(2) Transmitting and receiving channels to be added or changed.

(3) Transmitting power, emission type and polarization.

(4) Transmitting antenna pattern and maximum gain.

(5) Transmitting antenna height above ground level.

(c) Applicants and licensees receiving notification must respond promptly, even if no channel usage conflicts are
anticipated. If any notified party fails to respond within 30 days, the applicant may file the application without
a response from that party. 

(d) The 30-day period begins on the date of receipt of the notification by the party being notified. If the notification
is by mail, this date may be ascertained by:

(1) The return receipt on certified mail,

(2) The enclosure of a card to be dated and returned by the party being notified, or 

(3) A reasonable estimate of the time required for the mail to reach its destination. In this case, the date when the
30-day period will expire must be stated in the notification.

(e) All channel usage conflicts discovered during the coordination process should be resolved prior to filing of
the application. If the applicant is unable or unwilling to resolve a particular conflict, the application may be
accepted for filing if it contains a statement describing the unresolved conflict and a brief explanation of the reasons
why a resolution was not achieved.

(f) If a number of changes in the technical parameters of a proposed facility become necessary during the course of
the coordination process, an attempt should be made to minimize the number of separate notifications. If the changes
are incorporated into a completely revised notice, the items that were changed from the previous notice should be
identified.

(g) In situations where subsequent changes are not numerous or complex, the party receiving the changed notification
should make an effort to respond in less than 30 days. If the applicant believes a shorter response time is reasonable
and appropriate, it should so indicate in the notice and suggest a response date.

(h) If a subsequent change in the technical parameters of a proposed facility could not affect the facilities of one
or more of the parties that received an initial notification, the applicant is not required to coordinate that change
with these parties. However, these parties must be advised of the change and of the opinion that coordination is not
required.



 22.157

Distance computation.



The method given in this section must be used to compute the distance between any two locations, except that, for computation
of distance involving stations in Canada and Mexico, methods for distance computation specified in the applicable
international agreement, if any, must be used instead. The method set forth in this paragraph is considered to be sufficiently
accurate for distances not exceeding 475 km (295 miles).

(a) Convert the latitudes and longitudes of each reference point from degree-minute-second format to degree-decimal
format by dividing minutes by 60 and seconds by 3600, then adding the results to degrees.








(b) Calculate the mean geodetic latitude between the two reference points by averaging the two latitudes:










(c) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree latitude difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated
in paragraph (b) of this section as follows:












(d) Calculate the number of kilometers per degree of longitude difference for the mean geodetic latitude calculated
in paragraph (b) of this section as follows:










(e) Calculate the North-South distance in kilometers as follows:









(f) Calculate the East-West distance in kilometers as follows:








(g) Calculate the distance between the locations by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the East-West
and North-South distances:











(h) Terms used in this section are defined as follows:

(1) LAT1

dd

 and LON1

dd

 are the coordinates of the first location in degree-decimal format.
(2) LAT2

dd

 and LON2

dd

 are the coordinates of the second location in degree-decimal format.

(3) ML is the mean geodetic latitude in degree-decimal format.

(4) KPD

lat

 is the number of kilometers per degree of latitude at a given mean geodetic latitude.

(5) KPD

lon

 is the number of kilometers per degree of longitude at a given mean geodetic latitude.

(6) NS is the North-South distance in kilometers.

(7) DIST is the distance between the two locations, in kilometers.


 22.159


Computation of average terrain elevation.


Average terrain elevation must be calculated by computer using elevations from a 30 second point or better topographic
data file. The file must be identified. If a 30 second point data file is used, the elevation data must be processed for
intermediate points using interpolation techniques; otherwise, the nearest point may be used. In cases of dispute,
average terrain elevation determinations can also be done manually, if the results differ significantly from the
computer derived averages.
(a) Radial average terrain elevation is calculated as the average of the elevation along a straight line path from
3 to 16 kilometers (2 and 10 miles) extending radially from the antenna site. If a portion of the radial path extends
over foreign territory or water, such portion must not be included in the computation of average elevation unless
the radial path again passes over United States land between 16 and 134 kilometers (10 and 83 miles) away from the station.
At least 50 evenly spaced data points for each radial should be used in the computation.
(b) Average terrain elevation is the average of the eight radial average terrain elevations (for the eight cardinal
radials).
(c) For locations in Dade and Broward Counties, Florida, the method prescribed above may be used or average terrain
elevation may be assumed to be 3 meters (10 feet).






 22.161


Application requirements for ASSB.


Applications for base stations employing amplitude compandored single sideband modulation (ASSB) must contain
the following information:
(a) The application must describe fully the modulation characteristics, emission and occupied bandwidth, and specify
the center frequency of the emission for each channel, carrier frequency, and pilot channels, if any. The emission
must fall completely within a channel assignable for two-way operation in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service,
Rural Radiotelephone Service or Offshore Radiotelephone Service.
(b) The application must contain interference studies between stations within an authorized bandwidth, whether
FM-to-ASSB, ASSB-to-FM, or ASSB-to-ASSB in accordance with the following: For ASSB stations, the transmitter nearest
to the protected station must be used. The effective radiated power in the direction of the protected station must
be the sum of the peak effective radiated power of all transmitters in the group, in the direction of the protected station.
The antenna center of radiation height above average terrain must be the highest antenna center of radiation height
of any transmitter in the group in the direction of the protected station. The channel of the group is assumed to be the
same as that of the protected station (co-channel), and studies must be made in accordance with  22.567.








 22.163


Minor modifications to existing stations.


Licensees may make modifications to existing stations without obtaining prior Commission approval provided:
(a) 

Classification as minor

. The modifications must be minor. Modifications to a station are minor if an application filed solely for the purpose
of obtaining authorization for such modifications would not be classified as major in accordance with  22.123.
(b) 

International coordination

. The modifications are limited to those for which individual coordination of the channel assignment(s) with a foreign
administration, under applicable international agreements and rules in this part, is not required.

shall cooperate in the selection and use of channels in order to minimize interference and obtain the most efficient
use of the allocated spectrum.


 22.352

Protection from interference.


Public Mobile Services stations operating in full accordance with applicable FCC rules and the terms and conditions
of their authorizations are normally considered to be non-interfering. If the FCC determines, however, that interference
which significantly interrupts or degrades a radio service is being caused, it may, after notice and an opportunity
for a hearing, require modifications to any Public Mobile station as necessary to eliminate such interference.
(a) 

Failure to operate as authorized. 

Any licensee causing interference to the service of other stations by failing to operate its station in full accordance
with its authorization and applicable FCC rules shall discontinue all transmissions, except those necessary for
the immediate safety of life or property, until it can bring its station into full compliance with the authorization
and rules.
(b) 

Intermodulation interference. 

Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means.
(c) 

Situations in which no protection is afforded. 

Except as provided elsewhere in this part, no protection from interference is afforded in the following situations:
(1) 

Interference to base receivers from base or fixed transmitters. 

Licensees should attempt to resolve such interference by technical means or operating arrangements.
(2) 

Inteference to mobile receivers from mobile transmitters. 

No protection is provided against mobile-to-mobile interference.
(3) 

Interference to base receivers from mobile transmitters. 

No protection is provided against mobile-to-base interference.

Blanketing interference.


Licensees of Public Mobile Services stations are responsible for resolving cases of blanketing interference in
accordance with the provisions of this section.


(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, licensees must resolve any cases of blanketing interference
in their area of responsibility caused by operation of their transmitter(s) during a one-year period following commencement
of service from new or modified transmitter(s). Interference must be resolved promptly at no cost to the complainant.
(b) The area of responsibility is that area in the immediate vicinity of the transmitting antenna of stations where
the field strength of the electromagnetic radiation from such stations equals or exceeds 115 dB u V/m. To determine
the radial distance to the boundary of this area, the following formula must be used:







where d is the radial distance to the boundary, in kilometers
p is the radial effective radiated power, in kilowatts



The maximum effective radiated power in the pertinent direction, without consideration of the antenna's vertical
radiation pattern or height, must be used in the formula.




(c) Licensees are not required to resolve blanketing interference to mobile receivers or non-RF devices or blanketing
interference occurring as a result of malfunctioning or mistuned receivers, improperly installed consumer antenna
systems, or the use of high gain antennas or antenna booster amplifiers by consumers.
(d) Licensees that install transmitting antennas at a location where there are already one or more transmitting antennas
are responsible for resolving any new cases of blanketing interference in accordance with this section.
(e) Two or more licensees that concurrently install transmitting antennas at the same location are jointly responsible
for resolving blanketing interference cases, unless the FCC can readily determine which station is causing the interference,
in which case the licensee of that station is held fully responsible.

(b) 

Table Mountain. 

The requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible interference at the Table Mountain Radio Receiving
Zone of the Research Laboratories of the Department of Commerce located in Boulder County, Colorado.




(1) Carriers planning to construct and operate a new or modified Public Mobile Services station at a permanent fixed
location in the vicinity of Boulder County, Colorado are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications,
to the need to protect the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone from interference. To prevent degradation of the present
ambient radio signal level at the site, the Department of Commerce seeks to ensure that the field strengths of any radiated
signals (excluding reflected signals) received on this 1800 acre site (in the vicinity of coordinates 40
 07
'50
'
' North Latitude, 105
 14
'40
'
' West Longitude) resulting from new assignments (other than mobile stations) or from the modification or
relocation of existing facilities do not exceed the values given in Table C-3 of this section.







(2) Advance consultation is recommended, particularly for applicants that have no reliable data to indicate whether
the field strength or power flux density figures in the above table would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities.
In general, coordination is recommended for:

(i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles);

(ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) transmitting with 50 watts or more effective radiated power
(ERP) in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the Table Mountain Radio Receiving Zone;

of Commerce, Research Support Services NOAAR/E5X2, Boulder Laboratories, Boulder, CO 80303; telephone (303) 497-6548,
in advance of filing their applications with the FCC.

(4) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether advance consultation has taken place. However, such
consultation may avoid the filing of objections from the Department of Commerce or institution of proceedings to
modify the authorizations of stations that radiate signals with a field strength or power flux density at the site
in excess of those specified herein.


(c) 

Federal Communications Commission protected field offices.

 The requirements of this paragraph are intended to minimize possible interference to FCC monitoring activities.


(1) Carriers planning to construct and operate a new or modified Public Mobile Services station at a permanent fixed
location in the vicinity of an FCC protected field office are advised to give consideration, prior to filing applications,
to the need to avoid interfering with the monitoring activities of that office. FCC protected field offices are listed
in  0.121 of this chapter.

(2) Applications for stations (except mobile stations) that could produce on any channel a direct wave fundamental
field strength of greater than 10 mV/m (^65.8 dBW/m2 power flux density assuming a free space characteristic impedance
of 120
 

V

) in the authorized bandwidth at the protected field office may be examined to determine the potential for interference
with monitoring activities. After consideration of the effects of the predicted field strength of the proposed station,
including the cumulative effects of the signal from the proposed station with other ambient radio field strength
levels at the protected field office, the FCC may add a condition restricting radiation toward the protected field
office to the station authorization.

(3) In the event that the calculated field strength exceeds 10 mV/m at the protected field office site, or if there is
any question whether field strength levels might exceed that level, advance consultation with the FCC to discuss
possible measures to avoid interference to monitoring activities should be considered. Prospective applicants
may communicate with: Chief, Field Operations Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.

(4) Advance consultation is recommended for applicants that have no reliable data to indicate whether the field strength
or power flux density figure indicated would be exceeded by their proposed radio facilities. In general, coordination
is recommended for:

(i) Stations located within 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles);

(ii) Stations located within 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) with 50 watts or more average effective radiated power (ERP)
in the primary plane of polarization in the azimuthal direction of the protected field offices.

(iii) Stations located within 16 kilometers (10 miles) with 1 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization
in the azimuthal direction of the protected field office;

(iv) Stations located within 80 kilometers (50 miles) with 25 kW or more average ERP in the primary plane of polarization
in the azimuthal direction of the protected field office;

(5) Advance coordination for stations transmitting on channels above 1000 MHz is recommended only if the proposed
station is in the vicinity of a protected field office designated as a satellite monitoring facility in  0.121
of this chapter.

(6) The FCC will not screen applications to determine whether advance consultation has taken place. However, such
consultation may serve to avoid the need for later modification of the authorizations of stations that interfere
with monitoring activities at protected field offices.

Subpart D_Developmental Authorizations



 22.401 

Description and purposes of developmental authorizations.



Communications common carriers may apply for, and the FCC may grant, authority to construct and operate one or more
transmitters subject to the rules in this subpart and other limitations, waivers and/or conditions that may be prescribed.
Authorizations granted on this basis are developmental authorizations. In general, the FCC grants developmental
authorizations in situations and circumstances where it cannot reasonably be determined in advance whether a particular
transmitter can be operated or a particular service can be provided without causing interference to the service of
existing stations. For example, the FCC may grant developmental authorizations for:

(a) Field strength surveys to evaluate the technical suitability of antenna locations for stations in the Public
Mobile Services;

(b) Experimentation leading to the potential development of a new Public Mobile Service or technology; or,

(c) Stations transmitting on channels in certain frequency ranges, to provide a trial period during which it can be
individually determined whether such stations can operate without causing excessive interference to existing
services. 



 22.403 

General limitations.



The provisions and requirements of this section are applicable to all developmental authorizations. 

(a) Developmental authorizations are granted subject to the condition that they may be cancelled by the FCC at any
time, upon notice to the licensee, and without the opportunity for a hearing. 

(b) Except as otherwise indicated in this subpart, developmental authorizations normally terminate one year from
the date of grant. The FCC may, however, specify a different term. 

(c) Stations operating under developmental authorizations must not interfere with the services of regularly authorized
stations. 

(d) A grant of a developmental authorization does not provide any assurance that the FCC will grant an application
for regular authorization to operate the same transmitter(s), even if operation during the developmental period
has not caused interference and/or the developmental program is successful. 



 22.409 

Developmental authorization for a new Public Mobile Service or technology. 



The FCC may grant applications for developmental authority to construct and operate transmitters for the purpose
of developing a new Public Mobile Service or a new technology not regularly authorized under this part, subject to
the requirements of this section. Such applications may request the use of any portion of the spectrum allocated for
Public Mobile Services in the Table of Frequency Allocations contained in part 2 of this chapter, regardless of whether
that spectrum is regularly available under this part. Requests to use any portion of the spectrum for a service or purpose
other than that indicated in the Table of Frequency Allocations in part 2 of this chapter may be made only in accordance
with the provisions of part 5 of this chapter. 

(a) 

Preliminary determination. 

The FCC will make a preliminary determination with respect to the factors in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this
section before acting on an application for developmental authority pursuant to this section. These factors are:


(1) That the public interest, convenience or necessity warrants consideration of the establishment of the proposed
service or technology; 

(2) That the proposal appears to have potential value to the public that could warrant the establishment of the new
service or technology;

(3) That some operational data should be developed for consideration in any rule making proceeding which may be initiated
to establish such service or technology. 

(b) 

Petition required. 

Applications for developmental authorizations pursuant to this section must be accompanied by a petition for rule
making requesting the FCC to amend its rules as may be necessary to provide for the establishment of the proposed service
or technology. 

(c) 

Application requirements. 

Authorizations for developmental authority pursuant to this section will be issued only upon a showing that the applicant
has a definite program of research and development which has reasonable promise of substantial contribution to the
services authorized by this part. The application must contain an exhibit demonstrating the applicant's technical
qualifications to conduct the research and development program, including a description of the nature and extent
of engineering facilities that the applicant has available for such purpose. Additionally, the FCC may, in its discretion,
require a showing of financial qualification. 

(d) 

Communication service for hire prohibited. 

Stations authorized under developmental authorizations granted pursuant to this section must not be used to provide
communication service for hire, unless otherwise specifically authorized by the FCC.

(e) 

 Adherence to program. 

Carriers granted developmental authorization pursuant to this section must substantially adhere to the program
of research and development described in their application for developmental authorization, unless the FCC directs
otherwise. 

(f) 

Report requirements. 

Upon completion of the program of research and development, or upon the expiration of the developmental authorization
under which such program was permitted, or at such times during the term of the station authorization as the FCC may
deem necessary to evaluate the progress of the developmental program, the licensee shall submit a comprehensive
report, containing:

(1) A description of the progress of the program and a detailed analysis of any result obtained;

(2) Copies of any publications produced by the program;

Normally, applications and developmental reports are a part of the FCC's public records. However, an applicant or
licensee may request that the FCC withhold from public records specific exhibits, reports and other material associated
with a developmental authorization.

(h) 

Renewal. 

Expiring developmental authorizations issued pursuant to this section may be renewed if the carrier_

(1) Shows that further progress in the program of research and development requires additional time to operate under
developmental authorization;

(2) Complied with the reporting requirements of paragraph (e) of this section; and,

(3) Immediately resolved to the FCC's satisfaction all complaints of interference caused by the station operating
under developmental authority.



 22.411 

Developmental authorization of 43 MHz paging transmitters.



Because of the potential for interference to the intermediate frequency stages of receivers in broadcast television
sets and video recorders, 43 MHz paging channels are assigned only under developmental authorizations subject to
the requirements of this section, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

(a) 

Carrier responsibility. 

Carriers so authorized shall operate the 43 MHz paging service under developmental authority for a period of two years.
During the two year developmental period, carriers must resolve any broadcast television receiver intermediate
frequency interference problems that may occur as a result of operation of the 43 MHz paging transmitter(s). Carriers
shall inform subscribers receiving service on the channels assigned under developmental authority during the developmental

(b) 

Periodic surveys. 

To determine the extent of any interference to broadcast television receivers resulting from operation of 43 MHz
paging stations authorized pursuant to this section, carriers shall conduct semi-annual surveys during the first
two years of operation. The first such survey is to begin on the date when service to subscribers commences. For each
survey, the carrier shall contact at least 25 television viewers to determine whether they have experienced interference.

(1) The carrier shall contact viewers located throughout the geographic area encompassed by a 3 kilometer (2 mile)
radius of the 43 MHz paging transmitter antenna site. The carrier must not attempt to obtain a misleading survey by
contacting only viewers less likely to be experiencing interference. For example, the carrier must not contact only
the viewers located most distant from the paging transmitter antenna site. Instead, the carrier shall contact viewers
located near the paging transmitter antenna site.

(2) The carrier shall not, in subsequent surveys, contact viewers who were contacted in a previous survey; provided
that, in the event that all of the viewers within 3 kilometers (2 miles) have been contacted, viewers located near the
paging transmitter antenna site shall be contacted again.

(c) 

Periodic reports. 

Following each survey, the carrier shall submit to the FCC a written report disclosing and evaluating the extent of
any interference. These reports must include:

(1) The number of the report (1 to 4);

(2) The station call sign;

(3) The file number of the application that resulted in the developmental authorization;

(4) An exact description of the transmitter location(s);

(5) The date(s) and time of day when the survey was conducted;

(6) The survey method used (e.g. telephone, on-site, etc.);

(7) The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the viewers contacted;

(8) If interference resulted from operation of the 43 MHz paging station, a summary of how the interference problem
was resolved;

(9) The names and telephone numbers of any technical personnel consulted and/or employed to resolve interference
problems.

(d) 

Exceptions. 

The FCC may grant a regular authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service for a 43 MHz paging station in the
following circumstances:

(1) After the two-year developmental period, provided that broadcast TV interference complaints have been resolved
by the carrier in a satisfactory manner. Licensees that hold a developmental authorization for a 43 MHz paging station
and wish to request a regular authorization must file an application (FCC Form 401) prior to the expiration of the developmental
period.

(2) In the case of the assignment of or a transfer of control of a regular authorization of a 43 MHz paging station in the
Paging and Radiotelephone Service, provided that the station has been in continuous operation providing service
with no substantial interruptions.

 22.507

Number of transmitters per station.


This section concerns the number of transmitters licensed under each station authorization in the Paging and Radiotelephone
Service. Each station must have at least one transmitter. There is no limit to the number of transmitters that a station
may comprise. However, transmitters within a station should be operationally related and/or should serve the same
general geographical area. Operationally related transmitters are those that operate together as a system (e.g.
trunked systems, simulcast systems), rather than independently. Furthermore, the FCC may split wide-area systems
into two or more stations for administrative convenience. Except for nationwide paging and other operationally
related transmitters, transmitters that are widely separated geographically are not licensed under a single authorization.
The FCC may consolidate separately authorized stations upon request (FCC Form 401) of the licensee, if appropriate
under this section.







Note 

to  22.507: Notwithstanding the provisions of  22.507, until further notice there can be no more than
99 transmitters per station.


 22.511

Construction period for the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.


The construction period for stations in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service is one year.


 22.515

Permissible communications paths.


Mobile stations may communicate only with and through base stations. Base stations may communicate only with mobile
stations and receivers on land or surface vessels.


 22.529

(a) The 43 MHz channels may be assigned under developmental authorizations, pursuant to the requirements of  22.411.
(b) Channels 931.8875, 931.9125, and 931.9375 MHz may be assigned only to transmitters providing nationwide network
paging service.
(c) Upon application (FCC Form 401), common carriers may be authorized to provide one-way paging service using the
leased subcarrier facilities of broadcast stations licensed under part 73 of this chapter.
(d) Occasionally in case law and other formal and informal documents, the low VHF channels have been referred to as
``lowband'' channels, and the high VHF channels have been referred to as ``guardband'' channels.
(e) Pursuant to the U.S.-Canada Interim Coordination Considerations for 929-932 MHz, as amended, only the
following UHF channels may be assigned in the continental United States North of Line A or in the State of Alaska East
of Line C, within the indicated longitudes:
(1) From longitude W.73

in both countries:




 22.535

Effective radiated power limits.


The effective radiated power (ERP) of base transmitters operating on the channels listed in  22.531 must not
exceed the limits in this section.
(a)

(b) 

Basic power limit. 

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed 500
Watts.

(c) 

Height-power limit. 

Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of transmitters on the VHF channels must not exceed the
amount that would result in an average distance to the service contour of 32.2 kilometers (20 miles). The average distance
to the service contour is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures
specified in  22.537 for the eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for which
90% or more of the distance so calculated is over water.


(d) 

Encompassed interfering contour areas. 

Transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the area within their interfering
contours is totally encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters controlled
by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, operating transmitters are authorized transmitters that
are providing service to subscribers.

(e) 

Adjacent channel protection. 

The ERP of transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they:
(1) Transmit on a channel in the 152-159 MHz frequency range and are located less than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles)
from any station licensed in the Private Radio Services that receives on an adjacent channel; or,
(2) Transmit on channel 158.10 or 158.70 MHz and are located less than 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from any station licensed
in the Public Mobile Services that receives on either of the following adjacent channels: 158.07 MHz or 158.67 MHz.


 22.537


Technical channel assignment criteria.



The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria for the channels listed in  22.531. These
criteria permit channel assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public paging receivers of signals
from base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters, is protected from interference caused
by the operation of independent co-channel base transmitters.
(a) 

Contour overlap. 

The FCC may grant an application requesting assignment of a channel to a proposed base transmitter only if:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel
transmitter controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier has agreed in writing to accept
any interference that may result from operation of the proposed transmitter; and,

(2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap the interfering contour of any protected co-channel
transmitter controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the applicant agrees to accept any interference
that may result from operation of the protected co-channel transmitter; and,

(3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by the proposed transmitter is substantial, and
service gained would exceed that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.

(b) 

Protected transmitter.

 For the purposes of this section, protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a current
FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed pending applications.

(c) 

VHF service contour.

 For paging stations transmitting on the VHF channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour
along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:



d=1.243 x h

0.40

 x p

0.20



where d is the radial distance in kilometers

h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters

p is the radial ERP in Watts



(1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula.

(2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1
Watt, whichever is more.

(3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal
radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving
petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) of this
section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station
radial at 2.5
  intervals.

(d) 

VHF interfering contour.

 For paging stations transmitting on the VHF channels, the distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering
contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:



d=6.509 x h

0.28

 x p

0.17



where d is the radial distance in kilometers

h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters

p is the radial ERP in Watts



(1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula.

(2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction or 0.1
Watt, whichever is more.

(3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal
radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. In resolving petitions
to deny, however, the FCC may calculate the distance to the interfering contour using the formula in paragraph (d)
of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the
inter-station radial at 2.5
  intervals.

(e) 

931 MHz service contour.

 For paging stations transmitting on the 931 MHz channels, the service contour is a circle, centered on the transmitting
antenna, with a radius determined from Table E-1 of this section.

(g) 

In-building radiation systems

. The locations of in-building radiation systems must be within the service contour(s) of the licensee's authorized
transmitter(s) on the same channel. In-building radiation systems are not protected facilities, and therefore
do not have service or interfering contours.

 22.539 

Additional channel policies. 


The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for a paging channel when the applicant has applied
for or been granted an authorization for other paging channels in the same geographic area. This section applies to
applications proposing to use the channels listed in  22.531, excluding the nationwide network paging channels
and broadcast station subcarriers, or the channels listed in  22.561, where the application proposes to use
those channels to provide paging service only. The general policy of the FCC is to assign one paging channel in an area
to a carrier per application cycle. That is, a carrier must apply for one paging channel, receive the authorization,
construct the station, provide service to subscribers, and notify the FCC of commencement of service to subscribers
(FCC Form 489) before applying for an additional paging channel in that area. 
(a) 

VHF transmitters in same area. 

Any transmitter on any VHF channel listed in  22.531 is considered to be in the same geographic area as another
transmitter on any other VHF channel listed in  22.531 if: 
(1) One transmitter location is within the service area of the other transmitter; or, 
(2) the area within the overlap of the service contours of the two transmitters constitutes 50 percent or more of the
service area of either of the transmitters. 
(b) 

931 MHz transmitters in same area. 

Any transmitter on any 931 MHz channel is considered to be in the same geographic area as another transmitter on any
channel listed in  22.531 if it is located less than 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) from the transmitter. Likewise,
any transmitter on any channel listed in  22.531 is considered to be in the same geographic area as another transmitter
on any 931 MHz channel if it is located less than 64.4 kilometers (40 miles) from that transmitter. 
(c) 

Initial channel. 

The FCC will not assign more than one channel for new paging stations. Paging stations are considered to be new if there
are no authorized transmitters on any channel listed in  22.531 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic
area. 
(d) 

Additional channel. 

Applications for transmitters to be located in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the
applicant, but to operate on a different channel, are considered as requesting an additional channel for the authorized
station, unless paragraph (e) of this section applies. 
(e) 

Additional transmitters on same channel. 

Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, applications for transmitters to be located in the same geographic
area as an authorized station controlled by the applicant, and to operate on the same paging channel, are not considered
to be requests for an additional paging channel. 
(f) 

Amendment of pending application. 

If the FCC receives and accepts for filing an application for a transmitter to be located in the same geographic area
as a transmitter proposed in a pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on a different channel,
the subsequent application is considered as a major amendment to change the technical proposal of the prior application,
unless paragraph (e) applies. The filing date of any application so amended is the date the FCC received the subsequent
application. 
(g) 

Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. 

If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional channel for an authorized station prior to receiving
notification that the station is providing service to subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC may dismiss
that application without prejudice in accordance with  22.128. 


 22.541 

Procedures for mutually exclusive 931 MHz paging applications. 


Mutually exclusive 931 MHz applications are processed in accordance with the rules in this section. 
(a) 

Filing groups. 

Pending mutually exclusive applications are processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing
group are given concurrent consideration. The FCC may dismiss as defective (pursuant to  22.128) any mutually
exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range for inclusion in the filing group. The type
of filing groups used in day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A filing
group is one of the following types: 
(1) 

Renewal filing group. 

A renewal filing group comprises a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed
mutually exclusive competing applications.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) 

Same-day filing group.

 A same-day filing group comprises all mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which is
normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s).

(3) 

Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group.

 A thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is no later
than 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the filing dates)
as acceptable for filing.

(4) 

Window filing group.

 A window filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and including two specific dates, which are the first
and last dates on which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be accepted for filing. In the case
of a one-day filing window, the two dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.

(b) 

Procedures.

 Generally, the FCC may grant one application in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss other
application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by that grant, pursuant to  22.128.

(1) 

Selection methods. 

In selecting the application to grant, the FCC may use competitive biding or comparative hearings, depending on the
type of applications involved.

(2) 

Dismissal of applications. 

The FCC may dismiss any application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to dismissal under  22.128,
either before or after employing selection procedures.

(3) 

Type of filing group used.

 Except as otherwise provided in this part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more mutually exclusive
applications depends on the purpose(s) of the applications.

(i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization,
a renewal filing group is used.

(ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification and
none of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day filing group is
used.

(iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the earliest filing date are applications for initial
authorization, a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group is used.

(4) 

Disposition. 

If there is only one application in any type of filing group, the FCC may grant that application and dismiss without
prejudice any applications excluded by the grant (i.e. not in the filing group). If there is more than one mutually
exclusive application in a filing group, the FCC disposes of these applications as follows:

(i) 

Applications in a renewal filing group. 

All mutually exclusive applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative consideration in a
hearing.

(ii) 

Applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. 

(A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group are applications
for initial authorization, the FCC administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with Subpart Q of Part
1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other applications
may be dismissed without prejudice.

(B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group is an application
for modification, the FCC may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the
applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the
filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the
applications in the filing group.

(iii) 

Applications in a same-day filing group. 

If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the FCC may attempt to resolve
the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within
a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing.
In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.

(iv) 

Applications in a window filing group.

 Applications in a window filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a thirty-day notice and
cut-off filing group in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.

(c) 

Terminology.

 For the purposes of this section, terms have the following meanings:

(1) The ``filing date'' of an application is the date on which that application was received in a condition acceptable
for filing or the date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that application was received, whichever
is later, excluding major amendments in the following circumstances:

(i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control found by the FCC to be in the public interest;
or, 

(ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found unacceptable for filing.

(2) An ``application for initial authorization'' is:

(i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new station;

(ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing station to operate on an additional channel;

(iii) Any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
from any existing transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel.

(3) An ``application for modification'' is any application other than an application for initial authorization
or renewal.



 22.551

Nationwide network paging service.



The rules in this section govern the application for and provision of nationwide network paging service on the channels
reserved specifically for such service in  22.531(b).

(a) 

Nationwide network organizers.

 If and when a nationwide network paging channel becomes available for assignment, the FCC will issue a Public Notice
inviting applications from carriers seeking to organize a nationwide network paging service. The Public Notice
will provide complete details regarding application requirements and procedures.

(c) 

Affiliated local carriers.

 Parties seeking to become affiliated local carriers in a nationwide network paging service must have specific completed
contracts with the network organizer with which they are proposing to affiliate. Applications may contain a letter,
in lieu of the contracts, indicating that the applicant has a completed contract with the organizer. 

(d) 

Liability for technical operation.

 Nationwide network organizers and affiliated local carriers are jointly and severally liable for the technical
operation of the local network stations. 



 22.559

One-way paging application requirements.



In addition to information required by Subparts b and d of this part and  22.529, applications for authorization
to operate a paging transmitter on the channels listed in  22.531 must contain the applicable supplementary
information described in this section. 

(a) 

Interference exhibit.

 Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with  22.537 with
regard to protected transmitters is required for applications to operate a transmitter on the VHF channels. This
exhibit must:

(1) Identify each protected transmitter located within 109 kilometers (68 miles) of the proposed transmitter in
directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles) or less, and within 178
kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour
exceeds 76.5 kilometers (47.5 miles).

(2) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of distance calculations indicating that there
would be no overlap of service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the licensee of or applicant
for the protected transmitter and/or the applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any interference
resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter. 

(b) 

Encompassment exhibit.

 An exhibit showing that the area within the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally encompassed
by interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications
to operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-power limits of  22.535. For VHF transmitters,
this encompassment exhibit may substitute for the interference exhibit required in paragraph (a) of this section.



One-Way or Two-Way Mobile Operation



 22.561

Channels for one-way or two-way mobile operation.



The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to transmitters that provide (or support other transmitters
that provide) one-way or two-way public land mobile service. These channels may be assigned for use by mobile or base
transmitters as indicated, and to fixed transmitters (including control, repeater or other fixed transmitters).
The mobile channels may also be assigned for use by base or fixed transmitters under certain circumstances (see  22.567(h)).
Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies
in MegaHertz.

(a) 

Maximum ERP.

 The effective radiated power (ERP) of base and fixed transmitters must not exceed the applicable limits in this paragraph
under any circumstances.




(b) 

Basic power limit.

 Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts.
(c) 

Height-power limits.

 Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of base transmitters must not exceed the amount that would
result in an average distance to the service contour of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF channels or 30.7 kilometers
(19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the service contour is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean
of the distances determined using the procedures specified in  22.567 for the eight cardinal radial directions,
excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated is over water.
(d) 

Encompassed interfering contour areas.

 Base transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the area within their
interfering contours is totally encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel based transmitters
controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, operating transmitters are authorized transmitters
that are providing service to subscribers.
(e) 

Adjacent channel protection.

 The ERP of base and fixed transmitters must not exceed 500 Watts if they transmit on channel 454.025 MHz and are located
less than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) from any Private Radio Services station receiving on adjacent channel 454.0000
MHz.
(f) 

Mobile transmitters.

 The transmitter output power of mobile transmitters must not exceed 60 watts.
(g) 

Other transmitters.

 The ERP of dispatch and auxiliary test transmitters must not exceed 100 watts.


 22.567 

Technical channel assignment criteria.


The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria for the channels listed in  22.561. The criteria
in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section permit channel assignments to be made in a manner such that reception
by public mobile receivers of signals from base transmitters, within the service area of such base transmitters,
is protected from interference caused by the operation of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters in
the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and central office stations, including Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems
(BETRS), in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Additional criteria in paragraph (g) of this section permit channel
assignments to be made in a manner such that BETRS communications are protected from interference caused by the operation
of independent co-channel base and fixed transmitters in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service and other central
office stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Separate criteria in paragraph (h) of this section apply only
to assignment of the channels designated in  22.561 as mobile channels to base and fixed transmitters, and permit
these channel assignments to be made in a manner such that reception by public base and fixed receivers of signals from
associated mobile and fixed transmitters is protected from interference caused by the operation of independent
co-channel base and fixed transmitters.
(a) 

Contour overlap.

 The FCC may grant an application requesting assignment of a channel to a proposed base, fixed or central office station
transmitter only if:
(1) The interfering contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap the service contour of any protected co-channel
transmitter controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless that carrier has agreed in writing to accept
any interference that may result from operation of the proposed transmitter; and
(2) The service contour of the proposed transmitter does not overlap the interfering contour of any protected co-channel
transmitter controlled by a carrier other than the applicant, unless the application contains a statement that the
applicant agrees to accept any interference that may result from operation of the protected co-channel transmitter;
and
(3) The area and/or population to which service would be provided by the proposed transmitter is substantial, and
service gained would exceed that lost as a result of agreements to accept interference.
(b) 

Protected transmitter.

 For the purposes of this section, protected transmitters are authorized transmitters for which there is a current
FCC public record and transmitters proposed in prior-filed pending applications, in the Paging and Radiotelephone
Service and the Rural Radiotelephone Service.

 For base stations transmitting on the VHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the service
contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:



d=1.609 x h

0.40

 x p

0.20





where:



d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts

(1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula. 
(2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1
Watt, whichever is more. 

(3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal
radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving
petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (c) of this
section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above and below the inter-station
radial at 2.5
  intervals.
(d) 

VHF interfering contour. 

For base and fixed stations transmitting on the VHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to

p is the radial ERP in Watts 



(3) The value used for p in the above formulas must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or
0.1 Watt, whichever is more. 

(4) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the interfering contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal
radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving
petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the interfering contour using the appropriate formula in
paragraph (d) of this section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and additional radials above
and below the inter-station radial at 2.5
  intervals. 

(e) 

UHF service contour. 

For base stations transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to the service

0.35

 x p

0.18





where: 



d is the radial distance in kilometers 
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters 
p is the radial ERP in Watts 



(1) Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula. 

(2) The value used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1
Watt, whichever is more. 

(3) The distance from the transmitting antenna to the service contour along any radial other than the eight cardinal
radials is routinely calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle. However, in resolving
petitions to deny, the FCC may calculate the distance to the service contour using the formula in paragraph (e) of this
section with actual HAAT and ERP data for the inter-station radial and addition radials above and below the below the
inter-station radial at 2.5
  intervals. 

(f) 

UHF interfering contour. 

For base and fixed stations transmitting on the UHF channels, the radial distance from the transmitting antenna to
the interfering contour along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows: 
(1) If the radial antenna HAAT is less than 150 meters: 




d=9.471 x h

0.23

 x p

0.15





where: 



d is the radial distance in kilometers 
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters 
p is the radial ERP in Watts 




Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula.

(g) 

Protection for BETRS. 

In applying the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if either or both of the transmitters involved is a BETRS
central office station, the following contour substitutions must be used:

(1) The service contour of the BETRS central office station(s) is a circle, centered on the central office station
antenna, with a radius of 40 kilometers (25 miles).

of a BETRS central office station, is calculated as follows:




d=36.364 x h

0.2

 x  p

0.1






where:




d is the radial distance in kilometers

h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters

p is the radial ERP in Watts




Whenever the actual HAAT is less than 30 meters (98 feet), 30 must be used as the value for h in the above formula. The value
used for p in the above formula must not be less than 27 dB less than the maximum ERP in any direction, or 0.1 Watt, whichever

(h) 

Assignment of mobile channels to base or fixed transmitters.

 Mobile channels may be assigned to base or fixed transmitters if the following criteria are met:

(1) The paired base channel, as designated in  22.561, is assigned to base transmitters in the same geographical
area operated by the same licensee.

(2) The authorization is granted subject to the condition that no interference be caused to fixed receivers in use
on or prior to the date of the grant.



 22.569



Additional channel policies.



The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for a mobile channel when the applicant has applied
or been granted an authorization for other mobile channels in the same geographic area. This section applies to applications
proposing to use the channels listed in  22.561, except applications that propose to use these channels to provide
paging service only, which are subject to  22.539, instead of this section. The general policy of the FCC is to
assign no more than two channels in an area to a carrier per application cycle. That is, a carrier must apply for no more
than two channels, receive the authorization, construct the station, provide service to subscribers, and notify
the FCC of commencement of service to subscribers (FCC Form 489) before applying for additional mobile channels in
that area.

(a) 

Transmitters in same area. 

Any transmitter on any channel listed in  22.561 is considered to be in the same geographic area as another transmitter
or any other channel listed in  22.561 if:

(1) One transmitter location is within the service area of the other transmitter; or,

(2) The area within the overlap of the service contours of the two transmitters constitutes 50 percent or more of the
service area of either of the transmitters.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Initial channel. 

The FCC will not assign more than two channels for new stations. Stations are considered to be new if there are no authorized
transmitters on any channel listed in  22.561 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic area. 

(c) 

Additional channel. 

Applications for transmitters to be located in the same geographic area as an authorized station controlled by the
applicant, but to operate on a different channel, are considered as requests for an additional channel for the authorized
station, unless paragraph (d) of this section applies. 

(d) 

Additional transmitters on same channel. 

Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, applications for transmitters to be located in the same geographic
area as an authorized station controlled by the applicant, and to operate on the same channel, are not considered as
requests for an additional channel. 

(f) 

Dismissal of application constituting cumulative request for more than two channels. 

If the FCC receives an application for a transmitter to be located in the same geographic area as a transmitter proposed
in a pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on different channels such that, considered together,
the applications would constitute a request for more than two channels, the FCC may dismiss the subsequent application
without prejudice. 

(g) 

Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. 

If the FCC receives an application requesting two additional channels (or one additional channel) for an authorized
station prior to receiving notification that the station is providing service to subscribers on all (or all except
one) of the authorized channels, the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice. 



 22.571 

Responsibility for mobile stations. 



Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a two-way service in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service,
when receiving service from that station, are considered to be operating under the authorization of that station.
Licensees are responsible for exercising effective operational control over mobile stations receiving service
through their stations. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a two-way service in the Paging and
Radiotelephone Service, while receiving service from a different station, are considered to be operating under
the authorization of such different station. The licensee of such different station is responsible, during such
temporary period, for exercising effective operational control over such mobile stations as if they were subscribers
to it. 



 22.573 

Use of base transmitters as repeaters. 



As an additional function, base transmitters may be used as repeaters. Licensees must be able to turn the base transmitter
on or off from the control point regardless of whether a subscriber-operated transmitter is transmitting. 



 22.575 

Use of mobile channel for remote control of station functions. 



Carriers may remotely control station functions (e.g. shut down or reactivate base transmitters, turn aviation
obstruction warning lights on or off, etc.) using a control transmitter operating on a mobile channel, subject to
the conditions in this section and in  22.567(h). 

(a) The control transmitter must be capable of overriding transmissions from subscriber-operated transmitters
if necessary. Subscriber-operated transmitters must not be capable of being used to deliberately or accidentally
prevent the licensee from controlling the station. 

(b) The licensee must implement measures designed to prevent station functions from being controlled by persons
not authorized by the licensee to control the station. 

(c) The control transmitter location must be within the composite service contour of the licensee's authorized station
on the paired base channel. 



 22.577 

Grandfathered dispatch service. 



No new dispatch transmitters or dispatch points are authorized. Carriers that were authorized to provide dispatch
service prior to January 1, 1982, and have provided such service continuously since that date may continue to provide
such service. 

(a) 

Installation. 

A grandfathered station licensee may install a dispatch transmitter for one or more subscribers without applying
for specific authorization, provided that the following conditions are met. 

(1) The dispatch transmitter must use the mobile channel that is paired with the channel used by the grandfathered
base station. 

(2) The dispatch transmitter antenna must not exceed the criteria in  17.7 of this chapter that determine whether
the FAA must be notified of the proposed construction. 

(3) The output power of the dispatch transmitter must not exceed 10 Watts. 

(4) The dispatch transmitter must be incapable of overriding the functioning of any control transmitter that may
be using the same channel. 

(5) The dispatch transmitter must be under the continuous supervision of the licensee. 

(b) 

Notification. 

Licensees must notify the FCC by letter whenever a dispatch transmitter is installed pursuant to paragraph (a) of
this section. The notification must include the name and address of the subscriber(s) for which the dispatch transmitter
was installed, the location of the dispatch transmitter, the height of antenna structure above ground and above mean
sea level, the channel(s) used, and the call sign and location of the grandfathered base station.

(c) 

Termination without hearing. 

Operation of a dispatch transmitter pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be terminated by the FCC
without a hearing upon notice to the licensee.


(d) 

Dispatch transmitters requiring authorization. 

A dispatch transmitter that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section may be installed only upon
grant of an application for authorization therefor.


(e) 

Permissible communications. 

A dispatch transmitter operated by a subscriber may communicate only with mobile transmitters operated by that subscriber
through the associated base transmitter.



 22.579

Operation of mobile transmitters across U.S.-Canada border.




Mobile stations licensed by Canada may receive two-way service while in the United States from stations licensed
under this part, after authorization has been granted by the FCC. Mobile stations that normally operate under the
authority of base stations licensed under this part may receive two-way service while in Canada from stations licensed
under this part or by Canada, upon authorization by Canada.



 22.589

One-way or two-way application requirements.




In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this part and  22.529, applications for authorization
to operate a transmitter on the channels listed in  22.561 must contain the applicable supplementary information
described in this section.


(a) 

Interference exhibit. 

Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an exhibit demonstrating compliance with  22.567 with
regard to protected transmitters is required. This exhibit must:


(1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles) or less,
and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering
contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System
central office transmitter in the Rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers (144 miles),


(2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 kilometers (58 miles) or less,
and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering
contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).


(3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of distance calculations indicating that there
would be no overlap of service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the licensee of or applicant
for the protected transmitter and/or the applicant, as required, have agreed in writing to accept any interference
resulting from operation of the proposed transmitter.


(b) 

Encompassment exhibit. 

An exhibit showing that the area within the interfering contour of the proposed transmitter would be totally encompassed
by interfering contours of operating co-channel base transmitters controlled by the applicant is required for applications
to operate a transmitter with ERP exceeding the basic power and height-power limits of  22.565. This encompassment
exhibit may substitute for the interference exhibit required in paragraph (a) of this section.



Point-to-Point Operation



 22.591

Channels for point-to-point operation.




The following channels are allocated for assignment to fixed transmitters that support other transmitters that
provide public mobile service. Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated
by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

(a) The 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned under developmental authority pursuant to the requirements of  22.413.
The 72-76 MHz channels may also be used in point-to-multipoint configurations. The 72-76 MHz channels
are also allocated for assignment in the Private Radio Services (see Part 90 of this chapter).
(b) Channels in the frequency ranges 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz are also allocated for assignment in
the broadband Personal Communications Service (see part 24 of this chapter), the Multipoint Distribution Service
and the Point-to-Point Microwave Radio Service (see part 21 of this chapter). Assignment of channels in these ranges
is subject to the transition rules in  22.602.

(c) Channels in the frequency ranges 488.250-490.750 and 491.250-493.750 MHz may be assigned only to
inter-island fixed stations located in the State of Hawaii.



 22.593

Effective radiated power limits.


The effective radiated power of fixed stations operating on the channels listed in  22.591 must not exceed 150
Watts. The equivalent isotropic radiated power of fixed stations operating in the frequency ranges 2110-2130
and 2160-2180 MHz must not exceed the limits set forth in Part 21 of this chapter for stations operating in these
frequency ranges.


 22.599

Assignment of 72-76 MHz channels.


Because of the potential for interference to the reception of TV Channels 4 and 5 by broadcast television sets and video
recorders, assignments of the 72-76 MHz channels are subject to the following conditions:

(a) Assignments of 72-76 MHz channels for use within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting
on TV Channel 4 or 5 are subject to the condition that the licensee must eliminate any interference caused to television
reception on TV Channels 4 and 5. If the FCC notifies the licensee of an interference problem and the licensee does not
resolve the problem within 90 days of such notification, operation of the interfering 72-76 MHz fixed station
must be immediately discontinued.

(b) 72-76 MHz channels may be assigned for use within 16 kilometers (10 miles) of a full service TV station transmitting
on TV Channel 4 or 5 under a developmental authorization, pursuant to  22.413. However, for use within 50 meters
(164 feet) of a TV station transmitting on TV Channel 4 or 5, 72-76 MHZ channels may be assigned under a regular
authorization, rather than a developmental authorization.


 22.601 

Assignment of microwave channels.


Assignment of the microwave channels listed in  22.591 is subject to the transition rules in  22.602.
No new systems will be authorized under this part.
(a) 

Coordination required. 

Before filing applications for authority to modify existing stations on these channels or major amendments to such
applications, carriers must coordinate the planned channel usage, using the procedure outlined in  22.150,
with affected parties in this radio service and the Point-to-Point Microwave Service and the Multipoint Distribution
Service. Affected parties are licensees and other applicants with previously filed pending applications whose
stations could affect or be affected by the proposed modification of the existing station in terms of interference.
(b) 

System parameters. 

In designing a system modification, the applicant must select sites, equipment and channels that will avoid harmful
interference to other users. All parties must cooperate fully and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems
and conflicts that may inhibit the most effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum; however, a party receiving
notification is not obligated to suggest changes or re-design a proposal in cases involving conflicts. The applicant
must identify in the application all parties with which the technical proposal was coordinated. In the event that
technical problems are not resolved or if an affected party does not respond to coordination efforts within 30 days
after notification, an explanation must be contained in the application. Where technical conflicts are resolved
by an agreement between the parties that requires special procedures to reduce the likelihood of harmful interference
(such as the use of artificial site shielding), or would result in a reduction of quality or capacity of either system,
the details thereof must be contained in the application.
(c) 

Bandwidth. 

Applicants must request the minimum emission bandwidth necessary. The FCC does not authorize bandwidths larger
than 800 kHz under this part.


 22.602 

Transition of the 2110-2130 and 2160-2180 MHz channels to emerging technologies.


The microwave channels listed in  22.591 have been allocated for use by emerging technologies services (ETS).
No new systems will be authorized under this part. The rules in this section provide for a transition period during
which existing Paging and Radiotelephone Service (PARS) licensees using these channels may relocate operations
to other media or to other fixed channels, including those in other microwave bands. For PARS licensees relocating
operations to other microwave bands, authorization must be obtained under part 21 of this chapter.
(a) Licensees proposing to implement ETS may negotiate with PARS licensees authorized to use these channels, for
the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the PARS licensees would_
(1) Relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or other media, or alternatively,
(2) Accept a sharing arrangement with the ETS licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference
to the PARS operations.
(b) PARS operations on these channels will continue to be co-primary with other users of this spectrum until two years
after the FCC commences acceptance of applications for ETS, and until one year after an ETS licensee initiates negotiations
for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations.
(c) After the periods specified in paragraph (b) of this section, existing PARS operations become secondary to ETS
operations, provided that:
(1) The ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative guarantees payment of all relocation costs, including
all engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any reasonable additional costs that the PARS licensee might
incur as a result of relocation to another fixed band or migration to another medium;
(2) The ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative completes all activities necessary for implementing
the replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the relocation procedure and, if radio facilities
are involved, identifying and obtaining, on the incumbent's behalf, new channels and frequency coordination; and
(3) The ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability
with the existing 2 GHz system.
(d) The PARS licensee is not required to relocate until the alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable
time to make adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.
(e) If, within one year after the relocation to new facilities, the PARS licensee demonstrates that the new facilities
are not comparable to the former facilities, the ETS applicant, provider, licensee or representative must remedy
the defects or pay to relocate the PARS licensee back to its former (or equivalent) 2 GHz channels.


 22.603 

488-494 MHz fixed service in Hawaii.


Before filing applications for authorization of inter-island control and/or repeater stations, applicants must
coordinate the planned channel usage with existing licensees and other applicants with previously filed applications,
using the procedure outlined in  22.150. Applicants and licensees shall cooperate fully and make reasonable
efforts to resolve any channel usage conflicts. In situations where technical solutions to such conflicts cannot
be devised, the FCC may select a channel or channels to assign or may designate the application(s) for hearing. To be
acceptable for filing, applications and major technical amendments must contain a certification that coordination
has been completed and an exhibit listing the name(s) of the licensees and applicants with which the planned channel
usage has been coordinated.


Point-to-Multipoint Operation


 22.621 

Channels for point-to-multipoint operation.


The following channels are allocated for assignment to transmitters utilized within point-to-multipoint systems
that support transmitters that provide public mobile service. Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth
of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

(a) Channels in the Private Radio General Access Pool and the Private Radio Power Pool may be assigned only if the applicant
shows that none of the channels in the Public Mobile Pool are available for the proposed use.
(b) Channels in the Public, Private, Government Shared Pool are allocated for assignment in the Private Operational-Fixed
Microwave Service (47 CFR part 94) and to U.S. government fixed stations.


 22.623 

System configuration.


This section requires a minimum configuration for point-to-multipoint systems using the channels listed in  22.621.
(a) 

928-960 MHz. 

The channels may be assigned, individually or paired, only to fixed transmitters in a system that controls at least
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. If a 932-933 MHz channel and a 941-942
MHz channel are assigned as a pair, the 941-942 MHz channel must be assigned only to control transmitters; the
932-933 MHz channel may be assigned to control or fixed relay transmitters.
(b) 

470-512 MHz. 

These channels may be assigned only individually (unpaired), to control transmitters that directly control at least
four public mobile base transmitters that transmit on the same channel. Fixed relay transmitters are not authorized.
(c) 

Selection and assignment. 

The FCC selects and assigns a channel when granting applications for authorization to operate a new station to transmit
in the 470-512, 932-933 and 941-942 MHz frequency ranges. Applicants having a preference may request
the assignment of a specific channel or channel pair, but the FCC may in some cases be unable to satisfy such requests.


 22.625 

Transmitter locations.


This section governs where point-to-multipoint transmitters on the channels listed in  22.621 may be located.
(a) 

928-960 MHz. 

In this frequency range, the required minimum distance separation between co-channel fixed transmitters is 113
kilometers (70 miles). However, this requirement may be waived if the applicant submits an engineering analysis
that shows that no interference would be caused to either system. In such a case, a developmental authorization may
be issued (see  22.415). If no interference is experienced during the term of the developmental authorization,
the licensee may apply for a regular authorization.
(b) 

470-512 MHz. 

The purpose of the rule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz channels
are allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is to reduce
the likelihood that interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur.
(1) 

Control transmitter locations. 

Control transmitter locations must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in this paragraph.

(2) 

Protection from intermodulation interference. 

Control transmitter locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the main transmitter locations of all
TV stations transmitting on TV channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV channel containing the
frequencies on which the control station will transmit. This requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of
intermodulation interference.

(3) 

Co-channel protection from control transmitters with high antennas. 

This paragraph applies only to control transmitters that utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet)
above average terrain. The distance between the location of such a control transmitter and the applicable protected
TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the control transmitter
location to the radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles_representing
the distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the direction of the control
transmitter). The protected TV station locations in this paragraph are the locations of record as of September 1974,
and these do not change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated.

(i) The protected TV station locations are as follows:






(ii) The distance to the radio horizon is calculated using the following formula:








where




d is the distance to the radio horizon in kilometers

h is the height of the antenna center of radiation above ground level in meters



 22.627


Effective radiated power limits.



The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters operating on the channels listed in  22.621 must not exceed

 22.655 

Channel usage.



The FCC is redesignating the public mobile channels in the 470-512 MHz range from trunked mobile operation to
point-to-multipoint operation as the demand for trunked mobile service decreases.

(a) The licensees in each market shall measure channel usage at least once every 3 months. These measurements shall
be reported to the FCC within 30 days. Measurements shall be taken during the busiest 12-hour periods on 3 days (within
a 7-day period) having normal usage. The information must be reported separately for each of the 3 days selected, must
be reported by dates, and must disclose the following:

(1) The number of mobile units in service during each of the days specified;

(2) The number of calls completed each hour;

(3) The total number of minutes during each hour that the channels were utilized for communications by the mobile units;

(4) The average channel usage for the busiest hour for the 3 days measured; and

(5) Any additional information that more accurately reflects channel usage.

(b) If the measured probability of blocking decreases below 25%, the FCC will redesignate channels not needed to maintain
blocking at 25% or less. The number of channels needed to maintain blocking below 25% will be determined from the channel
usage reports and the Erlang C tables.

(c) Although two or more channels are necessary to provide trunked service, the FCC may, pursuant to this section,
reduce to one the number of channels assigned. In such cases, the licensee may provide non-trunked two-way public
mobile service on the one remaining channel.



 22.657 

Transmitter locations.



The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is to define the areas in which the 470-512 MHz
channels are allocated for public mobile use. The purpose of the rules in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section
is to reduce the likelihood that interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels
will occur. The protected TV station locations specified in paragraphs (d), (e)(1) and (f) of this section are the
locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently
relocated.

(a) 

Base transmitter locations. 

Base transmitter locations must be within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the designated locations in this paragraph.
Mobile transmitters must not be operated at locations more than 129 kilometers (80 miles) from the designated locations
in this paragraph.






(b) 

Mobile area of operation. 

Mobile transmitters must not be operated at locations more than 48 kilometers (30 miles) from all associated base
stations.

(c) 

Protection from intermodulation interference. 

Base transmitter locations must be at least 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the current main transmitter locations of
all TV stations transmitting on TV channels separated by 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8 TV channels from the TV channel containing
the frequencies on which the base station will transmit. This requirement is intended to reduce the likelihood of
intermodulation interference.

(d) 

Adjacent channel protection from mobile transmitters. 

Base transmitter locations must be at least 145 kilometers (90 miles) from the applicable protected TV station locations
specified in this paragraph. This requirement is intended to provide a 0 dB minimum desired to undesired signal strength
ratio at the Grade B contour of an adjacent channel TV station.

(e) 

Co-channel protection from mobile transmitters. 

Base transmitter locations must be at least the distance specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section from the applicable
protected TV station locations specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. This requirement is intended to provide
a 40 dB minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratio at the Grade B contour of a co-channel TV station.

(1) The protected TV station locations are as follows:









(2) The required minimum distance depends upon the effective radiated power (ERP) of the most powerful mobile transmitter(s)
in the system:






(f) 

Co-channel protection from base transmitters with high antennas. 

This paragraph applies only to base transmitter locations in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that
utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance between the location
of such a base transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal
or exceed the sum of the distance from the base transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of the specified
location and 89 kilometers (55 miles_representing the distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station
to its Grade B contour in the direction of the base transmitter). The distance to the radio horizon is calculated as
follows:








where


d is the distance to the radio horizon in kilometers

h is the height of the antenna center of radiation above ground level in meters

(g) The FCC may waive specific distance separation requirements of paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section if the
applicant submits an engineering analysis which demonstrates that terrain effects and/or operation with less effective
radiated power would satisfy the applicable minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratios at the Grade B contours
of the protected TV stations. For this purpose, the Grade B contour of a TV station is deemed to be a circle with a 89 kilometer
(55 mile) radius, centered on the protected TV station location, and along which the median TV signal field strength
is 64 dB u V/m. In any showing intended to demonstrate compliance with the minimum desired to undesired signal ratio
requirements of this section, all predicted field strengths must have been determined using the UHF TV propagation
curves contained in part 73 of this chapter.



 22.659 

Effective radiated power limits.



The purpose of the rules in this section, which limit effective radiated power (ERP), is to reduce the likelihood that
interference to television reception from public mobile operations on these channels will occur. The protected
TV station locations specified in this section are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not change
even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated.

(a) 

Maximum ERP. 

The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts under any circumstances. The ERP of mobile transmitters must
not exceed 60 Watts under any circumstances.

(b) 

Co-channel protection from base transmitters. 

The ERP of base transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area must not exceed the limits in the tables
referenced in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. The limits depend upon the height above average terrain
of the base transmitter antenna and the distance between the base transmitter and the nearest protected TV station
location in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(1) The protected TV station locations are as follows:






(2) Tables E-8 and E-9 of this section apply to base transmitters in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey
urban area that transmit on channels in the 476-482 MHz range.

 22.702 

Eligibility.


Existing and proposed communications common carriers are eligible to hold authorizations to operate conventional
central office, interoffice and rural stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service. Only local exchange carriers
that have been state certified to provide basic exchange telephone service (or others having state approval to provide
such service) in the pertinent area are eligible to hold authorizations for Basic Exchange Telephone Radio Systems
(BETRS). Subscribers are also eligible to hold authorizations to operate rural subscriber stations in the Rural
Radiotelephone Service.


 22.703 

Separate rural subscriber station authorization not required.


A separate authorization is not required for rural subscriber stations for which the effective radiated power does
not exceed 60 Watts and for which FAA notification of construction or alteration of the antenna structure is not required
(see criteria in  17.7 of this chapter). Authority to operate such rural subscriber stations is conferred by
the authorization of the central office or base station from which they receive service.


 22.705 

Rural radiotelephone system configuration.


Stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service are authorized to communicate as follows:
(a) Rural subscriber stations are authorized to communicate with and through the central office station(s) with

maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar plot of the horizontal gain pattern of the antenna, the electric field polarization
of the wave emitted by the antenna when installed as proposed;
(3) The center frequency of each channel requested, the maximum effective radiated power, the effective radiated
power in each of the cardinal radial directions, any non-standard emission types to be used, including bandwidth
and modulation type, the transmitter classification (e.g. central office), and the locations and call signs, if
any, of any fixed points of communication.
(c) 

No landline facilities. 

Each application for a central office station must contain an exhibit showing that it is impracticable to provide
the required communication service by means of landline facilities.
(d) 

Interference exhibit. 

Applications for central office, interoffice and relay stations must include an exhibit identifying co-channel
facilities and demonstrating, in accordance with  22.715 that the proposed station, if authorized, would
not cause interference to the service of those co-channel facilities. This exhibit must:
(1) For UHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 108 kilometers (67 miles) of the proposed
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles) or less,
and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering
contour exceeds 76.4 kilometers (47.5 miles); and identify each protected Basic Exchange Telephone Radio System
central office transmitter in the rural Radiotelephone Service within 231 kilometers (144 miles).
(2) For VHF channels, identify each protected transmitter located within 135 kilometers (84 miles) of the proposed
transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering contour is 93.3 kilometers (58 miles) or less,
and within 178 kilometers (111 miles) of the proposed transmitter in directions in which the distance to the interfering
contour exceeds 93.3 kilometers (58 miles).
(3) For each protected transmitter identified, show the results of distance calculations indicating that there
would be no overlap of service and interfering contours, or alternatively, indicate that the licensee of or applicant

(e) 

Blocking probability. 

Applications for authority to operate basic exchange telephone radio systems (BETRS) that request more than two
channel pairs must include an exhibit containing calculations showing that the number of channels requested is the
minimum necessary to achieve the required grade of service (in terms of blocking probability), and that there will
be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic estimates of current and future demand for paging, two-way
mobile and rural radiotelephone services (see  22.719(c)). Applications for authority to operate new conventional
rural radiotelephone systems that request more than two channel pairs must include a statement explaining why BETRS
technology is not being proposed.



 22.711

Provision of information to applicants.



Licensees in the Rural Radio Service must, upon request by a 

bona-fide

 prospective applicant, provide to such applicant the information required by  22.709 regarding the portion
of the licensee's operations that potentially could affect, or be affected by, the prospective applicant's proposed
station, if such information is not already on file with the FCC. This information must be provided to the 

bona-fide

 prospective applicant no later than 30 days after receipt of the information request.



 22.713

Construction period for rural radiotelephone stations.



The construction period for stations in the Rural Radiotelephone Service is 12 months.



 22.715

Technical channel assignment criteria for rural radiotelephone stations.



Channels are assigned in the Rural Radiotelephone Service using the procedures in  22.567.



 22.717

Procedure for mutually exclusive applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service.



Mutually exclusive applications in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, including those that are mutually exclusive
with applications in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service, are processed in accordance with the rules in this section.

(a) 

Filing groups. 

Pending mutually exclusive applications are processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing
group are given concurrent consideration. The FCC may dismiss as defective (pursuant to  22.128) any mutually
exclusive application(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range for inclusion in the filing group. The types
of filing groups used in day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A filing
group is one of the following types:

(1) 

Renewal filing group. 

A renewal filing group comprises a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed
mutually exclusive competing applications.

(2) 

Same-day filing group. 

A same-day filing group comprises all mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which is
normally the filing date of the first-filed application(s).

(3) 

Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. 

A thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is no later
than 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the filing dates)
as acceptable for filing.

(4) 

Window filing group. 

A window filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and including two specific dates, which are the first
and last dates on which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be accepted for filing. In the case
of a one-day filing window, the two dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.

(b) 

Procedures. 

Generally, the FCC may grant one application in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss other
application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by that grant, pursuant to  22.128.

(1) 

Selection methods. 

In selecting the application to grant, the FCC may use comparative hearings.

(2) 

Dismissal of applications. 

The FCC may dismiss any application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to dismissal under  22.128,
either before or after employing selection procedures.

(3) 

Type of filing group used.

 Except as otherwise provided in this part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more mutually exclusive
applications depends on the purpose(s) of the applications.

(i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization,
a renewal filing group is used.

(ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification and
none of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day filing group is
used.

(iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the earliest filing date are applications for initial
authorization, a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group is used.

(4) 

Disposition. 

If there is only one application in any type of filing group, the FCC may grant that application and dismiss without
prejudice any applications excluded by that grant (i.e. not in the filing group). If there is more than one mutually
exclusive application in a filing group, the FCC disposes of these applications as follows:

(i) 

Applications in a renewal filing group. 

All mutually exclusive applications in a renewal filing group are designated for comparative consideration in a
hearing.

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group.

 For applications in a thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group, the FCC may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity
by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the
FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event,
the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.

(iii) 

Applications in a same-day filing group.

 If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day filing group, the FCC may attempt to resolve
the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within
a reasonable time, the FCC may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing.
In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all of the applications in the filing group.

(iv) 

Applications in a window filing group.

 Applications in a window filing group are processed in accordance with the procedures for a thirty-day notice and
cut-off filing group in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.

(c) 

Terminology.

 For the purposes of this section, terms have the following meanings:

(1) The ``filing date'' of an application is the date on which that application was received in a condition acceptable
for filing or the date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that application was received, whichever
is later, excluding major amendments in the following circumstances:

(i) The major amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control found by the FCC to be in the public interest;
or,

(ii) The major amendment as received is defective or otherwise found unacceptable for filing.

(2) An ``application for initial authorization'' is:

(i) Any application requesting an authorization for a new system or station;

(ii) Any application requesting authorization for an existing station to operate on an additional channel, unless
the additional channel is for paired two-way radiotelephone operation, is in the same frequency range as the existing
channel(s), and will be operationally integrated with the existing channel(s) such as by trunking; or,

(iii) Any application requesting authorization for a new transmitter at a location more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
from any existing transmitters of the applicant licensee on the requested channel.

(3) An ``application for modification'' is any application other than an application for initial authorization
or renewal.



 22.719 

Additional channel policy for rural radiotelephone stations.



The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for central office stations that request a rural radiotelephone
channel pair when the applicant has applied for or been granted an authorization for other rural radiotelephone channel
pairs in the same area. The general policy of the FCC is to promote effective use of the spectrum by encouraging the use
of spectrum-efficient technologies (i.e. BETRS) and by assigning the minimum number of channels necessary to provide
service.

(a) 

Transmitters in same area.

 Any central office station transmitter on any channel pair listed in  22.725 is considered to be in the same area
as another central office station transmitter on any other channel pair listed in  22.725 if the transmitting
antennas are located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of each other.

(b) 

Initial channel pairs.

 The FCC does not assign more than two channel pairs for new central office stations, unless there are more than eight
rural subscriber stations to be served. Stations are considered to be new if there are no authorized transmitters
on any channel listed in  22.725 controlled by the applicant in the same geographic area.

(c) 

Additional channel pairs.

 Applications for central office station transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized central office
station controlled by the applicant, but to operate on a different channel pair(s) are considered as requests for
additional channel pair(s) for the authorized central office station. The FCC may grant applications for additional
channel pairs provided that the need for each additional channel pair (after the first two) is established and fully
justified in terms of achieving the required grade of service (blocking probability), and the applicant demonstrates
that there will still be adequate spectrum available in the area to meet realistic estimates of current and future
demand for paging, two-way mobile and rural radiotelephone services. In the case of conventional rural radiotelephone
central office stations, an explanation must be provided as to why BETRS technology is not being used instead of additional
channel pairs.



Conventional Rural Radiotelephone Stations



 22.725 

Channels for conventional rural radiotelephone stations.



The following channels are allocated for paired assignment to transmitters that provide conventional rural radiotelephone
service. These channels may be assigned for use by central office or rural subscriber stations as indicated, and interoffice
stations. These channels may be assigned also for use by relay stations in systems where it would be impractical to
provide rural radiotelephone service without the use of relay stations. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and
are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

(a) The channels listed in this section are also allocated for assignment in the Paging and Radiotelephone Service.

(b) In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, channels in the 154.04-154.46 MHz and 161.40-161.85 MHz frequency
ranges may be assigned to transmitters providing rural radiotelephone service; channels in these ranges are also
allocated for assignment in the International Fixed Public and Aeronautical Fixed radio services.

(c) In Alaska, channels 42.40, 44.10, 44.20 and 45.90 MHz are allocated for assignment to transmitters providing
rural radiotelephone service using meteor burst propagation modes, subject to the provisions of  22.729.

 22.727

Power limits for conventional rural radiotelephone transmitters.


The transmitting power of transmitters operating on the channels listed in  22.725 must not exceed the limits
in this section.
(a) 

Maximum ERP.

 The effective radiated power (ERP) of central office and rural subscriber station transmitters must not exceed the
applicable limits in this paragraph under any circumstances.




(b) 

Basic power limit.

 Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed
500 Watts.
(c) 

Height-power limits.

 Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the ERP of central office station transmitters must not exceed
the amount that would result in an average distance to the ``service contour'' of 41.6 kilometers (26 miles) for VHF
channels or 30.7 kilometers (19 miles) for UHF channels. The average distance to the ``service contour'' is calculated
by taking the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures specified in  22.567 for the
eight cardinal radial directions, excluding cardinal radial directions for which 90% or more of the distance so calculated
is over water.
(d) 

Encompassed interfering contour areas.

 Central office station transmitters are exempt from the basic power and height-power limits of this section if the
area within their interfering contours is totally encompassed by the interfering contours of operating co-channel
central office station transmitters controlled by the same licensee. For the purpose of this paragraph, operating
transmitters are authorized transmitters that are providing service to subscribers.

 22.809

 Transmitting power limits.



The transmitting power of ground and airborne mobile transmitters operating on the channels listed in  22.805
must not exceed the limits in this section.

(a) 

Ground station transmitters.

 The effective radiated power of ground stations must not exceed 100 Watts and must not be less than 50 Watts, except
as provided in  22.811.

(b) 

Airborne mobile transmitters.

 The transmitter power output of airborne mobile transmitters must not exceed 25 Watts and must not be less than 4 Watts.



 22.811

 Idle tone.



Whenever a ground station transmitter authorized to transmit on any of the communications channels listed in  22.805
is available for service but is not providing service, a modulated signal must be continuously transmitted on the
communication channel assigned to that transmitter. While this modulated signal is transmitted, the transmitter
power must be between 10 and 20 dB lower than the normal transmitting power.



 22.813

 Technical channel pair assignment criteria.



The rules in this section establish technical assignment criteria for the channel pairs listed in  22.805.
These criteria are intended to provide substantial service volumes over areas that have significant local and regional
general aviation activity, while maintaining the continuous nationwide in-route coverage of the original geographical
layout.

(a) 

Distance separation for co-channel ground stations. 

The FCC may grant an application requesting assignment of a communication channel pair to a proposed ground transmitter
only if the proposed antenna location is at least 800 kilometers (497 miles) from the antenna location of the nearest
co-channel ground transmitter in the United States, its territories and possessions; and 1000 kilometers (621 miles)
from the antenna location of the nearest co-channel ground transmitter in Canada.

(b) 

Dispersion.

 The FCC may grant an application requesting assignment of a communication channel pair to a proposed ground transmitter
only if there are no more than five different communication channel pairs already assigned to ground transmitters
with antenna locations within a 320 kilometer (199 mile) radius of the proposed antenna location.



 22.815

 Construction period for general aviation ground stations.



The construction period (see  22.142) for general aviation ground stations is 12 months.



 22.817

 Additional channel policies.



The rules in this section govern the processing of applications for authority to operate a ground station transmitter
on any ground station communication channel listed in  22.805 when the applicant has applied or been granted
an authorization for other ground station communication channels in the same area. The general policy of the FCC is
to assign one ground station communication channel in an area to a carrier per application cycle, up to a maximum of
six ground station communication channels per area. That is, a carrier must apply for one ground station communication
channel, receive the authorization, construct the station, and notify the FCC of commencement of service before
applying for an additional ground station communication channel in that area.

(a) 

Air-ground transmitters in same area.

 Any transmitter on any of the ground station channels listed in  22.805 is considered to be in the same area as
another transmitter on any ground station channel listed in  22.805 if it is located less than 350 kilometers
(217 miles) from that transmitter.

(b) 

Initial channel.

 The FCC will not assign more than one ground station communication channel for new ground stations. Ground stations
are considered to be new if there are no authorized ground station transmitters on any channel listed in  22.805
controlled by the applicant in the same area.

(c) 

Additional channel.

 Applications for ground transmitters to be located in the same area as an authorized ground station controlled by
the applicant, but to operate on a different ground station communication channel, are considered as requesting
an additional channel for the authorized station.

(d) 

Amendment of pending application.

 If the FCC receives and accepts for filing an application for a ground station transmitter to be located in the same
area as a ground station transmitter proposed in a pending application previously filed by the applicant, but on a
different ground station communication channel, the subsequent application is treated as a major amendment to change
the technical proposal of the prior application. The filing date of any application so amended is the date the FCC received
the subsequent application.

(e) 

Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel.

 If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station communication channel for an authorized
ground station prior to receiving notification that the station is providing service to subscribers on the authorized
channel(s), the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice.

(f) 

Dismissal of applications for seventh channel.

 If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station communication channel for an authorized
ground station which would, if granted, result in that station being assigned more than six ground station communication
channels in the same area, the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice.



 22.819

 AGRAS compatibility requirement.



Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, stations transmitting on the channels listed in  22.805
must operate in compliance with the technical and operational requirements contained in the document, ``Technical
Reference, Air-ground Radiotelephone Automated Service (AGRAS), System Operation and Equipment Characteristics'',
dated April 12, 1985.

(a) Until January 1, 1996, stations may continue to operate in compliance with the previous standard adopted in Docket
16073.

(b) Copies of the document referenced in this section may be obtained from the FCC's copying contractor.



 22.821

 Authorization for airborne mobile stations.



An authorization separate from any ground station authorization is required for each airborne mobile station that
operates on the channels listed in  22.805. The operator of the airborne mobile station must apply for the authorization
(FCC Form 409). The application must contain an affirmative representation that the applicant has made definite
arrangements with a wireline common carrier for service and billing.

Commercial Aviation Air-Ground Systems


 22.857 

Channel plan for commercial aviation air-ground systems.


The 849-851 and 894-896 MHz frequency ranges are allocated for block assignment to nationwide air-ground
systems providing radiotelephone service to passengers aboard commercial aircraft. These frequency ranges may
also be used to provide service to persons in general aviation or other aircraft. Ground stations transmit on channels
in the 849-851 MHz range. Airborne mobile stations transmit on channels in the 894-896 MHz range. Systems
using these channels must conform to the channel plan described in this section.
(a) 

Channel blocks.

 The spectrum allocated for commercial aviation air-ground systems is divided into ten channel blocks, numbered
1 through 10. All ground stations in each geographical area must use the same channel block for communication with
airborne mobile stations in flight, in accordance with  22.859.
(1) Each channel block is subdivided into 6 control channels labeled P-1 through P-6, and 29 communications
channels labeled C-1 through C-29.
(2) The authorized channel bandwidths are as follows:
(i) Each control channel has a bandwidth of 3.2 kHz.
(ii) Each communications channel has a bandwidth of 6 kHz.
(b) The center frequencies (in MegaHertz) of the communications and control channels are listed in Tables G-1
and G-2 of this section.

(a) Carriers authorized to construct and operate air-ground radiotelephone systems on the channels listed in  22.857
may also construct and operate low power ground stations designed to provide service to airborne mobile stations
on the ground, provided that no interference is caused to service provided by ground stations located in accordance
with the geographical channel block layout or with paragraph (b) of this section. The antenna location of each such
low power ground station may be anywhere that is at least 483 kilometers (300 miles) from all antenna locations of ground
stations using the same channel block(s) in accordance with the geographical channel block layout or with paragraph
(b) of this section.

(b) Ground station locations may be more than 1.61 kilometers (one mile) from all of the locations listed in this section,
provided that they are at least 885 kilometers (550 miles) from all antenna locations of ground stations using the
same channel block(s) in accordance with the geographical channel block layout or with this paragraph.



 22.861


Emission limitations.



Any appropriate emission type may be used to provide air-ground radiotelephone service on the channels listed in
 22.857, provided that the emission limitations of this section are met.

(a) 

Emission mask.

 The emission mask described in this paragraph applies instead of those in  22.359. The power of any emission
in each of the adjacent channels must be at least 30 dB below the power of the total emission. The power of any emission
in any of the channels other than the one being used and the adjacent channels must be at least 50 dB below the power of
the total emission.

(b) 

Airborne mobile transmitters.

 The power of any emission in each of the adjacent channels must not exceed -130 dBm at any ground station receiver,
assuming a 0 dBi receive antenna. The power of any emission in any of the channels other than the one being used and the
adjacent channels must not exceed -148 dBm at any ground station receiver, assuming a 0 dBi receive antenna.

(c) 

Ground station transmitters.

 The effective radiated power (ERP) of any emission outside of the frequency ranges set forth in  22.857 must
not exceed -10 dBm. The ERP of any emission in each of the adjacent channels must not exceed +10 dBm. The ERP of any
emission in any of the channels other than the one being used and the adjacent channels must not exceed -5 dBm.

(d) If an emission on any frequency outside of the authorized bandwidth causes harmful interference, the FCC may require
greater attenuation of that emission than required in paragraph (a) of this section.



 22.863


Transmitter frequency tolerance.



Ground station transmitter frequencies must be maintained within 0.1 parts per million (ppm) of the channel reference
or center frequencies. Doppler shift correction must be used to ensure that the frequencies of the signals of airborne
mobile stations received at ground stations remain within 0.2 ppm of the channel reference or center frequencies.



 22.865


Automatic channel selection procedures.



Operation of stations using the channels listed in  22.857 must be in accordance with the procedures in this
section.

(a) A communications channel is not available for use by a ground station if it is already in use by another ground station
at the same location. Ground station equipment must automatically determine whether channels are in use by other
ground stations at the same location, and may employ radio frequency signal monitoring to do so. For example, a communications
channel may be determined to be in use if the received signal power on that channel at the ground station exceeds -115
dBm, which, assuming a 0 dB gain 895 MHz receive antenna, corresponds to a field strength of approximately 19 dB u V/m.
Ground stations may employ an alternative method of determining whether a communications channel is in use provided
that such procedure is at least as reliable as radio frequency signal monitoring.

(b) Data indicating which communications channels are available for use are transmitted by ground stations on the
assigned control channels.

(c) A call is originated when an airborne mobile station selects a communications channel based on the received data
from ground stations and other factors, and transmits an identification code (which identifies the specific ground
station from which service is requested) on the selected communications channel. The ground station from which service
has been requested may then obtain any necessary billing information and complete the call.

(d) A ground station may not transmit on a communications channel unless it has received the proper identification
code. After a ground station has begun to transmit on a communications channel, that channel is not available to ground
stations other than the one from which service has been requested until the call is terminated.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(e) A call is terminated by the ground station when either a hang-up signal is transmitted by the airborne mobile station,
or the signal from the airborne mobile station on the communications channel is lost for a period of 15 continuous seconds.
The hang-up signal is the on-off keying (50% duty cycle) of an unmodulated carrier over a period of one second with pulse
duration of 5 milliseconds. However, if all carriers authorized to operate air-ground systems using the channels
listed in  22.857 agree that an alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure would be more efficient or beneficial,
such alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure may be used. The carriers must jointly give prior notification
to the FCC if an alternative hang-up signal and/or procedure is used.



 22.867 

Effective radiated power limits.



The effective radiated power (ERP) of ground and airborne stations operating on the channels listed in  22.857
must not exceed the limits in this section.

(a) The ERP of airborne mobile station transmitters must not exceed 30 Watts.

(b) The ERP of ground station transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts.

(c) The ERP of low power ground station transmitters operating pursuant to paragraph (a) of  22.859 must not
exceed 1 Watt.



 22.869 

Assignment of control channels.



The FCC selects and assigns exclusively one control channel to each commercial aviation air-ground licensee.



 22.871 

Control channel transition period.



The rules in this section provide for a period of transition during which the experimental air-ground system operating
on the channels listed in  22.857 will be discontinued and replaced by a system operating in full compliance
with the rules in this subpart. The experimental system may continue to exclusively use a 3.2 kHz control channel contained
within the bandwidth of communications channel C-2 of each channel block until September 9, 1996. After that
date communications channel C-2 will be available for use by all carriers authorized to operate an air-ground
system on the channels listed in  22.857.



 22.873 

Construction period for commercial aviation air-ground systems.

 22.905 

Channels for cellular service.



The following channels are allocated for block assignment in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service. All channels
have a bandwidth of 40 kHz and are designed by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.







(a) Each channel block is assigned exclusively to one licensee for use in that licensee's cellular geographic service
area (see  22.911).

(b) Licensees may use any channel pair from the assigned channel block at any of their transmitter locations, subject
to the prior coordination requirements of  22.907.



 22.907 

Coordination of channel usage.



Licensees in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must coordinate, with the appropriate parties, channel usage
at each transmitter location within 121 kilometers (75 miles) of any transmitter locations authorized to other licensees
or proposed by tentative selectees or other applicants, except those with mutually exclusive applications.

(a) Licensees must cooperate and make reasonable efforts to resolve technical problems that may inhibit effective
and efficient use of the cellular radio spectrum; however, licensees are not obligated to suggest extensive changes
to or redesign other licensees' cellular systems. Licensees must make reasonable efforts to avoid blocking the growth
of other cellular systems that are likely to need additional capacity in the future.

(b) If technical problems are addressed by an agreement or operating arrangement between the licensees that would
result in a reduction of quality or capacity of either system, the licensees must notify the FCC by letter.



 22.909 

Cellular markets.



Cellular markets are standard geographic areas used by the FCC for administrative convenience in the licensing of
cellular systems. Cellular markets comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Rural Service Areas (RSAs).
All cellular markets and the counties they comprise are listed in Public Notice Report No. CL-92-40 ``Common
Carrier Public Mobile Services Information, Cellular MSA/RSA Markets and Counties'', dated January 24, 1992, DA
92-109, 7 FCC Rcd 742 (1992).

(a) 

MSAs.

 Metropolitan Statistical Areas are 306 areas, including New England County Metropolitan Areas and the Gulf of Mexico
Service Area (water area of the Gulf of Mexico, border is the coastline), defined by the Office of Management and Budget,
as modified by the FCC.

(b) 

RSAs.

 Rural Service Areas are 428 areas, other than MSAs, established by the FCC.

 22.911 

Cellular geographic service area.



The Cellular Geographic Service Area (CGSA) of a cellular system is the geographic area considered by the FCC to be
served by the cellular system. The CGSA is the area within which cellular systems are entitled to protection and within
which adverse effects for the purpose of determining whether a petitioner has standing are recognized.

(a) 

CGSA determination.

 The CGSA is the composite of the service areas of all of the cells in the system, excluding any area outside the cellular
market boundary, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and excluding any area within the CGSA of another
cellular system. The service area of a cell is the area within its service area boundary (SAB). The distance to the SAB
is calculated as a function of effective radiated power (ERP) and antenna center of radiation height above average
terrain (HAAT), height above sea level (HASL) or height above mean sea level (HAMSL).

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna
to its SAB along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:




d=2.531 x h

0.34

 xp

0.17






where:



d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts




(2) For the cellular systems authorized to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA, the distance from a cell transmitting antenna
to its SAB along each cardinal radial is calculated as follows:




d=6.895 x h

0.30

 xp

0.15






where:



d is the radial distance in kilometers
h is the radial antenna HAAT in meters
p is the radial ERP in Watts




(3) The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not be less than 8 meters (26 feet) HASL
(or HAMSL, as appropriate for the support structure). The value used for h in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this
section must not be less than 30 meters (98 feet) HAAT, except that for unserved area applications proposing a cell
with an ERP not exceeding 10 Watts, the value for h used in the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to determine
the service area boundary for that cell may be less than 30 meters (98 feet) HAAT, but not less than 3 meters (10 feet)
HAAT.

(4) The value used for p in the formulas in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section must not be less than 0.1 Watt
or 27 dB less than (1/500 of) the maximum ERP in any direction, whichever is more.

<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Whenever use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section pursuant to the exception contained in paragraph
(a)(3) of this section results in a calculated distance that is less than 5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles), the radial distance
to the service area boundary is deemed to be 5.4 kilometers (3.4 miles).

(6) The distance from a cell transmitting antenna to the SAB along any radial other than the eight cardinal radials
is calculated by linear interpolation of distance as a function of angle.






Note

 to paragraph (a) of  22.911: On May 13, 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
instructed the FCC to vacate the provisions of old  22.903(a), now  22.911(a), insofar as they apply to
cellular systems licensed to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA (GMSA), pending reconsideration of an issue remanded to
the FCC in that decision. See 

Petroleum Communications, Inc. 

v. 

Federal Communications Commission

, No. 92-1670 and 

RVC Services, Inc., D/B/A Coastel Communications Company 

v. 

Federal Communications Commission

, No. 93-1016, 

XX

 F.2d 

XX

, 

XX

 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Accordingly, notwithstanding the provisions of  22.911(a), until further notice, the authorized
CGSAs of the cellular systems licensed to serve the GMSA are those which were authorized prior to January 11, 1993.




(b) 

Alternative CGSA determination

. If a carrier believes that the method prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section produces a CGSA that departs significantly
(

#

20% in the service area of any cell) from the geographical area where reliable cellular service is actually provided,
the carrier may submit, as an exhibit to an application for modification of the CGSA (FCC Form 401), a depiction of what
the carrier believes the CGSA should be. Such submissions must be accompanied by one or more supporting propagation
studies using methods appropriate for the 800-900 MHz frequency range, including all supporting data and calculations,
and/or by extensive field strength measurement data. For the purpose of such submissions, cellular service is considered
to be provided in all areas, including ``dead spots'', between the transmitter location and the locus of points where
the predicted or measured median field strength finally drops to 32 dB u V/m (i.e. does not exceed 32 dB u V/m further
out). If, after consideration of such submissions, the FCC finds that adjustment to a CGSA is warranted, the FCC may
grant the application.

(1) The alternative CGSA determination must define the CGSA in terms of distances from cell sites to cell SABs along
the eight cardinal radials, with other points along the SAB determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this
section. The distances used for the cardinal radials must be representative of the coverage within the 45
  sectors, as depicted by the alternative CGSA determination.

(2) If an uncalibrated predictive model is used to depict the CGSA, the alternative CGSA determination must identify
factors (e.g. terrain roughness or features) that could plausibly account for the difference between actual coverage
and that defined by the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If actual measurements or a measurement-calibrated
predictive model are used to depict the CGSA, and this fact is disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination, it
is not necessary to offer an explanation of the difference between actual coverage and that defined by the formula
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is clearly inapplicable for
the cell(s) in question (e.g. for microcells), this should be disclosed in the alternative CGSA determination.

(3) The provision for alternative CGSA determinations was made in recognition that the formula in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section is a general model that provides a reasonable approximation of coverage in most land areas, but may
substantially under-predict or over-predict coverage in specific areas with unusual terrain roughness or features,
and may be inapplicable for certain purposes, e.g. cells with a radial distance to the SAB less than 8 kilometers (5
miles). In such cases, alternative methods that utilize more specific models are appropriate. Accordingly, the
FCC does not consider use of the formula in paragraph (a)(1) of this section with parameters outside of the limits in
paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this section or with data for radials other than the cardinal radials to be
a valid alternative method for determining the CGSA of a cellular system. 

(c) 

CGSA extension areas.

 SAB extensions (areas outside of the cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the
methods of paragraph (a) of this section) are part of the CGSA only under the following circumstances: 

(1) During the five year build-out period of the system in the cellular market containing the extension, the licensees
of systems on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree that the portion of the service area of one
system that extends into unserved areas in the other system's cellular market is part of the CGSA of the former system.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00155 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) At the end of the five year build-out period of the system in the cellular market containing the extension, the portion
of the service area that extends into unserved areas in another cellular market becomes part of the CGSA, provided
that the licensee of the system so extended files a system information update in accordance with  22.947(c).
(3) For original systems in MSAs, extensions of the CGSA authorized by the FCC are part of the CGSA to the extent authorized.
(d) 

Protection afforded.

 Within the CGSA determined in accordance with this section, cellular systems are entitled to protection from co-channel
and first-adjacent channel interference and from capture of subscriber traffic by adjacent systems on the same channel
block.
(1) Licensees must cooperate in resolving co-channel and first-adjacent channel interference by changing channels
used at specific cells or by other technical means.
(2) Protection from capture of subscriber traffic is applied and limited in accordance with the following:
(i) Subscriber traffic is captured if an SAB of one cellular system overlaps the CGSA of another operating cellular
system. Therefore, cellular licensees must not begin to operate any facility that would cause an SAB to overlap the
existing CGSA of another cellular system on the same channel block, without first obtaining the written consent of
the licensee of that system. However, cellular licensees may continue to operate existing facilities that produce
an SAB overlapping a subsequently-authorized portion of the CGSA of another cellular system on the same channel block
until the licensee of that system requests that the SAB be removed from its CGSA. Such request may be made directly to
the licensee of the overlapping system or to the FCC. In the event such request is made, the licensee of the overlapping
system must reduce the transmitting power or antenna height (or both) at the pertinent cell site as necessary to remove
the SAB from the CGSA of the other system, unless a written consent from the licensee of the other system allowing the
SAB to remain is obtained. Cellular licensees may enter into contracts with the licensees of other cellular systems
on the same channel block to allow SABs to overlap CGSAs.
(ii) Cellular licensees are at most entitled to have a CGSA free of SABs from other cellular systems on the same channel
block.
(e) 

Unserved areas.

 Unserved areas are areas outside of all existing CGSAs (on either of the channel blocks), to which the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, is applicable.


 22.912


Service area boundary extensions.


This section contains rules governing service area boundary (SAB) extensions. SAB extensions are areas outside
of the cellular market boundary, but within the service area as calculated using the methods of  22.911(a).
Cellular systems must be designed to comply with the rules in this section. Applications proposing systems that would
not comply with the rules in this section are defective. Service within SAB extensions is not protected from interference
or capture under  22.911(d) unless and until the area within the SAB extension becomes a part of the cellular
geographic service area (CGSA) in accordance with  22.911(c).
(a) 

De minimis extensions.

 Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, SABs may extend into adjacent cellular markets if such extensions
are 

de minimis

, are demonstrably unavoidable for technical reasons of sound engineering design, and do not extend into the CGSA
of any other licensee's cellular system on the same channel block (unless the licensee of such other system consents
to the extension) or into any adjacent cellular market on a channel block for which the five year build-out period has
expired.
(b) 

Contract extensions.

 Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of cellular systems on the same channel block in adjacent
cellular markets may, at any time, enter into contracts with applicants or other licensees to allow SAB extensions
into their CGSA only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of
the first authorized cellular systems on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may agree to allow SAB
extensions into their CGSA and/or unserved areas in their cellular markets during the five year build-out period
of the market into which the SAB extends.
(c) 

Same applicant/licensee.

 Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of cellular systems that are also an applicant or
licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular markets may, at any time, allow or propose SAB extensions from
their adjacent market system into their 
CGSH only (not into unserved areas). Except as restricted in paragraph (d) of this section, licensees of the first
authorized cellular systems that are also an applicant or licensee on the same channel block in adjacent cellular
markets may allow or propose SAB extensions from their adjacent market system into their CGSA and/or unserved areas
in their cellular markets during the five year build-out period of the market into which the SAB extends.
(d) 

Unserved area systems.

 Phase I initial cellular applications must not propose SAB extensions. Phase I sole major modification applications
and Phase II applications may propose SAB extensions, subject to the conditions in this section.


 22.913 

Effective radiated power limits.


The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits
in this section.
(a) 

Maximum ERP.

 The effective radiated power (ERP) of base transmitters and cellular repeaters must not exceed 500 Watts. The ERP
of mobile transmitters and auxiliary test transmitters must not exceed 7 Watts.
(b) 

Height-power limit.

 The ERP of base transmitters must not exceed the amount that would result in an average distance to the service area
boundary of 79.1 kilometers (49 miles) for cellular systems authorized to serve the Gulf of Mexico MSA and 40.2 kilometers
(25 miles) for all other cellular systems. The average distance to the service area boundary is calculated by taking
the arithmetic mean of the distances determined using the procedures specified in  22.911 for the eight cardinal
radial directions.
(c) 

Coordination exemption.

 Licensees need not comply with the height-power limit in paragraph (b) of this section if the proposed operation is
coordinated with the licensees of all affected cellular systems on the same channel block within 121 kilometers (75
miles) and concurrence is obtained.


 22.915 

Modulation requirements.


Cellular systems must be capable of providing service using the types of modulation described in the cellular system
compatibility specification.
(a) 

Non-voice modulating signals.

 Modulating signals other than voice signals, such as data signals, may be transmitted, provided the resulting modulated
emission exhibits spectral characteristics not exceeding those resulting from voice modulation.
(b) 

Modulation levels.

 The levels of the modulating signals must be set to the values specified in this paragraph, and must be maintained within


#

10% of those values.
(1) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the main modulating signal must be 

#

12 kHz.

(2) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the supervisory audio tones must be 

#

2 kHz.

(3) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from the signaling tone must be 

#

8 kHz.

(4) The instantaneous frequency deviation resulting from wideband data signals must be 

#

8 kHz.

(c) 

Deviation limitation circuitry. 

Cellular transmitters must be equipped with circuitry that automatically prevents modulation levels for voice
transmissions from exceeding the limits specified in this section.

(d) 

Audio filter characteristics. 

Except as provided in  22.917, radiotelephony signals applied to the modulator from the modulation limiter
must be attenuated as a function of frequency as specified in this paragraph.

(1) For mobile stations, these signals must be attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, as follows:

(i) In the frequency ranges of 3.0 to 5.9 kHz and 6.1 to 15.0 kHz, signals must be attenuated by at least 40 log (f
3) dB, where f is the frequency of the signal in kHz.

(ii) In the frequency range of 5.9 to 6.1 kHz, signals must be attenuated at least 35 dB.

(iii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated at least 28 dB.

(2) For base stations, these signals shall be attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, as follows:

(i) In the frequency range of 3 to 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated by at least 40 log (f
3) dB, where f is the frequency of the signal in kHz.

(ii) In the frequency range above 15 kHz, signals must be attenuated by at least 28 dB.

(3) Filtering is not required for the supervisory audio tones, signaling tones or wideband data signals.



 22.917 

Emission limitations for cellular.



The rules in this section govern the spectral characteristics of emissions in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

(a) 

Analog radiotelephony emissions. 

F3E emissions must be used only on the communication channels.

(b) 

F3E/F3D emission mask for use with audio filter. 

For F3E and F3D emissions, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the mean power of emissions must be attenuated
below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier wave (P) as follows:

(1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz:




at least 26 dB;




(2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 45 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:




at least 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.




(c) 

Alternative F3E/F3D emission mask. 

For F3E and F3D emissions, transmitters may comply with the emission limitations in this paragraph in lieu of compliance
with paragraph (b) of this section and the audio filter requirement of  22.915.

(1) The mean power of any emission removed from the carrier frequency by a displacement frequency (f

d

 in kHz) must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) as follows:

(i) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 12 kHz but not more than 20 kHz:




at least 117 log (f

d


12) dB;






(ii) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 20 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier
frequency:




at least 100 log (f

d


11) dB or 60 dB or 43 + 10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation;




(2) For mobile stations, modulating signals other than the supervisory audio tone in the frequency range of 5.9 to
6.1 kHz must be attenuated, relative to the level at 1 kHz, at least 35 dB.

(d) 

F1D emission mask.

 For F1D emissions, the mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P)
as follows:

(1) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 20 kHz but not more than 45 kHz:




at least 26 dB;




(2) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 45 kHz but not more than 90 kHz:




at least 45 dB;

(3) On any frequency removed from the carrier frequency by more than 90 kHz, up to the first multiple of the carrier frequency:




at least 60 dB or 43+10 log P dB, whichever is the lesser attenuation.




(e) 

Out of band emissions. 

The mean power of emissions must be attenuated below the mean power of the unmodulated carrier (P) on any frequency
twice or more than twice the fundamental frequency by: 




at least 43+10 log P dB.




(f) 

Mobile emissions in base frequency range

. The mean power of any emissions appearing in the base station frequency range from cellular mobile transmitters
operated must be attenuated to a level not to exceed ^80 dBm at the transmit antenna connector.

(g) 

Interference from spurious emissions

. If any emission from a transmitter operating in this service results in interference to users of another radio service,
the FCC may require a greater attenuation of that emission than specified in this section.

(h) 

Measurement procedure

. The following spectrum analyzer bandwidth settings should be used for measurement of spurious emissions:

(1) When operating in the radiotelephony mode or the supervisory audio tone mode:

(i) For any emission not more than 45 kHz removed from the carrier frequency: 300 Hz;

(ii) For any emission more than 45 kHz removed from the carrier frequency: 30 kHz.

(2) When operating in the wideband data mode or the signaling tone mode:

(i) For any emission not more than 60 kHz removed from the carrier frequency: 300 Hz;

(ii) For any emission more than 60 kHz removed from the carrier frequency: 30 kHz.



 22.919

Electronic serial numbers.



The Electronic Serial Number (ESN) is a 32 bit binary number that uniquely identifies a cellular mobile transmitter
to any cellular system.

(a) Each mobile transmitter in service must have a unique ESN.

(b) The ESN host component must be permanently attached to a main circuit board of the mobile transmitter and the integrity
of the unit's operating software must not be alterable. The ESN must be isolated from fraudulent contact and tampering.
If the ESN host component does not contain other information, that component must not be removable, and its electrical
connections must not be accessible. If the ESN host component contains other information, the ESN must be encoded
using one or more of the following techniques:

(1) Multiplication or division by a polynomial;

(2) Cyclic coding;

(3) The spreading of ESN bits over various non-sequential memory locations.

(c) The ESN must be factory set and must not be alterable, transferable, removable or otherwise able to be manipulated.
Cellular mobile equipment must be designed such that any attempt to remove, tamper with, or change the ESN chip, its
logic system, or firmware originally programmed by the manufacturer will render the mobile transmitter inoperative.



 22.923

Cellular system configuration.



Mobile stations communicate with and through base transmitters only. Base transmitters communicate with mobile
stations directly or through cellular repeaters. Auxiliary test stations may communicate with base or mobile stations
for the purpose of testing equipment.



 22.925

Prohibition on airborne operation of cellular telephones.



Cellular telephones installed in or carried aboard airplanes, balloons or any other type of aircraft must not be operated
while such aircraft are airborne (not touching the ground). When any aircraft leaves the ground, all cellular telephones
on board that aircraft must be turned off. The following notice must be posted on or near each cellular telephone installed
in any aircraft:

``The use of cellular telephones while this aircraft is airborne is prohibited by FCC rules, and the violation of this
rule could result in suspension of service and/or a fine. The use of cellular telephones while this aircraft is on the
ground is subject to FAA regulations.''



 22.927

Responsibility for mobile stations.



Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a cellular system, when receiving service from that cellular
system, are considered to be operating under the authorization of that cellular system. Cellular system licensees
are responsible for exercising effective operational control over mobile stations receiving service through their
cellular systems. Mobile stations that are subscribers in good standing to a cellular system, while receiving service
from a different cellular system, are considered to be operating under the authorization of such different system.
The licensee of such different system is responsible, during such temporary period, for exercising effective operational
control over such mobile stations as if they were subscribers to it.

 22.929 

Application requirements for the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.


In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this part, applications for authorization in the Cellular
Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable supplementary information described in this section. Initial
applications for new cellular systems must also comply with  22.953.
(a) 

Administrative information.

 The following information is required either by FCC Form 401, Schedule C, or as an exhibit.
(1) The number of transmitter sites for which authorization is requested;
(2) The call sign(s) of other facilities in the same area that are ultimately controlled by the real party in interest
to the application;
(3) If the application involves a service area boundary (SAB) extension (see  22.912), a statement as to whether
the five year build-out period for the system on the relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB extends
has elapsed, and whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in that market.
(b) 

Technical information.

 The following information is required by FCC Form 401, Schedule C.
(1) Location description; city; county; state; geographical coordinates correct to 

#

1 second, the datum used (NAD 27 and NAD 83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent market boundaries
and international borders;
(2) Antenna manufacturer, model number and type, antenna height to tip above ground level, the height of the center

of the wave emitted by the antenna when installed as proposed;
(3) The channel block requested, the maximum effective radiated power, the effective radiated power in each of the
cardinal radial directions.
(c) 

Maps.

 If the application proposes a change in the CGSA, it must include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering,
as described in  22.953(a)(5)(i) through (iii).



 22.933 

Cellular system compatibility specification.



Except as provided in  22.901(d), equipment used in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must be designed in
compliance with the technical specifications for compatibility of mobile and base stations in the Cellular Radiotelephone
Service contained in ``Cellular System Mobile Station-Land Station Compatibility Specification'' (April 1981
Ed.), Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin No. 53. This bulletin is contained in Appendix D to the 

Report and Order

 in CC Docket No. 79-318, and was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 21, 1981. Copies may be obtained from the FCC's copying contractor. Special operational features that have
been developed by joint industry consensus through the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and established
as a TIA standard may be activated at the option of the cellular licensee, provided that the compatibility of equipment
within the Cellular Radiotelephone Service as specified in OET Bulletin No. 53 is not adversely affected.



 22.935 

Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings.



The procedures in this section apply to comparative renewal proceedings in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

(a) If one or more applications competing with an application for renewal of a cellular authorization are filed, the
renewal applicant must file with the FCC an original and four copies of its renewal expectancy showing. This filing
must be submitted no later than 60 days after the date of the Public Notice listing as acceptable for filing the renewal
application and the competing applications.

(b) Interested parties may file petitions to deny any of the mutually exclusive applications. Any such petitions
to deny must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal expectancy
showing. Applicants may file replies to any petitions to deny applications that are filed. Any such replies must be
filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) to deny was filed. No further pleadings will be accepted.

(c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing applications will be designated for a two-step procedure.
An Administrative Law Judge (Presiding Judge) will conduct a threshold hearing (step one), in which both the licensee
and the competing applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant deserves a renewal expectancy.
If the order designating the applications for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee,
those issues will be tried in this threshold hearing. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant
is basically qualified and due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be found ineligible for further
consideration and their applications will be denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant
does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all of the applications will be considered in
a comparative hearing (step two).

(d) Any competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold hearing (step one), if such applicant demonstrates
that its proposal so far exceeds the service already being provided that there would be no purpose in making a threshold
determination as to whether the renewal applicant deserved a renewal expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing applicant.
Any such waiver request must be filed at the time the requestor's application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver
requests may be filed. Any such petitions must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant
submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Replies to any petitions opposing such waiver requests may be filed. Any
such replies must be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) were filed. No further pleadings
will be accepted. Any waiver request submitted pursuant to this paragraph will be acted upon prior to designating
the applications for hearing. If a request to waive the threshold hearing (step one) is granted, the renewal expectancy
issue will be designated as part of the comparative hearing (step two), and will remain the most important comparative
factor in deciding the case, as provided in  22.940(a).

(e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the threshold (step one) that denies the licensee a renewal expectancy,
all of the applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed to file direct cases no later than 90 days after the
release date of the Presiding Judge's ruling. Rebuttal cases must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that
the direct cases were filed.

(f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures delineated in this paragraph in both threshold
(step one) and comparative (step two) hearings conducted in comparative cellular renewal proceedings.

(1) The Presiding Judge will schedule a first hearing session as soon as practicable after the date for filing rebuttal
evidence. This first session will be an evidentiary admission session at which each applicant will identify and offer
its previously circulated direct and rebuttal exhibits, and each party will have an opportunity to lodge objections.

(2) After accepting the exhibits into evidence, the Presiding Judge will entertain motions to cross-examine and
rule whether any sponsoring witness needs to be produced for cross-examination.

<TEXT>
 

Determination of what, if any, cross-examination is necessary is within the sound judicial discretion of the Presiding
Judge, the prevailing standard being whether the person requesting cross-examination has persuasively demonstrated
that written evidence is ineffectual to develop proof. If cross-examination is necessary, the Presiding Judge will
specify a date for the appearance of all witnesses. In addition, if the designation order points out an area where additional
underlying data is needed, the Presiding Judge will have the authority to permit the limited use of discovery procedures.
Finally, the Presiding Judge may find that certain additional testimony or cross-examination is needed to provide
a complete record for the FCC. If so, the Presiding Judge may schedule a further session.

(3) After the hearing record is closed, the Presiding Judge may request Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions
of Law to be filed no later than 30 days after the final hearing session. Replies are not permitted except in unusual
cases and then only with respect to the specific issues named by the Presiding Judge.

(4) The Presiding Judge will then issue an Initial Decision, preferably within 60 days of receipt of the last pleadings.
If mutually exclusive applications are before the Presiding Judge, the Presiding Judge will determine which applicant
is best qualified. The Presiding Judge may also rank the applicants in order of merit if there are more than two.

(5) Parties will have 30 days in which to file exceptions to the Initial Decision. The Common Carrier Bureau has authority
to determine, at the time of designation for hearing, that such exceptions will be taken directly to the FCC rather
than to the Review Board.



 22.936 

Dismissal of applications in cellular renewal proceedings.



Any applicant that has filed an application in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service that is mutually exclusive with
an application for renewal of a cellular authorization (competing application), and seeks to resolve the mutual
exclusivity by requesting dismissal of its application, must obtain the approval of the FCC.

(a) If a competing applicant seeks to dismiss its application prior to the Initial Decision stage of the hearing on
its application, it must submit to the FCC a request for approval of the dismissal of its application, a copy of any written
agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:

(1) A certification that neither the petitioner nor its principals has received or will receive any money or other
consideration in excess of legitimate and prudent expenses in exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the application,
except that this provision does not apply to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to 

bona fide

 merger agreements;

(2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or promised;

(3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks reimbursement; and

(4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal of the application.

(b) In addition, within 5 days of the filing date of the applicant or petitioner's request for approval, each remaining
party to any written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:

(1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals has paid or will pay money or other consideration
in excess of the legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for withdrawing or dismissing the application;
and

(2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or dismissal of the application.

(c) For the purposes of this section:

(1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by the filing party, if an individual, a partner having
personal knowledge of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge of the facts, if a corporation
or association.

(2) Applications are deemed to be pending before the FCC from the time the application is filed with the FCC until such
time as an order of the FCC granting, denying or dismissing the application is no longer subject to reconsideration
by the FCC or to review by any court.

(3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing,
prosecuting and/or settling its application for which reimbursement is sought.

(4) ``Other consideration'' consists of financial concessions, including, but not limited to, the transfer of assets
or the provision of tangible pecuniary benefit, as well as non-financial concessions that confer any type of benefit
on the recipient.



 22.937 

Demonstration of financial qualifications.



Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, each applicant for a new cellular system must demonstrate
that it has, at the time the application is filed, either a separate market-specific firm financial commitment or
available financial resources sufficient to construct and operate for one year the proposed cellular system. Each
application of reassignment of license or consent to transfer of control must demonstrate the financial ability
of the proposed assignee or transferee to acquire and operate the facilities.

(a) 

Estimated costs.

 The demonstration required by this section must include a realistic and prudent estimate of the costs of construction,
operating and other initial expenses for one year.

(b) 

Source of financing.

 The firm financial commitment must be obtained from a state or federally chartered bank or savings and loan association,
another recognized financial institution, or the financial arm of a capital equipment supplier. The firm financial
commitment may be contingent upon the applicant's obtaining an authorization.

(c) 

Lender's statement.

 The firm financial commitment must contain a statement that:

net current assets to construct and operate for one year the proposed cellular system; and,

(3) A certification by the applicant or an officer of the applicant organization attesting to the validity of the unaudited
balance sheet. 

(e) 

Parent corporation financing. 

Applicants relying upon financing obtained from parent corporations must submit the showings listed in paragraph
(d) of this section as the information pertains to the parent corporation. 

(f) 

Notice upon default. 

In addition to the disclosures required by paragraph (c) of this section, any loan or other credit arrangement providing
for a chattel mortgage or secured interest in any proposed cellular system must include a provision for a minimum of
ten (10) days prior written notification to the licensee, and to the FCC, before any such equipment may be repossessed
under default provision of the agreement. 

(g) 

Competing applications in cellular renewal proceedings. 

Initial cellular applications that are competing against a cellular renewal application are subject to the rules
in this paragraph instead of the rules in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section. 

(1) Any applicant filing a competing application against a cellular renewal application must demonstrate, at the
time it files its application, that it has either: 

(i) A firm financial commitment, an irrevocable letter of credit or performance bond in the amount of its realistic
and prudent estimated costs of construction and any other expenses to be incurred during the first year of operating
its proposed system (the irrevocable letter of credit or performance bond must be from the type of financial institution
described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section); or,

(ii) Available resources, as defined in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, necessary to construct and operate its
proposed cellular system for one year. 

(2) The firm financial commitment may be contingent on the applicant obtaining an authorization. The applicant must
also list all of its realistic and prudent estimated costs of construction and any other expenses to be incurred during
the first year of operating its proposed system. 

(3) The firm financial commitment required above shall be obtained from a state or federally chartered bank or savings
and loan association, another recognized financial institution, or the financial arm of a capital equipment supplier;
shall specify the terms of the loan or other form of credit arrangement, including the amount to be borrowed, the interest
to be paid, the amount of the commitment fee and the fact that it has been paid, the terms of repayment and any collateral
required; and shall contain a statement:

(i) That the lender has examined the financial conditions of the applicant, including audited financial statements
where applicable, and has determined that the applicant is creditworthy;

<TEXT>
 

(5) Applicant intending to rely upon financing obtained through a parent corporation must submit the information
required by paragraph (g)(4) of this section, as the information pertains to the parent corporation.
(6) As an alternative to relying upon a firm financial commitment, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a performance
bond from a financial institution as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, an applicant may state that it
has placed in an escrow account sufficient cash to meet its construction and first-year operating expenses. Such
a statement must specify the amount of cash, the escrow account number and the financial institution where the escrow
account is located.
(7) Any competing application filed against the renewal application of an incumbent cellular licensee that does
not demonstrate, at the time it is initially filed, that the competing applicant has sufficient funds to construct
and operate for one year its proposed cellular system will be dismissed.
(h) 

Exemptions. 

Any licensee applying for an unserved area adjacent to its existing cellular system, to integrate such area into the
existing system, is exempt from the financial demonstration requirements of this section. In addition, modification
applications and 

pro forma 

assignment and transfer of control applications are exempt from the financial demonstration requirements of this
section.


 22.939

Site availability requirements for applications competing with cellular renewal applications.


In addition to the other requirements set forth in this part for initial cellular applications, any application competing
against a cellular renewal application must contain, when initially filed, appropriate documentation demonstrating
that its proposed antenna site(s) will be available. Competing applications that do not include such documentation
will be dismissed. If the competing applicant does not own a particular site, it must, at a minimum demonstrate that
the site is available to it by providing a letter from the owner of the proposed antenna site expressing the owner's
intent to sell or lease the proposed site to the applicant. If any proposed antenna site is under U.S. Government control,
the applicant must submit written confirmation of the site's availability from the appropriate Government agency.
Applicants which file competing applications against incumbent cellular licensees may not rely on the assumption
that an incumbent licensee's antenna sites are available for their use.


 22.940

Criteria for comparative cellular renewal proceedings.


This section sets forth criteria to be used in comparative cellular renewal proceedings. The ultimate issue in comparative
renewal proceedings will be to determine, in light of the evidence adduced in the proceeding, what disposition of
the applications would best serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.
(a) 

Renewal expectancies. 

The most important comparative factor to be considered in a comparative cellular renewal proceeding is a major preference,
commonly referred to as a ``renewal expectancy.''
(1) The cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative renewal proceeding will receive a renewal expectancy,
if its past record for the relevant license period demonstrates that:
(i) The renewal applicant has provided ``substantial'' service during its past license term. ``Substantial'' service
is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above a level of mediocre service which just might
minimally warrant renewal; and
(ii) The renewal applicant has substantially compiled with applicable FCC rules, policies and the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended.
(2) In order to establish its right to a renewal expectancy, a cellular renewal applicant involved in a comparative
renewal proceeding must submit a showing explaining why it should receive a renewal expectancy. At a minimum, this
showing must include.
(i) A description of its current service in terms of geographic coverage and population served, as well as the system's
ability to accommodate the needs of roamers;
(ii) An explanation of its record of expansion, including a timetable of the construction of new cell sites to meet
changes in demand for cellular service;
(iii) A description of its investments in its cellular system; and
(iv) Copies of all FCC orders finding the licensee to have violated the Communications Act or any FCC rule or policy;
and a list of any pending proceedings that relate to any matter described in this paragraph.
(3) In making its showing of entitlement to a renewal expectancy, a renewal applicant may claim credit for any system
modification applications that were pending on the date it filed its renewal application. Such credit will not be
allowed if the modification application is dismissed or denied.
(b) 

Additional comparative issues. 

The following additional comparative issues will be included in comparative cellular renewal proceedings, if a
full comparative hearing is conducted pursuant to  22.935(c).
(1) To determine on a comparative basis the geographic areas and population that each applicant proposes to serve;
to determine and compare the relative demand for the services proposed in said areas; and to determine and compare
the ability of each applicant's cellular system to accommodate the anticipated demand for both local and roamer service;
(2) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's proposal for expanding its system capacity in a coordinated
manner in order to meet anticipated increasing demand for 

both 

local and roamer service;
(3) To determine on a comparative basis the nature and extent of the service proposed by each applicant, including
each applicant's proposed rates, charges, maintenance, personnel, practices, classifications, regulations
and facilities (including switching capabilities); and
(4) To determine on a comparative basis each applicant's past performance in the cellular industry or another business
of comparable type and size.
(c) 

Additional showings for competing applications. 

With respect to evidence introduced pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, any applicant filing a competing
application against a cellular renewal application (competing applicant) who claims a preference for offering
any service not currently offered by the incumbent licensee must demonstrate that there is demand for that new service
and also present a business plan showing that the competing applicant can operate the system economically. Any competing
applicant who proposes to replace analog technology with digital technology will receive no credit for its proposal
unless it submits a business plan showing how it will operate its system economically and how it will provide more comprehensive
service than does the incumbent licensee with existing and implemented cellular technology.

 22.941 

System identification numbers.



System identification numbers (SIDs) are 15 bit binary numbers assigned to cellular systems. SIDs are transmitted
by the cellular systems so that cellular mobile stations can determine whether the system through which they are communicating
is a system to which they subscribe, or whether they are considered by the system to be roamers.

(a) The FCC assigns one SID to each cellular system on its initial authorization. Cellular systems may transmit only
their assigned SID(s) and/or the SIDs assigned to other cellular systems. A cellular system may transmit the SID assigned
to another cellular system only if the licensee of that system concurs with such use of its assigned SID.

(b) Licensees must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) if their cellular systems transmit SIDs assigned to other cellular
systems. The notification must indicate the concurrence of the licensee(s) of such other systems with this use of
their assigned SID(s). The notification must be mailed or delivered to the filing place (see  22.106) no later
than 15 days after the system begins transmitting the SID(s).

(c) Licensees may request that an additional (previously unassigned) SID be assigned to their system by filing an
application for minor modification of station (FCC Form 401).



 22.942 

Limitations on interests in licensees for both channel blocks in an area.



No person may have a direct or indirect ownership interest in licensees for both channel blocks in overlapping cellular
geographic service areas (CGSAs), unless such interests pose no substantial threat to competition. A licensee,
a person that owns a controlling interest in a licensee, or a person that actually controls a licensee for one channel
block in a CGSA must not have any direct or indirect ownership interest in the licensee, a person that owns a controlling
interest in a licensee, or a person that actually controls a licensee for the other channel block in an overlapping
CGSA.

(a) A direct or indirect ownership interest of 5% or less in both systems is automatically excluded from the general
rule prohibiting multiple ownership interests. Interests of less than 5% are considered and are not excluded from
the general rule prohibiting multiple ownership interests in cases of persons or entities that own a small percentage
of the licensee but nonetheless actually control the licensee, a person that owns a controlling interest in the licensee,
or a person that actually controls the licensee.

(b) Divestiture of interests as a result of a transfer of control or assignment of authorization must occur prior to
consummating the transfer or assignment. 



 22.943 

Limitations on assignments and transfers of cellular authorizations.



The following limitations apply to applications for consent to transfer of control or assignment of authorizations
in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service.

(a) 

Trafficking.

 Applications for consent to transfer of control or assignment of authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service
are subject to the provisions of  22.139, except for:

(1) Applications reflecting the trading of an ownership interest in an authorized but unconstructed cellular system
in one market for a commensurate interest in a cellular system in another market; and, 

(2) Applications for consent to transfer of control or assignment of a cellular authorization obtained by random
selection, after commencement of service.

(b) 

Unserved area systems.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for consent
to transfer of control or assignment of the authorization of a cellular system licensed to serve an unserved area until
the system has provided service to subscribers for at least one year.

(1) Licensees must not enter into any agreement (e.g. option agreement or management contract) to transfer control
of the licensee of the system until the system has provided service to subscribers for one year.

(2) The FCC may accept that grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of authorization
if the transfer or assignment is 

pro forma

 and does not involve a change in ownership.

(c) 

Systems authorized as result of comparative renewal proceeding.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications
for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization of a cellular system that has been acquired
by the current licensee for the first time as a result of a comparative renewal proceeding until the system has provided
service to subscribers for at least three years.

(1) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization
of a cellular system that is to be transferred as a part of a 

bona fide

 sale of an on-going business to which the cellular operation is incidental.

(2) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of the authorization
of a cellular system that is to be transferred as a result of the death of the licensee.

(3) The FCC may accept and grant applications for consent to transfer of control or for assignment of authorization
if the transfer or assignment is 

pro forma

 and does not involve a change in ownership.

 22.944 

Transfers of interests in applications.



This section governs transfers of interest in applicants having a pending application for a new cellular system.
For the purposes of this section, ``interest in an application'' means interest in the applicant.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the transfer of any interest in any application for initial
authorization to operate a cellular system is prohibited. For the purposes of this section, transfer of interest
means the sale, assignment, placement of equity or convertible debt, grant of an option or future share or participation
in the applicant or any interest thereof.

(b) The following types of transfers of interest in cellular applications are permitted:

(1) Transfers that are necessary to raise capital, including the placement of debt or equity, to finance a 

bona fide 

business need of the applicant or an affiliated company, not related to the cellular application or financing of the
cellular system proposed therein;

(2) Transfers that are part of a 

bona fide 

sale of an ongoing business to which the cellular applications are merely adjunct or incidental;

(3) Transfers required by a court-ordered decree granting a divorce or enforcing a spousal separation agreement;

(4) Transfers necessitated by the death of the applicant;

(5) Transfers involving the routine trading of shares in a publicly traded corporation that do not constitute a transfer
of control of the applicant;

(6) Transfers resulting from 

pro forma 

transfers of control of the applicant, not involving changes in ownership;

(7) Transfers involving only the transfer of interest by one existing partner in a partnership applicant to another
existing partner in that same partnership, or between existing shareholders in a closely-held corporation, which
does not effect a transfer of control of the applicant;

(8) Transfers resulting from the alienation or exercise of stock warrants or stock options that existed prior to the
filing of the application.



 22.945 

Interests in multiple applications.



This section governs interests in applicants with mutually exclusive applications for a new cellular system. For
the purposes of this section, ``interest in an application'' means interest in the applicant.

(a) 

General. 

Except as otherwise provided in this section, parties must not have any interest, direct or indirect, in more than
one application for authority to operate a new cellular system in the same cellular market.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Abutting CGSAs

. Licensees of existing systems whose cellular geographic service area (CGSA) abuts a proposed CGSA may each file
one application that is mutually exclusive with the applications of other such licensees, even though they share
common owners, provided that such licensees do not thereby acquire a simultaneous interest in applications for both
channel blocks in any geographical area.
(c) 

Publicly traded corporate applicants

. Parties must not have any interest, direct or indirect, in more than one mutually exclusive initial application
for which the applicant is a publicly traded corporation, except that ownership interests of less than 5% are not considered.
Ownership and other interests in applicants are attributed to their holder and deemed cognizable as set forth below.
(1) 

Passive investors

. Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through
their trust departments in trust accounts are deemed to have a cognizable interest in a publicly traded cellular applicant
only if they hold 10% or more of the stock of the applicant. This provision applies only if an applicant in which such
parties hold an interest certifies in its application that no such party has exerted or attempted to exert any influence
or control over the officers of the applicant.
(2) 

Multiplier

. Attribution of ownership interests in a publicly traded cellular applicant that are held indirectly by any party
through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages
for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting
product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent, it is not included
in the multiplication.


 22.946

Service commencement and construction periods for cellular systems.


This section specifies the service commencement and construction periods and related requirements for cellular
systems.
(a) 

Commencement of service

. New cellular systems must be at least partially constructed and begin providing cellular service to subscribers
within the service commencement periods specified in Table H-1 of this section. Service commencement periods
begin on the date of grant of the initial authorization, and are not extended by the grant of subsequent authorizations
for the cellular system (such as for major modifications).

(1) To satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a cellular system must be interconnected with the
public switched telephone network (PSTN) and must be providing service to mobile stations operated by its subscribers
and roamers. A cellular system is not considered to be providing service to subscribers if mobile stations can not
make telephone calls to landline telephones and receive telephone calls from landline telephones through the PSTN,
or if the system intentionally serves only roamer stations.

(2) The licensee must notify the FCC (FCC Form 489) no later than 15 days after the requirements of paragraph (a) of this
section are met.

(b) 

Construction period for specific facilities.

 The construction period applicable to specific new or modified cellular facilities for which an authorization has
been granted is one year from the date the authorization is granted. Failure to comply with this requirement results
in termination of the authorization for the specific new or modified facility, pursuant to  22.144(b).



 22.947 

Five year build-out period.



The licensee of the first cellular system authorized on each channel block in each cellular market is afforded a five
year period, beginning on the date the initial authorization for the system is granted, during which it may expand
the system within that market.

(a) 

Exclusive right to expand within market.

 Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the FCC does not accept applications for authority to operate
a new cellular system in any unserved area in a market on a channel block during the five year build-out period.

(b) 

Partitioned markets.

 During the five year build-out period, the licensee of the first cellular system on each channel block in each market
may enter into contracts with eligible parties, allowing such parties to apply (FCC Form 401) for a new cellular system
on that channel block within the market. The FCC may grant such applications if they are in compliance with the rules
in this part. Markets with two or more authorized cellular systems on the same channel block during the five year build-out
period are referred to (with respect to the affected channel block) as ``partitioned markets''.

(1) Partitioning contracts must define the CGSA of the subsequent cellular system in accordance with  22.911,
including any expansion rights ceded. If not exercised, any such expansion rights terminate at the end of the five
year build-out period.

(2) The five year build-out period begins on the date the initial authorization for the first cellular system is granted,
and is not extended or affected in any way by the initial authorization of any subsequent cellular systems pursuant
to paragraph (b) of this section.

(c) 

System information update.

 Sixty days before the end of the five year build-out period, the licensee of each cellular system authorized on each
channel block in each cellular market must file, in triplicate, a system information update (SIU), comprising a full
size map, a reduced map, and an exhibit showing technical data relevant to determination of the system's CGSA. Separate
maps must be submitted for each market into which the CGSA extends, showing the extension area in the adjacent market.
Maps showing extension areas must be labeled (i.e. marked with the market number and channel block) for the market
into which the CGSA extends. SIUs must accurately depict the relevant cell locations and coverage of the system at
the end of the five year build-out period. SIUs must be filed at the Mobile Services Division, Common Carrier Bureau,
Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. If any changes to the system occur after the filing of the
SIU, but before the end of the five year build-out period, the licensee must file, in triplicate, additional maps and/or
data as necessary to insure that the cell locations and coverage of the system as of the end of the five year build-out
period are accurately depicted.

(1) The scale of the full-size map must be 1:500,000, regardless of whether any different scale is used for the reduced
map. The map must have a legend, a distance scale and correctly labeled latitude and longitude lines. The map must be
clear and legible. The map must accurately show the cell sites (transmitting antenna locations) which determine
the CGSA, the entire CGSA, any extension of the composite service are boundary beyond the CGSA (see  22.911)
and the relevant portions of the cellular market boundary. The date on which the map depictions are accurate must appear
on the map.

(2) The reduced map must be a proportional reduction, to 81/2 x 11 inches, of the full-size map required in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section, unless it proves to be impractical to depict the entire market by reducing the full-size map.
In such instance, an 81/2 x 11 inch map of a different scale may be substituted, provided that the required features
of the full-size map are clearly depicted and labeled.



 22.949 

Unserved area licensing process.



This section sets forth the process for licensing unserved areas in cellular markets on channel blocks for which the
five year build-out period has expired. This process has two phases: Phase I and Phase II.

(a) 

Phase I.

 Phase I is a one-time process that provides an opportunity for eligible parties to file competing applications for
authority to operate a new cellular system in or to expand an existing cellular system into unserved areas (Phase I
initial applications) as soon as these areas become available. In addition, each licensee whose Phase I initial application
is granted is afforded one opportunity during the Phase I process to file an application proposing major modifications
to the cellular system authorized by that grant (a Phase I major modification application), without being subject
to competing applications.

(1) Phase I initial applications must be filed on the 31st day after the expiration of the five year build-out period
of the authorized system(s) on the channel block requested in the market containing the unserved area.

(i) Each Phase I application must request authorization for one and only one cellular geographic service area (CGSA)
in one and only one cellular market.

(ii) Applicants must not file more than one Phase I initial application for any cellular market.

(iii) Phase I initial applications must not propose any 

de minimis

 or contract service area boundary (SAB) extensions.

(2) Only one Phase I initial application is granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, whenever two
or more acceptable Phase I initial applications are timely-filed in the same market on the same channel block, such
Phase I initial applications are mutually exclusive, regardless of any other considerations such as the technical
proposals. In order to determine which of such mutually exclusive Phase I initial applications to grant, the Commission
administers random selection procedures in accordance with part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application
of the tentative selectee may be granted and the applications excluded by that grant may be dismissed without prejudice.

(3) Phase I major modification applications (applications filed during Phase I that propose major modifications
to cellular systems authorized by the grant of Phase I initial applications) must be filed no later than 90 days after
the grant of the Phase I initial application. Each Phase I licensee may file only one Phase I major modification application.
The FCC will not accept any competing applications in response to a Phase I major modification application. Phase
I licensees may not sell to a third party any rights to apply for unserved area.

<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00166 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) Phase I major modification applications may propose 

de minimis

 or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into an adjacent market may be proposed only if,
at the time the Phase I major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent market (on the requested
channel block) has the right to enter into such a contract (see  22.912(c)).

(ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed
CGSA, provided that the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of  22.951.

(4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or notifications of minor modifications to its system. However,
such minor modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum coverage requirement of  22.951.

(b) 

Phase II

. Phase II is an open-ended filing process that allows eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain
in a market after the Phase I process is complete.

(1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications (applications
for authority to operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that market and channel block may be
filed on or after the 121st day after the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications are granted
for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st
day after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no Phase I initial applications are received for
a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 32nd
day after the expiration of the relevant five-year build-out period.

(2) There is no limit the number of Phase II applications that may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently,
Phase II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Furthermore, only mutually
exclusive Phase II applications with the same filing date are entitled to inclusion in a random selection process.
Where all mutually exclusive Phase II applications have different filing dates, the FCC may grant the earliest-filed
application and dismiss all applications excluded by that grant. For the purposes of this section, the filing date
of an application is the date on which that application was received or the date on which the most recently filed major
amendment to that application was received.

(3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one cellular market. Each Phase II application must
request authorization for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose 

de minimis 

and contract SAB extensions.

(c) 

Settlements

. Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually exclusive applications for unserved areas (partial
settlements) are prohibited. Settlements among all applicants with mutually exclusive applications (full settlements)
are allowed and must be filed no later than 15 business days before the random selection process is scheduled to take
place.

(d) 

Limitations on amendments.

 Notwithstanding the provisions of  22.122, Phase I applications are subject to the following additional limitations
in regard to the filing of amendments.

(1) The FCC will not accept amendments (of any type) to mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion
of the random selection process.

(2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I applications.

(3) Minor amendments required by  1.65 of this chapter must be filed no later than 30 days after public notice
announcing the results of the random selection process.



 22.951

Minimum coverage requirement.



Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee
of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular geographical service area
(CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the
minimum coverage requirement. However, area within 

de minimis

 SAB extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. Applications for authority to operate a new
cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved
area, must not propose coverage of water areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), except
for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA.



 22.953

Subpart I_Offshore Radiotelephone Service



 22.1001 

Scope.



The rules in this subpart govern the licensing and operation of offshore radiotelephone stations. The licensing
and operation of these stations and systems is also subject to rules elsewhere in this part that apply generally to
the public mobile services. However, in case of conflict, the rules in this subpart govern.



 22.1003 

Eligibility.



Offshore central station licenses may be licensed to communications common carriers. Offshore subscriber stations
may be licensed to common carriers or users of the service. 



 22.1005 

Priority of service.



Facilities in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service are intended primarily for rendition of public message service
between offshore subscriber and central stations. However, they may also be used to render private leased line communication
service, provided that such usage does not reduce or impair the extent or quality of communication service which would
be available, in the absence of private leased line service, to the general public receiving or subsequently requesting
public message service from an offshore central station.



 22.1007 

Channels for offshore radiotelephone systems.



The channels listed in this section are allocated for paired assignment to transmitters located in the specified
geographical zones that provide offshore radiotelephone service. All channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are
designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.

(a) 

Zone A_Southern Louisiana.

 The geographical area in Zone A is bounded as follows:




From longitude W.87

 22.1009

 Transmitter locations.


The rules in this section establish limitations on the locations from which stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone
Service may transmit.
(a) 

All stations.

 Offshore stations must not transmit from locations outside the boundaries of the appropriate zones specified in
 22.1007. Offshore stations must not transmit from locations within 241 kilometers (150 miles) of any full-service
television station that transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore station transmits.
(b) 

Airborne subscriber stations.

 Airborne subscriber stations must not transmit from altitudes exceeding 305 meters (1000 feet) above mean sea level.
Airborne mobile stations in Zone A must not transmit from locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Lake Charles,
Louisiana. Airborne mobile stations in Zone B must not transmit from locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of
Lafayette, Louisiana. Airborne mobile stations in Zone C must not transmit from locations within 129 kilometers
(80 miles) of Corpus Christi or locations within 129 kilometers (80 miles) of Houston, Texas.


 22.1011

 Antenna height limitations.


The antenna height of offshore stations must not exceed 61 meters (200 feet) above mean sea level. The antenna height
of offshore surface mobile stations must not exceed 10 meters (30 feet) above the waterline.


 22.1013

 Effective radiated power limitations.


The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service must not exceed the limits
in this section.
(a) 

Maximum power.

 The ERP of transmitters in this service must not exceed 1000 Watts under any circumstances.
(b) 

Mobile transmitters.

 The ERP of mobile transmitters must not exceed 100 Watts. The ERP of mobile transmitters, when located within 32 kilometers
(20 miles) of the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit, must not exceed 25 Watts. The ERP of airborne mobile stations must not
exceed 1 Watt.
(c) 

Protection for TV Reception.

 The ERP limitations in this paragraph are intended to reduce the likelihood that interference to television reception
from offshore radiotelephone operations will occur.
(1) 

Co-channel protection.

 The ERP of offshore stations must not exceed the limits in Table I-1 of this section. The limits depend upon the
height above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the antenna location of
the offshore transmitter and the antenna location of the main transmitter of the nearest full-service television
station that transmits on the TV channel containing the channel on which the offshore station transmits.
(2) 

Adjacent channel protection.

 The ERP of offshore stations located within 128.8 kilometers (80 miles) of the main transmitter antenna of a full service
TV station that transmits on a TV channel adjacent to the TV channel which contains the channel on which the offshore
station transmits must not exceed the limits in the Table I-2 of  22.1015. The limits depend upon the height
above mean sea level of the offshore transmitting antenna and the distance between the location of the offshore transmitter
and the 4.8 kilometer (3 mile) limit.

Offshore central stations must communicate only with subscriber stations (fixed, temporary-fixed, mobile and
airborne). Offshore subscriber stations must normally communicate only with and through offshore central stations.
Stations in the Offshore Radiotelephone Service may communicate through relay stations authorized in this service.


 22.1031

Temporary fixed stations.


The FCC may, upon proper application therefor, authorize the construction and operation of temporary fixed stations
in the Offshore Radiotelephone service to be used only when the service of permanent fixed stations is disrupted by
storms or emergencies or is otherwise unavailable.
(a) 

Six month limitation.

 If it is necessary for a temporary fixed station to remain at the same location for more than six months, the licensee
of that station must apply for authorization to operate the station at the specific location at least 30 days before
the end of the six month period.
(b) 

International communications.

 Communications between the United States and Mexico must not be carried using a temporary fixed station without prior
authorization from the FCC. Licensees desiring to carry such communications should apply sufficiently in advance
to allow for the time necessary to coordinate with Canada or Mexico.

SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the Department's regulations on direct grant programs and State-administered programs to
clarify the requirements and procedures for establishing and applying indirect cost rates under programs administered
by the Department. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 14, 1994, the Secretary published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 2480) a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to revise certain sections in the Education Department
General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) on indirect cost rates. These proposed revisions were intended to improve
the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for grantees the procedures and requirements of the Department.




The proposed regulations addressed a number of problems in this area of grants administration, including the computation
and use of restricted indirect cost rates in programs with a statutory supplement-not-supplant requirement, the
definition of a training grant, and the use of indirect costs as matching or cost-sharing. 

Significant differences between the NPRM and this final regulation include changes to   75.561 and 76.561
to allow State educational agencies to approve multi-year indirect cost rates for local educational agencies, the
deletion of research training programs from the definition of a training grant in  75.562, and the inclusion
of a definition of ``modified total direct cost base,'' also in  75.562. 



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 21 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the resulting changes in the regulations follows. 

Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other
minor 
changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are
not addressed. 



Section 75.560 General Indirect Cost Rates; Exceptions 



Since the Department recently adopted the revised OMB Circular A-110 as 34 CFR Part 74, references in this section
have been revised to be consistent with the new Part 74. 



Comments:

 Several parties commented on the requirement that a recipient have a current indirect cost rate agreement to charge
indirect costs to a grant, asking what should happen if a recipient has submitted an indirect cost proposal but has
not received approval from the Department. One suggested that the Department should assign an indirect cost rate
based on the applicant's last approved rate and another thought the applicant should be allowed to use its proposed
rate. 



Discussion:

 The Department now allows six months to review a rate proposal and negotiate a new rate, which is generally adequate
time to complete the process. If for some reason a rate has not been approved on time, the use of a temporary rate would
be considered by the Department. Since other changes to these regulations give the Department authority to establish
temporary rates, no additional changes concerning temporary rates are necessary. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Another commenter asked about the effect of the proposed regulations on contractors under a grant and whether this
section requires contractors to obtain a rate, including a temporary rate if necessary, from the Department.

Discussion:

 Many contractors already have a negotiated indirect cost rate because they are direct recipients of Federal funds.
Under current procedures State and local governments are expected to assign an indirect cost rate to a contractor
or other lower tier organization that does not already have one. Thus State educational agencies assign rates to their
local educational agencies (see  75.561). These regulations do nothing to change these practices and contractors
or other lower tier organizations are not expected to negotiate a rate with the Department. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 75.561 Approval of indirect cost rates. 





Comments:

 Several commenters were confused by the statement in  75.561(c) that the Secretary approves indirect cost
rate agreements, an apparent conflict with the practice of the cognizant agency negotiating a rate with an applicant.




Discussion:

 The Secretary does negotiate indirect cost rates with applicants, but only when the Department is the cognizant agency.
A change has been made to clarify this paragraph. 



Changes:

 Section 75.561(a) has been revised to make it clear that the Secretary approves indirect cost rates for applicants
when the Department is the cognizant agency. 



Comments:

 One commenter suggested that State educational agencies have the same flexibility to approve multi-year indirect
cost rates as the proposed revision to  75.561 would give the Secretary. The commenter observed that it would
be more cost-effective, particularly for small local educational agencies, to have rates in effect for more than
one year. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with this comment and has made a change. 



Changes:

 Section 75.561(b) has been revised to allow State 
educational agencies to approve indirect cost rates_for local educational agencies_that are in effect for more
than one year. 



Section 75.562 Indirect cost rates for educational training projects.





Comments:

 A commenter objected to the inclusion of research training programs in the proposed definition of an educational
training grant, observing that OMB Circular A-21 specifies that research training is part of an institution's
sponsored research activities. 



Discussion:

 OMB Circular A-21, in Section B, Definition of Terms, states that the term ``sponsored research'' includes
``activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques (commonly called research training)
* * *.'' In order to be consistent with this circular, the Secretary has made a change in the definition
of an educational training grant. 



Changes:

 The phrase ``including special research training programs'' has been deleted from the definition of an educational
training grant in  75.562(a). 




Comments:

 A few commenters thought that the definition of a training grant was ambiguous and too broad. One suggested that it
be limited to grants that were designated as training grants by statute or where the grant includes such costs as tuition
and fees (so-called ``flow-through'' funds) that are used by the recipient to cover a portion of its indirect costs.
Another asked if the Secretary would be using this definition in determining which grants are training grants, as
stated in  75.562(b). 



Discussion:

 The fact that the proposed definition of a training grant is broad and comprehensive is a reflection of the great variety
of grants administered by the Department that are training grants. The definition suggested by the commenter would
overly limit the designation of training grants and exclude certain programs that clearly are primarily for the provision
of training. The intent of the definition is to provide the public with the criteria used by the Secretary in determining
what is a training grant and a change has been made to make this clear. 



Changes:

 Section 75.562(b) has been revised to indicate that the Secretary does use the definition of a training grant in paragraph
(a) in determining which grants are educational training grants. 



Comments:

 Several commenters objected to the Department's use of the eight percent limit on training grants and thought the
rate negotiated by the recipient with its cognizant agency should be employed instead. 



Discussion:

 Since its inception, the Department has consistently maintained the necessity of limiting the indirect cost rate
on training grants. This policy was originally established when the Department was a component of the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare, now the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This policy is still in effect
at HHS and is intended in part to maximize the number of projects funded under these programs. In addition, a number
of training projects contain significant amounts of flow-through funds and therefore do not carry the same burden
of overhead or administrative costs as do other projects. The Secretary does not agree that the recipients of training
grants should be reimbursed at their full negotiated rates and no change in this section has been made. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Nine comments were received on the proposed revision to  75.562(c) that would require the training rate of eight
percent to be applied to a modified total direct cost base, instead of using a base of total direct costs as in the current
regulation. Commenters opposed this change on grounds that it would further reduce a grantee's ability to recover
legitimate indirect costs under training grants and reduce the number of organizations that could afford to apply
for those grants. Several commenters also asked for a definition of ``modified total direct cost base.'' 



Discussion:

 There is general agreement in the grants community that indirect costs should not be charged to activities that do
not have significant administrative costs associated with them, such as ``flow-through funds'' (e.g., tuition,
fees, and stipends). The Secretary proposed to revise these regulations to be consistent with this principle and
to clarify for all interested parties what base should be used in computing indirect costs under a training grant.
Though this change will reduce the indirect costs charged to the Department's grants for some recipients, the Secretary
does not agree that the indirect cost base for training grants should include activities or costs that do not generate
significant administrative expenses. However, the Secretary has made a change to clarify the term ``modified total
direct cost base.'' 



Changes:

 Section 75.562(c) has been revised to include a definition of ``modified total direct cost base.'' It has also been
reworded to make it clearer that the paragraph is referring to the lesser amount of funds, not the lesser rate. 



Comments:

 One commenter stated that the eight percent limitation should not apply to contractors under training grants, as
required by  75.562(c)(1), since not all contractors are in a position to absorb the costs not covered by the
limited rate. 



Discussion:

 If the contractor is not conducting training activities, the eight percent limitation would not apply and the contractor
could use its negotiated rate. However, a contractor that is conducting training under a training grant would still
be subject to the limitation of eight percent. No change has been made in this paragraph.

Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Thirteen commenters objected to the requirement in  75.562(c)(3) that indirect costs in excess of the eight
percent limitation may not be used to satisfy cost-sharing or matching requirements. Many cited the new provision
in OMB Circular A-110 that allows the use of unrecovered indirect costs for this purpose, with the approval of
the granting agency. Commenters were concerned that this limitation would make it difficult for many competent applicants
to qualify for grants that require cost-sharing or matching. 



Discussion:

 The Department has a long-standing practice not to allow the use of unrecovered indirect costs under training grants
as matching or cost-sharing. This practice was required because under a previous version of OMB Circular A-110
and the Department's implementing regulations in 34 CFR Part 74, only 
allowable costs could be used for matching or cost-sharing purposes. Since training grants are limited to an eight
percent indirect cost rate, all indirect costs over that limit were considered unallowable and thus could not be used
as matching or cost-sharing. The practice also had the result of maximizing the funds that support project activities,
because the use of unrecovered indirect costs to meet matching or cost-sharing requirements would reduce the amount
of direct cost funds being put into the project by the recipient. 

The Department recently revised 34 CFR Part 74 to implement revisions to OMB Circular A-110. The circular and
Part 74 now allow institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, and hospitals that receive funds
under Federal programs to use unrecovered indirect costs for matching or cost-sharing, but only with the approval
of the awarding agency. In light of this change and in response to the concerns expressed by commenters, the Secretary
re-examined this practice but decided not to change it because it maximizes the impact of the limited funds available
for training grant programs. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 The Department received comments suggesting that applicants be notified as early as possible in the application
process that a program is subject to the training rate or to the restricted rate based on a statutory supplement-not-supplant
requirement. Commenters thought this information should be 
included in the application packages and also on the grant award notices. 



Discussion:

 Many programs already include this information in application packages and notices, but, in an effort to assist applicants
as much as possible, the Department will do this for the other programs as well. The issue is somewhat complicated by
the fact that some, but not all, grants awarded under certain programs may be training grants. In this case the Department
will include in the application package and notice a statement that some grants awarded under the program could be
training grants subject to the eight percent limitation on indirect costs, depending upon the type of project proposed.
The Department is already taking steps to include information in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance that
identifies those programs subject to the restricted rate based on the supplement-not-supplant requirement. As
for placing the information on the award notices, the Department is currently redesigning its core financial systems,
including the grants management system, and this information will be on award notices produced under the new system.
These notification issues were not addressed in the proposed regulations and no change has been made to include them
in the final regulations. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 A few commenters thought that the Department should exclude training grants and their indirect costs from the 
process used by the Department to establish indirect cost rates. This would have the effect of increasing the organization's
negotiated rate and would offset somewhat the loss of indirect costs under the training grants. 



Discussion:

 This issue was not included in the proposed regulations but will be considered by the Department during its periodic
reviews of administrative procedures. 



Changes:

 None. 


Section 75.563 Restricted Indirect Cost Rate_Programs Covered 





Comments:

 One commenter said that the restricted rates applicable to programs with the supplement-not-supplant requirement
should not be applied to universities that have a negotiated indirect cost rate. They suggested that   75.563
and 75.564(f) be deleted. 



Discussion:

 The Department applies a restricted rate only to grants made under programs that have a statutory requirement that
Federal funds be used to supplement, not supplant, institutional funds. If a recipient happens to be an institution
of higher education, the restricted rate must be applied_the Department has no choice on the matter because the rate
implements a statutory limitation. However, as a matter of practice, the recipients of grants under these programs
are predominately State educational agencies or local educational agencies; very few institutions of higher education
receive grants under restricted rate programs. 



Changes:

 None. 


Section 75.564 Reimbursement of Indirect Costs 





Comments:

 Several commenters thought the language in  75.564(a) was confusing and contradicts  75.564(b) and
 75.560(d). They thought  75.564(a) should be revised to make it clear that the Department accepts the
rate negotiated with an applicant's cognizant agency. 



Discussion:

 This section addresses the issue of reimbursement of indirect costs and the opening paragraph is a general statement
of the Department's policies in this area. As stated in the first sentence, there are administrative and statutory
restrictions that affect the reimbursement of indirect costs under programs administered by ED. There are also situations,
though infrequent, when indirect costs are not reimbursed due to a lack of funds. This usually occurs when a grantee
is seeking reimbursement of indirect costs because the applicable rate was adjusted upwards during or after the performance
of the grant. The Secretary agrees that the second sentence in this section is somewhat confusing and has made a change.




Changes:

 The second sentence in  75.564(a), ``The extent to which indirect costs are reimbursed is a matter for determination
between the Secretary and the grantee,'' has been deleted from the final regulation.

Comments:

 The Department received comments that construction grants and grants in support of conferences should not be included
in the list of grants in  75.564(c) for which indirect costs are unallowable. The commenters think these types
of grants do carry considerable administrative costs and ED should reimburse recipients for their indirect costs.
One commenter suggested that the language concerning conferences be revised to apply to grants made exclusively
to support conferences. 



Discussion:

 The Department does not agree that construction grants carry the same administrative costs as other types of grants.
Most of the construction work funded by those grants is carried out under subcontracts, a practice which results in
recipients incurring relatively little overhead expense in comparison to other types of grants. Also, unlike other
products of grant-supported activities, the costs of a building can be recovered through depreciation or use allowances.
Therefore no change has been made concerning construction grants, but the language on grants for conferences has
been revised. 



Changes:

 Section 75.564(c)(6) has been revised to apply to grants made exclusively to support conferences. 



Comments:

 Several commenters thought  75.564(e) prohibits the use of indirect costs to satisfy matching or cost-sharing
requirements and so should be revised or deleted as inconsistent with OMB Circulars A-21 and A-110. 



Discussion:

 The OMB circulars that serve as cost principles or administrative guidance for grant recipients all contain the requirement
that only allowable costs may be charged to a Federal grant as either direct or indirect costs. The same principle applies
to funds used for matching or cost-sharing. However, the re-statement of this principle in these regulations has
caused some confusion, particularly since a change to OMB Circular A-110, recently adopted by the Department
as 34 CFR Part 74, gives granting agencies the option of approving unrecovered indirect costs to satisfy matching
or cost-sharing requirements. The Department has therefore decided to delete the proposed  75.564(e) from
the final regulations. 

As discussed elsewhere in this document, the Department is continuing its practice of prohibiting the use of unrecovered
indirect costs to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements under training and restricted rate grants. For
grantees subject to 34 CFR Part 74, the Department will consider on a case-by-case basis requests to use unrecovered
indirect costs as matching or cost-sharing when the grant in question is not a training grant or a grant subject to a
restricted indirect cost rate. 



Changes:

 The proposed  75.564(e) has been deleted. 



Comments:

 The Department received one comment that  75.564(f) should be deleted and each member of a group of eligible
parties be allowed to apply its own indirect cost rate to its portion of the grant funds. 



Discussion:

 It has been the Department's policy on certain indirect cost matters_for example, the eight percent training rate_to
maximize the Federal funds going to support program activities. If the official recipient of the grant applies its
rate to the full award amount and each member of the group applies its full rate to its portion of the grant, as has happened
in such situations, a disproportionate amount of the grant is spent on indirect costs. Since the Department wishes
to maximize the funds supporting the direct costs of a project, it is limiting the indirect costs for grants made to
groups of eligible parties to the rate of the official grant recipient, the fiscal agent for the group. The members
of the group can decide among themselves how the funds should be divided within the group.

Changes:

 No change was made to the text of this paragraph, but, since the proposed  75.564(e) has been deleted, this paragraph
has been redesignated as  75.564(e) in these final regulations.



Section 76.560 General indirect cost rates; exceptions.



Since the Department recently adopted the revised OMB Circular A-110 as 34 CFR Part 74, references in this section
have been revised to be consistent with the new 34 CFR Part 74. 



Section 76.561 Approval of indirect cost rates.



The Department has revised this section to be consistent with the corresponding section of 34 CFR Part 75 so that State
educational agencies may approve multi-year indirect cost rates for recipients subject to 34 CFR Part 76. 



Section 76.564 Restricted indirect cost rate_formula. 



The Department has made a revision to this section to make its requirements consistent with similar requirements
in 34 CFR Part 75. Specifically,  76.564(d) has been revised to prohibit the use of unrecovered indirect costs
under a restricted rate grant to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. This change is consistent with current
departmental practices and with the restriction placed on training grants in  75.562(c)(3). 



Section 76.565 General management costs_restricted rate. 





Comments:

 Several commenters found the language in  76.565 concerning organization-wide activities to be unclear.
Some of the commenters thought that the proposed regulations did not make it clear that some activities considered
divisional administration may in fact be organization-wide activities, such as payroll or personnel functions.




Discussion:

 The Department agrees with these commenters and has changed the wording in an attempt to make the final version clearer
to readers. 



Changes:

 The wording of  76.565(a) has been changed to clarify the meaning of the term organization-wide. Section 76.565(c)
has been revised to clarify the use of the term divisional administration. 



Comments:

 One commenter said a deputy chief executive officer who oversees general management activities should not be excluded
as required in  76.565 (c) and (d). Another said that chief executive officers should be excluded only if their
activities are limited to one component. 



Discussion:

 Chief executive officers and their deputies are positions that would exist whether or not the organization received
Federal funds. To support them with Federal funds would be supplanting, which is prohibited under restricted rate
programs. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 One commenter disagreed with the definition of component in  76.565(d)(2), saying it conflicts with the generally
accepted accounting standard that an agency is a component of a State. The commenter maintains that the proposed definition
of a component as an organizational unit within an agency would prohibit States from charging legitimate administrative
costs to a grant. 



Discussion:

 As stated in  76.563, this section applies to ``agencies of State and local governments,'' most commonly the
State educational agency, not to the State itself. In this context, the component would be an organizational unit
within a State agency, as described in the regulation. No change has been made in this section. 



Changes:

 None. 


Section 76.567 Other expenditures_restricted rate. 





Comments:

 The Department received one comment that subgrants should be excluded from other expenditures, since their inclusion
would distort the indirect cost calculation and subgrants are already excluded from the base in the formula in  76.569.




Discussion:

 The Department agrees with this comment and has made a change. 



Changes:

 Section 76.567(b) has been revised to exclude subgrants from other expenditures. 



Section 76.568 Occupancy and space maintenance costs_restricted rate.





Comments:

 One commenter thought the last two sentences of  76.568(c) should be deleted as inconsistent with other Federal
guidance in OMB Circular A-87 and OASC-10, that States cannot afford to pay for the office space occupied
by Federal program staff.

Discussion:

 The sentences in question are not intended to indicate that the costs of office space for Federal program staff must
be borne by the States, nor are they inconsistent with other Federal guidance. Costs of space can be charged as indirect
or direct costs as appropriate, but Federal funds cannot be used to supplant local funds under programs with statutory
prohibitions of supplanting. The last sentence merely reiterates the standard practice that the Secretary approves
the budgets of projects supported by grant funds. No changes have been made to this section. 



Changes:

 None. 


Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 



These regulations have been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been found to contain no information
collection requirements. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States. 

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

1. The authority citation for Part 75 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474, unless otherwise noted. 




2. Section 75.129 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) and adding paragraph (a)(3), to read as follows:




 75.129 

Legal responsibilities of each member of the group. 



(a) * * * 

(1) The use of all grant funds;

(4) Commercial (for-profit) organizations, at 34 CFR 74.27; and 
(5) State and local governments and federally-recognized Indian tribal organizations, at 34 CFR 80.22. 
(b) A grantee must have a current indirect cost rate agreement to charge indirect costs to a grant. To obtain an indirect
cost rate, a grantee must submit an indirect cost proposal to its cognizant agency and negotiate an indirect cost rate
agreement. 
(c) The Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate for a grantee that does not have an indirect cost rate
agreement with its cognizant agency. 
(d) The Secretary accepts an indirect cost rate negotiated by a grantee's cognizant agency, but may establish a restricted
indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.





(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474) 



4. Section 75.561 is revised to read as follows: 


 75.561 

Approval of indirect cost rates. 


(a) If the Department of Education is the cognizant agency, the Secretary approves an indirect cost rate for a grantee
other than a local educational agency. For the purposes of this section, the term local educational agency does not
include a State agency. 
(b) Each State educational agency, on the basis of a plan approved by the Secretary, shall approve an indirect cost
rate for each local educational agency that requests it to do so. These rates may be for periods longer than a year if
rates are sufficiently stable to justify a longer period. 
(c) The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may
be approved for periods longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be sufficiently stable to justify
a longer rate period. 




(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474)



5. Section 75.562 is revised to read as follows: 


 75.562 

Indirect cost rates for educational training projects. 


(a) Educational training grants provide funding for training or other educational services. Examples of the work
supported by training grants are summer institutes, training programs for selected participants, the introduction
of new or expanded courses, and similar instructional undertakings that are separately budgeted and accounted for
by the sponsoring institution. These grants do not usually support activities involving research, development,
and dissemination of new educational materials and methods. Training grants largely implement previously developed
materials and methods and require no significant adaptation of techniques or instructional services to fit different
circumstances. 
(b) The Secretary uses the definition in paragraph (a) to determine which grants are educational training grants.


(c) Indirect cost reimbursement on a training grant is limited to the recipient's actual indirect costs, as determined
by its negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, or eight percent of a modified total direct cost base, whichever amount
is less. For the purposes of this section, a modified total direct cost base is defined as total direct costs less stipends,
tuition and related fees, and capital expenditures of $5,000 or more. 
(1) The eight percent limit also applies to cost-type contracts under grants, if these contracts are for training
as defined in this section. 
(2) The eight percent limit does not apply to agencies of State or local governments, including federally recognized
Indian tribal governments, as defined in 34 CFR 80.3. 
(3) Indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limit may not be charged directly, used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing
requirements, or charged to another Federal award. 
(d) A grantee using the training rate of eight percent is required to have documentation available for audit that shows
that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent. 




(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474) 



6. Section 75.563 is revised to read as follows: 


 75.563 

Restricted indirect cost rate_programs covered. 


If a grantee decides to charge indirect costs to a program that has a statutory requirement prohibiting the use of Federal
funds to supplant non-Federal funds, the grantee shall use a restricted indirect cost rate computed under 34 CFR 76.564
through 76.569. 




(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1) and 3474) 




7. Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed. 
8. A new  75.564 is added to read as follows: 


 75.564 

Reimbursement of indirect costs. 


(a) Reimbursement of indirect costs is subject to the availability of funds and statutory or administrative restrictions.

(b) The application of the rates and the determination of the direct cost base by a grantee must be in accordance with
the indirect cost rate agreement approved by the grantee's cognizant agency. 
(c) Indirect cost reimbursement is not allowable under grants for_
(1) Fellowships and similar awards if Federal financing is exclusively in the form of fixed amounts such as scholarships,

use_
(1) An indirect cost rate computed under paragraph (a) of this section; or 
(2) An indirect cost rate of eight percent unless the Secretary determines that the subgrantee or grantee would have
a lower rate under paragraph (a) of this section. 
(d) Indirect costs that are unrecovered as a result of these restrictions may not be charged directly, used to satisfy
matching or cost-sharing requirements, or charged to another Federal award.

(c) Occupancy and space maintenance costs associated with functions that are not organization-wide must be included
with other expenditures in the indirect cost formula. These costs may be charged directly to affected programs only
to the extent that statutory supplanting prohibitions are not violated. This reimbursement must be approved in advance
by the Secretary. 




(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3(a)(1), 2831(a), 2974(b), and 3474)

Indirect costs=(Restricted indirect cost rate) x (Total direct costs of the grant minus capital outlays,
subgrants, and other distorting or unallowable items as specified in the grantee's indirect cost rate agreement)




(b) If a grantee uses a restricted indirect cost rate, the general management and fixed costs covered by that rate must
be excluded by the grantee from the direct costs it charges to the grant.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is adopting amendments to Rule 15c2-12
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to deter fraud and manipulation in the municipal securities
market by prohibiting the underwriting and subsequent recommendation of securities for which adequate information
is not available. The amendments prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer (``Participating Underwriter'')
from purchasing or selling municipal securities unless the Participating Underwriter has reasonably determined
that an issuer of municipal securities or an obligated person has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for
the benefit of holders of such securities to provide certain annual financial information and event notices to various
information repositories; and prohibit a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending the
purchase or sale of a municipal security unless it has procedures in place that provide reasonable assurance that
it will receive promptly any event notices with respect to that security.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction and Summary



The Commission has long been concerned with disclosure in both the primary and secondary markets for municipal securities.

1

 As part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Congress established a limited regulatory scheme for the municipal
securities market. This limited regulatory scheme included mandatory registration of municipal securities brokers
and dealers, and the creation of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''). In 1989, acting in response
to consistently slow dissemination of information in connection with primary offerings of municipal securities,
the Commission, pursuant to its authority under Exchange Act Section 15(c)(2),

2

 adopted Rule 15c2-12

3

 and an accompanying interpretation concerning the due diligence obligations of underwriters of municipal securities.

4

 In 1993, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation conducted a comprehensive review of many aspects of the municipal
securities market, including secondary market disclosure.

5

 Findings in the September, 1993 

Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market

 (``

Staff Report

'') regarding the growing participation of individual investors, who may not be sophisticated in financial matters,
as well as the proliferation of complex derivative municipal securities, underscored the need for improved disclosure
practices in both the primary and secondary municipal securities markets.

6

 Information about the issuer and other obligated persons is as critical to the secondary market,

7

 where little information about municipal issuers and obligated persons is regularly disseminated, as it is in primary
offerings, where, as a general matter, good disclosure practices exist. As one industry group testified, today ``secondary
market information is difficult to come by even for professional municipal analysts, to say nothing of retail investors.''

Notwithstanding voluntary industry initiatives to improve disclosure, particularly primary market disclosure,
the 

Staff Report

 recommended that the Commission use its interpretive authority to provide guidance regarding the disclosure obligations
of municipal securities participants under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the
Commission amend Rule 15c2-12 to prohibit municipal securities dealers from recommending outstanding municipal
securities unless the issuer has committed to make available ongoing information regarding its financial condition.
In order to assist issuers, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in meeting their obligations under
the antifraud provisions, in March, 1994, the Commission published the 

Statement of the Commission Regarding Disclosure Obligations of Municipal Securities Issuers and Others

 (``Interpretive Release''),

9

 which outlined its views with respect to the disclosure obligations of market participants under the antifraud provisions
of the federal securities laws in connection with both primary and secondary market disclosure.





Concurrent with the publication of the Interpretive Release, the Commission published Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 33742 (``Proposing Release''),

10

 which requested comment on amendments to Rule 15c2-12 (``Proposed Amendments'') designed to enhance the quality,
timing, and dissemination of disclosure in the municipal securities market by placing certain requirements on brokers,
dealers, and municipal securities dealers. In proposing the amendments, the Commission intended to further deter
fraud by preventing the underwriting and recommendation of transactions in municipal securities about which little
or no current information exists. Brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers serve as the link between the
issuers whose securities they sell and the investors to whom they recommend securities. Investors, especially individual
investors, place their reliance on these securities professionals for their recommendations of municipal securities.





The amendments to Rule 15c2-12 ensure that brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers will review
the secondary market disclosure practices of issuers and other obligated persons at the time of an offering of municipal
securities.

13

 This scrutiny at the time of initial issuance of municipal securities will result in the dissemination of important
information by issuers and other obligated persons throughout the term of the municipal securities. As a result of
the amendments, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers will be better able to satisfy their obligation
under the federal securities laws to have a reasonable basis on which to recommend municipal securities, as well as
their obligations under the rules of the MSRB.





The availability of secondary market disclosure to all municipal securities market participants will enable investors
to better protect themselves from misrepresentation or other fraudulent activities by brokers, dealers, and municipal
securities dealers. A lack of consistent secondary market disclosure impairs investors' ability to acquire information
necessary to make intelligent, informed investment decisions, and thus, to protect themselves from fraud.

In the Proposing Release, comment was requested on each aspect of the Proposed Amendments, as well as on standards
for recognition of nationally recognized municipal securities information repositories (``NRMSIRs''). In response
to the request for comments, the Commission received over 390 comment letters representing over 475 groups and individuals.
The commenters represented all types of participants in the municipal securities market, including issuers, underwriters,
investors, counsel, analysts, financial advisers, banks, insurance providers, disclosure services, and the MSRB.

14

 The comment letters presented a variety of thoughtful views on the issues raised by the Proposing Release.

15

 The Commission has determined to adopt amendments to Rule 15c2-12, with certain modifications that are designed
to address concerns expressed by commenters.

16

 In addition, the suggestions of a group of industry participants that cooperated to assist the Commission in its efforts
to improve disclosure in the municipal securities market have been valuable.

17

Commenters across a broad range of market participants supported the goal of improved secondary market disclosure
for the municipal securities market, but emphasized that flexibility is necessary, given the diversity that exists
in the municipal securities market.

18

 As adopted, the amendments to Rule 15c2-12 will further that goal by prohibiting underwritings unless there
are commitments to provide ongoing disclosure, while, at the same time, providing issuers with significant flexibility
to determine the appropriate nature of that disclosure. The amendments retain the requirement that a Participating
Underwriter ascertain that an issuer or obligated person has undertaken to provide secondary market disclosure,
including notices of material events, to information repositories, but rely on the parties to the transaction to
establish who will provide secondary market disclosure, and what information is material to an understanding of
the security being offered. 




The amendments build upon and reinforce current market practices that have provided, as a general matter, good quality
disclosure in official statements, and extend those practices to the secondary market. As is currently the practice,
under the amendments, the participants in an underwriting would continue to determine which persons are material
to an understanding of the Offering. Information concerning those persons would be included in the final official
statement. Financial information and operating data that is material to an offering at the outset generally remains
material throughout the life of the securities. Under the amendments, that information would be provided on an annual
basis. Put simply, the amendments reflect the belief that purchasers in the secondary market need the same level of
financial information and operating data in making investment decisions as purchasers in the underwritten offering.

The Proposed Amendments would have prohibited a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending
the purchase or sale of a municipal security, unless it had reviewed the annual and event information provided pursuant
to the undertaking. Commenters anticipated that such a prohibition would have a considerable negative impact on
secondary market liquidity. Furthermore, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers considered the proposed
recommendation prohibition to be problematic from a compliance perspective. The Commission has modified this provision
to require instead that brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers recommending municipal securities
in the secondary market have procedures to obtain material event notices. Because under existing law brokers, dealers,
and municipal securities dealers are required to use information disseminated into the marketplace in forming a
reasonable basis for recommending securities to investors, the rule does not impose mechanical review requirements
on a trade-by-trade basis. 
The amendments contain an exemption to minimize the effect on small issuers. Offerings in which neither the issuer
nor any obligor is obligated with respect to more than $10 million dollars in municipal securities outstanding following
an offering will be exempt from the amendments, on the condition that there is a limited undertaking to provide upon
request, or annually to a state information depository, at least the financial information or operating data they
customarily prepare, and that is publicly available. In addition, the undertaking must meet the amendment's requirement
regarding notices of material events. 


II. Description of Amendments To Rule 15c2-12 


A. Amendments With Respect to the Underwriting of Municipal Securities 


Under the amendments to Rule 15c2-12, a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer (``Participating Underwriter'')

19

 will be prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection
with a primary offering of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000 or more (``Offering''),

20

 unless the Participating Underwriter has made certain determinations.

21

 Specifically, the Participating Underwriter must reasonably determine that an issuer of municipal securities
or an obligated person, either individually or in combination with other issuers of such municipal securities or
other obligated persons,

22

 has undertaken in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of such securities, to provide, either
directly or indirectly through an indenture trustee or a designated agent, certain annual financial information
and event notices to various information repositories.

23

 









The ``reasonable determination'' required by the amendments to Rule 15c2-12 must be made by the Participating
Underwriter prior to its purchasing or selling municipal securities in connection with an Offering. A Participating
Underwriter would, therefore, need to receive assurances from the issuer or obligated persons that such undertakings
would be made before agreeing to act as an underwriter. A dealer could look to provisions in the underwriting agreement
or bond purchase agreement that describe the undertakings for the benefit of bondholders made elsewhere, such as
in a trust indenture, bond resolution, or separate written agreement.

24

 In a competitively bid offering, such assurances also might be found in a notice of sale. Of course, representations
concerning commitments to provide secondary market disclosure, like any other key representations by an issuer,
are subject to specific verification, such that a Participating Underwriter has a reasonable basis to believe that
such representations are true and accurate. Thus, investigation of an issuer's or obligated person's undertakings
to provide secondary market disclosure would be an element of the Participating Underwriter's professional review
of offering documents.

25

 





Because the amendments prohibit Participating Underwriters from purchasing or selling securities in the absence
of undertakings in a written agreement or contract, such agreement or contract would have to be in place at the time
the issuer delivers the securities to the Participating Underwriter.

26

 As discussed below, in conditioning the closing of an Offering on the existence of an agreement or contract, this provision
of the amendments permits flexibility as to where undertakings for continuing disclosure are memorialized.

27

 





The amendments to the definition of final official statement will affect the obligations of Participating Underwriters
under Rule 15c2-12. Rule 15c2-12(b)(1) requires that a Participating Underwriter, prior to bidding
for, purchasing, offering, or selling municipal securities, obtain and review a DFOS.

28

 The Commission expects that Participating Underwriters will review the DFOS with a view to ascertaining that it contains
information satisfying the definition of final official statement in Rule 15c2-12.

29

 The Commission further expects that the quality of disclosure in the DFOS will improve in a manner that is commensurate
with the changes in final official statement disclosure.

30

 






Rule 15c2-12(b)(2) requires, for all except competitively bid offerings, from the time a Participating Underwriter
has reached an understanding with an issuer of municipal securities that it will act as a Participating Underwriter,
until the final official statement is available, that the Participating Underwriter send, to any potential customer,
no later than the next business day, a copy of the most recent POS, if any. The Commission expects that the Participating
Underwriters' obligations with respect to dissemination of the POS will not change. 


1. Determining the Required Scope of the Undertaking to Provide Secondary Market Disclosure 


Under the amendments as adopted, the financial information and operational data to be provided on an annual basis
pursuant to the undertaking will mirror the financial information and operating data contained in the final official
statement with respect to both the issuers and obligated persons that will be the subject of the ongoing disclosure,
and the type of information provided. The amendments govern the core financial and operational data to be provided.
It does not address the textual disclosure typically provided in annual reports, leaving the scope of that disclosure
to market practice.

31

 To clarify the intended quantitative focus of the rule, as adopted, the rule uses the term ``financial information
and operating data.''

a. 

The Starting Point_Definition of Final Official Statement_

(1) 

Information Concerning Persons Material to an Evaluation of the Offering. 

The Proposed Amendments would have revised the definition of final official statement to require that financial
and operating information, including audited annual financial statements, regarding the issuer and any significant
obligor be included in order to provide a fair presentation of the issuer's and significant obligor's financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flow. 
Commenters objected to various aspects of the proposed definition, including the general requirement that financial
and operating information be presented in the final official statement.

32

 Commenters also objected that the use of the term ``the issuer,'' in specifying whose financial information should
be included in the final official statement, failed to take into account a variety of situations in which the governmental
issuer does not have any repayment obligations on the municipal securities (as with conduit issuers), as well as other
situations (such as revenue bonds) in which the payments will be derived from entities, enterprises, funds and accounts
that do not prepare separate financial statements. Some commenters took the position that in certain instances,
inclusion of the financial statements of the general municipal issuer of which the enterprise is a part may be misleading.

33

 





In view of these comments, the definition of final official statement has been revised to require that financial information
and operating data be provided for those persons, entities, enterprises, funds, and accounts that are material to
an evaluation of the offering.

34

 Thus, the definition eliminates the reference to ``the'' issuer. In addition, the definition no longer requires
that the official statement provide information about specific ``significant obligors.'' It leaves to the parties
(including the issuer and Participating Underwriters) the determination of whose financial information is material
to the offering (including, without limitation, the credit supporting the securities being offered). 




The definition does not set its own form and content requirements on the financial information and operating data
to be included; in particular, the proposed requirement for audited financial statements has not been adopted. Instead,
it provides the flexibility that many commenters asserted is necessary in determining the content and scope of the
disclosed financial information and operating data, given the diversity among types of issuers, types of issues,
and sources of repayment.

35

 




The fact that the amendments rely on the final official statement to set the standard for ongoing disclosure should
not serve as an incentive for issuers to reduce existing disclosure practices in the preparation of the final official
statement. Market discipline and regulatory requirements should ensure that those practices continue at current
or improved levels. While issuers remain primarily responsible for the content and accuracy of their disclosures,

36

 as noted, Participating Underwriters must review the DFOS in a manner consistent with their obligations. 




As the Commission recognized in the Interpretive Release,

37

 the extensive voluntary guidelines issued by the Government Finance Officers' Association, and the industry specific
guidelines published by industry groups such as the National Federation of Municipal Analysts, are followed widely
in the preparation of official statements.

38

 The Commission anticipates that such sound practices will continue and develop beyond that mandated by the amendments.
Although those guidelines are not mandatory, the Commission encourages market participants to continue to refer
to those voluntary guidelines and the Commission's Interpretive Release in preparing disclosure documents. In
addition, as noted in the Interpretive Release,

39

 final official statements are subject to the prohibition against false or misleading statements of material facts,
including the omission of material facts necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances in which
they are made, not misleading.

(2) 

Use of cross references to publicly available information.

 The Proposing Release requested comment on the appropriateness of satisfying disclosure needs through a reference
to other externally prepared and located documents. In response, a number of commenters stated that the concept of
incorporation of information should be explicitly included in the rule,

40

 and that the ability to incorporate information should not be conditioned on a minimum dollar amount of securities
in the hands of the public_commonly known as ``public float.''

41

 Some commenters also suggested that any limitation of this practice to ``seasoned issuers'' should include all investment
grade issuers.

42

 Some commenters further noted that the final official statement should not have to set forth information that has
been filed with the Commission in accordance with its periodic reporting requirements.

43

 The commenters suggested one significant prerequisite for permitting cross referencing_the availability of the
information in some public repository.

44

 








The definition of final official statement has been revised to make explicit

45

 that a final official statement may include financial information and operating data either by setting forth the
information in the document or set of documents composing the final official statement, or by including a specific
reference to documents already prepared and previously made publicly available.

46

 For purposes of the amendments, documents will be considered to be publicly available if they have been submitted
to each NRMSIR and to the appropriate state information depository or, if the information concerns a reporting company,
filed with the Commission. If the document is a final official statement, it must be available from the MSRB. 





If cross referencing is used, for purposes of determining the appropriate scope of the ongoing information undertaking,
the final official statement will be deemed to include all information and documents that have been cross referenced.

47

 The amendment does not place limitations on the type of issuer that may use cross referencing. This approach is consistent
with the goal of making the repositories the principal source of information concerning municipal securities. Once
received by a repository, the referenced information should be readily available regardless of the nature of the
issuer. 




As commenters noted, permitting cross referencing to other externally prepared and available information should
result in official statements that are clear and concise, yet provide information material to the Offering.

48

 Moreover, the use of cross referencing also should ease some expressed apprehension about the ability of some issuers
to obtain information about parties not within their control, to the extent that information about these parties
is made available to the repositories or, if a reporting company, filed with the Commission.

(3) 

Description of information undertakings. 

The definition of final official statement also has been changed from the Proposed Amendments to include a requirement
that the undertakings provided pursuant to the rule be described in the final official statement.

50

 As the Commission recognized in the Interpretive Release

51

 and a number of commenters echoed,

52

 it is important for investors and the market to know the scope of any ongoing disclosure. By including a description
of the undertaking in the final official statement, market participants will know the identity of the entities about
which information will be provided, and the type of information to be provided. By reviewing the final official statement,
investors in the secondary market will be able to ascertain the scope of that undertaking and whether it has been satisfied.







Critical to any evaluation of a covenant is the likelihood that the issuer or obligated person will abide by the undertaking.
The definition of final official statement thus has been modified to require disclosure of all instances in the previous
five years in which any person providing an undertaking failed to comply in all material respects with any previous
informational undertakings called for by the amendments.

53

 This information is important to the market, and should, therefore, be disclosed in the final official statement.
The requirement should provide an additional incentive for issuers and obligated persons to comply with their undertakings
to provide secondary market disclosure, and will ensure that Participating Underwriters and others are able to assess
the reliability of disclosure representations.

54

 





The amendments do not prohibit Participating Underwriters from underwriting an Offering of municipal securities
if an issuer or obligated person has failed to comply with previous undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure.
However, if a failure to comply with such previous undertakings has not been remedied as of the start of the Offering,
or if the party has a history of persistent and material breaches, it is doubtful whether a Participating Underwriter
could form a reasonable basis for relying on the accuracy of the issuer's or obligated person's ongoing disclosure
representations. 
b. 

Entities about which information must be provided to the secondary market. 

It is critical that current financial information and operating data is provided to the secondary market about the
persons that would be important to investors in evaluating the security. The Proposed Amendments would have required
the Participating Underwriter to determine that the issuer had committed to provide, at least annually, current
financial information concerning the issuer of the municipal securities and any significant obligor.

55

 The identity of persons about which information should be provided to the secondary market was the subject of a substantial
number of comment letters.

56

 As with the proposed definition of final official statement, a large number of commenters expressed particular concern
about the provision of information on a continuing basis for conduit issuers who have no ongoing liability for repayment
of municipal securities.

57

 There also were a significant number of comments received critiquing the concept of significant obligor.

58

 







Under the amendments as revised, the identity of the persons for which information must be provided on an annual basis
is determined by the information included in the final official statement. If the final official statement includes
financial information or operating data on a person, information about that person must continue to be provided to
the secondary market if the person is committed by contract or other arrangement to support payment of the obligations
on the municipal securities.

59

 Thus, the obligation to provide ongoing information relates to those persons for which financial information or
operating data is included in the final official statement 

and 

that have a contractual or other connection to repayment of the municipal obligations.

(1) The obligated person concept.

 The Proposed Amendments defined a significant obligor as ``any person who, directly or indirectly, is the source
of 20 percent or more of the cash flow servicing the obligations on the municipal security.'' The proposed definition
generated a significant amount of comment, including concerns that it could be interpreted to include significant
taxpayers and customers,

60

 credit enhancers (including banks that are letter of credit providers and insurers providing bond insurance),

61

 providers of guaranteed investment contracts,

62

 as well as state and federal governments that provide revenue sharing, grant, state and local aid and other cofinancing
arrangements.

63

 Commenters raised technical concerns as to the appropriate percentage of repayment obligation necessary to trigger
inclusion in the definition of significant obligor,

64

 and when the percentages were to be measured.

65

 Some commenters also expressed concern that, in the bond pool context, the definition of significant obligor may
not have permitted sufficient flexibility in determining which obligors in a pool would be the subject of the requirement
to provide information on an ongoing basis.

66

 











Commenters suggested a number of modifications to the significant obligor concept. First, a number of commenters
indicated that the definition of significant obligor should include a requirement that a contractual relationship
exist between the obligor and the repayment of the obligation before a continuing information obligation is imposed.

67

 Second, commenters recommended modifying the definition to include different percentages of cash flow, ranging
from a low of no threshold to a high of 50% of cash flow.

68

 Third, some commenters suggested replacing the entire definition of significant obligor with the concept of materiality,
in which the issuer and the other offering participants would determine, on a continuing basis, whose information
would be provided.

69

 







As suggested by a number of commenters, the amendments eliminate the reference to significant obligor.

70

 Instead, the amendments include a definition of ``obligated person,'' which means a person (including an issuer
of separate securities) that is committed by contract or other arrangement structured to support payment of all or
part of the obligations on the municipal securities.

71

 By including a nexus to the financing through a commitment that is structured to support the payment obligations,
the amendments address concerns raised by many commenters that the term ``source of cash flow'' in the definition
of significant obligor was overbroad and could encompass persons with no relationship to the financing.

72

 The requirement for a contractual or other arrangement will assist Participating Underwriters in identifying the
persons for which information should be provided pursuant to an undertaking. 







Some commenters recommended that the commitment with respect to payment of the obligation on the securities consist
of a contractual obligation to and enforceable by bondholders.

73

 Instead, the definition includes a broader notion of a contract or arrangement that is structured to ``support payment,''
without specifying that it run to bondholders. The definition is intended to include contracts or arrangements where
payments are made either to bondholders, to issuers to be used to pay obligations on municipal securities, or through
conduit structures.

74

 Similarly, the reference to ``obligations on municipal securities'' is intended to be broad enough to cover debt
obligations, lease payments and any other repayment obligation on or resulting from the municipal securities. 






As was the case with the proposed significant obligor concept, the term ``obligated persons'' includes, but is broader
than, the concept of issuers of separate securities under Rule 131 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities
Act'')

75

 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-5.

76

 Also, in response to comments raised that the terms ``issuer'' or ``significant obligor'' do not sufficiently address
financings in which the source of repayment is not a separate person or entity, but a dedicated revenue stream from
a specified project, segregated tax revenues or other enterprise, fund or account,

77

 the definition includes persons which are obligated generally, such as with full recourse to the person, or, in a more
limited manner, such as through an enterprise, fund or account of such person, including a dedicated revenue stream.
As noted above, the obligation to provide information must cover all such enterprises, funds or accounts, whether
or not there is a separate entity. In such a case, the information undertaking could be provided by the governmental
unit or financing authority of which the enterprise, fund or account is a part.

78

 For example, a Participating Underwriter could accept an information undertaking from a state issuing bonds secured
solely by funds collected under a special tax, to report financial information relating to the special tax; for issues
supported both by contracts of assistance of separate authorities or funds in addition to the issuer's own revenues,
undertakings from the separate authorities, as well as the issuer could be provided. Accordingly, although the definition
of significant obligor has been eliminated, that modification does not reflect a change in the Commission's assessment
of the importance of ongoing information concerning the ultimate sources of payment on the securities.

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Unlike the significant obligor concept in the Proposed Amendments, there is no need to include a specified percentage
of payment in the definition of obligated person, because the issuer and other participants will determine at the
time of preparation of the final official statement which obligated persons are material to an Offering.

79

 In making that materiality determination, the parties to a financing will evaluate the facts of the Offering.

80

 






Determining the obligated persons in pooled financings requires more flexibility, because the composition of the
pool may vary over time. Rather than identifying the specific persons for which information will be provided on a continuing
basis, under the amendments, bond pools must describe in their official statements, and the undertaking, the objective
criteria (presumably including percentage of payment support) they will apply consistently, both in the final official
statement and on a continuing basis, in determining whether information concerning an obligated person will be provided.

81

 The amendments permit, but do not require this approach for non-pooled issuers. The objective criteria approach
ensures that financial information and operating data will be provided about those persons that, at the time of disclosure,
meet the objective standards described in the undertakings. Obligated persons could commit to the issuer, at the
time of initial participation in a pooled financing, through an undertaking to provide information when and if they
satisfy that criteria. Obligated persons that no longer meet the objective criteria will no longer need to provide
ongoing information. In order to ensure that the selection method is incorporated into the undertaking, the amendments
require that Participating Underwriters reasonably determine that the undertakings identify those persons for
which the information will be provided, either by name or by the objective criteria to be used to select such persons.

82

 






Commenters were divided on whether providers of bond insurance, letters of credit, and other liquidity facilities,
should be excluded from the definition of significant obligor.

83

 The concept of ``obligated person'' encompasses these entities because they are committed, at least conditionally,
to support payment of principal and interest obligations. Moreover, these persons normally are material to an understanding
of the security, and, therefore, official statements should contain financial information concerning such persons
either directly or by reference to publicly available materials. A number of commenters stated, however, that it
would be inappropriate to put the onus on the issuer to provide information on such providers on an annual basis, particularly
where that information is otherwise available to investors either upon request or in public reports that have been
submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities.

84

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00192 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Commenters indicated a willingness by providers of bond insurance, letters of credit, and other liquidity facilities
to deposit publicly available reports in a repository, or otherwise note where such reports may be easily obtained.

85

 The issuer or other obligated person providing the undertaking may then refer to such reports in their annual financial
information and indicate the location where any such current annual reports can be obtained. Based upon such representations,
providers of bond insurance, letters of credit, and liquidity facilities have been excepted from the definition
of obligated person to eliminate the need to separately obtain and disseminate annual information about such providers.






The Commission encourages industry participants to work together to adopt appropriate disclosure practices, both
with respect to information concerning the provider contained in primary offering materials and on an ongoing basis
in the annual financial information. The Commission will monitor developments in this area regarding the nature
and quality of information made available about credit enhancers and liquidity providers, and the manner in which
information is made available to determine whether further steps are necessary to assure access to this important
body of information. 

(2) 

Who must undertake.

 A related question to whose information must be given is who must provide the information undertaking; the person
providing the undertaking may not necessarily be the person about which the information relates. The Proposed Amendments
would have required that the continuing information undertaking be provided by the issuer. A significant number
of commenters raised concerns about which of potentially several persons that could be considered an issuer of municipal
securities

86

 would be expected to provide the undertaking and who would make that determination.

87

 This was a particular concern in light of the potential liability of the issuer providing the undertaking for the provision
and the content of information regarding other issuers and significant obligors_persons not necessarily under
their control. Commenters made a number of suggestions to address these perceived ambiguities, including requiring
that each issuer of a municipal security and each significant obligor undertake to provide the information only with
respect to itself.

88

 







In response to these concerns, and consistent with the general approach to affording underwriting participants
significant flexibility, the undertaking provision has been revised to provide that the undertaking may be made
by any issuer of the municipal securities being offered, or by any obligated person for which information is provided
in the final official statement. An issuer of a municipal security may provide the undertaking, regardless of whether
it is obligated on the municipal security. In addition, obligated persons may provide the undertaking regardless
of whether they are deemed an issuer of municipal securities. These obligated persons may be the main, if not the only,
credit source for repayment of the obligations on the municipal securities. This approach should allow the governmental
issuer to shift to the obligated person the responsibility to provide information on a continuing basis. 

Thus, a Participating Underwriter need only reasonably determine that an issuer of municipal securities or an obligated
person for which financial information or operating data is presented in the final official statement has agreed
to provide the information called for by the rule; it will not be necessary to obtain an undertaking from all possible
issuers and obligated persons. Moreover, to respond to the expressed concern that separate undertakings should
be permitted, the amendments have been revised to recognize that undertakings may be provided in combination with
other issuers and other obligated persons. In all cases, however, the undertakings, either individually or collectively,
must constitute a commitment to provide information with respect to all the persons about which information must
be provided on an annual basis. 

The amendments have been revised to clarify that dissemination responsibilities may be delegated to designated
agents or to indenture trustees. As commenters pointed out, there are circumstances in which third parties may be
effective in assisting issuers and obligated persons in disseminating the information.

89

 Moreover, indenture trustees have expressed concerns about being considered ``designated agents'' in performing
any dissemination role, based on the scope of, and standards affecting, their responsibilities as indenture trustees.

90

 The language has been revised in response to clarify that, in addition to designated agents, issuers or obligated
persons may contractually empower indenture trustees to disseminate information that an issuer or obligated person
has agreed to provide. The parties may authorize an indenture trustee to provide certain information through specific
instruction or on its own initiative upon becoming aware of particular facts.

c. 

Scope of financial information and operating data to be provided on an annual basis

_(1) 

Definition of annual financial information.

 The amendments provide a definition of the term ``annual financial information,''

91

 a concept that was used, without definition, in the Proposed Amendments. The definition of annual financial information
specifies both the timing of the information_that is, once a year_and, by referring to the final official statement,
the type of financial information and operating data that is to be provided to the repositories. If financial information
or operating data concerning an obligated person (or category of obligated persons in the case of financings using
the objective criteria approach) is included in the final official statement, then annual financial information
would consist of the same type of financial information or operating data. For example, if anticipated cash flow information
is provided in the final official statement for a revenue bond financing, cash flow data reflecting actual operations
must continue to be provided on an annual basis. Only the annual financial information called for by the undertakings
need be sent to the repositories; other types of financial information and reports that may be prepared by the issuer
or obligated persons are not subject to the rule's dissemination provisions. 





Many commenters addressed the issue of whether the rule should specify form and content of the information that should
be provided on an annual basis, as well as for event specific information.

92

 Some commenters argued that the rule should include specified formats for information to be provided, including
financial statements and certain industry reporting formats,

93

 while other commenters contended that no form or content should be specified and that the parties should be permitted
to make determinations based on materiality alone.

94

 As discussed below, the flexibility afforded by the concept of annual financial information addresses these concerns
by providing a minimum standard for ongoing disclosure, but allowing the parties to define that standard with respect
to each Offering of municipal securities. 







(2) 

Financial information.

 The proposal to mandate audited financial statements produced considerable comment. As with the proposed definition
of final official statement, commenters expressed concern with the availability of audited financial statements
on an annual basis, as well as the relevance of financial statements for certain types of financings. 

Some commenters indicated that some municipalities were not required by law to have independently audited financial
statements, and any such requirement would impose a significant new expense.

95

 A number of commenters also expressed doubt as to whether audited financial information could be delivered on an annual
basis, because audits may not be completed for a number of years following the close of the fiscal year.

96

 Commenters noted that in some cases, financial statements for certain types of entities were audited every year,
and in other cases every 2-3 years.

97

 Therefore, some of these commenters argued that the requirement for annual audited financial statements would have
an adverse impact on an issuer's ability to access the public securities markets or increase its costs of financing.

98

 








A number of commenters also raised concerns regarding the availability of full financial statements for certain
issuers, whether or not audited.

99

 As examples, commenters noted that some issuing entities do not have their own financial statements and may be included
in the financial statements of a larger issuer or entity.

100

 Commenters from two states indicated that governmental units of the states may be encompassed in the state's comprehensive
annual financial report and that there may be only supplemental schedules that described the governmental units.

101

 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00194 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Some commenters raised the point that financial statements of a general governmental unit may not necessarily be
relevant in certain project and structured financings.

102

 As an example, one commenter noted that in some asset backed financings, information about the governmental issuer
may be relevant only with respect to its experience in managing programs of loan pools.

103

 





Commenters proposed a number of alternatives to the requirement to provide annual audited financial statements.
Among the alternatives was a suggestion that financial statements be required in the form customarily prepared by
the issuer promptly upon becoming available and that audited financial statements be provided to the extent available.

104

 Other suggestions included limiting the requirement to those entities required by state or federal law to have audited
financial statements.

105

 





In view of the comments received, the amendments do not adopt the proposal to mandate audited financial statements
on an annual basis with respect to each issuer and significant obligor. Instead, the amendments continue to require
annual financial information, which may be unaudited, and may, where appropriate and consistent with the presentation
in the final official statement, be other than full financial statements. While it is anticipated that full financial
statements will be provided for entities with ongoing revenues and operating expenses, it is possible that in the
case of dedicated revenue streams and certain types of structured financings, other types of special purpose financial
statements, project operating statements or reports may be used to reflect the financial position of the credit source
for the financing. However, if audited financial statements are prepared, then when and if available, such audited
financial statements will be subject to the undertaking and must be submitted to the repositories.

106

 Thus, as suggested by a number of commenters, the undertaking must include audited financial statements only in those
cases where they otherwise are prepared. 




The amendments adopt the proposed requirement that the undertaking specify the accounting principles pursuant
to which the financial information provided as part of the annual financial information will be prepared.

107

 As discussed in the Proposing Release, it is important that financial information be prepared on a consistent basis
to enable market participants to evaluate results and perform year to year comparisons.

108

 The undertaking also must specify whether audited financial statements will be provided as part of the annual financial
information.

109

 






The amendments do not establish a standardized format for presentation of financial information, or any specification
of the content of the information, other than by reference to the final official statement. The annual financial information
may be presented through any disclosure document or set of documents, whatever their form or principal purpose, that
include the necessary information. The amendments, as adopted, contemplate that sequential final official statements
prepared by frequent issuers may meet the standards of the rule. As in the case of final official statements, annual
financial information submitted to a repository also may reference other information already submitted to repositories
or the MSRB, or filed with the Commission.

110

 




(3) 

Operating data. 

The Proposed Amendments

111

 would have required that the undertaking call for pertinent operating information, and that the parties specify
the pertinent operating information to be provided on an annual basis. The basic concern of commenters regarding
this provision, in addition to issues of specification of form and content discussed above, was that the use of the
term ``pertinent'' did not provide sufficient guidance as to who would determine what was pertinent and what independent
obligations Participating Underwriters would have with respect to such evaluation.

112

 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00195 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The amendments have been modified to respond to these comments. The phrase ``pertinent'' has been deleted from the
reference to operating information and the word ``data'' is used to emphasize the intended quantitative nature of
the information. Operating data is included as a subset of annual financial information, and the operating data to
be provided annually also is determined by reference to the type of operating data presented in the final official
statement. Thus, the parties will determine at the outset, presumably with the assistance of applicable industry
guidelines, what operating data will be provided both initially and on an ongoing basis. For example, in a conduit
health care financing, under current industry practice, an official statement typically provides information
relating to the obligated party_the hospital_in an appendix. In addition to a discussion describing the hospital,
its administration and management, economic base and service area, and capital plan, operating statistics such
as bed utilization, admissions and type, patient days, and payor utilization often is provided. Under the amendments,
in this type of transaction, parties at the outset of a transaction will determine which operating data will be included
in the hospital appendix; such information, in turn, will be the type of ``operating data'' to be provided annually.

Some commenters expressed concern that the Proposed Amendments were not sufficiently flexible to permit parties
to address changing conditions because the undertaking would have to describe the financial and pertinent operating
information to be provided in the future.

113

 Nonetheless, the requirement that the undertaking specify in reasonable detail the type of data that will be provided
on an ongoing basis, including the identity of the persons (or category of persons) about which the information will
relate has been retained. As is the case with financial information, the intent of the amendments is to give investors
and market participants the ability to evaluate the security through comparisons of the quantitative operating
data provided. Contrary to the suggestion of some commenters, the undertaking would be meaningless if issuers and
obligated persons could unilaterally determine that certain types of information were no longer necessary or meaningful
to investors. 




Because the amendments require that the undertaking specify only the general type of information to be supplied,
there should be sufficient flexibility to accommodate subsequent developments that may require adjustments in
the financial information and operating data that should be provided annually. Of course, nothing in the undertaking
will prevent a party from providing additional information, particularly where such disclosure may be necessary
to avoid liability under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Similarly, the amendments make
specific provision for adjusting the persons about which information is provided. As required in the case of pooled
financings, parties may identify the persons covered by reference to objective selection criteria that will be applied
on a consistent basis between the offering statements and with regard to annual financial information. Moreover,
the party providing the undertaking need not continue to provide information concerning persons that are no longer
obligated persons with respect to the municipal securities. 
A new provision has been added to the amendments which permits the written agreement or contract to have a termination
provision with respect to any obligated person that is no longer directly or indirectly liable for repayment of any
of the obligations on the municipal securities.

114

 Once an obligated person no longer has any liability for repayment of the municipal securities, whether through termination
or expiration of its commitment to support payment, or as a result of a defeasance of the municipal securities with
no remaining liability, then the obligation to provide annual financial information and notices of events may terminate.





2. Notice of Material Events 


Commenters generally agreed that issuers and obligors should be subject to an undertaking to provide event information
to the market.

115

 Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers supported these provisions of the Proposed Amendments, because
the use of a list provides guidance as to what events should be covered.

116

 Other commenters, however, felt that the list should be deleted from the rule and that the concept of materiality should
be relied upon to determine what events should be the subject of notices.

117

 Some commenters believed that the list of eleven events should be expanded to include a provision that would cover
any other event that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the holders of the bonds.

118

 







The list of eleven events has been retained in the amendments.

119

 As indicated in the Proposing Release, the list of eleven events was proposed in response to requests for guidance
to issuers and other participants in the municipal securities markets as to those events that normally would reflect
on the credit supporting the municipal securities, as well as on the terms of the securities that they issue, and thus
normally would be considered material. Under the amendments, only the occurrence of one of the specified events will,
if material, create an obligation to send a notice to the repository. 




The determination of whether other events also should be the subject of notification pursuant to the information
undertaking is left to the parties. For example, some commenters requested that the list of events be expanded to address
circumstances when the notified events have been cured or rectified, as well as other favorable developments.

120

 The parties would be free to add such matters to the undertaking. Issuers also may wish to send information regarding
material developments to the repositories, to ensure equal access to that information by all investors and participants
in the market, regardless of whether the particular development is subject to the undertaking.

121

 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00196 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Some commenters were concerned that permitting issuers and obligors to send any notices or information they wished
would flood the repositories. Given the fact that event notices generally are short, it appears that the repositories
would be able to handle the flow of notices. The Commission will, however, monitor developments in this area. 
Some commenters expressed concern that the event described as ``matters affecting collateral'' was too broad.

122

 In response to such observations, that reference has been revised to reflect more clearly the types of events relating
to collateral that could affect the creditworthiness of the security being offered. For instance, the item was not
intended to require disclosure in the event of a drop in revenues or receipts securing payment. Rather, as more clearly
indicated in the revised amendments, it is intended to encompass the release, substitution, or sale of property securing
repayment of the securities being offered.

123

 





Commenters also questioned whether the event relating to adverse tax opinions or events affecting the tax-exempt
status of the security would include events not specific to an issuer, such as tax law changes which may affect a multitude
of issuances and which are broadly reported.

124

 They argued that there is no need for each issuer to make that disclosure, which may overwhelm the repositories. The
amendments do not include a uniform requirement for notification of events having widespread impact that are widely
reported. Frequently, individual issuer disclosure may not affect the total ``mix'' of information available to
investors, for example where Congress amends tax rates or alternative minimum tax rules that could affect an investor's
yield. On the other hand, it may not be clear, absent individual disclosure, which classes of outstanding securities
are affected by the general events, for example, where the tax law change affects a particular type of municipal security
or financing structure. 




It is possible that an ``event'' affecting the tax-exempt status of the security may include the commencement of litigation
and other legal proceedings, including an audit by the Internal Revenue Service, when an issuer determines, based
on the status of the proceedings and their likely impact on holders of the municipal securities, among other things,
that such events may be material to investors. 
Commenters expressed concern that the party providing the undertaking may not have knowledge of the occurrence of
events affecting other parties that might be called for by the provisions of the rule.

125

 This concern should be addressed by the revised approach of enabling the parties to the transaction to determine who
will provide the undertakings. For example, in the conduit context, the covenant could be provided by the person that
is committed by contract or other arrangement to support payment of debt service, rather than the conduit issuer.





The timing for providing the notification has not been changed from the Proposed Amendments, which required that
the notice be provided on a ``timely'' basis. The amendments do not establish a specific time frame as ``timely,''
because of the wide variety of events and issuer circumstances. In general, this determination must take into consideration
the time needed to discover the occurrence of the event, assess its materiality, and prepare and disseminate the notice.

A new paragraph has been added to the amendments

126

 that would require a Participating Underwriter to reasonably determine that the undertaking includes an agreement
to notify the appropriate repository if the annual financial information is not provided in the stated time frame.
Given the expressed concerns of some commenters regarding the difficulty that they would face in determining whether
an issuer or other person was in compliance with any of its undertakings,

127

 this provision will help inform market participants if annual financial information for such persons has not been
made available in the agreed upon time frame. 





3. Location of Undertaking in a Written Agreement or Contract 


The Proposed Amendments called for the undertaking to be contained in a written agreement or contract for the benefit
of holders of municipal securities. Commenters provided a variety of views as to where the undertakings should be
memorialized, who should be parties to such undertakings, and the need for flexibility to modify undertakings in
the future. Commenters suggested, for instance, that the undertakings could be included in the trust indenture,
bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation, a separate written agreement, or the underwriting agreement
or bond purchase agreement. 
As discussed in the Proposing Release, many offerings of municipal securities are issued pursuant to a trust indenture
setting out the covenants of the issuer for the benefit of the holders of the municipal securities. If there is no trust
indenture as part of an offering, as is the case with general obligation and certain other types of bonds, there may
be a bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation. Most commenters addressing this issue considered the trust
indenture, bond resolution, ordinance, or other legislation to be appropriate for undertakings to provide secondary
market disclosure, because they would create a direct obligation by issuers to bondholders.

128

 Commenters also suggested the use of a separate written agreement between the issuer and the trustee as an appropriate
method of memorializing undertakings.

129

 





Several commenters suggested that the inclusion of the undertakings in an underwriting agreement or bond purchase
agreement would be sufficient for purposes of Rule 15c2-12,

130

 though another commenter suggested that a promise running to the benefit of the underwriter, whether in a bond purchase
agreement or in a separate agreement, would be enforceable by existing and future bondholders only on the basis of
a third party beneficiary theory, the availability of which may vary from state to state.

Because commenters were supportive of leaving the determination of the location of the undertaking to the parties,
the relevant language of the Proposed Amendments, requiring a Participating Underwriter to look to ``undertakings
in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of such securities'' has been adopted as proposed. Therefore,
undertakings may be included in a trust indenture, bond resolution or other legislation, or a separate written agreement.
Undertakings also may be included in the bond form itself. This general requirement will create a direct obligation
to bondholders, yet will be flexible to address variations in state law, as well as the wide variety of types and structures
of offerings in the municipal securities market. 
The Commission also recognizes that an issuer's ability to contract may be limited under state law. To the extent that
issuers are restricted by statute from entering into long-term contractual arrangements, the undertaking may include
a qualifier to its obligation, such as that it is subject to appropriation.

132

 




Commenters generally took the view that, while a statement in the final official statement describing any undertakings
to provide secondary market disclosure would be an important addition to undertakings in a written agreement or contract,
in order to make clear that the undertaking is an obligation of the issuer or obligated person that is enforceable on
behalf of bondholders, the undertaking should be in a writing signed by the issuer or obligated person.

133

 Statements regarding an issuer's or obligated person's provision of secondary market disclosure made exclusively
in an official statement would not satisfy the terms of Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) because they would not create a contract
enforceable on behalf of bondholders. 




Commenters addressing the inclusion of undertakings in various documents were concerned that the failure to provide
continuing disclosure pursuant to the undertakings could be deemed a potential event of default on the securities.

134

 Though a failure to comply with the undertaking would be a breach of contract, the rule does not specify the consequences
of an issuer's breach of its undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure. As called for by the Joint Response,
as well as other commenters, remedies for breach of any undertaking under applicable state law are a subject for negotiation
between the parties to the Offering. To avoid uncertainties of enforcement, the parties to a transaction are encouraged
to enumerate the consequences in the undertaking, including the available remedies, for breach of the information
undertaking. 




B. Recommendation of Transactions in Municipal Securities 


The Proposed Amendments would have prohibited any broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending
the purchase or sale of a municipal security unless it had specifically reviewed the information the issuer of such
municipal security had undertaken to provide.

135

 The purpose of this provision of the Proposed Amendments was to assist dealers in satisfying their obligation to have
a reasonable basis to recommend municipal securities by requiring them to consider the most current information
before making a recommendation. 




In view of the importance of secondary market liquidity in municipal issues, the Commission requested comment on
whether the Proposed Amendments would have a substantial or long-lasting effect on market liquidity. This request
for comment was based on concerns raised about whether municipal securities dealers would be willing to effect secondary
market transactions in a broad range of municipal securities if review was required on a recommendation by recommendation
basis. 
Many commenters strongly criticized this provision of the Proposed Amendments. The majority of commenters responded
that requiring the review of information prior to making a recommendation on the purchase or sale of a municipal security
would create substantial compliance burdens for dealers.

136

 Commenters also noted that the specific requirement to review information either would impel dealers to hire larger
research and analysis staffs,

137

 or, more likely, would cause dealers to restrict the issuers whose municipal securities they would trade to a smaller
number of large and frequent issuers.

138

 Commenters predicted that, as a result, liquidity for all but the largest and most frequent issuers would be reduced.

139

 







Commenters proposed alternatives to the recommendation prohibition, including basing the type of review of a municipal
security, and disclosure about such review, on whether the investor was an institutional or retail investor,

140

 or on the type of municipal security recommended.

141

 Other commenters suggested the continued reliance on the reasonable basis standard inherent in the MSRB's suitability
rule, G-19, and the antifraud provisions, as discussed by the Commission in the 1988 and 1989 Releases proposing
and adopting Rule 15c2-12, as well as the Interpretive Release.

142

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As adopted, this provision has been modified in a number of respects to respond to concerns expressed by commenters.
In particular, the amendments replace the proposed review standard with a requirement that dealers have procedures
in place that provide reasonable assurance that they will receive promptly any notices of material events regarding
the securities that they recommend. The events are any of the eleven events disclosed as described in Rule 15c2-12(b)(5)(i)(C),
or the notice of failure to provide annual financial information in accordance with an undertaking as described in
Rule 15c2-12(b)(5)(i)(D) with respect to that security. Many dealers currently subscribe to electronic reporting
systems that give notice of significant events made public by municipal issuers. To comply with the rule's requirement,
these dealers should make certain that these systems receive, directly or indirectly, material event notices for
issues the dealer recommends. In addition, dealers should develop procedures to ensure that notices of such events
will be available to the staff responsible for making recommendations. 


In the Commission's view, the recommendation provision, as modified, should substantially reduce the concerns
of commenters with respect to compliance burdens and effects on liquidity. It also will help ensure that dealers will
consider the material event notices that issuers produce, thus enabling them to have an adequate basis on which to
recommend

143

 municipal securities. 





Moreover, even though the amendments do not require that dealers directly review an issuer's ongoing disclosure
before making each recommendation, the Commission agrees with those commenters that said that additional information
made available by issuers will be taken into account by dealers making recommendations regarding that security,
under the MSRB's fair dealing and suitability rules, and the antifraud provisions.

144

 In addition to the Commission's past interpretations of the responsibilities of dealers to have a reasonable basis
for their recommendations, the MSRB repeatedly has emphasized that secondary market disclosure information publicized
by issuers must be taken into account by dealers to meet the investor protection standards imposed by its investor
protection rules. Specifically, MSRB rule G-17 requires dealers to disclose material facts of a transaction
to the customer; MSRB rule G-19 requires dealers to ensure that any transaction recommended to the customer
is suitable for that customer; and MSRB rule G-30 requires dealers to ensure that the prices set for customer
transactions are fair and reasonable. In its comment letter, the MSRB noted that ``[i]f a dealer is not aware of major
financial and other material developments affecting an issuer's securities, it is difficult or impossible for the
dealer to comply with these requirements.''

145

 






For example, if a dealer reviews an electronic reporting system for material events relating to a security, and finds
that an issuer has submitted a notice that it has failed to provide annual financial information on or before the date
specified in the written agreement or contract,

146

 that fact would be a significant factor to be taken into account when the dealer formulates the basis for a recommendation
of such securities. While the dealer would not be prohibited 

per se 

from recommending such municipal securities, notice that the issuer has failed to provide annual financial information
would be the type of material information required to be disclosed to the customer pursuant to MSRB rule G-17.

147

 Such a notice also would trigger a further inquiry by the dealer to assure itself that it is cognizant of the condition
of the issuer or obligated persons, despite the absence of promised information. This also would be true if a dealer
attempts to obtain an issuer's annual financial information, finds that it has not been submitted to any repository,
and the dealer had no record of the issuer submitting a notice to this effect. In such cases, further research may be
necessary or advisable prior to making a recommendation in the issuer's securities.

C. Information Repositories 



1. Background 



Under Rule 15c2-12, as adopted in 1989, NRMSIRs essentially serve the function of disseminators of official
statements on behalf of Participating Underwriters.

148

 The option of Participating Underwriters to transfer their final official statement delivery obligations to NRMSIRs
has encouraged the development of NRMSIRs.

149

 The three existing NRMSIRs are private vendors that gather and disseminate final official statements pursuant to
Rule 15c2-12. In addition, although not required under existing provisions of the rule, they provide other
current information about municipal issuers to the primary and secondary municipal securities markets.

150

 







As a result of the amendments, NRMSIRs will play an expanded role in the collection and dissemination of secondary
market information. In addition to the collection and dissemination of final official statements, they will collect
and disseminate annual financial information, as well as notices of material events. The Commission is sensitive
to the need of NRMSIRs for flexibility, especially with respect to the timing requirements for the dissemination
of notices of material events. The Commission will monitor developments in the municipal securities market as participants
adapt to the changes in Rule 15c2-12, and fully expects that the current and potential NRMSIRs are capable of
adjusting to their expanded role. The Commission is of the view that NRMSIRs, as private information vendors, will
have sufficient economic incentives to serve their expanded functions resulting from the amendments to Rule 15c2-12,
even in the absence of the more specific review requirement of the recommendation prohibition of the Proposed Amendments.

2. Definition of Nationally Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repository 



The Commission requested comment on whether the term ``NRMSIR'' should be defined in Rule 15c2-12, and whether
specific standards should be established for NRMSIRs. If standards were to be established in the rule, the Commission
requested comment on whether proposed standards set forth in the release were adequate.
 The majority of state-based information gatherers and disseminators, and other NRMSIRs that addressed the issue
of defining the term ``NRMSIR'' supported maintaining the guidelines already established by the Commission in the
1989 Release.
 After reviewing the comment letters, the Commission has determined that the guidance established in the 1989 Release
for NRMSIRs should be modified only as necessary to reflect the amendments to Rule 15c2-12. In determining whether
a particular entity is a NRMSIR the Commission will now consider, among other things, whether the repository: 






(1) Is national in scope; 

(2) Maintains
 current, accurate
 information about municipal offerings in the form of official statements, and annual financial information, notices
of material events, and notices of a failure to provide annual financial information undertaken to be provided in
accordance with Rule 15c2-12; 






(3) Has effective retrieval and dissemination systems; 

(4) Places no limits on the persons from which it will accept official statements, and annual financial information,
notices of material events, and notices of a failure to provide annual financial information undertaken to be provided
in accordance with Rule 15c2-12; 

(5) Provides access to the documents deposited with it to anyone willing and able to pay the applicable fees; and 

(6) Charges reasonable fees.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00201 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While NRMSIRs may charge reasonable fees
 for the dissemination of information, they may not charge issuers for accepting information provided by issuers
in accordance with Rule 15c2-12.
 In response to concerns raised by commenters, the Commission also notes that giving preferential treatment to certain
brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers by giving them market information before it is made available
to all customers would be wholly inconsistent with recognition as a NRMSIR.
 







Comment also was requested on the ability and willingness of both potential NRMSIRs, and those presently operating
under no-action letters, to meet the dissemination standards discussed in the Proposing Release. NRMSIRs responded
that they can meet these standards.
 In order to implement these standards, the Commission has determined that existing NRMSIRs should reapply for recognition
from the Commission under the revised criteria to continue to function as NRMSIRs. 





3. State Information Depositories 



The Commission also requested comment on whether a state-based depository could serve as an effective means to disseminate
information to the market for a nationally traded security, thus enabling the appropriate parties to fulfill their
disclosure obligations using a state-based depository. Commenters expressed divergent views on this issue.
 No state responded directly in response to the Commission's request for comment on whether states are willing to make
the necessary financial commitment to create a state-based system. The Comptroller of the State of New York pointed
out, however, that his office already collects financial data from local governments, and that there ``is an appropriate
and important function which the states may perform in the secondary market disclosure process.''
 A number of third party state-based information collectors also stated that they were in the process of creating state-based
repositories.
 Other such third party state-based information collectors pointed out that they already had working depositories
in place.
 








Based on these comments, and in light of existing disclosure mechanisms and recent legislation in several states
designed to enhance secondary market disclosure,
 it appears that states can play a beneficial role in enhancing disclosure in the municipal securities market.
 State-based depositories will be in a special relationship with filers of disclosure information to provide for
convenient and efficient dissemination. The Commission therefore encourages states to develop state-based depositories.

<TEXT>
 

To encourage the development of state-based depositories, the Commission has amended Rule 15c2-12 to require
that Participating Underwriters reasonably determine that the information undertaken to be provided, in addition
to being submitted to the NRMSIRs, or, in some cases, to the MSRB, will be submitted to a state information depository
(``SID''), if an appropriate SID has been established in that state. Further, as discussed below,
 an exemption conditioned on making annual financial information available upon request or to a SID, and providing
notices of material events to each NRMSIR or the MSRB, and to a SID, has been adopted. An appropriate SID would be a depository
operated or designated
 by the state that receives information from all issuers within the state, and makes this information available promptly
to the public on a contemporaneous basis.
 The Commission staff is prepared to provide guidance in particular instances regarding a SID's qualification for
purposes of the rule. 







4. Information Delivery Requirements 



The Proposing Release asked to whom the required information should be delivered. It also requested comment on the
feasibility of requiring NRMSIRs to inform the MSRB when they receive disclosure information from issuers, and whether
such information also should be required to be placed with the MSRB, in addition to or in lieu of a NRMSIR. The NRMSIRs
did not address the issue of requiring them to inform the MSRB whenever they received disclosure information from
an issuer, although one commenter argued that designating the MSRB as a repository only would add an unnecessary layer
to the dissemination process.
 Other commenters suggested designating a single central repository.
 Similarly, some commenters suggested imposing a requirement that disclosure information be delivered to all NRMSIRs,
 while others suggested that NRMSIRs be required to share the information received with other NRMSIRs,
 and a third group preferred the establishment of a central index.
 State-based information gatherers and disemminators had diverging views on this issue.
 










Based on these comments, the Commission has determined to require that annual financial information undertaken
to be provided be deposited with each NRMSIR and the appropriate SID in the issuer's state. Any audited financial statements
submitted in accordance with the undertakings also must be delivered to each NRMSIR and to the SID in the issuer's state,
if such a depository has been established. The requirement to have annual financial information and audited financial
statements delivered to all NRMSIRs and the appropriate SID is a modification of the Proposed Amendments. This modification
will ensure that all NRMSIRs receive disclosure information directly. It also permits the Commission to adopt the
amendments without a delay for the creation of a central index or a system of information sharing among NRMSIRs.
 The requirement to send information to all NRMSIRs rather than a single NRMSIR of the issuer's or obligated person's
choice, should not impose significant burdens or costs, other than duplication and mailing costs. Furthermore,
this requirement to deliver disclosure to the NRMSIRs and the appropriate SID also allays the anti-competitive concerns
raised by the creation of a single NRMSIR. 





In contrast to annual financial information, under the amendments, notices of material events, as well as notices
of a failure by an issuer or other obligated person to provide annual financial information must be delivered to each
NRMSIR or the MSRB, and the appropriate SID. The Commission is of the view that permitting issuers and obligated persons
to file such notices either with each NRMSIR or with the MSRB (as well as the appropriate SID) will facilitate prompt
and wide disclosure. The amendments reflect the preference of some commenters for filing such notices in one central
place, such as the MSRB, rather than having to file with multiple NRMSIRs. The Commission expects that if notices are
filed with the MSRB, the MSRB will make these notices available to all NRMSIRs on a prompt and contemporaneous basis.

5. Timing of Dissemination 



Due to the time sensitive nature of notices of material event and failures to provide annual financial statements,
it is important that such notices are disseminated quickly. These market requirements will dictate that disseminators
have a system in place by which information vendors can make such notices available to broker-dealers and investors
quickly and contemporaneously. 

NRMSIRs and other information vendors have indicated in their comment letters that under certain circumstances
a 15 minute turnaround
 time for notices of material events, and a 24 hour turnaround period for annual financial information may be feasible,
and, in some instances, already is in place.
 Nonetheless, because the ultimate scope of the information undertakings was not known to the existing and potential
NRMSIRs at the time they submitted their comments, the Commission intends to discuss with the NRMSIRs during the recognition
process appropriate and practicable turnaround standards for information re-dissemination. Because SIDs are
alternative sources of information for every type of disclosure, the Commission does not intend to impose strict
turnaround times for SIDs. Instead, SIDs should provide the Commission and users with a clear statement of turnaround
times that they will meet consistently. 






6. Technological Considerations 



The Commission also received many suggestions from information gatherers and vendors on streamlining the filing
of disclosure information. These suggestions included requiring electronic filing of disclosure information,
providing filings on computer disks and providing information to NRMSIRs as images of original source documents
rather than exclusively as coded text.
 Rather than dictate standards, the Commission encourages municipal securities market participants to coordinate
their requirements and preferences on an industry-wide basis. 





D. Exemptions 



The Proposed Amendments contained two new exemptions, which are being adopted with certain modifications. A third
new exemption from the annual financial information requirement, for short-term securities, also is being adopted.
In addition, Rule 15c2-12's limitation to primary offerings of municipal securities with an aggregate principal
amount of $1,000,000 or more, and its existing exemptions, also apply to the amendments.
 





1. Small Issuer Exemption 



The Proposed Amendments would have exempted from the provisions of the undertaking and recommendation prohibitions
of the rule municipal securities issued in Offerings by issuers that had (i) less than $10,000,000 in principal amount
of securities outstanding, including the offered securities and (ii) issued less than $3,000,000 in aggregate amount
of municipal securities in the most recent 48 months preceding the offering.

<TEXT>
 

A number of commenters discussed the appropriateness of the proposed dollar exemption, with comments ranging from
a call for increased thresholds to no thresholds at all.

180

 Some commenters believed that the thresholds should be increased, because many small municipalities would exceed
these thresholds if they delay their financings in order to issue a greater amount of bonds at one time. The commenters
argued that these are small, infrequent issuers with limited trading in the secondary market and the cost of compliance
would outweigh the benefits received from improved secondary market disclosure.

181








Other commenters took exception to the proposed thresholds because they were too high. These commenters argued that
the exemption as proposed would exclude from coverage of the rule the types of issuers who have historically had deficient
disclosure practices and disproportionate numbers of defaults.

182

 A number of commenters also argued that the $3 million/48 month component of the threshold was too complex.

183








As adopted,

184

 the exemption retains the aggregate $10,000,000 limitation, but eliminates the $3,000,000 threshold. Instead,
in addition to falling under the $10,000,000 in outstanding securities threshold, the exemption is conditioned
upon an issuer or obligated person providing a limited disclosure undertaking. Under this undertaking, financial
information and operating data concerning each obligor for which financial information or operating data is presented
in the final official statement, must be provided upon request to any person, or be provided at least annually to the
appropriate SID. The undertaking would specify the type of financial information and operating data that will be
made available annually, which must include financial information and operating data that is customarily prepared
by the obligated person and is publicly available. The final official statement must describe where and how the financial
information and operating data can be obtained.





Financial information and operating data of governmental issuers generally are subject to freedom of information
laws, and thus would be publicly available for purposes of this condition of the exemption. Conduit borrowers generally
provide annual financial information to trustees, credit enhancers, or the financing agency that issued the municipal
securities, and thus would have no difficulty complying with this standard if that information is made publicly available.
To the extent that an obligated person does not currently publicly disclose that information, they are free to specify
the type of information they are undertaking to provide on an ongoing basis, but they must agree to provide some information.
That information need not be the same type of information presented in the official statement. Nor would these exempt
persons have to release their audited financial statements, unless they otherwise customarily prepare and make
their audited financial statements publicly available. Moreover, the limited disclosure undertaking need only
cover those obligors for which financial information or operating data is provided in the official statement.

In addition to providing financial information and operating data annually, notices of material events must be sent
to each NRMSIR or to the MSRB, and the appropriate SID. This public information condition has been adopted in response
to comments highlighting the need for information regarding small issuers accessing the public debt market.

185







The threshold of $10,000,000 has been retained, notwithstanding comments that it was too high or too low. According
to statistics provided by one commenter,

186

 in 1993, 71% of the approximately 52,000 municipal issuers had under $10,000,000 in outstanding municipal securities.
Accordingly, the amendments as proposed already provided significant exemptive relief for small issuers. Indeed,
the fact that a majority of issuers fall below that threshold supports conditioning the exemption on a commitment
to provide a limited amount of secondary market information from exempt issuers. Even with that condition, a significant
percentage of offerings would remain totally exempt from the amendments as adopted, because over 20% of the total
issuances in 1993 were under $1,000,000.

187

 As these statistics demonstrate, the exemption should exclude a large percentage of small infrequent issuers.






Commenters also questioned how the aggregate thresholds were measured, including whose securities would be included
and whether the exemption applied only to outstanding securities that were sold in Offerings subject to the rule.

188

 Many commenters indicated that the thresholds should be separately applied to each issuer of municipal securities
and each underlying obligor.

189

 Thus, in the case of conduit issuers that have no liability on the municipal securities, commenters argued that the
thresholds should be determined by reference to the persons who are the beneficiaries of the financing.

190

 Some commenters argued that those issuers that had different types of financings that relied on separate revenue
streams for repayment, such as dedicated tax revenues, should not be foreclosed from relying on the small issuer exemption
for each financing.

191

<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00205 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To address the first of these concerns, the amendments have been revised to clarify that the availability of the exemption
turns on the amount of outstanding municipal securities for which an issuer or obligated person also is an obligated
person. An issuer of municipal securities would need to satisfy the threshold only if it were an obligated person with
respect to the security being offered. Under this approach, if a financing agency that is offering obligations that
have some recourse to the agency, only those outstanding securities of the agency that likewise are recourse would
count toward the threshold. If the financing agency does not issue recourse securities, the exemption will be unavailable
only if a conduit borrower obligated on the municipal securities being offered is an obligated person with respect
to more than $10,000,000 in outstanding municipal securities. If any one obligated person in an Offering exceeds
the threshold, then the entire Offering, including all obligated persons, will be subject to the rule. Subsequent
non-recourse offerings by the financing agency would not be affected, but would be subject to a similar test.

With respect to the second concern, however, the amendments require that an obligated person aggregate all its outstanding
obligations, even if some are payable from separate dedicated revenue sources. For example, a city or county that
issues securities for a number of different purposes could not qualify as a small and infrequent issuer merely because
its outstanding securities are payable from separate revenue streams. Thus, while a governmental issuer's outstanding
obligations need not be aggregated with that of non-governmental obligated persons, a governmental issuer could
not avoid aggregation of its securities by restricting repayment to separate revenue streams.

192







Commenters also discussed a related issue of what securities would be included in the calculation. Commenters contended
that only publicly offered securities should be included in the calculation. Other commenters questioned how short
term obligations such as bond anticipation notes, refunded bonds and installment/lease purchase agreements would
be treated. Several commenters suggested that the threshold should be measured only against publicly offered, long-term
bonds.

193







The amendments have been clarified in this respect to exclude from the threshold calculation securities that were
offered in transactions exempt from Rule 15c2-12 because they were otherwise exempt as private placements
and short term financings. In addition, to the extent that an issuer or obligated person is no longer liable for repayment
on bonds, as with certain defeased bonds, then such bonds would not be included in the calculation of the threshold
for such issuer or obligated person.

A number of commenters indicated that an exemption should be available based on the number of holders of the municipal
securities.

194

 However, in accordance with concerns voiced by other commenters regarding the difficulty in ascertaining the number
of holders due to the fact that most municipal securities are held in street name through a very limited number of depositories,

195

 the amendments do not adopt any exemption based on the number of holders of the municipal securities.






A variety of other comments were raised relating to exemptions, and a number of alternative exemptions were proposed,
including exemptions based on the type of issuer or the existence of an investment grade rating.

196

 Commenters also believed that an exemption should be available for securities covered by bond insurance or other
credit enhancement, such as bank letters of credit.

197

 Except as described above, the exemptions have not been revised to adopt these suggestions. Commenters, including
some bond insurance providers,

198

 expressed the view that the existence of credit enhancement does not necessarily eliminate the need for information
regarding the underlying credit.







A number of commenters also argued that new exemptions should be added that would mirror exemptions under the Securities
Act.

199

 Some commenters argued that exemptions should be included for non-profit entities that would have their own exemption
from registration under the Securities Act.

200

 The Commission is not including any exclusion in the amendments for any such issuers. Issuers accessing the tax-exempt
public securities markets have obligations to promote the integrity and efficiency of those markets. As the Commission
noted in the Interpretive Release, the high level of defaults in sectors such as healthcare, lifecare, retirement
homes and multifamily housing, relative to other market sectors,

201

 and the past problems with the sufficiency of information in many of these sectors, weighs heavily against adopting
such exclusions.

2. Exemption from the Annual Financial Information Requirement for Short-term Securities 



A new exemption has been added to exempt from the requirement for an undertaking calling for annual financial information,
Offerings of securities with an 18 month or shorter maturity.

202

 The new exemption is in response to comments suggesting that the rule not require annual financial information in
situations where the securities would mature shortly after, or possibly even before, the annual financial information
would be due.

203

 The provisions of the amended rule relating to notices of material events, however, would apply to these Offerings
absent some other Rule 15c2-12 exemption. 






3. Exemptions from the Recommendation Prohibition 



The Proposed Amendments also included a new exemption,

204

 which would have permitted the recommendation in the secondary market of securities that were not subject to the underwriting
prohibition, either because they were sold in a primary offering

205

 of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of less than $1,000,000, or came within the existing exemptions
for limited placements, short-term securities, and securities with demand features,

206

 or within the new exemption for small, infrequent issuers.

207

 This exemption has been adopted as proposed,

208

 with the exception that securities sold in an exempt Offering that is subject to the limited undertaking condition,

209

 are not exempt from the application of the recommendation prohibition. Pursuant to this element of the small issuer
exemption, dealers must have in place procedures to receive notices of material events.

210

 











4. Transactional Exemption 



The existing Rule 15c2-12 transactional exemption

211

 permits the Commission to exempt any Participating Underwriter from any requirement of the rule. Because Rule 15c2-12,
as amended, places requirements on brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in the secondary market,
the transactional exemption has been amended to clarify that the Commission has exemptive authority with respect
to both Participating Underwriters, in connection with Offerings, and with respect to brokers, dealers, and municipal
securities dealers recommending transactions in the secondary market.

212

 






E. Transitional Provision 



The rule as amended contains a transitional provision for the amendments to Rule 15c2-12.

213

 The underwriting prohibition applies to a Participating Underwriter that has contractually committed to act as
an underwriter in an Offering on or after the effective date of the rule, July 3, 1995; provided that issuers need not
undertake to provide annual financial information for fiscal years ending prior to January 1, 1996. The recommendation
prohibition will become effective on January 1, 1996. The Commission is of the view that this delay of six months beyond
the effective date of the amendment relating to the underwriting of municipal securities is sufficient to permit
participants in the municipal securities market to design procedures for compliance with the provisions of Rule
15c2-12. Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers must, therefore, have procedures in place to comply
with the recommendation prohibition on or before January 1, 1996. Finally, the limited undertaking condition to
the small issuer exemption need not be satisfied for offerings commencing prior to January 1, 1996. 





III. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations 



Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act

214

 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, to consider the anticompetitive effects of those rules,
if any, and to balance that impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the
Exchange Act. The Commission has considered the amendments to Rule 15c2-12 in light of the standard cited in
Section 23(a)(2) and believes the adoption of the amendments will not impose any burden on competition not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act.

In addition, the Commission has prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis (``FRFA''), pursuant to the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act

215

 regarding the proposed amendments to Rule 15c2-12. The Commission requested comment on the extent to which
current practice deviates from the requirements of the proposed amendments, and the extent to which additional costs
may be imposed on small issuers, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers if the amendments are adopted
as proposed. The FRFA indicates that the amendments to the rule could impose some additional costs on small broker-dealers
and municipal issuers. Nonetheless, the Commission is of the view that many of the substantive requirements of the
amendments already are observed, absent access to the continuing information provided by the amendments, by issuers,
brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers as a matter of business practice, or to fulfill their existing
obligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. To the extent that the Proposed Amendments
would have imposed additional costs on small issuers, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers, in response
to commenters' concerns, the Commission has modified the amendments as described. 





A copy of the FRFA may be obtained from Janet W. Russell-Hunter, Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, Division of Market
Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Mail Stop 7-10, Washington, DC 20549,

amount of $1,000,000 or more (an ``Offering'') unless the Participating Underwriter complies with the requirements
of this section or is exempted from the provisions of this section.

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is adopting amendments to Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that will require
brokers and dealers to provide customers immediate written notification of information relevant to their securities
transactions. Consistent with the Commission's investor protection mandate and in keeping with innovations in
securities products and markets, the amendments will require brokers and dealers to provide information concerning
customer transaction costs in specified NASDAQ and exchange-listed securities, the status of certain unrated debt
securities, the status of certain non-SIPC member broker-dealers, and the availability of information regarding
asset-backed securities.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction and Summary


A. Price Transparency


During the past year, the Commission has initiated efforts to further improve the efficiency of, and to protect investors
in, the municipal securities and other debt markets. In September 1993, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation
published the 

Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market 

(``Staff Report''),

1

 which contained several recommendations to improve the municipal securities market. The Staff Report recommended,
among other things, riskless principal mark-up disclosure as a means of providing greater information to investors
purchasing municipal securities.

2

 The Staff Report noted that, unlike the equity markets where mark-ups and mark-downs

3

 are disclosed to investors in non-market maker riskless principal transactions and principal transactions in ``reported
securities,''

4

 mark-ups are not disclosed in any principal transaction in municipal securities.

5

 Thus, investors of municipal securities are constrained in their ability to compare transaction costs among broker-dealers
and across markets. The Staff Report identified this ability as one of the benefits of mark-up disclosure.

6

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to enhanced confirmation disclosure, the Staff Report discussed the overall benefits of price transparency
and the need for greater transparency in the municipal securities market.

7

 Notably, price transparency enhances market liquidity and depth, and fosters investor confidence,

8

 while a lack of price information impairs market pricing mechanisms, weakens competition, and prevents investors
from monitoring the quality of their executions.

9

 






To address some of the recommendations contained in the Staff Report, on March 9, 1994, the Commission issued for comment
proposed Rule 15c2-13 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'')

10

 to require disclosure of mark-ups in riskless principal transactions in municipal securities. Because the same
benefits of mark-up disclosure apply to other debt transactions, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10
(``Rule'') under the Exchange Act that would require riskless principal mark-up disclosure for debt securities
other than municipal securities.

11

 





Since the Proposing Release was issued for comment on March 9, 1994, municipal market participants have proposed
significant new ways of making pricing information more widely available to investors. The Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') has taken the first step toward a system that will make publicly available price information
for municipal securities transactions on a next day basis. Recently, the MSRB stated that its ``ultimate goal for
the [transparency] program is to collect and make available transaction information in a comprehensive and contemporaneous
manner (footnote omitted) * * * [and] wishe[d] to reiterate to the Commission its commitment to these
goals.''

12

 The Public Securities Association (``PSA'') also has proposed a system to publicize municipal securities price
information. These proposals will create the infrastructure necessary to enhance transparency in the market, and
when fully implemented, will provide last sale reporting for virtually all municipal securities transactions.





The Commission is encouraged by these developments, and after careful consideration, has determined to defer the
riskless principal mark-up proposal for six months

13

 in anticipation of meaningful progress by the industry toward enhanced price transparency in the municipal securities
market. The riskless principal mark-up proposals would provide better information only to a certain segment of transactions
in the debt markets. The industry's efforts to improve transparency, on the other hand, ultimately will result in
enhanced price disclosure for 

all

 transactions. Moreover, better dissemination of price information will benefit investors by providing them with
useful information at the time they are making their investment decision, rather than after-the-fact when the confirmation
is received. If, at the end of the six-month period, industry initiatives to improve price transparency have not progressed
to the Commission's satisfaction, however, the Commission may reconsider the riskless principal mark-up proposal
in light of existing alternatives. 




B. Other Disclosures


In addition to the riskless principal mark-up proposals, the Commission proposed several other amendments designed
to improve confirmation disclosure so that customers can better evaluate their securities transactions. Specifically,
the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 that would require broker-dealers to disclose (1) mark-ups
in connection with transactions in certain NASDAQ and regional exchange-listed securities; (2) if they are not members
of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC''); (3) information relevant to certain types of collateralized
debt instruments; and (4) if a debt security has not been rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization
(``NRSRO''). Proposed Rule 15c2-13 contained a similar provision requiring broker-dealers to disclose the
unrated status of a municipal security.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00213 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission also requested comment on the broader issue of whether the shortened settlement period of three days
(``T+3 Settlement'') will have an effect on the future utility of the confirmation and whether some information currently
required in the confirmation could be shifted to an account statement.

14

 In addition, the Commission proposed adding a preliminary statement to Rule 10b-10 designed to clarify that
the Rule is not intended as a safe harbor from the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

15

 






In response to the request for comment, the Commission received 344 comment letters, the majority of which addressed
the mark-up disclosure proposals for riskless principal transactions. Commenters included regional and national
broker-dealers, industry associations, financial institutions, law firms, insurance companies, and individual
investors.

16

 The comments presented a range of views with respect to the proposals and the effects that the proposed disclosure
requirements may have on broker-dealers, investors, and markets. 





After a review of the comments, the Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 that require
disclosure if a debt security is not rated by an NRSRO, with a modification to exclude all government securities from
the disclosure requirement; mark-up disclosure in connection with transactions in certain NASDAQ and regional
exchange-listed securities; disclosure if a broker-dealer is not a member of SIPC, except for certain transactions
in investment company shares by non-SIPC member firms that do not handle customer funds or securities; and disclosure
with respect to the availability of information with respect to transactions in collateralized debt securities.
The Commission also is adopting the preliminary note to Rule 10b-10. To allow firms the appropriate time to adapt
their systems to accommodate these disclosure requirements, the proposals will become effective April 3, 1995.


In addition, that portion of Rule 15c2-13 that would require disclosure if a municipal security was not rated
by an NRSRO has been deferred and will be withdrawn if the MSRB acts to adopt similar amendments to its confirmation
rule, Rule G-15.

17

 The MSRB recently reiterated its willingness to amend Rule G-15 to require disclosure if a municipal security
is not rated by an NRSRO.

18

 






II. Description of Amendments 



A. Role of the Confirmation 



The Commission's confirmation rule, Rule 10b-10

19

 under the Exchange Act,

20

 generally requires a broker-dealer effecting a customer transaction in securities (other than U.S. Savings Bonds
or municipal securities) to provide written notification to its customer, at or before completion of a transaction,
that discloses information specific to the transaction. The confirmation requires, among other things, the disclosure
of: The date, time, identity, and number of shares bought or sold;

21

 the capacity of the broker-dealer;

22

 the net dollar price and yield of a debt security;

23

 and, under specified circumstances, the amount of compensation paid to the broker-dealer and whether payment for
order flow is received.

24

 For over 50 years, the customer confirmation has served basic investor protection functions by conveying information
allowing investors to verify the terms of their transactions; alerting investors to potential conflicts of interest
with their broker-dealers; acting as a safeguard against fraud; and providing investors the means to evaluate the
costs of their transactions and the quality of their broker-dealer's execution. 










1. T+3 Settlement 



In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on the future utility of the confirmation once T+3 Settlement
is implemented on June 7, 1995.

25

 Rule 10b-10 requires that a confirmation be sent at or before completion of a customer transaction.

26

 Commenters noted that T+3 Settlement will diminish the confirmation's usefulness as a customer invoice and questioned
the practicability of requiring the disclosure of additional information on a document that an investor will receive
after already having made his or her investment decision and tendering funds or securities.

27

 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-0-00214 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Notwithstanding the shortened settlement period of T+3 and the possibility that an investor may receive the confirmation
after payment has been made, the Commission believes that the confirmation will continue to serve important investor
protection functions. T+3 Settlement's implementation merely may mean that the confirmation may take on a different
role. Some firms may continue to use the confirmation as a customer invoice, while financing positions when customer
payment is received after settlement date. For other firms, the confirmation may not continue to serve in all circumstances
as an invoice of a transaction because ordinary confirmation delivery and transfer of customer funds and securities
may not be feasible within a three-day settlement cycle.

28

 Rather, the confirmation may serve primarily as written evidence of the contract between the customer and broker-dealer.

29

 As a written record of the transaction, the confirmation will continue to provide investors the necessary information
to assist them in evaluating the quality and accuracy of their trades while assisting them in correcting mistakes
and verifying the terms of their transactions. Accordingly, while T+3 Settlement may affect the mechanics of settlement,
it will not eliminate the confirmation's investor protection functions. 






2. Periodic Account Statement 



The Commission also requested comment on the feasibility of transferring information currently disclosed on the
confirmation to a periodic account statement.

30

 Many commenters addressing this issue opposed such a use of the periodic account statement and noted that it was not
the appropriate document to convey particularized trade information.

31

 Rather, as one commenter indicated, account statements are intended to summarize the activity and status of an account;
they are not intended to convey information regarding the features and risks of each individual securities transaction.

32

 Other commenters, however, noted that, as investors increasingly rely upon periodic account statements, the confirmation
will diminish as a primary disclosure device.

33

 At this time, the Commission has determined to retain the confirmation as the basic transaction disclosure document
and use the account statement, the account opening document, or annual disclosure requirements as needed to supplement
or summarize confirmation disclosures.

The Commission noted in the Proposing Release, however, that a customer may waive the receipt of an immediate confirmation
in the context where a fiduciary has discretion over the customer's account.
 The Commission noted that, in its view, the account, rather than the fiduciary, was the customer for purposes of Rule
10b-10. To effect a valid waiver, the broker-dealer must (1) obtain from the customer a written agreement that
the fiduciary receive the immediate confirmation; and (2) send to the customer a periodic report, not less frequently
than quarterly, containing the same information that would have been contained in an immediate confirmation.
 The customer may not waive this periodic report.
 







The requirement to send a periodic report is intended to ensure that the 

beneficial owner

 of the account receives material information needed to verify the transaction in the account.
 As the Commission noted in the release originally adopting Rule 10b-10, the Rule is not intended to require a
broker-dealer dealing with the trustee of a plan to deliver statements to plan participants where the trustee is the
shareholder of record of the securities being purchased or sold. In those instances, the Rule would require the broker-dealer
to deliver a confirmation, or upon written request, a periodic report, only to the trustee.

38

 A beneficiary of the trust would be required to receive an immediate confirmation, or upon written request, the periodic
report, only if that beneficiary was a beneficial owner of the trust assets on the books of the broker-dealer, enjoying
the rights and privileges of beneficial ownership. 






The Commission also believes that the broker-dealer can satisfy its obligation to send a confirmation to the customer
if it sends the confirmation to a custodian of the customer authorized to receive securities and disburse funds for
the customer.
 The custodian in question must not be affiliated with a broker-dealer or an investment adviser or have any role in choosing
the broker-dealer or investment adviser used;
 and the customer must retain the right to request that the confirmation be sent directly to the customer, at no extra
charge by the custodian or broker-dealer. Moreover, an account custodian may not choose to receive a periodic report
in place of an immediate confirmation.

3. Preliminary Note 



The Commission proposed adding a preliminary note to Rule 10b-10 clarifying that the Rule is not intended as
a safe harbor from disclosure obligations imposed by the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities
laws.

41

 This note is intended to respond to claims made by litigants that Rule 10b-10 prescribes all the necessary disclosure
relevant to a customer's securities transaction.

42

 A few commenters addressed the inclusion of the preliminary note to Rule 10b-10, with equal support for

43

 and opposition to

44

 the note. One supporter suggested that the Commission could accomplish the same purpose of clarification in an interpretative
release.

45

 One opponent of the preliminary note argued that its existence would lead to frivolous claims against broker-dealers.

46

 










After reviewing the comments, the Commission is adopting the preliminary note to Rule 10b-10. The Commission
is not persuaded that the existence of the preliminary note would lead to any additional litigation against broker-dealers.
The preliminary note is merely making explicit a longstanding position that the antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws may impose, given the circumstances, greater disclosure than what may be required by a specific rule
or regulation.

47

 





B. Mark-Up and Mark-Downs in Riskless Principal Transactions in Debt Securities



The majority of comment letters addressed the proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 and the portion of proposed
Rule 15c2-13 that would require mark-up disclosure of riskless principal trades in debt securities.

48

 Generally, most commenters opposed the proposals on the grounds that the requirements would have detrimental effects
on competition and market liquidity; would cause compliance difficulties; would create customer confusion; and
are not based upon findings of abusive practices in the debt market. 





It has been argued by some commenters that greater price transparency in the municipal market could achieve similar
goals as riskless principal mark-up disclosure without the alleged negative effects purported to result from mark-up
disclosure.

49

 Since the proposals were published for comment in March, progress has been made to develop price transparency in the
debt markets. In particular, the MSRB has proposed a program that ultimately would provide same day price reporting
of all transactions in municipal securities, including same day reporting of retail trades. This program is to be
implemented in four phases. As proposed, the first phase of the MSRB program will collect reports of interdealer transactions
and make available to the public daily high-low and average price figures for the most frequently traded issues (initially
defined as those trading at least four times during the day).

50

 These requirements will be expanded in phase two to include institutional customer transactions. The third phase
will expand the daily reporting requirements to include retail customer transactions, and phase four will advance
reporting times closer in time to the transaction, such as by the end of day or within a specified time period following
the trade. In the initial phases of the MSRB's proposal, information regarding the prices and volume of transactions
in approximately 80 to 240 issues would be reported each day. As each phase is implemented, the MSRB will review closely
this information and system operations, with a view toward reflecting a greater number of issues and transactions
in the reports.

<TEXT>
 

In addition to the proposal by the MSRB, the PSA has proposed two initiatives to convey municipal securities pricing
information to retail investors. First, the PSA proposes to develop a generic scale and yield curve for AAA-insured
revenue bonds. This information, which will be made available to daily newspapers, is intended to provide customers
with grade information on the price and yield of a representative range of bonds. Second, the PSA proposes to establish
a 900-number which investors could call to obtain price information regarding particular municipal securities.

Although the MSRB's initiative is in a developmental stage, the Commission believes it ultimately could provide
the public with improved information about the price of municipal securities. If widely published, this information
would allow investors to better assess the prices provided by their broker-dealers in a municipal securities trade.
In light of these proposals, the Commission has decided to defer for a period of six months adoption of that part of Rule
15c2-13 requiring the disclosure of mark-ups for riskless principal transactions in municipal securities.


The Commission has deferred adoption of the riskless principal mark-up disclosure proposal in order to ascertain
whether the proposed price information systems can provide more meaningful benefits to investors in the long-term
and to assess the progress of the industry in developing the proposed systems. Price transparency, if fully developed,
will provide better market information to investors on a timely basis (

e.g., 

before the transaction). Potentially, price transparency also could provide investors the ability to determine
the value of their municipal securities purchased in principal transactions. The proposed mark-up disclosure,
on the other hand, would have provided cost information to investors only in riskless principal transactions and
would not have applied to other principal transactions, the majority of transactions in the debt market. Price transparency,
if fully developed, meets investors' need for information without focusing on only one portion of the market, which
commenters argued could lead to a deleterious restructuring of the market, thus reducing market liquidity and narrowing
the available choices of securities sold to customers.

51







The Commission recognizes that these benefits depend on the sound design and successful implementation of transparency
proposals. Their value to investors further depends on widespread availability of the information, and customer
understanding of how it should be used. At the end of six months, the Commission will assess the need for further action
based upon the prospects for the availability of meaningful pricing information to a broad range of investors about
a full range of securities. If such information is not likely to be available, the Commission will explore alternatives
to better provide information to fixed income investors. To this end, the Commission similarly is deferring the proposed
amendment to Rule 10b-10 requiring mark-up disclosure for other debt securities. While the Commission believes
it is appropriate to address transparency in municipal securities initially because of the presence of a large proportion
of individual investors in that market, during the deferral, the Commission expects the industry to address the extent
to which customer price information can be increased in debt markets other than the municipal securities market.
The Commission recognizes that the government, corporate, and mortgage securities markets have different levels
of price information publicly available. For example, GovPx, a joint venture of primary dealers and interdealer
brokers formed in 1990, provides to investors real-time quotations, trade prices, and volume information for U.S.
Treasury and other government securities via a worldwide network of 12,000 terminals. In addition, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') developed the Fixed Income Pricing System (``FIPS''), which
collects, processes, and disseminates real-time firm quotations for 30 to 50 of the most liquid, high yield bonds
traded in the over-the-counter market.

52

 The Commission expects the industry to review the availability of information to investors in each of these markets
and consider methods of increasing transparency as an alternative to riskless principal disclosure in these markets.





Even though the Commission is deferring the adoption of riskless principal mark-up disclosure, the Commission continues
to believe that, absent transparency in the debt markets, the disclosure of the dealer's cost along with the mark-up
would be of use to customers in assessing the value of their debt securities. In the absence of progress on transparency,
the Commission will revisit its riskless principal proposal. The Commission also may consider whether to require
the disclosure of all mark-ups in principal transactions based on the underlying inventory costs,

53

 or the prevailing market price

54

 or to mandate alternative price transparency systems. 






The Commission strongly believes that real progress is needed in a timely fashion to achieve the goal of better customer
information for market prices in the debt market. Achievement of this goal will add strength to and confidence in the
debt markets, to the benefit of both broker-dealers and investors.

C. Disclosure of Unrated Securities 


The Commission also published for comment a requirement to disclose, if applicable, that certain debt securities
have not been rated by an NRSRO.

55

 The proposal excluded government securities defined under Section 3(a)(42) (A) and (B) of the Exchange Act,

56

 but requested specific comment on whether other securities should be excluded from this disclosure.

57

 In addition, specific comment was requested whether the MSRB should implement the disclosure requirement with respect
to municipal securities, rather than the Commission.

58

 








Of the 43 commenters that addressed this disclosure proposal, 24 supported the proposal.

59

 Some commenters believed that the disclosure requirement did not go far enough and indicated that specific ratings
also should be disclosed on the confirmation.

60

 In particular, commenters believed that the confirmation should bear all ratings of securities, particularly those
rated below investment grade.

61

 







Ten commenters opposed the disclosure requirement on the grounds that requiring this disclosure may be unhelpful
to investors. They argued that such disclosure may cause investors to believe that unrated securities are inferior
to rated securities, when the unrated security may pose less risk than a rated security, particularly a security rated
below investment grade.

62

 They noted that such disclosure does not explain the reasons why a security may not have a credit rating_notably that
smaller, but no less sound, issuers may not wish to bear the expense of obtaining a credit rating.

63

 Commenters also questioned why the Commission excluded from the disclosure requirement only government securities
defined under Section 3(a)(42)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act.

64

 In particular, Freddie Mac argued that securities issued by government sponsored enterprises (``GSEs''), including
those issued by Freddie Mac, also should be excluded from the disclosure requirement. Freddie Mac argued that, because
of the market's assessment of the creditworthiness of GSEs, it makes little economic sense for a GSE to bolster its
creditworthiness with an independent rating.

65

 Finally, some commenters believed that the MSRB should adopt any rule affecting the municipal securities market;
other commenters were neutral whether the Commission or the MSRB implemented rulemaking. 







After considering the comments, the Commission is adopting the proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 requiring disclosure
if a debt security, other than a government security, has not been rated by an NRSRO. Such disclosure would be more meaningful
to the investor if it is made together with the description of the security. As noted in the Proposing Release, this
disclosure is not intended to suggest that an unrated security is inherently riskier than a rated security.

66

 Rather, the disclosure is intended to alert customers that they may wish to obtain further information or clarification
from their broker-dealers. In most cases, this disclosure should verify information that was disclosed to the investor
prior to the transaction. If a customer was not previously informed of the security's unrated status, then confirmation
disclosure may prompt a dialogue between the customer and broker-dealer. 




The Commission agrees with commenters that all ``government securities'' should be excluded from the unrated debt
disclosure requirement, not just those defined under Section 3(a)(42)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act.

67

 Therefore, government securities meeting the definition under sub-paragraphs (C) and (D) of Section 3(a)(42),
which includes securities issued by GSEs, will be exempt from the disclosure requirement. The Commission, however,
does not intend to expand the class of securities subject to the exclusion beyond those defined as government securities
in Section 3(a)(42).

The non-rated debt proposal for municipal securities was contained in proposed Rule 15c2-13. In its comment
letter, the MSRB stated that, ``[t]he Board 
agrees with the Commission that, while the fact that a bond is unrated is not necessarily indicative of problems, disclosure
of the fact would be helpful to investors.''

68

 The MSRB also noted that, if the Commission determined that such information was needed by investors in debt securities,
it would amend its confirmation rule, Rule G-15, and require disclosure if a municipal security has not been
rated by an NRSRO.

69

 Inasmuch as other confirmation requirements for municipal securities are currently set forth in Rule G-15
of the MSRB, the Commission is willing to defer this portion of the proposal to allow the MSRB to adopt the requirement
as part of its rules, and will withdraw it after the MSRB has taken action. 





D. Disclosure of Mark-Ups and Mark-Downs in Certain NASDAQ and Exchange-Listed Securities 



As part of the amendments to Rule 10b-10, the Commission proposed requiring the disclosure of mark-up information
for principal transactions in certain securities quoted on NASDAQ or listed on regional exchanges.

70

 This proposal covered securities that are subject to last sale reporting, but are not technically ``reported securities''
under Rule 11Aa3-1 of the Exchange Act.

71

 As noted in the Proposing Release, the NASD adopted amendments to its confirmation rule requiring the disclosure
of mark-up information in principal transactions in securities that are not NASDAQ/NMS securities_

i.e., 

NASDAQ Small Cap Securities.

72

 The purpose of the proposed amendment is to consolidate disclosures already required under NASD rules. Because last
sale information is available for regional exchange-listed securities, the Commission proposed to extend the disclosure
requirements to those securities, in addition to Small Cap Securities. By adopting this proposal, the confirmation
rule will treat all equity securities subject to last sale reporting similarly, irrespective of their trading markets.








The two comments that addressed this requirement supported the proposal.

73

 Accordingly, under Rule 10b-10, broker-dealers effecting principal transactions in Small-Cap NASDAQ and regional
exchange-listed securities that are subject to last-sale reporting will be required to disclose on the confirmation
the reported trade price, price to the customer, and the difference, if any, between the two prices.

E. Disclosure of Coverage by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation 


In order to reduce investor confusion concerning a firm's SIPC coverage,

74

 the Commission proposed to amend Rule 10b-10 to require affirmative disclosure, if applicable, when a broker-dealer
is not a member of SIPC and when an account is carried by a non-SIPC-member broker or dealer. Generally, the Securities
Investor Protection Act of 1970 requires broker-dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15(b) of the
Exchange Act to be members of SIPC. Certain types of broker-dealers registered under Section 15(b), as well as all
broker-dealers registered as government securities brokers and dealers under Section 15C of the Exchange Act, are
excluded from SIPC membership.

75

 





Many commenters addressing this issue supported the Commission's proposal to inform customers when their broker-dealers
are not SIPC members.

76

 Other commenters generally agreed with requiring the disclosure, but disagreed that the confirmation was the appropriate
disclosure medium and suggested that non-membership status in SIPC be disclosed in a periodic account statement
or opening account document.

77

 Commenters opposing the disclosure initiative argued that the disclosure would be misleading to investors in that
they would believe that they are at greater risk when dealing with a non-SIPC firm.

78

 The Investment Company Institute (``ICI'') argued that requiring ``negative disclosure'' concerning the lack
of SIPC coverage is contrary to the reasons certain persons are exempted from the membership requirement in the first
instance_namely, excluded broker-dealers present limited risks to investors because they do not hold customer
funds.

79

 








The Commission, consistent with its authority under the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993,

80

 is adopting the proposed amendment to ensure that customers are not led to believe that their accounts are subject
to protection beyond what actually is the case.

81

 This disclosure is relevant and meaningful to investors. Further, the confirmation is the best vehicle to convey
this information to customers on a transaction-specific basis, particularly in situations where a customer is dealing
with affiliated broker-dealers and one or more of the affiliates is not a SIPC member. 






The Commission agrees, however, that certain instances exist where this disclosure should not apply.

82

 For instance, the ICI stated that in some cases when a broker-dealer contracts with an investment company for the distribution
of fund shares, customers purchasing such shares will send their purchase money directly to the fund's transfer agent.

83

 The transfer agent then will issue shares to the customer against receipt of the purchase money and send the money to
the fund's custodian bank. In this situation, customer funds are not handled by the broker-dealer. In addition, the
ICI argued that the transfer agent or fund underwriter, when sending the confirmation on behalf of the broker-dealer,
may not know the SIPC status of a particular broker-dealer. Accordingly, the disclosure provision contains an exclusion
that is intended to apply only in cases where the non-SIPC broker-dealer does not receive or handle in any form customer
funds or securities in connection with a purchase or redemption of registered open-end investment company or unit
investment trust shares and the customer sends its purchase money or securities to the fund, its transfer agent, its
custodian, or its designated agent, none of whom are associated persons of the broker-dealer. Furthermore, checks
may not be made payable to the broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer may not handle any customer checks in connection
with the transaction. Otherwise, the broker-dealer would be required to disclose its non-SIPC status. Therefore,
if a broker-dealer, including a fund underwriter, receives customer funds or securities and promptly forwards funds
or securities to the investment company, transfer agent, custodian, or other designated agent, the confirmation
would have to disclose the non-SIPC status of the broker-dealer.

F. Disclosures Relating to Asset-Backed Securities 



In 1983, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 10b-10 to require disclosure of yield information on a customer
confirmation, recognizing that such information is important to investors when evaluating the merits of investing
in various debt securities.

84

 Currently, Rule 10b-10 requires the disclosure of (1) the yield to maturity, if the transaction is effected
on the basis of dollar price;

85

 (2) the dollar price calculated from yield, if the transaction is effected on a yield basis;

86

 and (3) if effected on a basis other than dollar price or yield to maturity, and the yield to maturity will be less than
the represented yield, then both the yield to maturity and the represented yield.

87

 








Rule 10b-10 exempts from the yield disclosure requirements any instrument that is a ``participation interest
in notes secured by liens upon real estate continuously subject to prepayment.''

88

 Since the adoption of the yield disclosure requirements, structured financings have expanded to include securities
backed by mortgage notes, automobile loans, computer leases, consumer debt, and other receivables. These asset-backed
securities raised similar problems of variable yield. Accordingly, the Commission proposed to expand the range
of securities subject to the exemptions from yield disclosure to include asset-backed securities that are not insulated
from prepayment risk or susceptible to an accurate forecast of yield.

89

 






In addition, the Commission proposed to require particularized disclosures in connection with transactions in
collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs'').

90

 Specifically, the Commission proposed amendments that would require broker-dealers to disclose on the confirmation
the particular CMO's (1) estimated yield; (2) weighted average life; and (3) prepayment assumptions underlying
the yield.

91

 






Some commenters supported the Commission's proposal to require disclosure of CMO information and noted that such
disclosures were provided to investors as a matter of course, either in a confirmation or other disclosure statements.

92

 Other commenters opposed confirmation disclosure of the estimated yield, weighted average life, and prepayment
assumptions on the grounds that the confirmation is not an appropriate disclosure vehicle to convey the information.

93

 In addition, commenters opposed disclosing such complex information in a confirmation because it could not be accomplished
in a meaningful way due to the document's limited size and space.

94

 Many commenters noted that detailed discussions concerning particular aspects of CMOs are contained in the prospectus
or other offering documents that are sent to investors prior to the time in which they make their investment decisions.

95

 








No comments were received regarding the proposal to expand the range of instruments that would be exempted from the
yield disclosure requirements. Because some instruments are not subject to predictable forecasts of the yield,
the Commission is adopting amendments exempting asset-backed instruments that are continuously subject to prepayment.
The exemption would apply only to those instruments that are not insulated from prepayment risk or otherwise susceptible
to an accurate forecast of yield.

96

 





In addition, in light of the comments concerning the proposed CMO disclosure, the Commission is modifying the amendment
requiring the disclosure of prepayment assumptions, weighted average life, and estimated yield of a CMO. The Commission
recognizes that broker-dealers intend confirmations to be brief, and thus size limitations may affect the detail
of disclosure that may be practically and meaningfully conveyed to the customer. Thus, while yield information is
important to investors of CMOs, as well as all mortgage and asset-backed securities, the Commission agrees that these
securities contain complexities that are difficult to explain using single figures in a confirmation. Accordingly,
rather than require the disclosure in the confirmation of specific numbers identifying the estimated yield, weighted
average life, and prepayment assumptions underlying the yield, the Commission is adopting a requirement that broker-dealers
include on the confirmation a statement alerting investors that their yields are subject to fluctuation depending
on the speed in which the underlying note or receivable prepays and that specific information is available upon written
request of the customer.

97

<PARENT> FR941117-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While information concerning prepayment assumptions and pricing of CMOs and other asset-backed securities may
be contained in disclosure documents at the offering stage, this type of detailed information has not been as readily
available in the secondary market for some asset-backed securities and to some investors.

98

 Under the Rule, as adopted, such information would be required to be sent to customers upon written request. In addition,
if in fact a CMO or other asset-back security is sold solely on the basis of one yield amount, the yield and underlying
assumptions should be disclosed on the confirmation, as well as the legend stating that these items may vary.

99

 This is consistent with those commenters that noted that they disclose yield information in CMO transactions as a
matter of course.

100

 The antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws would require that any information provided upon request
reflect changes or developments in the characteristics of the asset-backed security. 







III. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations 



Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act

101

 requires that the Commission, when adopting rules under the Exchange Act, consider the anticompetitive effects
of those rules, if any, and balance any anticompetitive impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of
furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission believes that adoption of the amendments to Rule 10b-10
will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act. 





The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``FRFA'') regarding the amendments to Rule
10b-10, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604. The FRFA notes the potential initial costs of operational and procedural
changes that may be necessary to comply with the amendments. In addition, the FRFA notes the benefits to investors
of increased disclosure that will result from these amendments. The Commission believes that the benefits of added
disclosure outweigh the costs that will be incurred by industry participants in complying with these amendments.


A copy of the FRFA will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth
Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

(a) 

Disclosure Requirement. 

It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to effect for or with an account of a customer any transaction in, or to induce
the purchase or sale by such customer of, any security (other than U.S. Savings Bonds or municipal securities) unless
such broker or dealer, at or before completion of such transaction, gives or sends to such customer written notification
disclosing: 

(1) The date and time of the transaction (or the fact that the time of the transaction will be furnished upon written
request to such customer) and the identity, price, and number of shares or units (or principal amount) o
