</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Revised notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Angeles National Forest published a Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement for a non-significant
amendment to the Angeles National Forest Land and Resources Management Plan in Volume 55, No. 173 / Thursday, September
6, 1990. The amendment would add 1640 acres to the Land Adjustment Plan, which is part of the Land and Resources Management
Plan. This is in response to a proposal to exchange land for the purpose of development of a solid waste management facility
in the Elsmere Canyon area of the Tujunga Ranger District, Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles County, California.



The Forest wishes to revise and update the Notice of Intent with the following information:




DECISION:

 The Forest Service must decide whether or not to exchange 1643 acres of National Forest land currently within the boundaries
of the Angeles National Forest for private lands within the boundaries of Angeles National Forest. Other private
lands within the boundaries of other National Forests within Southern California, may also be considered. As part
of that decision, an amendment to the existing Angeles National Forest Land Adjustment Plan would be made, adding
the 1643 acres to the Adjustment Plan. Further, the Angeles Land and Resources Management Plan would be amended to
reflect the changes in the Plan as a result of the decision. This decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR 215.

<DOCTITLE>Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity (LTEP) Research Project, Willamette National Forest, Lane County, OR</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement on a proposal to implement
a Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity research project. This project will result in establishing conditions across
a gradient of successional stages and organic matter levels on the forest floor according to the Long-Term Ecosystem
Productivity Program Integrated Research Sites, Governing Research Plan (PNW, Susan Little and others, 10/16/91).
Creating these conditions will require harvesting approximately 180 acres of 70 to 80 year old Douglas fir forest
by clearcutting and 90 acres of partial cutting. Other proposed activities include weather station siting, reforestation,
fuel control, and snag creation.


The Willamette National Forest invites additional written comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis.
Comments have already been received as the result of local public participation activities. The agency will also
give notice of the full environmental analysis and decision-making process so that interested and affected people
are made aware as to how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Long-Term Ecosystem Productivity planning area is located in the East Fork of Deer Creek drainage in portions
of T17S, R3E, Sections 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 35. This research site is one of six in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska designed
for long-term ecosystem productivity research. The Integrated Research Sites are established as a network of research
and monitoring sites to look at topics which are long-term, which are complex, and which demand the integration of
scientific disciplines. These sites will be studied over a period of 200 years to test the hypothesis that long-term
ecosystem productivity is directly affected by successional patterns and the level of down woody debris.




The nature and scope of the decision is to implement the research project. This EIS will tier to the Willamette National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (1990) as amended by the Record Of Decision and Standards and Guidelines
for Management of Habitat For Late Successional and Old-Growth Forest Related Species within the Range of the Northern
Spotted Owl.

On June 25, 1992 an amendment to the Willamette National Forest Plan made an allocation change of this Isolation Block
from Management Area 14a (General Forest) to a newly created allocation, Management Area 3b (Integrated Research
Site) and established Management Area (MA) standards and guidelines for MA 3b. 

Initial scoping began in February of 1991. Issues that were identified include water quality, soil productivity,
wildlife habitat, we area protection, and economics of helicopter harvesting needed for research objectives and
design.

Preliminary analysis and alternative formulation have resulted in the proposed action. This proposed action meets
the objectives of the Governing Research Plan and proposes to implement the research plan by treating approximately
180 clearcut acres and 90 partial cut acres of 70 to 80 year old Douglas fir forest. There are 3 study blocks, each containing
6 treatment units and 1 control area, resulting in a total of 18 treatment units and 3 control areas. Each treatment
unit would be approximately 15 acres in size. Helicopter yarding would be used for removal of the trees. The research
plan has been scaled down and refined to minimize environmental effects. At its fullest extent, the original research
concept would have included 36 treatment units and 4 control areas. Alternative 2 is the No Action alternative.


A scoping meeting will be held in early December. If you are interested in this meeting, please notify us for the location
and time. The Forest Service will be seeking additional information, comments and assistance from Federal, State
and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested or affected by the proposed project.
Additional information will be used to further identify key issues or develop other alternatives. This input will
be used in preparation of the draft EIS.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by March 1995. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of
availability in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, a reviewer of a draft EIS must structure their
participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's
position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, 553 

(1978

). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion
of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel,

 803 f. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objectives
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points.)

The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by May 1995. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to
comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding this
proposal. The responsible official will document the decision and rationale for the decision in the Record of Decision.
That decision will be subject to Forest Service appeal Regulations (36 CFR 217).

Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone_Fort Myers, FL; Application and Public Hearing 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Lee County Port Authority, requesting
authority to establish a general-purpose foreign-trade zone at two airport sites in Fort Myers, Florida. The main
site would be at Southwest Florida International Airport, which is a Customs user fee port facility. The application
was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations
of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 2, 1994. The applicant is authorized to make the proposal
under Section 288.36, Florida Statutes Annotated (1993). 




The two proposed sites (3,955 acres) are in Fort Myers, Lee County, on property owned and operated by the applicant.


Site 1

 (Southwest Florida International Airport_3,315 acres) is located at 16000 Chamberlin Parkway, and 

Site 2 

(Page Field_640 acres) is located adjacent to U.S. Highway 41, some 7 miles northwest of Site 1. There are cargo and
warehouse structures at both sites. 




The application contains evidence of the need for zone services in the Fort Myers area. Several firms have indicated
an interest in using zone procedures for warehousing/distribution of such items as electronic and telecommunication
products, audio-video equipment, oriental carpets, and assorted machinery. Specific manufacturing approvals
are not being sought at this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 57 FR 50790-50808, 10-8-91), a member of
the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 

As part of the investigation, the Commerce examiner will hold a public hearing on January 19, 1995 at 9:00 a.m., Training
Center at the Southwest Florida International Airport, Fort Myers, Florida. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is February
6, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period until February 21, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact; Proposed Federal Building_Courthouse, Central Islip, NY</DOCTITLE>



Description of Action



The proposed action involves the construction and operation of a new Federal Building_Courthouse complex on a 29-acre
site in Central Islip, Long Island, New York by the United States General Services Administration (GSA). The complex
will be developed in two phases and will provide space for the Untied States Courts for the Eastern District of New York
and other Federal agencies. The first phase of the development is scheduled for completion by 1998 and will contain
approximately 900,000 gross square feet of floor area, with 450,000 occupiable square feet allocated to U.S. Courts
and office space and 170,000 square feet (480 spaces) to covered parking. The second phase of the development, depending
upon future needs, is anticipated to be completed between the years 2006 and 2011, and would consist of an additional
building with a floor area of approximately 200,000 occupiable square feet.

The site of the proposed development is the former grounds of the Central Islip State Psychiatric Hospital, located
at exit 43A of the Southern State (Heckscher) Parkway on Long Island. The site is bounded by North Spur Drive to the south,
Carleton Avenue to the west, the John P. Cohalan, Jr. County Courts Complex to the north, and the cemetery of the Central
Islip State Psychiatric Hospital to the east. The site contains a pond and landscaped grounds associated with the
recently completed County complex, as well as surface parking for the complex and a groundwater recharge basin. The
site is owned by Suffolk County.



Finding



Pursuant to the provisions of GSA Order ADM P 100.2B and the Regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality,
November 29, 1978, and based upon the Environmental Assessment and review of the air quality analysis conducted for
the proposed action, the proposed action is not considered a major federal action significantly affecting the quality
of human environment.



Basis for Finding



The findings are presented in the Environmental Assessment, entitled New Federal Building_Courthouse, Central
Islip, New York, dated June 1994.

Construction and operation of the proposed Federal Building_Courthouse Complex would result in less than significant
impacts to the immediate project site and surrounding community. Less than significant adverse impacts would occur
to utility services, traffic and transportation movements to and from the site, noise, and air quality.

The General Services Administration reviewed the air quality analysis conducted for this project consistent with
the requirements of 40 CFR Part 93: ``Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation
Plans (SIP)'', issued on November 30, 1993. This ruling seeks to conform federal actions, such as the construction
of the Federal Building_Courthouse, to the purpose of the State Implementation Plan to reduce or eliminate violations
of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Criteria contained in 40 CFR Part 93 were applied to the air quality
analysis for the proposed project to determine the need to conduct a conformity analysis for the proposed action.

Suffolk County, in which the project is located, is in attainment with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for carbon monoxide levels. Therefore, federal conformity criteria contained in the general conformity rule for
this pollutant do not apply to the project. However, Suffolk County is in severe non-attainment with NAAQS for ozone
levels, and conformity criteria for this pollutant therefore do apply. The air quality analysis conducted for the
proposed action indicated that the combined predicted direct and indirect emissions for ozone precursors VOC's
and NO

X

 are 6.9 tons/year, and 16.1 tons/year, respectively. This is below the de minimus level of 25.0 tons/year for either
pollutant, as identified in the general conformity rule 40 CFR Part 93. Since the proposed facility conforms with
the allowed emissions limitations, no further conformity determination was deemed necessary.

Beneficial impacts would be realized through the increased efficiency of the Federal justice system. Beneficial
impacts upon the region's economy would also be realized by virtue of the construction and operating budgets associated
with the Federal Building_Courthouse Complex. Cumulative and secondary impacts would be controlled, mitigated
or avoided to the maximum extent possible.

Federal Financial Participation in State Assistance Expenditures; Federal Matching Shares for Aid to Families
With Dependent Children, Medicaid, and Aid to Needy Aged, Blind, or Disabled Persons for October 1, 1995 through September
30, 1996 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Percentages and Federal Medical Assistance Percentages for Fiscal Year 1996 have been calculated pursuant
to the Social Security Act (the Act). These percentages will be effective from October 1, 1995 through September 30,
1996. This notice announces the calculated ``Federal percentages'' and ``Federal medical assistance percentages''
that we will use in determining the amount of Federal matching in State welfare and medical expenditures. The table
gives figures for each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American
Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. Programs under title XIX of the act exist in each jurisdiction; title IV-A
programs in all jurisdictions except American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands; programs under titles I, X,
and XIV operate only in Guam and the Virgin Islands; while a program under title XVI (AABD) operates only in Puerto Rico.
The percentages in this notice apply to State expenditures for assistance payments and medical services (except
family planning which is subject to a higher matching rate). The statute provides separately for Federal matching
of administrative costs. 




Sections 1101(a)(8) and 1905(b) of the Act, as revised by section 9528 of Pub. L. 99-272, require the Secretary
of Health and Human Services to publish these percentages each year. The Secretary is to figure the percentages, by
formulas in sections 1101(a)(8) and 1905(b) of the Act, from the Department of Commerce's statistics of average income
per person in each State and in the Nation as a whole. The percentages are within upper and lower limits given in those
two sections of the Act. The statute specifies the percentages to be applied to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam,
American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. 

The ``Federal percentages'' are for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and aid to needy aged, blind, or
disabled persons, and the ``Federal medical assistance percentages'' are for Medicaid. However, under section
1118 of the Act, States with approved Medicaid plans may claim Federal matching funds for expenditures under approved
State plans for these other programs using either the Federal percentage or the Federal medical assistance percentage.
These States may claim at the Federal medical assistance percentage without regard to any maximum on the dollar amounts
per recipient which may be counted under paragraphs (1) and (2) of sections 3(a), 403(a), 1003(a), 1403(a), and 1603(a)
of the Act.

Citizens Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites.




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

HHS and the Department of Energy (DOE) have two Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) for public health activities and
research at DOE sites. One transferred the responsibility for the management and conduct of energy-related analytic
epidemiologic research to HHS. HHS has delegated program responsibility to CDC.



The Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management and the Office on Environment, Safety, and Health within
DOE have a separate MOU with ATSDR. This MOU addresses ATSDR public health responsibilities around DOE sites. In addition,
ATSDR is required by law (Sections 104, 105, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act) to conduct public health assessments and where appropriate other health activities (for example,
health studies, health surveillance, exposure registries), many of which are conducted at DOE sites.

Implementing these MOUs requires significant interaction with communities living in proximity to DOE sites. This
charter is in response to the requests by representatives of the communities surrounding DOE sites to provide consensus
advice and recommendations on community concerns related to CDC's and ATSDR's activities related to the sites.




PURPOSE:

 The Citizens Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites will provide advice
and recommendations to the Director of CDC and the Administrator of ATSDR regarding community, Native American Tribes,
and labor concerns pertaining to CDC's and ATSDR's public health activities and research at respective DOE sites.
Activities will focus on providing a forum for community, Native American Tribal, and labor interaction and serve
as a vehicle for community concern to be expressed as advice and recommendations to CDC and ATSDR.

<DOCTITLE>Social Security Acquiescence Rulings: Rescissions; Paxton v. HHS Secretary; Augmented Veterans Benefit Paid Directly
to Veteran, Treatment of Dependent's Portion</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 90-1(9)_

Paxton 

v. 

Secretary of Health and Human Services, 

856 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1988).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with 20 CFR 416.1485(e) and 422.406(b)(2), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of the
rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 90-1(9).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of
Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations
when the Government has decided not to seek further review of the case or is unsuccessful on further review.








As provided by 20 CFR 416.1485(e)(4), a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling may be rescinded as obsolete if we subsequently
clarify, modify or revoke the regulation or ruling that was the subject of the circuit court holding for which the Acquiescence
Ruling was issued.




On July 16, 1990, we issued Acquiescence Ruling (AR) 90-1(9) (55 FR 28946) to reflect the Ninth Circuit's holding
in 

Paxton 

v. 

Secretary of Health and Human Services, 

856 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1988), that, as written, the current regulations did not support counting the dependent's
portion of an augmented Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefit as unearned income to the dependent in determining
supplemental security income (SSI) eligibility and calculating benefits. Acquiescence Ruling 90-1(9) applied
to SSI applicant and recipient cases arising in the Ninth Circuit in which an individual received an augmented VA benefit.

On November 17, 1994, we are publishing final regulations which set out our policy, under the SSI program, regarding
the treatment of veterans benefits that are augmented to provide for dependents. The effect of these regulations
is to clarify and make more equitable our treatment of the ``dependent's portion'' of augmented veterans benefits.
The regulations state that, if an individual receives a veteran's benefit that includes an amount paid to him or her
because of a dependent, we will not count as unearned income the amount paid to him or her because of the dependent. The
regulations additionally provide that the dependent's portion will be counted as the dependent's unearned income
if the dependent resides with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse, or if the dependent receives his or her
own portion in a separate payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs.



Because these regulations address the issued decided by the 

Paxton 

court, we hereby rescind AR 90-1(9) as obsolete. The regulations make specific provisions for those individuals
in the Ninth Circuit who might lose SSI benefits as a result of this rescission.




Adjudicators of claims arising in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon and Washington) will no longer follow AR 90-1(9), but will decide cases based
on the amended regulations.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement; Oregon</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, section 202(f) of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and 43 CFR part 1610, a Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental
Impact Statement has been prepared for the Roseburg District, Oregon. The Proposed Final RMP/EIS describes and analyzes
future options for managing approximately 423,900 acres of mostly forested public land and 1,717 acres of non-federal
surface ownership with federal mineral estate administered by the Bureau of Land Management in Douglas county in
southwestern Oregon. 



PUBLIC PARTICIPATION: 

The Draft RMP/EIS was available for public review and comment from August 21, 1992 to December 21, 1992. Written comments
were received from agencies, organizations, and individuals. All comments provided were considered during the
preparation of the Proposed Final RMP/EIS. 


Copies of the Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement and its summary may be obtained
from the Roseburg District Office. Copies will be available for review at public libraries throughout Douglas County,
all government document depository libraries, and at the following BLM locations:

 

Office of External Affairs, Main Interior Building Room 5600, 18th and C Streets, N.W. Washington, D.C. 
Public Room, Oregon State Office 1515 S.W. 5th Portland, Oregon 97201 
Roseburg District Office 777 NW Garden Valley Blvd. Roseburg, Oregon 97470

 

All other BLM offices in western Oregon.
Background information and maps used in developing the Proposed Final RMP/EIS are available at the Roseburg District
Office. 
Open houses with opportunity to discuss the Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement
will be held at the Roseburg District Office (at the above address). The dates, times, and locations of all open house
meetings will be announced in a separate mailer as well as in the local media. 
Protests should be sent to: Director (760), Bureau of Land Management, Chief, Planning and Environmental Coordination,
Bureau of Land Management, 1849 ``C'' Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20240.
The Roseburg District Proposed Resource Management Plan and Final Environmental Impact Statement is expected to
be published on or about November 10, 1994. Protests must be postmarked within the 30-day protest period which would
start November 18, 1994 and would close December 19. 1994. To be considered complete, your protest must contain, at
a minimum, the following information: 



_Name, mailing address, telephone number, and interest of the person filing the protest. 
_A statement of the issue or issues being protested.

_A statement of the part or parts of the specific (named) proposed RMP being protested. To the extent possible, this
should be done by reference to specific pages, paragraphs, sections, tables, maps, etc. included in the document.

_A copy of all documents addressing the issue or issues that you submitted during the planning process or a reference
to the date the issue or issues were discussed by you for the record. 
_A concise statement explaining why the BLM State Director's decision is believed to be incorrect. This is a critical
part of your protest. Document all relevant facts. As much as possible, reference or cite the planning documents,
environmental analysis documents, and available planning records (e.g., meeting minutes or summaries, or correspondence).
A protest that merely expresses disagreement with the Oregon/Washington State Director's proposed decision, without
any data, will not provide us with the benefit of your information and insight. In this case, the Director's review
will be based on the existing analysis and supporting data. 




At the end of the 30-day protest period, the BLM may issue a Record of Decision approving implementation of any portion
of the proposed plan not under protest. Approval will be withheld on any portion of the plan under protest until the
protest has been resolved. 




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement describes and analyzes seven alternatives
to resolve the following issues: (1) Timber production practices; (2) Old-growth forests and habitat diversity;
(3) Threatened and endangered and other special status species habitat, including habitat for the northern spotted
owl; (4) Special areas; (5) Visual resources; (6) Stream/riparian/water quality; (7) Recreation resources; (8)
Wild and scenic rivers; (9) Land tenure; and (10) Rural interface areas. The issues are analyzed in seven distinct
alternatives, with each alternative representing a complete management plan for the district. 


The Proposed Resource Management Plan responds to the need for a healthy forest ecosystem with habitat that will support
populations of native species (particularly those associated with late-successional and old-growth forests).
It also responds to the need for a sustainable supply of timber and other forest products that will help maintain the
stability of local and regional economies and will contribute valuable resources to the national economy, on a predictable
and long-term basis. BLM-administered lands are primarily allocated to Riparian Reserves, Late-Successional
Reserves, General Forest Management Areas, and Connectivity/Diversity Blocks. An Aquatic Conservation Strategy
would be applied to all lands and waters under BLM jurisdiction. 
Approximately 89,900 acres would be managed for timber production. The annual probable sale quantity would be 7.0
million cubic feet (45 million board feet). Standing trees; snags; and down, dead woody material would be retained
to contribute to biological diversity, 
Management would provide for a wide variety of recreation opportunities, with particular emphasis on enhancement
of opportunities for dispersed recreational use. 
Approximately 29 miles of river found eligible for designation and studied by BLM would be found not suitable for designation.

Most BLM-administered lands would remain available for mineral leasing and location of mining claims, but 28 acres
would be closed to leasing for oil and gas and geothermal resources, and 5,070 acres would be closed to location of claims.

The Proposed Resource Management Plan would designate or 
redesignate the following ACECs and RNAs: 





There were no potential ACEC areas identified that met the 
Bureau 
ACEC criteria of relevance and importance that are 
not included in whole or in part in the proposed alternative 
described above. 
This notice meets the requirements of 43 CFR 1610.7-2 for 
designation of 
ACECs and the requirements of the final 
revised Department of the Interior-Department of Agriculture 
Guidelines for Eligibility, Classification, and Management 
of Rivers (FR Vol. 47, No. 173, pg. 39454).

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement; United States v. Association of Retail Travel Agents</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, Stipulation, and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in 

United States 

v. 

Association of Retail Travel Agents

, Civil No. 94-2305 as to the association of Retail Travel Agents. 

The Complaint alleges that the defendant and its members agreed on commission levels and other terms of trade on which
to transact business with providers of travel services, and encouraged and participated in a group boycott with the
intent to induce certain providers of travel services to agree to certain commission levels and practices.

The proposed Final Judgment enjoins the defendant from inviting or encouraging travel agents to engage in concerted
refusals to deal with travel services providers, and also requires defendant to establish an antitrust compliance
program.

Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 

Federal Register 

and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Roger Fones, Chief, Transportation, Energy and Agriculture
Section, Room 9104, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001

In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia 


Case Number 1:94CV02305.
Judge: Paul L. Friedman.
Deck Type: Antitrust.
Date Stamp: 10/25/94.



The United States of America, plaintiff, by its attorneys, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the
United States, brings this civil action to obtain equitable relief against the above-named defendant, and complains
and alleges as follows: 



I



Jurisdiction and Venue




1. This complaint is filed under Section 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  4, in order to prevent and restrain violations
by defendant of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1, and this Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant
to 28 U.S.C.   1331 and 1337. 

2. Defendant transacts business and is found in the District of Columbia, within the meaning of 15 U.S.C.  22
and 28 U.S.C.  1391(c). 



II



Defendant



3. Association of Retail Travel Agents, Ltd. (``ARTA''), is a District of Columbia nonprofit corporation with its
principal place of business in Arlington, Virginia. ARTA is a trade association with over two thousand members who
act as retail travel agents selling transportation and accommodations (``travel services'') to the public as agents
for airlines, hotels, cruise lines, rental car companies and other providers of travel services (``travel providers'').
ARTA's members compete with one another both to sell travel services to the public and to act as selling agents for travel
providers.



III



Trade and Commerce



4. Airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise lines, and other travel providers sell a significant portion of
their travel services to the public through travel agents, including the members of defendant. Travel agents inform
consumers about the price, availability and other details of various travel options and make reservations and sell
tickets to the travellers for the travel services they choose. Roughly 80% of airline sales, 30% of hotel sales, 50%
of rental car sales and 95% of cruise line sales in the United States are made through travel agents. In 1993, the amount
of such sales by travel agents was in excess of $90 billion. 

5. Travel agents sells travel services to the public as agents of the travel providers. Travel agents normally do not
charge travellers directly for their services; instead, travel providers pay commissions to the travel agents for
the sales the agents make on behalf of the travel providers. These commissions vary and are established between individual
travel agents and travel providers. These commissions generally are included in the price the consumer pays for airline
tickets, hotel accommodations, rental cars, cruises and other travel services. The lower the sales commissions
established between individual travel agents and travel providers, the lower the total cost of travel services to
the consumer. 

6. A substantial proportion of the commissions earned by travel agents, including members of defendant, are derived
from the sale of travel services that are within the flow of and substantially affect interstate and foreign trade
and commerce. 

7. The sale of travel services by travel agents constitutes a line of commerce and a relevant product market within
the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 

8. The United States constitutes a relevant geographic market within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 



IV



Alleged Violation 



9. On or about October 16, 1993, the members of defendant, through its Board of Directors, adopted a statement of objectives
for defendant and its members. That statement, entitled ``ARTA Objectives for the Travel Agency Community,'' constitutes
an agreement among the members of defendant's Board of Directors and among defendant's members as to the matters contained
therein. 

10. Included among the ARTA Objectives described in Paragraph 9 are agreements concerning the amount of commissions
that certain travel providers should pay to travel agents, including members of defendant, and agreements as to the
terms under which travel providers should transact business with travel agents, including members of defendant.


11. On or about October 19, 1993, defendant held a press conference, attended by defendant's president and two members
of its Board of Directors, where it announced and disseminated the contents of the ARTA Objectives. The contents of
the ARTA Objectives were subsequently disseminated to travel providers, its own members and other travel agents
through publications that are widely circulated among travel agents and travel providers. 

12. Shortly after defendant's public announcement of the ARTA Objectives, a member of defendant's Board of Directors
made a public statement, through a press release, that he and his travel agency would refuse to deal with certain travel
providers who did not comply with the ARTA Objectives. In making that announcement, the defendant's director stated
that he ``encourage[d] owners and managers [of travel agencies] nationwide to join this effort.'' 

13. Thereafter, at least one other member of defendant's Board of Directors made a public announcement that she and
her travel agency would also refuse to deal with the travel providers who did not comply with the ARTA Objectives. 

14. As a result of the actions of its president and directors described above, defendant and its members agreed on commission
levels and other terms of trade on which ARTA members and other travel agents should transact business with travel
providers, and invited, encouraged and participated in a group boycott of certain travel providers to induce them
to agree to those commission levels and other terms of trade. 

15. The group boycott and agreement on commissions and other terms of trade described above had the effect of unreasonably
restraining trade in the sale of travel services by travel agents. 

16. The group boycott and agreement on commissions and other terms of trade described above constitutes a contract,
combination or conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman
Act, 15 U.S.C.  1. There is a significant likelihood that the offense will recur unless the relief hereinafter
prayed for is granted. 



Prayer



Wherefore, plaintiff prays: 

1. That defendant be enjoined from inviting or encouraging concerted action by travel agents that has the purpose
or effect of specifying the commission levels paid by travel providers to travel agents, or of specifying the terms
of trade between travel agents and travel providers; 

2. That plaintiff have such other or further relief as the Court may deem just and proper; and 

3. That plaintiff recover the costs of this action.

Competitive Impact Statement


Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA''), 15 U.S.C.  16(b)-(h),
the United States files this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for
entry with the consent of the Association of Retail Travel Agents in this antitrust proceeding.


I


Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding


On October 25, 1994, the United States filed a Complaint alleging that the Association of Retail Travel Agents (hereinafter
``ARTA'') had entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of
the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.  1). The Complaint alleges that ARTA, a trade association all of whose members are
travel agents, and its members agreed on commission levels and other terms of trade on which to transact business with
providers of travel services, and encouraged and participated in a group boycott with the intent to induce certain
providers of travel services to agree to certain commission levels and practices.
On October 25, 1994, the United States and ARTA filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed
Final Judgment designed to prevent any recurrence of such activity in the future. Under the proposed Final Judgment,
ARTA will be enjoined from inviting or encouraging travel agents to deal with travel providers only on agreed terms.
This prohibition includes any agreements on specified commission levels. The proposed Final Judgment also prohibits
ARTA from adopting or disseminating any rules, policies, or statements that have the purpose or effect of advocating
or encouraging such a concerted refusal to deal.
The United States and ARTA have agreed that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA.
Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction to
construe, modify, and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment.


II


Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation


Airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise lines and other providers of transportation and accommodations
(hereinafter ``travel providers'') sell a significant proportion of their services to the public through travel
agents. Travel agents inform travellers about the price, availability and other details of various travel options
and make reservations and sell tickets to the travellers for the travel services they choose. Travel agents are agents
of the travel providers, receiving commissions from the travel providers for sales they make. These commissions
vary and are established between individual travel agents and travel providers. These commissions generally are
included in the price the consumer pays for airline tickets, hotel accommodations, rental cars, cruises and other
travel services. The lower the sales commissions established between individual travel agents and travel providers,
the lower the total cost of travel services to the consumer.
ARTA is an association of travel agents. Among its goals are achieving improved commission levels for travel agents
and persuading travel services providers to adopt commission policies and practices that are beneficial to travel
agents. ARTA members compete with each other and with other travel agents both to sell travel services to the public
and to act as selling agents for travel services providers.
On October 16, 1993, ARTA's Board of Directors adopted a document entitled ``ARTA Objectives for the Travel Agency
Community.'' Among its Objectives, ARTA stated that it sought a ``minimum'' ten percent commission on all hotel and
car rental sales by travel agents, the elimination of all distribution outlets for airline tickets other than travel
agents, and the payment of commissions based on full fares rather than the discounted prices actually paid by travellers.
A few days after adopting the ARTA Objectives, ARTA hosted a press conference attended by its president and two members
of its Board of Directors, in addition to members of the press. Several days after the press conference, one of ARTA's
board members announced that his travel agency would cease doing business with certain travel providers whose commission
and sales practices did not comport with the ARTA Objectives, and invited other travel agents to join his boycott in
support of the ARTA Objectives. Shortly thereafter, at least one other ARTA board member made a similar public announcement.
The Complaint alleges that through those activities, defendant and its members agreed on commission levels and other
terms of trade on which ARTA members and other travel agents should transact business with travel providers, and invited,
encouraged and participated in a group boycott designed to induce travel providers to agree to those commission levels
and terms of trade. The Complaint further alleges that those activities constitute a contract, combination or conspiracy
in unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.  1).


III


Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment


The proposed Final Judgment is designed to prevent defendant and its officers, directors and agents from inviting,
encouraging or advocating concerted refusals to deal. In addition to enjoining defendant and its officers, directors
and agents from engaging in such activities (Section III), it requires defendant to provide an annual summary of the
Final Judgment to its members (Section IV), and requires that its officials provide an annual certification that
they have read and understand the Final Judgment (Section IV). The proposed Final Judgment also requires that defendant
provide an annual briefing on the requirements of the Final Judgment and on the antitrust laws to its officials (Section
V).
The United States is satisfied that the proposed Final Judgment sufficiently resolves the antitrust violations
alleged in the Complaint. Compliance with the proposed Final Judgment would prevent any recurrence of the violations
alleged in the Complaint, and thus provides complete relief.

IV


Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigations


Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.  15) provides that any person who has been injured in his business or property
as a result of conduct forbidden by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages
suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorneys fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair
nor assist the bringing of any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton
Act (15 U.S.C.  16(a)), the proposed Final Judgment has no 

prima facie 

effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that may be brought.


V


Procedure Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment


The United States and defendant have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after
compliance with the provisions of the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent. The APPA
conditions entry upon the Court's determination that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.

The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgment within which
any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who
wishes to comment should do so within 60 days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the


Federal Register. 

The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to comments.
The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the 

Federal Register.

Written comments should be submitted to: Roger W. Fones, Chief, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture Section,
Antitrust Division, Judiciary Center Building, 555 4th Street, N.W., Rm 9104, Washington, D.C. 20001.



VI


Alternative to the Proposed Final Judgment



The alternative to the proposed Final Judgment would be a full trial of the case against ARTA. In the view of the Department
of Justice, such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted because the Proposed
Final Judgment provides relief that will remedy the violations of the Sherman Act alleged in the United States' Complaint.


VII


Determination Materials and Documents


There are no materials or documents that the United States considered to be determinative in formulating this proposed
Final Judgment. Accordingly, none are being filed with this Competitive Impact Statement.



Dated: October 25, 1994.

United States Response to Public Comments 



Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, (``APPA'' or ``Tunney Act'') 15 U.S.C.
 16(b)-(h), the United States hereby responds to public comments it has received relating to the proposed
Final Judgment in this civil antitrust proceeding. After careful consideration of these comments, the United States
continues to believe that the proposed Final Judgment will provide an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust
violations alleged in the Complaint. After the public comments and this response have been published in the 

Federal Register

, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  16(d), the United States will move the Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment.


This action began on July 15, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that Microsoft Corporation had
unlawfully maintained its monopoly of personal computer operating systems and had unreasonably restrained trade,
in violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.   1, 2. Simultaneously, with the filing of
the Complaint, the United States filed a proposed Final Judgment and a Stipulation signed by the defendant consenting
to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment after compliance with the requirements of the APPA. 

Pursuant to the APPA requirements, the United States filed a Competitive Impact Statement (``CIS'') on July 27, 1994.
The defendant filed a description of certain written and oral communications on its behalf, as required by section
15(g) of the APPA, on August 8, 1994. A summary of the terms of the proposed Final Judgment and CIS, and directions for
the submission of written comments relating to the proposal were published in the Washington Post for seven days in
the period from August 7, 1994 through August 13, 1994. The proposed Final Judgment and the Competitive Impact Statement
were published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 19, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 42845-42857 (1994). 

The 60-day period for public comments began on August 20, 1994 and expired on October 18, 1994.
 The United States received five comments, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1-5. Three of these comments
relate to alleged Microsoft practices that the government did not challenge as violations of the antitrust laws,
and which are not addressed in the proposed Consent Decree. Only one comment relates directly to the proposed relief,
and that comment suggests that an additional remedy should have been included. Finally, one brief comment argues
that the government should not have taken any action against Microsoft.

I. Background



The proposed Final Judgment is the culmination of an investigation of Microsoft begun by the Federal Trade Commission
(``FTC'') in June 1990 and continued by the Department of Justice beginning in August 1993. From April 1991 onward,
the FTC's investigation had as its central focus the licensing practices by which Microsoft distributes its operating
system software products, MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, to manufacturers of personal computers, a group referred
to in the computer industry as original equipment manufacturers or OEMs. In the course of its investigation, the FTC
subpoenaed documents from Microsoft, deposed over a dozen Microsoft officers and employees, and interviewed numerous
OEMs, firms that compete against Microsoft in the development and sale of operating system software, and other software
industry participants.

While focussing on Microsoft's licensing practices, the FTC staff also considered whether Microsoft attempted
to stifle competition in various computer software markets through other practices. Among other things, they considered
whether Microsoft had deliberately created incompatibilities between its Windows operating system software product
and its competitors' disk operating system products in order to disadvantage those competing products; whether
Microsoft used false preannouncements of new products; and whether Microsoft's developers of applications software
products obtained an anticompetitive advantage over their competitors because they received preferential access
to information about Microsoft's operating system products.

In August of 1993, following reports that the FTC's deliberations had ended with a 2-2 vote that would result
in no enforcement action against Microsoft, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice began
its investigation of Microsoft. The Justice Department was provided with complete access to all evidence collected
by the FTC in the course of its investigation. After reviewing this evidence, the Department sought additional evidence
from Microsoft and other industry participants. The Department carefully examined the use by Microsoft of per-processor
and per-system licenses to distribute MS-DOS and Windows to OEMs. The Department also looked extensively at
all other issues that had been considered by the FTC, including alleged false product preannouncements and the relationship
between Microsoft's operating system and applications divisions. In addition, the Department's investigation
explored new issues which first emerged during the course of its investigation, including Microsoft's use of restrictive
non-disclosure agreements.

The Department contacted dozens of OEMs, and Division staff lawyers visited at least fifteen OEMs in person. In addition,
the Division contacted numerous other industry participants, former Microsoft employees, and other companies
and individuals knowledgeable about the computer software and hardware industries. In total, the Department conducted
over one hundred interviews of individuals involved in the software industry. Twenty-two depositions were conducted
pursuant to Civil Investigative Demands (``CIDs'') issued by the Department; six of these oral examinations were
of top-ranking officers of Microsoft. In addition to reviewing the material produced to the FTC, the Department reviewed
material produced in response to twenty-one additional CIDs that it sent to a number of software companies, including
Microsoft. In total, the Department reviewed over one million pages of documents in connection with this investigation.

At the conclusion of this effort, the Department determined that certain of Microsoft's licensing practices and
its use of unreasonably restrictive non-disclosure agreements violated the Sherman Act. The Department challenged
these practices, and obtain a proposed Consent Decree which adequately addressed the competitive concerns. As to
all other areas that were investigated, the Department carefully considered the evidence before it under the prevailing
legal standard, and determined that no further action was warranted on the evidence before it.

II. Response to Public Comments


A. Comments That Do Not Relate to Violations Charged in the Complaint


Three of the five comments received related to conduct not charged in the Complaint. As discussed in more detail 

infra, 

review under the Tunney Act is confined to the terms of the proposed decree and their adequacy as remedies for the violations
alleged in the Complaint. Public comments and the Court's review are designed to ensure that the Department has fashioned
relief to the violations alleged in the Complaint that it reasonably believes will further the public interest. Public
comments that relate to conduct that the Department has determined not to prosecute are beyond the scope of the Tunney
Act review procedure, for the reasons and under the law set forth fully at section III, below.
The issues raised by the following three comments therefore are not relevant to the Tunney Act determination of whether
the proposed decree is in the ``public interest.'' Nevertheless, the Department herewith provides an explanation
to interested members of the public on the issues raised.


1. Comment of Anne E. Bogoch, Chan & Jodziewicz


Anne E. Bogoch, an attorney in the firm Chan & Jodziewicz, submitted a comment on behalf of small computer companies
who claim to have been unlawfully excluded from both the hardware and software computer market by Microsoft's monopolization
of the personal operating system software market. The comment objects to two related Microsoft practices: (1) ``Microsoft's
tying or bundling of the sale of MS-DOS to the purchase of hardware systems'' and (2) Microsoft's ``purported
licensure to restrict the resale of copies of MS-DOS.'' The comment attacks these practices as illegal under
two theories. The first relies on copyright law, arguing that under the First Sale Doctrine, Microsoft cannot restrict
the ability of purchases of MS-DOS to resell that MS-DOS in any manner they see fit. The fact that Microsoft
is writing license agreements that purport to restrict resale is alleged to be an abuse of the copyright and therefore
an antitrust violation. Second, the comment argues that Microsoft has engaged in illegal tying, by conditioning
the purchase of the typing product, MS-DOS, on the purchase of personal computers: customers are prevented
from buying MS-DOS without a personal computer.
This comment apparently refers to Microsoft's practice of licensing the use of its copyrighted software (Microsoft)
to OEMs only for distribution with the personal computers sold by those OEMs, and subject to license restrictions
that prohibit the OEMs from reselling the software as a stand-alone product. Microsoft has used this licensing policy
for many years, and has initiated legal action against a number of its licensees alleging that by distributing copies
of MS-DOS that were not sold in conjunction with a computer, the licensee had violated the terms of its license
and infringed Microsoft's copyrights. In a number of these cases, Microsoft has apparently received favorable results.
In general, a firm does not violate the antitrust laws merely by enforcing its legitimate intellectual property rights.
Thus, to the extent that Microsoft's conduct is an instance of legitimately exploiting its copyright, there is little
reason to challenge that conduct as violative of the Sherman Act. Based on the facts that were uncovered through its
inquiry, the Department did not find a basis for challenging under the Sherman Act this aspect of Microsoft's conduct.
The Department also has not sought to challenge this alleged conduct as an illegal tying arrangement under the antitrust
laws. Microsoft does not sell the allegedly tied product (personal computers). This situation does not, therefore,
come with the framework for illegal tying arrangements.


2. Comment of Micro System Options


A comment from Micro System Options complaints that the developers toolkit for Microsoft's Windows NT 3.5 contains
a new, attractive feature to create three dimensional images within software applications. It expresses concern
that Microsoft's next release of Windows will include the same feature. Micro System Options apparently makes a software
product called 3d Graphic Tools which performs functions similar to those of the new feature in Microsoft's software
product(s), and Micro System Options is concerned that the inclusion of this new feature in Microsoft software products
will reduce demand for its own software product.
The Department's Complaint does not challenge as violations of the antitrust laws Microsoft's inclusion of new software
features in its operating system products. Over the past fourteen years, Microsoft has developed and soft numerous
successive versions of its operating system products, each more advanced and containing more software features
than the previous one. Whenever Microsoft adds an attractive software feature to its operating system products,
it reduces the demand for software products sold by third parties as a complement to the Microsoft product that performed
similar functions.

The proposed Final Judgment, in IV (E), forbids Microsoft from licensing covered products
 through agreements conditioned on ``(1) the licensing of any * * * other product.'' However, this
provision explicitly states that ``this provision in and of itself shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from
developing integrated products.'' The evidence developed by the government during this investigation would not,
in its view, support a broader injunction. Activity of this sort requires case by case analysis, and a broad injunction
against such behavior generally would not be consistent with the public interest. 




3. Comment of Anthony R. Martin 



A comment from Anthony R. Martin states that since the settlement of this case, Microsoft has begun to engage in new
and different forms of monopolistic conduct. As an example of this, Mr. Martin complains that Microsoft is pressuring
software suppliers into switching from the current version of Windows to the next version of Windows which will be
released shortly. Mr. Martin suggests that the government may have ``settled too soon, for too little,'' and that
it should reopen its investigation. 

The United States does not believe that the possibility that Microsoft might in the future engage in new forms of anticompetitive
behavior is a sufficient reason to reject the proposed Final Judgment before the Court now. Obviously, the Department
cannot, in a Consent Decree, proscribe every conceivable kind of anticompetitive conduct in which a firm might engage
in the future. It certainly cannot allege in a complaint anticompetitive conduct that has not yet occurred. In addition,
the government cannot be expected to continue its investigations and litigation indefinitely, without resolution,
on the theory that the defendant might, at some point, begin to engage in additional anticompetitive practices. The
Department considered every allegation of anticompetitive behavior that came to its attention during the period
of its investigation, and brought an action challenging the practices that it thought should be challenged on the
facts then before it. The proposed Decree meets the Department's competitive concerns as of the date of filing of the
proposed Decree. Should Microsoft at some future date begin to engage in new forms of anticompetitive conduct, the
government can and will initiate a new investigation. 




B. Comment of IDEA 



One comment does relate directly to the terms of the proposed decree. That comment, submitted by IDEA, an OEM which
has licensed software from Microsoft, contends that its license agreements from January 1, 1989 to the present have
resulted in more than $2,000,000 in prepaid royalties. IDEA suggests that the decree should contain provisions ordering
Microsoft to refund such prepaid royalties to IDEA and similarly situated companies. 

This comment apparently concerns the ``minimum commitment'' feature found in the many operating system software
licenses Microsoft has entered into with OEMs. The minimum commitments create ``take or pay'' contracts in which
OEM's commit themselves to pay Microsoft not less than a particular amount of money in a particular time period.
 





The proposed Final Judgment prohibits Microsoft from entering into license agreements that contain minimum commitments
(section IV (F)) and from enforcing any minimum commitment in existing license agreements (section IV (J) (2)). These
prohibitions were included because of concerns that minimum commitments could be structured in ways that create
anticompetitive disincentives for OEMs to make incremental purchases of non-Microsoft operating systems. 

See 

Competitive Impact Statement, pp. 10, 14. In addition, Section IV (I) of the proposed Final Judgment provides all
OEMs the right to terminate existing license agreements for MS-DOS and Windows immediately, without penalty. However,
the government did not believe that it was necessary, in order to create the conditions for competition in the operating
system software market on an ongoing basis, to require Microsoft to refund ``unused'' royalty payments that were
paid under minimum commitment provisions applicable to contract periods prior to the filing of the government's
case. The principal goal of the government's action was to ensure that OEMs' purchasing decisions in the future would
not be distorted by the existence of anticompetitive license terms. Refunds of royalties paid by OEMs in prior periods
would not have affected prospective decisions about which operating system products they should buy now and in the
future. Further, such refunds arguably could produce a windfall for some OEMs without producing corrective or remedial
procompetitive impact.

 





C. Comment of J. Adam Burden 



A comment by J. Adam Burden complains about the ``ridiculous action brought forth towards Microsoft.'' Mr. Burden
contends that Microsoft's large market share can be attributed to the fact that software developers like to have an
operating system standard, and that the government has penalized Microsoft for its success.

As evidenced by the Complaint, proposed Consent Decree, and Competitive Impact Statement filed with the Court, the
Department concluded after an extensive and thorough investigation that specific Microsoft practices were unlawfully
restraining competition in the PC operating system market, and sought to enjoin such practices in the proposed Final
Judgment. The government's Complaint and the proposed Decree do not suggest that Microsoft should be penalized for
success or merely for obtaining a larget market share. 


III. The Legal Standard Governing the Court's Public Interest Determination 


When the United States proposes an antitrust consent decree, the Tunney Act requires the court to determine whether
``the entry of such judgment is in the public interest.'' 15 U.S.C.  16(e) (1988). In making that determination,
``the court's function is not to determine whether the resulting array of rights and liabilities `is one that will


best 

serve society,' but only to confirm that the resulting `settlement is ``within the 

reaches 

of the public interest. 

United States 

v. 

Western Elec. Co., 

993 F.2d 1572, 1576 (D.C. Cir.), 

cert. denied, 

114 S. Ct. 487 (1993) (quoting, in turn, 

United States 

v. 

Western Elect. Co., 

900 F.2d 283, 309 (D.C. Cir.), 

cert. denied, 

498 U.S. 911 (1990); 

United States 

v. 

Bechtel, 

648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), 

cert. denied, 

454 U.S. 1083 (1981); 

United States 

v. 

Gillette Co., 

406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975) emphasis in 993 F. 2d)).





Thus, under the Tunney Act, the district court plays an important but limited role. It properly reviews the government's
reasons for proposing the decree, as explained in the competitive impact statement and the response to comments,
to ensure that the government is not acting irrationally. But the court may not reject the proposed decree ``simply
because the proposal diverge[s] from its view of the public interest.'' 

Western Elec. Co., 

993 F.2d at 1577. Rather, the public interest standard requires the court to enter a proposed decree ``that the Department
* * * reasonably regard[s] as advancing the public interest.'' 

Id. 

at 1576; 

see also United States 

v. 

Gillette Co., 

406 F. Supp. 713, 716 (D. Mass. 1975). The court may reject the decree ``only if it has exceptional confidence that adverse
antitrust consequences will result_perhaps akin to the confidence that would justify a court in overturning the
predictive judgments of an administrative agency.'' 

Western Elect. Co. 

993 F.2d at 1577. 
Moreover, review under the Tunney Act is confined to the terms of the proposed decree and their adequacy as remedies
for the violations alleged in the complaint. To the extent that comments raise issues not addressed in the complaint,
those comments are irrelevant to the court's Tunney Act review. The Tunney Act does not contemplate that the court
will evaluate the wisdom or adequacy of the government's complaint or consider what relief might be appropriate for
violations that the Department has not alleged. In describing the factors that may be considered by the court in its
public interest determination, the Act refers to ``the competitive impact 

of such judgment'', 

the ``termination of 

alleged violations

'' and the impact of the judgment upon ``individuals alleging specific injury 

from the violations set forth in the complaint

.'' 15 U.S.C. 16(e) (1988) (emphasis added). There is no suggestion in the Act that the court should consider whether
the government should have challenged other practices beyond those detailed in its complaint. 
The limitations on the scope of a court's Tunney Act review have been explained by two Courts of Appeals. In 

United States 

v. 

Western Elec. Co., 

900 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir.), 

cert denied

, 498 U.S. 911 (1990), the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit considered whether the public interest required the
continuation of a consent decree provision designed to protect competition in information services markets, notwithstanding
the agreement of the parties in the case that the decree provision should be rescinded.
 The court noted that the government's case ``centered exclusively on AT&T's activities in the interexchange-service
and equipment manufacturing markets,'' and did not involve the information services market. 

Id 

at 307. Because of that, the Court of Appeals concluded that if the parties had proposed a decree that did not include
provisions to protect information services markets, that decree nonetheless would have been in the public interest.


Id. 

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized the same principle: the Tunney Act ``does not authorize a district
court to base its public interest determination on antitrust concerns in markets other than those alleged in the government's
complaint.''

had filed does not require court approval under the Tunney Act);

There are many reasons that might cause the Department not to initiate a lawsuit, or to challenge some practices and
not others, including reasons related to the factual support available for potential claims and the enforcement
resources that would be required to establish them. These decisions are ``peculiarly within [the] expertise'' of
the Department of Justice, which is ``far better equipped then the courts to deal with the many variables involved
in the proper ordering of its priorities.'' 

Heckler 

v.

 Chaney,

 470 U.S. 821, 831-32 (1985); 

see also Maryland 

v.

 United States,

 460 U.S. 1001, 1006 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from summary affirmance) (``How is a court to decide whether
a better settlement in a case involving one industry is more important to the public than the benefits that might be
gained by immediately working on an antitrust problem in another industry?'').



Finally, Congress did not intend the Tunney Act to lead to protracted hearings on the merits, and thereby undermine
the incentives for defendants and the government to enter into consent judgments. S. Rep. No. 298, 93d Cong. 1st Sess.
3 (1973); 

see United States 

v.

 American Tel. & Tel. Co.,

aff'd, Maryland 

v.

 United States,

 460 U.S. 1001 (1983). Because it is not the function of the court ``to make de novo determination of facts and issues''
but rather to determine whether explanations of the Department of Justice were ``reasonable under the circumstances,''


United States 

v.

 Mid-America Dairymen,

 1977-1 Trade Cas. (CCH)  61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977), courts have consistently refused to consider
``contentions going to the merits of the underlying claims and defenses.'' 

Bechtel Corp.

 648 F.2d at 666.




IV. Conclusion





The Tunney Act requires that public comments and the government's response to those comments be published in the 

Federal Register

. When that publication has been accomplished, the government will notify the Court that all of the procedures required
by the Tunney Act have been completed, and will ask the Court to enter the proposed Final Judgment based on its determination
that the Final Judgment is in the public interest.



The United States is firmly convinced that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest, and we urge the Court
to act promptly to ratify that judgment. If the proposed Final Judgment is to fulfill its promise of opening the personal
computer operating system software market, it must be approved without delay. Microsoft has agreed to abide by the
requirements of the proposed Final Judgment pending the Court's Tunney Act review. However, the effectiveness of
the proposed remedy depends not only on Microsoft's conduct, but on the perception of industry participants that
the remedy will be approved and enforced. OEMs considering alternatives to Microsoft's forthcoming Windows '95
product need to know that they may shop the competition without paying a royalty to Microsoft for each computer they
sell. Other operating system suppliers also need to make development and marketing decisions with the assurance
that Microsoft's per-processor and per-system licenses will no longer artificially limit the market for their wares.
Accordingly, we urge the Court to act promptly to approve the proposed Final Judgment following the completion of
the remaining Tunney Act requirements.

``Society * * * has found it necessary over the centuries to restrain those engaged in competition
from undue destruction of competitors and oppression of consumers. * * * for competition, unless
supervised, like Cronus, will devour its contending young. Cise & Lifland, 

Understanding Antitrust Laws,

 PLI, N.Y. 1991 at 4. This comment is being filed on behalf of the small computer companies who have been unlawfully excluded
from both the hardware and software computer market by Microsoft's monopolization of the personal operating system
software market. In this instance of voracious market manipulation the small vendors in the computer industry are
Cronus' children.

It is the opinion of this author, that although the consent decree in 

United States 

v. 

Microsoft

 was long needed, it has not gone far enough, for additional pernicious anticompetitive conduct survives, namely
Microsoft's tying or bundling of the sale of MS-DOS to the purchase of hardware systems and attempting, through contract
sale and purported licensure to restrict the resale of copies of MS-DOS.

Microsoft's bundling restrictions have impacted four different segments of the economy; consumers of hardware,
consumers of software, sellers of hardware and sellers of software. In addition because Microsoft's has attempted
to impose restrictions upon downstream purchasers it has also and most severely affected resellers of computer software
and hardware, already in a submissive market position. Microsoft's monopoly in operating systems has effectively
precluded the market for other operating systems and accompanying applications programs. Consumers who wish to
buy from small companies which sell hardware and or equip their customers with systems to operate their businesses
must sell the tied accompanying hardware system to which the MS-DOS was originally bundled, effectively precluding
the consumer from choosing the hardware systems.

In addition, small computer companies are faced with insurmountable barriers to access to the market for the sale
of hardware if they do not have licenses to sell DOS, the operating system product used by over 70% of the market and for
which most application software on the market is written. The only thing a small computer seller or reseller can do
in the current Microsoft regime is resell the goods tied or bundled as per Microsoft's purported licensure agreements.
This form of restriction on alienation is an unlawful extension of federal copyright law's monopoly grant and constitutes
an antitrust violation.

The Copyright Act of 1976 grants copyright holders ``the exclusive right to distribute copies * * *
of [a] copyrighted work to the public by `sale' or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease or lending.'' 17
U.S.C. 106(3). It expressly limits, however, this monopoly grant by prohibiting copyright holders from imposing
any restraints on alienation subsequent to the first sale of a copy of a copyrighted work.

The First Sale Doctrine, a codified exception to the Copyright Act's monopoly grant is based on the common law's aversion
to the restraint of alienation, 

Sabastian International Inc. 

v. 

Consumer Contacts (PTY) Ltd.,

 847 F.2d 1093 (3rd Cir. 1988) and the principle that ownership of a material object or copy is distinct from ownership
of a copyright or intangible, c.f. 

Mirage Editions, Inc. 

v. 

Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.,

 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1988). The First Sale provision provides that where a copyright owner sells or parts with title
to a particular copy of a copyrightable work, he divests himself of his exclusive right to vend that particular copy,
17 U.S.C. Section 109(a). Under the First Sale Doctrine, a first sale extinguishes the copyright holder's ability
to control the course of copies placed into the stream of commerce.

Microsoft seeks to avoid the operation of the First Sale Doctrine and unlawfully extend its copyright monopoly beyond
what is permitted by law by characterizing the sale of copies of MS-DOS as licenses. Blanket misuse of the term ``license''
cannot veil the fact the distribution of the hard copies of MS-DOS at issue are sales.
 Microsoft, illegally attempting to control the ultimate disposition of the over 70 Million copies of MS-DOS it has
placed into the marketplace is succeeding in market place power semantics at the expense of Constitutional and Congressional
copyright policy and law.

What Microsoft is doing is not new. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in 

Step-Saver Data System, 

in finding a similar purported license to in fact be a contract for the sale of computer software stated:




When form licenses were first developed for software, it was, in large part, to avoid the federal copyright law first
sale doctrine. * * * By characterizing the original transaction between the software producer and
the software rental company as a license, rather than a sale, and by making the license personal and non-transferable,
software producers hoped to avoid the reach of the first sale doctrine and to establish a basis in state contract law
for suing the software rental companies directly. * * * Under the amended (copyright) statute, a purchaser
of a copy of a copyrighted computer program may still sell his copy to another without the consent of the copyright holder.
This amendment renders the need to characterize the original transaction as a license largely anachronistic.




The purchaser of a copy of a computer program enjoys the same freedom to transfer a copy as the owner of copies of any other
form of copyrighted work. Goldstein, 

Copyright, 

Vol.1 Section 5.6.1 at p. 607. A copy of a computer program is a fungible good like any other copy of a copyrighted work.




Computer programs are copyrightable intellectual property, but like a phono record of a composition, once implanted
into a medium and widely distributed to computer owners, are merely copies. When transferred to a readable, it becomes
a readily merchantable commodity.




``That a computer program may be copyrightable as intellectual property does not alter the fact that once in the form
of a floppy disc or other medium, the program is tangible, moveable and available in the marketplace.'' Like a phono
record of a musical composition, once implanted into a medium and widely distributed to computer owners, computer
programs become fungible goods.

The copyright owner who does not wish to encumber subsequent distribution of copies, embodying his work can do so by
initially leasing rather than selling, C.F. Goldstein, 

Copyright, supra, 

Section 5.6.1, Vol, 1 at 595. However, once there has been a valid first sale of a copy of computer program, the 

First Sale Doctrine Act 

as a defense to any claim of copyright infringement as to subsequent purchases.

While perhaps Microsoft desires to control the ultimate disposition of every one of the seventy million odd copies
of its software in existence, it may not use the copyright laws to do so. Congress has decided wisely that when an item
is sold, purchaser is to take certain minimum rights, among which is the right to resell.

Patent decisions and copyright costs by analogy have uniformly recognized that the purpose of patent law is fulfilled
with respect to any particular article when the patentee has received his reward for the use of his work by the sale of
an article or copy, and that once that purpose is realized, the patent law affords no basis for retaining the use and
enjoyment of the thing sold. [Citations omitted]. Construing and applying the patent law so as to give affect to the
public policy which limits the granted monopoly strictly to the terms of the statutory grant, the particular form
or method by which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. The first vending of any article manufactured
under a patent or a copy of a copyright work puts the article beyond the reach of the monopoly which the patent confers.


United States 

v. 

Univis Leno Co., et al., 

316 U.S. 241, 251-252 (1942).

A copyright, like a patent is a statutory grant of monopoly privileges. 

Broadcast Music, Inc. 

v. 

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 

441 U.S. 1, 29, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 1567 (1979). Being a statutory grant, the rights are only such as the statute confers,
and may be enjoined only on the terms and conditions which is specifies. See 

Loew's Inc. 

v. 

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. 

A copyright owner, like a patentee, may not increase the scope of the monopoly afforded by the copyright through a license
agreement with a licensee. 

F.E.L. Publications 

v. 

Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 

506 F. Supp. 1127, 1134 (N.D. Ill. 1981) (Plaintiff's attempt to extend his copyright monopoly to the licensing of
not-for-profit performances of copyright religious music for worship constituted an antitrust violation.) Microsoft's
attempt to extend his monopoly beyond that conferred by statutory grant constitutes misuse and an antitrust violation.

In addition its attempt to do so in concert with and by licensure agreement with hardware manufacturer constitutes
a conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws.

Microsoft's bundling is an illegal tying arrangement, either cast as a per se tying or a conspiracy under Section 1
of the Sherman Act. Microsoft's ``licenses'' are ``contracts'' within the scope of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as
well as its licensing practices constituting monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.

The essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over
the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might
have preferred to purchase elsewhere.'' 

Jefferson Parish Hospital 

v.

 Hyde,

 466 U.S. 2, 12, 104 S. Ct., 1551, 1558, 80 L.Ed.2d 2 (1984). A tying arrangement violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act
and Section 3 of the Clayton Act if it is shown to restrain competition unreasonably or is illegal per se. 

Fortner Enterprises 

v.

 U.S. Steel Corp.,

 394 U.S. 495, 498-500, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 1256-1257, 22 L.Ed.2d 495 (1969).

The prerequisites of per se illegality are: 
(1) separate products, the purchase of one (tying product) being conditioned on purchase of the other (tied product);

(2) sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to restrain competition appreciably in the tied product;
and 
(3) an effect upon a substantial amount of commerce in the tied product. 

Id.

 What is required in a per section case is not power over the whole market for the tying product, but only a ``type of market
power [that] has sometimes been referred to as leverage * * * defined here as a supplier's ability to
induce his customers for one product to buy a second product from him that would not be purchased solely on the merit
of that second product.'' 

Id.

 at 1559 n.20

 quoting V.P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law, 

1134 at 202 (1980). Courts have condemned tying arrangements ``when the seller has `market power' to force a purchaser
to do something that he would not do in a competitive market.''

it in combination with its licensees to restrict competition in the tied product.

v.

 Caro.,

 689 F. Supp. 221, 237 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). (

Id.

 at 808) the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the District Court for the Southern District of New York found
software and CPUs, to be ``separate products,'' for purposes of finding tie-ins.



Digidyne 

v.

 Data General Corp.,

 734 F.2d 1336 (9th Cir. 1984) involved litigation between rival computer manufacturers. Data General, the defendant,
manufactured a computer system called NOVA, consisting of a central processing unit (``CPU'') and a disk operating
system called RDOS. The operating system contained the basic commands for operating the system. Data General refused
to license the RDOS to all except the purchasers of its NOVA hardware. The Ninth Circuit held that defendant's refusal
to license its computer operating system software except to purchasers of central processing units of its computer
system was an unlawful tying arrangement. Stating that tying agreements served hardly any purpose beyond the suppression
of competition. The Court found that conditions such as existed in 

Digidyne

 successfully curbed competition on the merits with respect to the tied product,'' by denying competitors free access
to the market for the tied product, not because the party imposing the tying requirements has a better product or a lower
price, but because of his power or leverage in another market. At the same time buyers are forced to forego their free
choice between competing product.'' 

Id.

 at 807. Since it is the use of ``power or leverage in another market'' which the antitrust laws proscribe, the Court
reasoned that tie-ins are `unreasonable in and of themselves whenever a party has sufficient economic power with
respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product and a `not
insubstantial' amount of interstate commerce is affected.'' ``If each of the products may be purchased separately
in a competitive market, one seller's decision to sell the two in a single package imposes no unreasonable restraint
on either market particularly if competing suppliers are free to sell either the entire package or its several parts.


Jefferson Parish,

 466 U.S. At 12. Microsoft's anticompetitive licenses prevent sellers from doing just that. Licenses specifically
restrict the sale of MS-DOS to circumstances where it is tied to an accompanying hardware system.

Microsoft's contracts with its licensees whereby they have tied the purchase of MS-DOS to the purchase of accompanying

United States 

v. 

Paramount Pictures, 

334 U.S. 131, 156-159 (1948).

Because of Microsoft's monopoly, sellers of software are precluded from entering and competing in the market for
operating software. Because of Microsoft's monopoly, and sellers inability to obtain MS-DOS to run it sells, seller
is effectively precluded from entering a large portion of the hardware market as well.

From the standpoint of the consumer whose interests in the statute was especially intended to serve the freedom to
select the best bargain in the second market is impaired by his need to purchase the tying product, and perhaps by the
inability to evaluate the true cost of either product when they are available only as a package. 

Jefferson,

 466 U.S. at 15.

Microsoft may claim that it limits its licenses to hardware companies so severely for valid quality control reasons.

Microsoft's effort to enlarge the scope of its monopoly by using the market power it confers to restrain competition
in the market for a second product will undermine competition on the merits in that second market.

Dear Mr. Rosen. This letter refers to the Justice Department's Proposed Final Judgment in United States of America
vs. Microsoft Corporation. I am not certain if this situation is covered. If it is, Microsoft is already violating
the principles of the consent decree. If it is not, I believe it should be included as Prohibited Conduct. This is not
an isolated case. 

Last week I purchased the developers toolkit for Microsoft's Windows NT 3.5 and discovered that Microsoft has included
third party tools to create three dimensional images within software applications free of charge. My product, 3d
Graphic Tools, is a tool to create three dimensional images within software applications. The third party tools included
in Windows NT 3.5 were obtained or licensed from Silicon Graphics by Microsoft. Further I hear (Microsoft will not
cooperate and say one way or the other) that a version of the same third party tools will be included in the upcoming Windows
4.0 release. If this happens my product will be dead, because why would anyone pay for something they already get free?
I think Microsoft's intent by selling this ``package'' is to guarantee a market for one software product and squeeze
may product (and other competing products) out of this market. 

I was under the impression (false) that these third party tools would be sold separately. I was an official test site
for Windows NT 3.5 and they were not included by Microsoft in the pre-release version of the product in other than an
extremely rudimentary form which would have required the purchase of additional tool kits from other sources. 3d
Graphic Tools is not unknown to Microsoft, they have two copies in their corporate library which are accessible to
any employee. We participate in Microsoft's Add-on Developer Tools Program and advertise in the Companion Products
catalogs which are included in Microsoft's product boxes with the Visual Basic and Visual C++. (I have included a copy
of the most recent catalog for Visual C++, my advertisement is on page 15). I think this demonstrates that Microsoft
is aware of my products. As with other small companies this is my sole product. 3d Graphic Tools has been available since
1992 to Windows developers and to MacIntosh developers since 1988. 

Please contact me if you need further information regarding this matter.

Re: Microsoft, Inc. Settlement




Dear Deputy Attorney General Bingaman: I am writing to ask you to please send me a set of the settlement documents for
the Microsoft lawsuit which you recently settled, and also to request that you reopen that matter to consider postsettlement
conduct by Microsoft.

As I understand the basic parameters of the settlement, you sought to ``open up'' access to operating systems. However,
I think you may have settled too soon, for too little.

In the wake of your settlement Microsoft appears to have become more, not less, predatory. Last week I announced I would
fight to stop Microsoft from monopolizing use of the word ``windows'' in computers. This past Sunday the New York Times
carried a story indicating Microsoft is trying to strong-arm software suppliers into shifting to Windows 4.0 under
pain of losing permission to use a ``compatibility'' logo, thereby forcing both producers and consumers of software
to incur major expenses without any real need to do so. These gestures are the classic activity of a monopolist.

I believe there is a reasonable, credible basis to believe that Microsoft is using your settlement as a sword, not a
shield, and has gone on to initiate new forms of monopolistic conduct which may not be literally touched upon by your
settlement. I therefore ask that you reopen your investigation and take meaningful steps to ensure a level playing
field/open marketplace in computer software as well as in operating systems.

RE: United States v. Microsoft Corporation 

Civil Action No. 94-1564 Comment in accordance with the Tunney Act 

 


Dear Messrs. Nanni, Lubeck and Ohana: Under the terms of License Agreements (``Agreements'') with Microsoft Corporation
(``Microsoft'') which cover the period January 1, 1989 to present, I.D.E. Corporation (``IDEA'') has paid Microsoft
prepaid royalties which now exceed Two Million ($2,000,000.00). The Agreements expressly state that these prepaid
royalties may never be refunded to IDEA by Microsoft. Although the Agreement provides that prepaid royalties may
be recoupable against actual earned royalties in excess of IDEA's minimum commitment payments, it is virtually impossible
that these prepaid royalties shall ever be recouped as set forth in the Agreement. 

Although the Consent Decree (``Decree'') grants IDEA the ability to renegotiate the terms of our Agreements, the
Decree does not grant us a remedy for the recovery of $2,000,000 of prepaid royalties. IDEA has been able to obtain a
firm commitment from Microsoft on a refund of the prepaid royalties. It is our sincere belief that Microsoft will not
refund prepaid royalties unless they are so ordered. We therefore respectfully request that the Final Decree contain
such a remedy to IDEA and similarly situated companies.

RE: United States v. Microsoft Corporation

 Civil Action No. 94-1564 Comment in accordance with the Tunney Act



Dear Messrs. Nanni, Lubeck and Ohana: In furtherance of comments provided to your office dated October 17, 1994, we
have enclosed a copy of a draft Amendment submitted to I.D.E. Corporation (``IDEA'') by Microsoft Corporation (``Microsoft'').
As was stated in our earlier comments, although the Consent Decree (``Decree'') grants IDEA the ability to renegotiate
the terms of our Agreements, the Decree does not grant us a remedy for the recovery of $2,000,000 of prepaid royalties.
The attached draft Amendment evidences Microsoft's unwillingness to refund prepaid royalties. This Amendment
indicates that:



``* * * prepaid royalties shall be recoupable against earned royalties * * * only to
the extent such prepaid royalties could have been recouped had the minimum commitment payments existing prior to
the Amendment remained in effect.''



I therefore submit that by amending existing agreements in this manner Microsoft continues to impose minimum commitments
and does not comply with the Decree which requires that it discontinue its practice of imposing minimum commitments.
Again, we respectfully request that the Final Decree stipulate a remedy to IDEA and similarly situated companies
with respect to prepaid royalties. Microsoft's most recent draft Amendment supports our belief that Microsoft will
not refund prepaid royalties unless they are so ordered.

July 25, 1994.




To whom it may concern: This letter is being written in regards to the ridiculous action brought forth towards Microsoft.
Is it Microsoft's fault that they have produced a product that is popular due to the ease in which it takes to operate
it? 

In the statement issued from the Justice department it states that Microsoft has a 70% market share. If it was a monopoly,
should that number not be around 90-95%? To me it looks a little strange to have the Vice-President promoting
the Information Super-Highway and the Justice Department going after a company that will help provide a user friendly
interface for ``computer novices'' to use in order to navigate the highway with. One reason that Microsoft has such
a large market share is that software developers would like to have an operating system standard. Can you imagine the
cost for developing an application in 3 or 4 different formats? I believe that this would cripple trade far more than
the fact that Microsoft has 70% of the market share. This clearly shows that in America you get penalized for success.

places. The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire
detection system in all belt entries used as intake air courses. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


5. Pontiki Coal Corporation 


[Docket No. M-94-162-C] 


Pontiki Coal Corporation, P.O. Box 801, Lovely, Kentucky 41231 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30
CFR 75.350 (air courses and belt haulage entries) to its Pontiki No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 15-09571) located in Martin
County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to use belt haulage entries as intake air courses to ventilate active working
places. The petitioner proposes to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system as an early warning fire
detection system in all belt entries used as intake air courses. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


6. D.G.W. Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-163-C] 


D.G.W. Coal Company, P.O. Box 425-B2, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1405 (automatic couplers) to its No. 7 Vein Slope (I.D. No. 36-07093) located in Schuylkill County,
Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use bar and pin or link and pin couplers on its underground haulage equipment
instead of automatic couplers. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least
the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


7. Mallie Coal Company, Inc. 


[Docket No. M-94-164-C] 


Mallie Coal Company, Inc., Rt. 1, Box 211, Woodbine, Kentucky 30771 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.342 (methane monitors) to its No. 4 Mine (I.D. No. 15- 
17603) located in Knox County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to monitor continuously with a hand-held methane
and oxygen detector instead of using a methane monitoring system on permissible three-wheel tractors with drag bottom
buckets. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.

8. Eastern Associated Coal Corporation 


[Docket No. M-94-165-C] 


Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, 800 Laidley Tower, P.O. Box 1233, Charleston, West Virginia 25324 has filed
a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.503 (permissible electric face equipment; maintenance) to its Federal
No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01456) located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to increase
the maximum length of its trailing cables supplying shuttle cars, loading machines, and roof bolters to 900 feet from
a nominal 480 volt, 3-phase alternating current system during longwall development; to have the cables for shuttle
cars and loading machines not smaller than 

#

2 AWG with the maximum setting at 800 amps; to have the roof bolter cable not smaller than 

#

4 AWG with the maximum setting at 500 amps; and to have the trip settings of these circuit breakers sealed or otherwise
fixed so that the unit settings cannot be set above the maximum allowable value. The petitioner asserts that the proposed
alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


9. Gray Quarries, Inc. 


[Docket No. M-94-43-M] 


Gray Quarries, Inc., P.O. Box 386, Hamilton, Illinois 62341 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR
56.6131(a)(1) (location of explosive material storage facilities) to its Gray Quarries (I.D. No. 11-00073)
located in Hancock County, Illinois. The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory safety standard to
allow the storage facility to remain in its present location until a new location can be established. The petitioner
states that the only other location that is within the mine site that would not create a hazard cannot be used until mining
is complete in that location. 


10. J. M. Huber Corporation 


[Docket No. M-94-44-M] 


J. M. Huber Corporation, P.O. Box 306, Langley, South Carolina 29834 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 56.14101(a)(2) (brakes) to its Langley Plant (I.D. No. 38-00052) located in Aiken County, South Carolina.
The petitioner requests a modification of the mandatory safety standard to allow the use of a different type of parking
device for its Case W-11B loaders because the operator is not able to pull the handle into position when the parking
brakes are adjusted tight enough to hold on a ramp. The petitioner proposes to park this mobile equipment between two
mounds (speed brake type) to ensure the safety of employees, equipment, and surrounding area; to train designated
loader operators in job requirement and safe work practices; and to post a sign in each loader and at each designated
parking area stating the requirement for parking in the designated area.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement 94-2 (IRPS 94-2).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (the Act) requires that NCUA and the federal
banking agencies each establish an appeals process within the Agency to review material supervisory determinations
made with respect to insured institutions. The NCUA Board proposes that the review process be carried out by a supervisory
review committee consisting of senior staff members. This proposal sets forth the types of issues that are eligible
for review by the committee as well as the composition, structure and procedures for the proposed committee. The Board
requests comment on the committee concept as well as all other aspects of the proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-325 (the Act) was signed
into law on September 23, 1994. Section 309 of the Act requires, among other things, that the NCUA and the federal banking
agencies each establish an independent appellate process to review material supervisory determinations. The Act
requires that the agencies provide the public with notice and opportunity to comment on proposed guidelines for the
appellate process within 90 days of the Act's passage. The Act requires further that each agency's appellate process
be established not later than 180 days after the Act's passage.

The Act defines the terms ``material supervisory determinations'' and ``independent appellate process.'' Material
supervisory determinations are defined to include determinations relating to (1) examination ratings; (2) adequacy
of loan loss reserve provisions; and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to a credit union. The
definition specifically excludes determinations made by NCUA to appoint a conservator or liquidating agent or a
decision made under Section 212 of the FCU Act (12 U.S.C. 1790a) concerning NCUA approval of officials of newly chartered
or troubled credit unions.

Independent appellate process is defined as a review by an agency official who does not report, directly or indirectly,
to the agency official who made the determination that is being reviewed. The Act also requires that the agencies ensure
that appeals be heard and decided expeditiously and that safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation
by agency examiners.

In order to carry out the requirements of the Act, the NCUA Board proposes the establishment of a supervisory review
committee composed of several senior NCUA personnel. The Board believes the committee will provide at least the following
benefits for NCUA and credit unions:

 Ensure more consistent application of supervisory policy throughout the Agency.

 Enhance the level of fairness and due process afforded to credit unions and others who are involved in supervisory
disputes with NCUA.

 Reduce the number of cases that can only be resolved through judicial proceedings.

 Provide a more comprehensive and accurate record in those cases that do result in such proceedings.

The Board requests comment on all aspects of this proposal, including the advisability of meeting the statutory requirements
through the establishment of a committee; whether the process should be established by policy statement (as proposed
here) or regulation; the types of disputes subject to the committee's jurisdiction; the composition of the committee's
membership; and the procedural workings of the committee. Certain of these issues are discussed in greater detail
below. 



Supervisory Disputes 



As noted above, the Act sets forth the material supervisory determinations subject to the review process. Included
are determinations related to (1) examination ratings; (2) adequacy of loan loss reserves; and (3) loan classifications
on loans that are significant to the credit union. 

The Board understands the reference to ``examination'' rating to mean a credit union's CAMEL rating. CAMEL is a rating
system that provides a numerical score, from 1 through 5 (with 1 being the highest score), in each of five key areas of
a credit union's management and financial performance, as well as a composite score. The five rated areas_capital
adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity_provide the basis for the CAMEL acronym. 

It should be noted that CAMEL is intended and used mainly as an internal supervisory tool by NCUA, to assist the agency
in determining how and where to devote its supervisory resources. It is not a public rating and it does not necessarily
reflect the level of service a credit union provides to its members. 

The Board proposes that only a credit union's composite CAMEL rating be appealable, but requests comment on whether
the individual component ratings (capital, assets, management, earnings and liquidity) should also be subject
to appeal. In either case, the Board proposes that only ratings of 4 and 5 be subject to appeal. Credit unions with CAMEL
ratings of 4 and 5 are treated differently than those with ratings of 1, 2, or 3. They are generally under much closer
supervision. They are often subject to letters of understanding and agreement. All new officials of credit unions
with a 4 or 5 CAMEL rating are subject NCUA approval pursuant to Section 701.14 of the NCUA Regulations. The Board believes
that credit unions subject to these special supervisory and regulatory procedures are the credit unions whose examination
ratings should be subject to the appeal process. Comment is requested on whether additional composite ratings should
be subject to the appeal process. 

The Board also requests comment on how it should define classified loans that are ``significant'' to the credit union.
Should this be left to the discretion of the credit union? Should it be determined by the loan amount as a percentage
of reserves? Or is some other definition more appropriate. 

Finally, with respect to disputes subject to review, the Board proposes to limit the review process to those three
categories set forth in the Act and identified above. The Board requests comment, however, on any other specific disputes
that should be subject to the committee's review. 



Timing of Committee Involvement 



The Board proposes that the committee assume jurisdiction over a supervisory determination only when the credit
union establishes that it has been unsuccessful in attempting to resolve the matter with the credit union's examiner
and the appropriate regional office. The Board does not intend by this requirement to establish a series of regional
reviews (e.g. Director of Supervision, to Associate Regional Director, to Regional Director), but only that the
credit union demonstrate that an effort was made to resolve the matter with the regional office and an official stationed
in the regional office has said no. 

The Board believes that any earlier involvement by the committee would be disruptive of the established organizational
structure of the NCUA and the relationships between credit unions and their regional offices. Also, in order to remain
flexible and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy, the Board would prefer not to establish specific time frames for resolving
issues at the regional level. The Board welcomes comment on these issues, however, and is committed to both preserving
the regional chain of command and avoiding unnecessary delays. 



Committee Composition and Procedures 



The committee will be comprised of senior agency staff. The Board proposes that the committee be comprised of five
regular members. The members of the committee will consist of the Executive Director, the General Counsel, the Director
of the Office of Examination and Insurance, a specified Regional Director, and one additional senior or Board staff
member. The regional member will be rotated on a periodic basis (proposed policy is to rotate every two years), and
an alternate Regional Director will be named to consider matters arising in the regular member's region. The Executive
Director will serve as the chairperson of the committee. 

Regular committee meetings will be scheduled four times a year. Special meetings may be called and regular meetings
may be canceled based on the workload of the committee. Each committee member will have one vote, the chairperson will
only vote in the case of a tie, and a quorum will be required to conduct business. 

All appeals will be submitted in writing. An appeal may be made by letter, addressed to the Chairman of the Supervisory
Review Committee, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428. The
appeal need only include the name of the credit union, the determination being appealed, and the reasons for the appeal.
Appellants will be encouraged, however, to provide as much detail and supporting documentation as possible, in order
to expedite the appeal process.

<PARENT> FR941117-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Personal appearances will not be a regular part of the process. Appellants may request personal appearances, but
the final decision will be made by the committee.

NCUA is committed to the Act's mandate that appeals be decided expeditiously. It is proposed that the following timing
requirements apply. Credit unions must submit their appeal within 30 days of the regional office's decision. Once
a complete package of information is submitted, the committee will make a determination on the appeal within 90 days.

The committee may request more information from either the appealing party or the regional office. Committee requests
for more information must be made within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The information must be submitted to the committee
within 15 days of receipt of the committee request. The 90 days to make a determination will not begin to run until the
expiration of the time allotted to submit more information. Although these time requirements should be sufficient
in most cases, they are subject to adjustment by the committee, either on its own or upon request of the appellant or
the region involved.

Each determination by the committee will be submitted in writing to the NCUA Board. The Board will review the determination
within seven working days. Board members will each sign indicating whether they agree with the committee's determination.
If a majority of the Board members agree, the determination will be final and the parties will be notified. If a majority
of the Board members do not agree, the matter will be considered by the Board on final appeal.

The Board welcomes comment on both the composition and procedural aspects of the committee.



Miscellaneous Issues



Section 309 of the Act requires that each of the agencies ensure that safeguards exist for protecting the appellant
from retaliation by agency examiners. The proposal notes that credit unions can seek redress from alleged retaliation
through NCUA's Office of Inspector General. The Board will expeditiously and firmly address any cases of retaliation
or abuse. The Board requests comment on any other steps it should take to protect and reassure appellants.

The Act requires that the appellate process be available at 

insured institutions

 that the agency supervises. Accordingly, the supervisory review process will be open to all federally insured credit
unions. The committee will however, only consider appeals of material supervisory determinations made by NCUA.
the committee will consult with the state supervisory authority in appropriate cases involving federally insured
state chartered credit unions.



Regulatory Procedures



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The NCUA Board certifies that the proposed IRPS, if made final, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small credit unions. The appeal procedure set forth in the proposal applies equally to all credit unions.
The appeal procedure is not mandatory. Only those credit unions wishing to appeal certain regional decisions are
subject to its provisions. It is not anticipated that small credit unions will use the appeal procedure any more or
less than large credit unions. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Analysis is not required.



Executive Order 12612



Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The proposed IRPS will
apply to all federally insured credit unions, as required by the Act. It may have a direct effect on the states, on the
relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. However, the Act requires that this process apply to FISCUs.



Paperwork Reduction Act



The proposed IRPS, if adopted, will impose paperwork requirements on an appealing credit union. The paperwork requirements
will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Written
comments on the paperwork requirements should be forwarded directly to the OMB Desk Officer indicated below at the
following address: OMB Reports Management Branch, New Executive Office Building, Room 10202, Washington, DC 20530,
Attn. Milo Sunderhauf. NCUA will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 once OMB action is taken on the submitted requirement.

Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement 94-2_Supervisory Review Committee



Section 309 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 requires that NCUA establish
an independent intra-agency appellate process to review material supervisory determinations. The NCUA Board hereby
establishes a supervisory review committee to implement Section 309.

The committee shall consist of five regular members of NCUA's senior staff: the Executive Director, the Director
of the Office of Examination and Insurance, the General Counsel, one Regional Director, and one additional senior
staff or Board staff member. An alternate Regional Director shall be appointed to consider matters arising in the
member Regional Director's region. The term of committee service for the Regional Director, alternate Regional
Director and additional member is two years. These members may be appointed for additional terms. All other members
will serve permanently.

The Executive Director shall serve as the chairperson of the committee and shall only vote in the case of a tie. All other
members shall have one vote. At least three members will be present at each committee meeting. A majority vote is required
for action on an appeal. Regular committee meetings shall be held four times a year. Meetings via teleconference are
acceptable. Regular meetings may be canceled and special meetings may called by the Executive Director.

Appeals may be made by all federally insured credit unions. The committee shall hear appeals of material supervisory
determinations made by the NCUA. Such determinations are limited to: (1) composite CAMEL rating of a 4 or 5; (2) adequacy
of loan loss reserve provisions; and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to a credit union. A determination
is appealable only after a decision has been made by an official of the appropriate NCUA Regional Office.

Appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Chairman of the committee, within 30 days of the regional office's decision.
Appeals shall be mailed or delivered to Chairman, Supervisory Review Committee, NCUA, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria,
VA 22314-3428. Appeals may be made by letter, which shall include the name of the appellant credit union, the
supervisory determination being appealed and the reasons for the appeal. Appellants are encouraged to submit all
information and supporting documentation relevant to the matter in dispute.

The committee may request additional information from the appellant and/or the regional office within 30 days of
its receipt of the appeal. The information must be submitted to the committee within 15 days of receipt of the committee
request. The committee shall make a determination on the appeal within 90 days from the date of the receipt of an appeal
by the committee or of its receipt of any requested additional information.

The time requirements set forth above are subject to adjustment by the committee, either on its own or upon request
of the appellant or the region involved.

The committee's determination shall be submitted in writing to the NCUA Board. Within seven working days, each Board
member will sign indicating whether they agree with the committee's determination. If a majority of the Board members

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






GPU Nuclear Corporation; Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station Environmental Assessment and Finding of No significant
impact 





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-16, issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al. (the licensee), for operation of the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station, located in Ocean County, New Jersey. 



Environmental Assessment 



Identification of the Proposed Action 



The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification Section 2.3.P(2) to raise the degraded voltage
setpoints from 3671 volts to 3840 volts, and to revise the allowable setpoint range from 

#

1% to +20V, ^40V. The revised setpoint tolerance values in volts represents a range of +0.5%, ^1.0% compared to the
existing setpoint tolerance range of 

#

1%. 

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated July 8, 1994. 



The Need for the Proposed Action 



The proposed action is needed to provide improved protection to safety related electrical equipment from loss of
capability in the event of a sustained degraded voltage condition of the offsite electrical grid system. 



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that the proposed change provides
improved protection to safety related equipment from loss of capability in the event of a sustained degraded voltage
condition on the offsite electrical grid system. 

The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. 

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action. 



Alternatives to the Proposed Action 



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evacuated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not provide the improved protection to safety related equipment
from loss of capability in the event of a sustained degraded voltage condition on the offsite electrical grid system.




Alternative Use of Resources 



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station dated December 1974. 



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the New Jersey State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments. 



Finding of no Significant Impact 




Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action. 

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated July 8, 1994, as supplemented
October 10, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman
Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County
Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington Street, Toms River, NJ 08753.

Notice is hereby given that by a ``PETITION FOR EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNDER PROVISION OF 10 CFR 2.206 WITH REGARD
TO COMANCHE PEAK UNIT 1 AND THERMOLAG 330-1 FIRE BARRIERS,'' dated September 26, 1994, Citizens for Fair Utility
Regulation and Nuclear Information and Resource Service (Petitioners) request that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
take action with regard to Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES) Unit 1 of Texas Utilities Electric Company
(TU Electric).

The Petition requests that (1) the licensee perform additional destructive analysis for Thermo-Lag configurations
in proportion to the total installed amount to determine the degree of ``dry joint'' occurrence; (2) the licensee
perform fire tests on up-graded ``dry joint'' Thermo-Lag configurations for conduit and cable trays to rate the barrier
as a tested configuration in compliance with fire protection regulations; and (3) the NRC immediately suspend the
Comanche Peak Unit 1 license until the above corrective actions are taken.

As the bases for their requests concerning Thermo_Lag 330-1 Fire Barrier upgrades, Petitioners state that:
(1) The licensee's records on the original installation of Thermo-Lag fire barriers on conduits and cable trays indicate
that its contractor followed specifications for pre-buttering all joints; (2) NRC Inspection Report No. 50-455/93-42;
50-446/93-42 found, based on destructive analysis documents, that a concern did exist where Thermo-Lag
conduit joints fell apart easily and did not appear to have any residual material of a buttered surface, indicative
of a joint that had not been pre-buttered; (3) the ``dry joint'' deficiency appeared in Room 115A and other areas of
the unit; (4) the licensee directly contradicts a NRC inspector's findings that were determined in part by destructive
analysis; (5) the ``dry joint'' or absence of pre-buttering of Thermo-Lag panels can be determined only by destructive
analysis and cannot be determined by a walk down visual inspection; (6) the findings reported in the Comanche Peak
Unit 1 Region IV inspection report 50-445/93-42 and 50-446/93-42, based on the limited amount
of destructive analysis conducted at the unit, constitutes a substantial documentation of installation deficiencies
found in Thermo-Lag fire barriers as documented in NRC Information Notice 91-79 and IN 91-79 Supplement
1; (7) neither the NRC nor the industry, by its agent Nuclear Energy Institute, nor a utility, have conducted fire tests
on dry fitted or ``dry joint'' upgraded configurations of Thermo-Lag 330-1; and (8) the presence of ``dry joint''
upgraded configurations in Comanche Peak Unit 1 constitutes an untested application of Thermo-Lag fire barriers.

The Petition is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The Petition has been referred
to the Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this
Petition within a reasonable time. By letter of November 7, 1994, the Director denied Petitioners' request for an
immediate suspension of the operating license.

A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the University of Texas at Arlington Library, Government Publications/Maps, 702 College, P.O. Box
19497, Arlington, Texas 76019.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Testing Laboratories, Inc. (ETL) Forked River, NJ; Order To Cease and Desist Use and Possession of
Regulated Byproduct Material</DOCTITLE>




Environmental Testing Laboratories (ETL), Inc. (Licensee), is the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License
No. 29-19310-02 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant
to 10 CFR Part 30 on July 31, 1986. The License authorized the possession and use of nickel-63 in plated sources or foils,
not to exceed 15 millicuries per foil, in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The License expired on
August 31, 1991.



II



The byproduct material has been transferred from the licensed address of 412 Route 9, Lanoka Harbor, New Jersey, 08834,
to 512 Route 9, Forked River, New Jersey 08731, where it is currently stored. The Licensee did not submit an application
for renewal of the License under 10 CFR 30.37 prior to its expiration, nor did the Licensee notify the Commission, in
writing under 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the License. Although Mr. Walter Holm, Jr., the Radiation Safety
Officer, stated ETL's intentions in a letter dated May 15, 1991, to terminate the license, as of this date, ETL has not
transferred the licensed material to an authorized recipient, nor has ETL applied for an NRC license. 

On January 14, 1993, the NRC, Region I, issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to ETL, mailed to Mr. Walter Holm, for possession
of material without a valid specific license. The letter forwarding the NOV directed the Licensee to place the licensed
material in secure storage, not to use the material, and promptly transfer the licensed material to a lawful recipient.
The Licensee has not responded to the Notice of Violation.

In addition, in a June 7, 1994 letter, the NRC again reminded ETL of the need to respond to the NRC Notice of Violation.
ETL did not respond to a telephone message left on October 26, 1994. To date, ETL still possesses nickel-63 sealed sources
without an NRC license and without applying for such a license.



III



ETL remains in possession of NRC-licensed radioactive material without a license. This is prohibited by Section
81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Based on the above, ETL has violated 10 CFR 30.3, which states that, except
for persons exempt as provided in 10 CFR Parts 30 and 150, no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as
authorized in a specific or general NRC license.

Furthermore, based on the above, notwithstanding the several notices concerning the above from the NRC and the corresponding
opportunities to achieve compliance with applicable requirements, ETL has deliberately violated NRC requirements
by possessing nickel-63 sealed sources without a license. This conclusion is based on the facts that ETL never filed
a renewal application before the License issued to ETL expired on August 31, 1991, as required by 10 CFR 30.37; ETL has
not responded to the NRC Notice of Violation issued on January 14, 1993; ETL has not responded to an NRC letter, dated
June 7, 1994, addressing its previous failure to respond to the Notice of Violation; ETL has refused to dispose of the
radioactive material; and ETL possesses the radioactive material contrary to 10 CFR 30.3; without a valid NRC specific
license.

Improper handling of the nickel-63 sealed sources can result in an unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic
Energy Act and the Commission's regulations require that possession of licensed material be under a regulated system
of licensing and inspection. ETL's possession of NRC-licensed material without a valid NRC license, as documented
in the January 14, 1993, Notice of Violation, and its unwillingness to respond to numerous NRC written and verbal communications
to apply for an NRC license, demonstrate that it is either unable or unwilling to comply with NRC requirements.

Given the circumstances surrounding ETL's possession of the byproduct material and the failure to respond to communications
with the NRC, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected while
ETL remains in possession of the radioactive material without the required NRC license.

IV



Accordingly, in accordance with Sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161i, and 161o of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
and 10 CFR Parts 20 and 30, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT, ETL shall:

A. Immediately cease and desist from any further use of byproduct material now in its possession.

B. Maintain safe control over the byproduct material, as required by 10 CFR Part 20, by keeping the material in locked
storage and not allowing any person access to the material, except for purposes of assuring the material's continued
safe storage, until the material is transferred to a person authorized to receive and possess the material in accordance
with the provisions of this Order and the Commission's regulations.

C. Transfer the nickel-63 byproduct material within 30 days to a person authorized to receive and possess the material.
If ETL does not have sufficient funds to complete the transfer, ETL must provide, within 10 days of this Order, evidence
supporting such a claim by submitting to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, D.C. 20555: (1) An estimate of the cost of the transfer and the basis for the estimate, including the license
numbers and identifies of the persons who have provided estimates of the cost of the transfer; (2) written statements
from at least two banks stating that ETL does not qualify for a loan to pay for the transfer; (3) copies of the Federal
income tax returns of ETL for the years ending 1993, 1992, 1991, and 1990; and (4) a signed statement agreeing to allow
the NRC to receive credit information on ETL from a credit agency. In addition, if ETL has not been able to find a person
who will accept the byproduct material, ETL must provide to the Director, Office of Enforcement, at the address stated
above, within 10 days of the date of this Order, the names of the persons who have been contacted regarding acceptance
of the byproduct material and the dates that the contacts were made. A SUBMITTAL OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE LACK OF
SUFFICIENT FUNDS DOES NOT EXCUSE NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THIS ORDER.

D. At least two working days prior to the date of the transfer of the byproduct material, notify Dr. Ronald Bellamy,
Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC, Region I, by telephone (610-337-5200) so that the NRC may,
if it elects, observe the transfer of the material to the authorized recipient.

E. Within seven days following completion of the transfer, provide to the Regional Administrator, Region I, in writing,
under oath or affirmation: (1) Confirmation, on NRC Form 314, that the nickel-63 byproduct material has been transferred,
(2) the last date that the byproduct material was used, (3) a copy of the survey performed in accordance with 10 CFR 30.36(c)(1)(v),
and (4) a copy of the certification from the authorized recipient that the source has been received.

Copies of the response to this Order shall be sent to the Regional Administrator, Region I, 475 Allendale Road, King
of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, and to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555.

After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with
NRC requirements.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change and
Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Solicited
Transactions</DOCTITLE>



November 9, 1994.



I. Introduction



On May 3, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to adopt a new Rule 6.9 that would regulate the execution of ``solicited orders''; would set forth specific
priority principles applicable to such orders; and would restrict trading by members and associated persons possessing
knowledge of imminent undisclosed solicited transactions. On September 19, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1
to its proposal.
 The proposed rule change was published for comment and appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 13, 1994.
 One comment letter was received on the proposed rule change,
 to which the CBOE responded.











II. Description of the Proposal



The purpose of the CBOE's proposal is to regulate the execution of ``solicited'' transactions in options, 

i.e.,

 options transactions having terms that are negotiated prior to the time the orders comprising the transaction are
exposed to the trading crowd on the CBOE floor.
 The proposed rule change also restricts trading in any class of an option, as well as trading in the underlying security
or any ``related instrument,'' by CBOE members and their associated persons who have knowledge of an imminent solicited
transaction in options of that class. This prohibition applies until all terms are disclosed to the trading crowd
or until execution of the solicited transaction cannot reasonably be considered imminent given the passage of time
since the transaction was agreed upon.







Currently, the CBOE's rules are designed to promote order interaction in an open-outcry auction. For example, Rule
6.43 requires bids and offers to be made at the post by public outcry, and Rule 6.74 imposes specific order exposure
requirements on floor brokers seeking to cross buy orders with sell orders. The CBOE believes that if the orders that
comprise a solicited transaction are not suitably exposed to the order interaction process on the CBOE floor, the
execution of such orders would be inconsistent with the open auction market principles governing the execution of
orders on the CBOE's floor.

Proposed Rule 6.9 is intended to preserve the right that CBOE members currently enjoy the solicit orders in advance
of submitting a proposed trade to the crowd, while at the same time assuring that original orders that are the subject
of a solicitation are exposed to the auction market in a meaningful way. For instance, the proposed rule change would
require a member representing an original order that is the subject of a solicitation to disclose the terms of the original
order to the crowd before the original order can be executed.

<TEXT>
 

The CBOE's proposal establishes a series of priority principles for solicited transactions. Priority is accorded
depending on whether the original order is disclosed throughout the solicitation period; whether the solicited
order improves the best bid or offer in the crowd; and whether the solicited order matches the original order's limit.
Thus, when the original order is disclosed in advance of the solicitation and the solicited order both matches the
disclosed original order's limit and improves the market, the solicited order has priority over other orders in the
crowd and may trade with the original order at the improved bid or offered price, subject to the customer limit order
book priorities set forth in Rule 6.45. When a solicited order does not match the original order's limit and does not
improve the market, however, it does not have priority over other bids and offers represented in the crowd even if the
original order was disclosed to the crowd for the full solicitation period. Under the proposal, if an original order
is not disclosed to the crowd, a responsive solicited order will not have priority to trade with the original order
even if the solicited order improves the market; instead, in that instance, others in the crowd may trade ahead of the
solicited person at the improved price, subject to the customer limit order priorities in CBOE Rule 6.45.
In addition to requiring disclosure of original orders and clarifying the priority principles applicable to solicited
transactions, proposed Rule 6.9(e) clarifies that it is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade
for any member or associated person, who has knowledge of all the material terms of an original order and a solicited
order that matches the original order's price, to enter an order to buy or sell an option of the same class as any option
that is the subject of the solicitation prior to the time the original order's terms are disclosed to the crowd or the
execution of the solicited transaction can no longer reasonably be considered imminent. This prohibition would
extend to orders to buy or sell the underlying security or any ``related instrument,'' as that term is defined in the
Rule.
 The CBOE has stated that the purpose of these measures is to prevent members and associated persons from using undisclosed
information about imminent solicited option transactions to trade the relevant option or any closely-related instrument
in advance of persons represented in the relevant options crowd. Moreover, the CBOE believes that proposed Rule 6.9
improves the CBOE's auction by clarifying the requirements applicable to solicited transactions and by enabling
the CBOE to initiate enforcement proceedings in appropriate cases under specific rules.




III. Comment Letter


The Comment Letter
 concerning the proposed rule change addressed two areas of concern. First, the letter questions whether the proposed
rule applies to those market makers who are continuously present in a trading crowd. Second, the commenter claims
that the terminology used in the proposed rule is vague and undefined.




The commenter claims that the CBOE's proposed rule is silent with respect to its applicability to market makers continuously
present in the trading crowd. Instead, the commenter claims that the proposal only specifically addresses those
situations where a market maker decides to participate in a solicitation either by order or by appearing in person
in the trading crowd, and believes the proposal should make this clear.

<DOCNO> FR941117-2-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The commenter, however, is concerned that if the proposed rule imposes solicitation-related trading restrictions
on market makers who are physically present in a trading crowd on a continual basis, this would significantly affect
such market makers' ability to fulfill their market making functions under CBOE rules. According to the commenter,
such an interpretation conceivably could preclude any number of market makers in a given trading crowd from trading
in their appointed option classes for an undetermined amount of time in instances when a solicited transaction never
materializes into an actual order in a trading crowd.

The commenter also expressed concern that the terminology used in the CBOE's proposal is vague or undefined, making
it difficult for the Exchange to enforce the rule consistently. Specifically, the commenter believes the rule should
define what comprises ``all of the material terms'' of an order, what establishes an order as ``imminent,'' and the
length of time that trading restrictions remain in effect following a solicitation.

In its response, the CBOE addresses each of the commenter's concerns.
 With respect to the commenter's concern that the CBOE proposal ignores market makers continuously present in a trading
crowd, the CBOE states that for purposes of its proposed rule, a member's location at the time a solicitation is received
is irrelevant. The proposed rule applies to all members, including market makers, whether or not continuously present
in a trading crowd, and whether or not present in the crowd at the time of the solicitation.





As for the commenter's contention that the proposal's reach is too broad if it is meant to apply to market makers continuously
present in a trading crowd, the CBOE notes that the only transactions prohibited by its proposed rule are those that
are based on knowledge of the terms (which requires knowledge of the price of both the original and responsive solicited
order) of an imminent, undisclosed solicited transaction. Thus, general solicitations of interest that do not specify
all material terms, or other solicitations that do not result in express or tacit agreement on all material terms of
a trade, including price, do not give rise to trading restrictions under the rule. Further, trades not based on undisclosed
knowledge of a solicitation are not restricted.

Regarding the commenter's contention that the terms ``material'' and ``imminent'' as used in the proposal are undefined
and vague, the CBOE responds that similar terms and concepts are used in the regulatory circulars of the CBOE and other
exchanges prohibiting front running of block transactions. According to the CBOE, many of the principles in the proposed
rule are derived from the frontrunning context, where compliance and enforcement has not been difficult. Similarly,
the CBOE contents, compliance and enforcement should not be difficult in the context of solicited transactions.



IV. Discussion



The Commission finds the proposed rule change consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the proposed rule change is consistent
with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) of the Act, because the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors
and the public interest.

The Commission believes that it is appropriate to permit solicitation between potential buyers and potential sellers
of options in advance of the time they send actual orders to the trading crowd on the Exchange. Complex options orders,
such as spreads, straddles, and combination orders, as well as stock-option orders and large-sized orders, often
require the ``advance shopping'' that is characteristic of a solicited transaction. Therefore, the Commission
agrees with the CBOE that such interactions between buyers and sellers and the resulting solicited transactions
can enhance liquidity and depth at the CBOE by bringing orders to the floor that might otherwise be difficult to effect.

<TEXT>
 

Nevertheless, because solicited transactions may entail individualized negotiation, the orders that comprise
a solicited transaction may not adequately be exposed to the floor auction. Consequently, the crowd may not have sufficient
time to digest and react to those orders' terms, causing the parties to a solicited transaction to preempt the crowd
by executing it at the pre-negotiated price.

The Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal strikes the proper balance of allowing members to solicit, in advance,
the other side of an order, while ensuring at the same time that the order will be exposed to the trading crowd consistent
with auction market principles. The proposal encourages disclosure of an original order to the trading crowd by making
the priority of a solicited order dependent upon the degree of disclosure to the crowd, and upon whether the order improves
the market.
 Such disclosure gives members of the trading crowd the opportunity to participate in all transactions, including
solicited transactions, and should ensure that customer orders receive the best price available on the CBOE floor.
At the same time, the CBOE's proposal will enable members to search for contra-side interest for orders that will ultimately
be brought down to the CBOE floor, thereby enhancing depth and liquidity on the CBOE floor.





Absent the proposal, the only guidelines concerning solicited transactions are contained in a 1988 memorandum to
the CBOE's membership.
 The lack of codified Exchange rules governing such activity could cause uncertainty and hinder solicitation of additional
trading interest. The Exchange's proposal introduces clear rules applicable to solicited transactions, and strengthens
the ability of the Exchange to ensure that customer orders receive full consideration by the trading crowd. In addition,
the proposed rule change will enable the Exchange to monitor more effectively transactions where orders have been
solicited outside the trading crowd, and should ensure that transactions involving solicitation will be executed
consistent with auction market principles.





The Commission also believes that the commenter's concerns have been adequately addressed. In this regard, the Commission
believes that it is appropriate for the CBOE to prohibit, as inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade,
transactions by members based on the knowledge of imminent undisclosed solicited transactions, irrespective of
a member's location in or out of the trading crowd at the time of the solicitation. Without this prohibition, such trading
can threaten the integrity of the auction market or disadvantage unwittingly other market participants.

Although the Commission recognizes that the trading restrictions may prevent a market maker from conducting certain
transactions while in the crowd, we do not believe the proposal inhibits CBOE market makers from fulfilling their
market making functions. The trading restrictions only will apply if the member has knowledge of all material terms
and conditions, including the price of both sides of the trade, of an imminent undisclosed solicited transaction.
General solicitations will not give rise to trading restrictions under the proposal. Moreover, market maker trades
not based on undisclosed knowledge of the terms of a solicited transaction are not restricted. Thus, a market maker
only will be subject to trading restrictions when he or she trades based on the information regarding an imminent transaction
that is not disclosed to the trading crowd. It is reasonable for the CBOE to conclude that transactions effected under
such circumstances are inconsistent with market making obligations, and should be restricted. Accordingly, the
Commission believes that market makers will still be able to perform their functions fully, and will be expected to
do so, notwithstanding the trading restrictions imposed under the rule. Finally, regarding the commenter's concerns
that the terms in the CBOE's proposed rule are vague, the Commission agrees with the CBOE that, although subject to
interpretation, when used in other contexts these terms have not posed a problem for the Exchange or the Commission.

In summary, the Commission believes that the CBOE proposal is a reasonable approach to ensure that solicited, prenegotiated
orders are not ``hidden'' from interaction with the auction market. Such orders should be exposed to the trading crowd
to ensure that the best price available is obtained. At the same time, the proposal will still provide market participants
with flexibility to search for interest for unusual or complex orders. By setting forth a set of priority principles,
subject to the priorities granted to the customer limit order book, to encourage disclosure of solicited orders,
and by prohibiting market participants from trading ahead of others based on undisclosed knowledge of solicited
orders, the proposal should benefit market participants and ensure investor protection consistent with Section
6(b)(5) of the Act.
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Amendment No. 1 effects three minor revisions to the CBOE's proposal. First, paragraph one of Proposed Rule 6.9 is
amended to make it clear that the rule includes solicitations by floor brokers who do not represent such an original
order but who become aware of the original order when it is announced in the trading crowd or otherwise. Second, Proposed
Interpretation and Policy .04 is revised to reflect that only paragraph (a) of Rule 6.9 overrides the Exchange's crossing
rule, CBOE Rule 6.74. Third, Proposed Interpretation and Policy .05 is revised by deleting the introductory clause
and adding an example to make it clear that the priority of an original order is in all cases governed by the priority
principals of Rule 6.45.
The Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 strengthens the Exchange's proposal by refining some of the language
used in its proposed rule. Moreover, these changes do not affect the substance of the Exchange's proposal. Accordingly,
the Commission believes the Amendment raises no new or unique regulatory issues. Therefore, the Commission believes
it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on an accelerated
basis.


V. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons
making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written
statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications
relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from
the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in
the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer
to File No. SR-CBOE-94-15 and should be submitted by [insert date 21 days from date of publication].


VI. Conclusion


For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the Act, and, in particular,
Section 6 of the Act.


It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-15), as amended, is approved. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; MBS Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Establishing
Additional Requirements Applicable to Participants</DOCTITLE>


November 9, 1994.


On June 27, 1994, the MBS Clearing Corporation (``MBS'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MBS-94-04) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The proposed rule change establishes additional requirements in MBS's rules applicable to participants. The Commission
published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on August 1, 1994.
 On November 7, 1994, MBS filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 The amendment was technical in nature and did not require republication of notice of filing. No comments were received.
For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.






I. Description



The proposed rule change establishes additional requirements in MBS's rules applicable to participants. Specifically,
MBS is adding a new Section 13 to Article III, Rule 1 (``Requirements Applicable to participants'') of MBS's rules.
New Section 13 requires that all participants prepare and maintain all required financial and other reports and a
general ledger chart of accounts in English and in U.S. dollars, ensure the availability of an individual fluent in
English and knowledgeable in securities and financial matters to assist representatives of MBS, and satisfy the
financial net worth requirements in MBS's rules computed in accordance with generally accepted U.S. accounting
principals. In addition, new Section 13 requires that all participants maintain an agent located in the U.S. for service
of process and maintain an office or agent located in the U.S. that can adequately address all purchase and sales, margin
compliance, clearance, and cash settlement functions for the participant. Section 13 explicitly sets forth that
these requirements are in addition to all other requirements applicable to MBS participants.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that MBS's proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act
 and in particular with Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act.
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) require, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to assure
the safeguarding of securities and funds within its possession or control or for which it is responsible. The Commission
believes that MBS's proposal to establish additional requirements in MBS's rules applicable to participants is
consistent with this obligation.





Under the proposed rule change, all MBS participants now will be required to satisfy their financial and reporting
obligations in a manner which will better facilitate MBS's oversight of participants. For example, a participant
now will be explicitly required to satisfy the financial net worth requirements in MBS's rules computed in accordance
with generally accepted U.S. accounting principals and maintain an entity located in the U.S. to tend to certain securities
matters related to MBS.
The Commission believes that the additional requirements applicable to all participants should facilitate MBS's
monitoring of the communications with participants and should help ensure that participants comply with all requirements
in MBS's rules. As a result, MBS should be better able to reduce its risk exposure and consequently should be better
able to fulfill its safeguarding obligations.


III. Conclusion


On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, in particular
with Section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder.


It is therefore ordered

, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MBS-94-04) be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations and Legal Analysis


1. Chase requests exemptive relief for itself, any management investment company registered under the Act, other
than an investment company registered under section 7(d) of the Act (a ``U.S. Investment Company''), and any custodian
for a U.S. Investment Company from section 17(f) of the Act. The requested exemption would let Chase, such U.S. Investment
Company and such custodian maintain foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents (collectively, ``Assets'')
in the custody of Chase-Mexico, an indirect subsidiary of Chase located in Mexico. For purposes of the application,
the term ``foreign securities'' includes (a) securities issued and sold primarily outside the United States by a
foreign government, a national of any foreign country, or a corporation or other organization incorporated or organized
under the laws of any foreign country, and (b) securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the United States
or by any state or any political subdivision thereof or by any agency thereof or by any entity organized under the laws
of the United States or of any state thereof which have been issued and sold primarily outside of the United States.
2. Section 17(f) of the Act requires every registered management investment company to place and maintain its securities
and similar investments in the custody of certain enumerated entities. Rule 17f-5 under the Act expands the
group of entities located outside the United States that are permitted to serve as custodians for the Assets of registered
management investment companies. Rule 17f-5 defines the term ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' to include a
majority-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of a qualified U.S. bank-holding company that is incorporated or organized
under the laws of a country other than the United States and that has shareholders' equity in excess of $100,000,000
(U.S. $ equivalent or U.S. $) as of the close of its most recently completed fiscal year. The rule defines the term ``Qualified
U.S. Bank'' to include a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States that has an aggregate capital,
surplus and undivided profit of not less than $500,000.

<TEXT>
 

3. Chase is a national banking association and is regulated as such by the Comptroller of the Currency under the National
Bank Act. At December 31, 1993, Chase had shareholders' equity in excess of $6.4 billion. Thus, Chase is a ``Qualified
U.S. Bank'' under the requirements of rule 17f-5, since it is a banking institution organized under the laws of the
United States, and it has aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profit substantially in excess of the $500,000
minimum required by the rule.

4. Chase is a subsidiary of The Chase Manhattan Corporation, a Delaware company that provides financial services
throughout the world. Through its Global Securities Services division (``GSS''), Chase provides custody and related
services to global institutional investors, including U.S. mutual funds. GSS currently has over $1,300 trillion
in assets under custody at various locations throughout the world, including its branches and subsidiaries in approximately
50 countries.

5. Chase currently operates a representative office in Mexico and has custodian accounts at a Mexican bank and Meixco's
central securities depositary. As a result of the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Chase
wishes to consolidate its activities in Mexico with the establishment of Chase-Mexico, which it anticipates will
be incorporated in Mexico on or around November 1, 1994. Chase-Meixco will be a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of Chase engaged in the business of commercial banking in Mexico, and will be supervised by the National Banking Commission
under the Banking Law. Chase intends to transfer its current custody operations in Mexico to Chase-Mexico upon receipt
of the requested exemptive order.

6. Chase-Mexico will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f-5 insofar as it will be a majority-owned indirect subsidiary
of a Qualifying U.S. Bank and will be incorporated and organized under the laws of Mexico. Chase-Mexico will not, however,
meet the $100 million minimum shareholders' equity requirement of rule 17f-5. Accordingly, Chase-Mexico will not
qualify as an ``Eligible Foreign Custodian'' under the rule and, absent exemptive relief, could not serve as custodian
for the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies.

7. Where custody services are required in Mexico, Chase will hold the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies as custodian
or subcustodian and will deposit (or cause or permit the deposit of) the Assets with Chase-Mexico in accordance with
the arrangements described in the conditions below. Before permitting Chase-Mexico to act as a custodian for U.S.
Investment Company Assets, Chase will assure that Chase-Mexico is capable and well-qualified to provide custody
and subcustody services to Chase, U.S. Investment Companies, and custodians for U.S. Investment Companies. Under
the proposed foreign custody arrangements, the protection afforded the Assets of U.S. Investment Companies held
by Chase-Mexico would not be diminished from the protection afforded by rule 17f-5
.

Applicant's Conditions





Chase agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief my be conditioned upon the following:



1. The foreign custody arrangements proposed regarding Chase-Mexico will satisfy the requirements of rule 17f-5
in all respects other than Chase-Mexico's level of shareholders' equity.



2. Chase will deposit Assets with Chase-Mexico only in accordance with the Custody Agreement and the Subcustody Agreement
described in (a) and (b) below. The Custody and Subcustody Agreements will remain in effect at all times during which
Chase-Mexico fails to satisfy all the requirements of the rule.



(a) The Custody Agreement will be between Chase and the U.S. Investment Company (or its custodian). In that agreement,
Chase will undertake to provide custody or subcustody services, and the U.S. Investment Company (or its custodian)
will authorize Chase to delegate to Chase-Mexico such of Chase's duties and obligations as will be necessary to permit
Chase-Mexico to hold in custody the Mexican Assets of U.S. Investment Companies. The Custody Agreement will further
provide that the delegation by Chase to Chase-Mexico will not relieve Chase of any responsibility to the U.S. Investment
Company or its custodian for any loss due to such delegation, and that Chase will be liable for any loss or claim arising
out of or in connection with the performance by Chase-Mexico of the custody services to the same extent as if Chase had
itself provided the custody services under the Custody Agreement.



(b) A Subcustody Agreement will be executed by Chase and Chase-Mexico. Pursuant to this agreement, Chase will delegate
to Chase-Mexico such of Chase's duties and obligations as would be necessary to permit Chase-Mexico to hold Assets
in custody in Mexico. The Subcustody Agreement will explicitly provide that (i) Chase-Mexico is acting as a foreign
custodian for Assets that belong to a U.S. Investment Company pursuant to the terms of an exemptive order issued by
the SEC and (ii) the U.S. Investment Company or its custodian (as the case may be) that has entered into a Custody Agreement
will be entitled to enforce the terms of the Subcustody Agreement and can seek relief directly against Chase-Mexico.
The Subcustody Agreement will provide that it will be governed by New York law.



3. Chase currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the Qualified U.S. Bank requirement set forth in rule 17f-5(c)(3).

<DOCTITLE>Portico Funds, Inc., et al.; Notice of Application </DOCTITLE>



November 10, 1994. 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').

Portico Funds, Inc. (the ``Fund''), Firstar Investment Research & Management Company (``FIRMCO''), and Sunstone
Financial Group, Inc. (``Sunstone''). 




Relevant Act Sections: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 18(f), 18(g), 18(i), 22(c),
and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder.




Summary of Application:

The application was filed on July 8, 1994, and amended on September 14, 1994, and November 10, 1994.




Hearing or Notification of Hearing: 

An order granting the application will be issued unless the SEC orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a

notification of a hearing by writing to the SEC's Secretary.



</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations 



1. The Fund is a open-end management investment company. The Fund consists of multiple investment portfolios or series,
each of which has separate investment objectives and policies. FIRMCO serves as the Fund's investment adviser and
Sunstone serves as the distributor. 

2. Applicants request that any relief granted also apply to other open-end management investment companies for which
FIRMCO or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FIRMCO acts in the future as investment
adviser (collectively, with the Fund, the ``Companies''). 

3. Under the current distribution arrangements, shares of each of the Fund's portfolios are offered to investors
without a sales charge. Some portfolios are, however, subject to a purchase adjustment fee of up to .50%. This fee is
imposed at the time of purchase to prevent a portfolio from being adversely affected by the transaction costs associated
with share purchases. It is anticipated that this fee will be discontinued after the requested order is granted. 

4. Applicants propose that each Company be permitted to offer an unlimited number of classes of shares. Classes of
shares may be offered in connection with a plan or plans adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act (the ``Distribution
Plan'') and/or in connection with a non-rule 12b-1 administrative plan (the ``Administrative Services Plan,''
and, collectively with the Distribution Plan, the ``Plans''). Services under the Plans may be provided by a Company's
distributor and/or administrator, or by organizations that have entered into agreements (collectively, ``Plan
Agreements'') with the Company, its distributor, or it administrator concerning the provision of services to the
organization's clients who may be the record or beneficial owners of shares of a particular class. The Companies also
may offer classes of shares that would be subject to front-end sales loads and/or CDSCs. The sum of any front-end load,
asset based sales charge, and CDSC paid by a shareholder for a single investment will not exceed the maximum sales charge
provided for in article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. (``NASD'').

<PARENT> FR941117-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. Expenses of a Company that could not be attributed directly to any one portfolio would be allocated to each portfolio
based on the relative net assets of the portfolio or as otherwise determined under the supervision of its directors
(``Company Expenses''). Expenses attributable to a portfolio but not to a particular class would be allocated on
the basis of the relative net asset value of the respective classes in the portfolio (``Portfolio Expenses''). Each
class will bear certain expenses attributable specifically to such class, as set forth in condition 1 (``Class Expenses'').
The net asset value of all shares of a portfolio would be computed on the same days and at the same times.
6. FIRMCO or another service contractor may choose to reimburse or waive Class Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary,
temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are
by their nature specific to a given class and are expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants believe that
it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different
levels for different classes of the same portfolio.
7. In addition, FIRMCO or another service contractor may waive or reimburse Company Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses
(with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Company
Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Company Expenses and/or Portfolio
Expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a portfolio according to the relative net
assets of the classes. Company Expenses and Portfolio Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given portfolio.
Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Company Expenses or Portfolio Expenses at different
levels for different classes of the same portfolio.
8. Applicants propose that share exchange privileges may be available to shareholders to permit (a) the exchange
of shares of one portfolio for shares of another portfolio, (b) the exchange of shares of an equity portfolio or a fixed
income portfolio for shares of a money market portfolio (or vice versa), and/or (c) the exchange of shares of one class
of a portfolio for shares of another class of the same portfolio. Any exchange of shares will comply with rule 11a-3
under the Act.
9. Shares of some classes of shares subject to a CDSC (``Convertible CDSC Shares'') could automatically convert into
shares of non-CDSC shares (``Non-CDSC Shares'') after a prescribed period following the purchase of Convertible
CDSC Shares. Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid with respect to
Cnvertible CDSC Shares will also be Convertible CDSC Shares. These shares will convert to Non-CDSC Shares on the earlier
of a prescribed period following the date of such reinvestment or the conversion date of the most recently purchased
Convertible Shares which were not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions.
10. Applicants also request an exemption to permit the Companies to impose a CDSC on redemptions of shares of the Company,
and to waive the CDSC under certain circumstances. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase
in the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation, on shares acquired through the reinvestment
of income dividends or capital gain distributions, or on those shares purchased more than a specified period prior
to redemption. In determining whether a CDSC would be payable, it would be assumed that shares, or amounts representing
shares, that are not subject to a CDSC would be redeemed first and other shares or amounts would be redeemed in the other
purchased. No CDSC will be imposed on shares purchased before the effective date of the requested order.
11. Applicants also request relief to permit each Fund to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. Any waiver
or reduction will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d-1 of the Act.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe
that by implementing the multiple class distribution system, the Company would be able to facilitate the distribution
of their shares and provide a broad array of services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs.
Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights in the manner described above
is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders.

2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemptions of
shares. Applicants believe that their request to permit the CDSC arrangement would permit shareholders the option
of having more investment dollars working for them from the time of their share purchases than if they chose a class
with a front-end sales load.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in one portfolio of a Company, and will be identical in all respects,
except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of the same portfolio will relate solely
to: (a) the impact of (i) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Plan, (ii) other Class Expenses which would be limited
to (A) transfer agency fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (B)
printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses,
and proxies to current shareholder of a class, (C) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (D) SEC
registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (E) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required
to support the shareholders of a specific class, (F) litigation or other legal expenses or audit or other accounting
expenses relating solely to one class of shares, and (G) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to
one class of shares; and (iii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated
to one class and which are approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately
with respect to a portfolio's Plans and any other matter submitted to shareholders relating to Class Expenses, except
as provided in condition 17 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of the classes of shares; (d) the designation
of each class of shares of a portfolio; and/or (e) certain conversion features offered by some of the classes.

2. The board of directors of a Company, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the multiclass
distribution system. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with
respect to the approvals necessary to implement a multi-class system will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors'
determination that the proposed multi-class system is in the best interests of both the Company involved and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of a Company, including a majority
of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and
disposition of monies paid or payable by a Company to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and
the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which
such expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of a Company, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each portfolio having a multi-class system for the existence of any material conflicts among
the interests of the various classes of each portfolio. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors,
shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. A portfolio's
investment adviser and distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the
directors. If a conflict arises, a portfolio's investment adviser and/or distributor at their own cost will remedy
such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. Any Administrative Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1. 
6. The directors of a Company will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distributions and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing expenditure charged to that class. Expenditures not
related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 
7. Dividends paid by a portfolio with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will
be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Plan Payments
relating to each respective class of shares and the Class Expenses relating to each class of shares will be borne exclusively
by that class. 
8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various
classes in any portfolio having a multi-class distribution system and the proper allocation of expenses among the
various classes in each such portfolio have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to
the Company involved, which report has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Company involved that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports,
following request by the Company involved (which the Company agrees to provide), will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Company for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management or a regional office of the SEC. Authorized staff members would be limited to the Director, an Associate
Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators
or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures
placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and
tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted
by the AICPA from time to time. 
9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 
10. The prospectuses of each portfolio having a multi-class system will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson
and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares of a portfolio may receive different
compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the same portfolio.

11. The distributor for a Company having a multi-class system will adopt compliance standards for any portfolio which
has a multi-class system, which standards will relate to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a portfolio having a multi-class system to agree
to conform to such applicable standards.



12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
with respect to the multi-class system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the directors of a
Company having a multi-class system.



13. Each portfolio having a multi-class system will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution
arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, conversion features, CDSCs, and exchange privileges applicable to
each class of shares in a portfolio in every prospectus relating to such portfolio, regardless of whether all classes
of shares are offered through each prospectus. Each such portfolio will disclose the respective expenses and performance
data applicable to all classes of shares in a portfolio in every shareholder report relating to such portfolio. The
shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information
related to the portfolio as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each portfolio's per share data, however,
will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such portfolio. To the extent any advertisement
or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose
the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by
applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of any portfolio's net asset value and public offering
price will present each class of shares separately.



14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval,
authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the portfolios may make pursuant to a Plan
in reliance on the exemptive order.



15. If a CDSC arrangement is implemented with respect to shares of a portfolio, applicants agree to comply with the
provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as
such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.



16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature will convert into another class of shares on the basis of the relative
net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion,
the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined
in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based
sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.



17. If a Company implements any amendment to its Distribution Plan(s) (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or
implements any amendment to an Administrative Plan or Plans) that would increase materially the amount that may be
borne by the Non-CDSC Shares under the Plan, existing Convertible CDSC Shares will stop converting into the Non-CDSC
Shares unless the Convertible CDSC Shares, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors shall
take such action as is necessary to ensure that Convertible CDSC Shares are exchanged or converted into a new class
of shares (``New Non-CDSC Shares''), identical in all material respects to the Non-CDSC Shares as they existed prior
to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Non-CDSC
Shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all
existing Convertible CDSC Shares for a new class (``New Convertible CDSC Shares ''), identical to the existing Convertible
CDSC Shares in all material respects except that the New Convertible CDSC Shares will convert into New Non-CDSC Shares.
New Non-CDSC Shares or New Convertible CDSC Shares may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions
described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of New Non-CDSC Shares or New Convertible CDSC Shares shall be borne solely by the Company's adviser
and/or distributor. Convertible CDSC Shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Non-CDSC
Shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Non-CDSC Shares plan and
the relationship of such plan to the Convertible CDSC Shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

Environmental Impact Statement: Pettis, Morgan, Cooper, Moniteau and Cole Counties, MO



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
project in central Missouri.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to upgrade U.S. Route 50 to a dual-lane facility starting 0.7 mile west of Routes
D and T in Cole county and continuing to a point west of the cityof Sedalia in Pettis county. The EIS will also include
U.S. Route 65 through the city of Sedalia. A location study will run concurrently with the preparation of the EIS and
will provide definitive alternatives for evaluation by the EIS. The proposed action will accomplish several goals
(1) improve safety and capacity for through traffic on U.S. Route 50, (2) to study the need for a dual-lane bypass around
the cities of Sedalia, Syracuse, Tipton, California, and St. Martins and (3) promote economic development for the
counties involved in the cities mentioned above.





1. The proposed project begins at 0.7 mile west of Routes D and T in Cole county and continues to a point west of the city
of Sedalia in Pettis county. The project is approximately 70.0 miles in length. The proposed facility will provide
a four-lane, limited-access roadway with at-grade intersections or interchanges at major arterial crossroads.

2. Alternatives under consideration include ``build'' alternatives north and/or south of the existing route that
could be either parallel or on relocation. Other alternatives include transportation management options as well
as a ``no build'' alternative.

3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping
process was initiated with federal, state, and local agencies at a scoping meeting on October 11, 1994. Further public
meetings and hearings will be held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action is addressed
and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments
and questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or to the MHTD at the addresses
provided above.

SeaRiver Maritime, Inc.; Notice of Application for Approval To Transfer Operating-Differential Subsidy Agreement,
Contract MA/MSB-439 From the Bankruptcy Estate of Equity Carriers, Inc. and To Operate the S/R ``Mediterranean''
in the Foreign Trade With Operating-Differential Subsidy


SeaRiver Maritime, Inc. (SeaRiver), by letter of September 29, 1994, advises that it has purchased Operating-Differential
Subsidy Agreement, Contract MA/MSB-439 from the bankruptcy estate of Equity Carriers, Inc., and that its purchase
agreement with the bankruptcy estate is subject to: 



 Maritime Administration (MARAD) approval of the transfer of Contract MA/MSB-439,
 MARAD obtaining approval of funding for at least one of the three operating subsidies comprising Contract
MA/MSB-439 for the balance of the period of Contract MA/MSB-439, which expires on May 23, 2001, and 
 MARAD and SeaRiver agreement to necessary amendments to Contract MA/MSB-439. 



SeaRiver advises that the purpose of its petition to MARAD is to request approval of the transfer of Contract MA/MSB-439
to SeaRiver and to obtain confirmation that funding will be available for subsidizing the worldwide transportation
of crude oil in bulk in the foreign commerce of the United States and between foreign ports on the S/R MEDITERRANEAN
(Vessel), a 211,000 DWI tanker, which sustained bottom damage in 1989 when it ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William
Sound. Following completion of repairs in 1990 and due to an expected decline in ANS transportation requirements,
the Vessel was temporarily placed in foreign service and renamed accordingly. Subsequently, under a provision of
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the vessel was, and remains, prohibited from operating in Prince William Sound, thereby
denying the Vessel from operating in the only Jones Act trade for which it is operationally and economically suited.

SeaRiver advises that since September 1990, therefore, the Vessel has operated in foreign service. In the four years
of foreign operations, the Vessel has completed more than 60 voyages primarily transporting mid-East crude oil to
European discharge ports. SeaRiver states that the Vessel's performance in this service has been exemplary, and
the Vessel and its crew are highly regarded in the many foreign ports which it has entered. Moreover, as the only modern
U.S. tanker consistently operating abroad, the Vessel and her crew have demonstrated and fostered the best traditions
of the American flag merchant marine. 
SeaRiver advises that the Vessel is competing against low-cost foreign-flag operators for foreign commerce in a
depressed-rate trade, which is not covering operating costs of foreign flag tankers with significantly lower operating
costs than U.S. flag vessels. However, the Vessel is precluded from operating in the domestically protected trade
for which it was primarily built. SeaRiver advises that given the losses sustained and the prospect of continuing
losses on the operation of the Vessel, SeaRiver has to consider alternatives including lay-up and sale. The other
viable and beneficial alternative is the granting of operating-differential subsidy (ODS) to support continued
operation of the Vessel in foreign commerce. 
SeaRiver states that it is wholly-owned affiliate of Exxon Corporation (Exxon). SeaRiver is a ``stand alone'' company
which has the responsibility to the shareholders to ensure that SeaRiver maintains its leadership presence as a technically
proficient, high quality owner/operator of U.S.-flag vessels transporting crude and petroleum products. SeaRiver
states that providing ODS will ensure that this modern state-of-the-art and technologically advanced Vessel will
continue to operate and will provide for continuing employment for about 50 skilled, dedicated American seafarers.
SeaRiver states that it owns and operates oceangoing tankers, tugs/towboats and barges. It has an ocean fleet of 12
tankers totaling 1,200 thousand DWT and an inland fleet of 16 tugs and towboats and 50 barges. SeaRiver advises that
its principal operations involve the transportation of crude oil, petroleum feedstocks, and finished petroleum
and chemical products and tug assist service. 
SeaRiver's principal operations are listed below: 



 Alaskan crude from Valdez, Alaska, to U.S. west coast destinations;
 Motor gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel, and other petroleum fuel products to U.S. ports from Baytown, Texas;
and Baton Rouge, Louisiana;
 Lubricating oils, solvents, and other specialty products from Baytown and Baton Rouge to east coast and inland
destinations;

<DOCNO> FR941117-2-00153 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

 Inter-refinery feedstock transportation; 

 Harbor, escort and assist tug services to vessels; and 

 International crude trade (one vessel). 

 


SeaRiver, by letter of October 24, 1994, provided additional information in connection with its request of September
29, 1994. 

SeaRiver advises that since September 1990, the Vessel has operated in foreign service, having now completed more
than 60 voyages, primarily from the Middle East and Mediterranean areas to European ports. On occasion, the Vessel
has loaded North Sea crude in Scotland for transportation to other European discharge ports. Earlier this year, the
Vessel also transported a Strategic Petroleum Reserve cargo from Sullom Voe. SeaRiver advises that its plans are
that the Vessel will continue to operate in international service, optimally in the Middle East and European foreign
trades. However, this does not preclude the vessel from trading in the U.S. In Attachment I to its letter of October
24, SeaRiver shows the number of voyages and foreign areas of operation for the Vessel for 1992, 1993, and 1994. 

SeaRiver also requests the necessary written permission under section 805(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as
amended (Act), for vessels owned and operated by SeaRiver in the domestic trades. These include tank vessels used
to transport crude from Alaska to U.S. west coast destinations and solvents, chemicals, specially and petroleum
products from the U.S. gulf to the U.S. east coast. SeaRiver also operates towboats and barges that move petroleum
fuel products, specialty products and chemicals along the U.S. gulf coast and inland waterways. SeaRiver advises
that tugs are also used in harbor assist, escort and oil spill response service on the U.S. west coast and in the Gulf.
SeaRiver states that it may acquire additional U.S. flag tonnage as an owner/operator or may dispose of existing tonnage
in the course of normal business operations. Additionally, SeaRiver indicates that it may spot, term or bareboat
incharter and/or outcharter U.S.-flag tonnage as necessary to satisfy business requirements. SeaRiver lists its
domestic fleet and areas of operating in Attachment II to its letter of October 24, 1994. 

SeaRiver advises that it presently distinguishes accounting for the expenditures of the S/R MEDITERRANEAN separate
from other operations. SeaRiver will further guarantee to institute any additional internal procedures that may
be necessary to ensure that any operational subsidy granted will apply only to the S/R MEDITERRANEAN. 

SeaRiver is also requesting a waiver of section 804(a) of the Act. In addition to owning, operating, inchartering
and outchartering U.S. flag vessels, SeaRiver also incharters foreign flag tankers to support domestic operations
(e.g. Gulf of Mexico ligthering service). 

SeaRiver advises that Exxon also has international affiliates that own, operate and charter foreign flag vessels.
These affiliates are located primarily in Europe, the Far East and Latin America. The vessels are managed and operated
by the affiliates and are totally independent from the U.S. flag marine operations of SeaRiver. These Exxon affiliates
may acquire additional foreign flag tonnage as owners/operators or may dispose of existing tonnage in the course
of their normal business operations. The affiliates may also spot, term, or bareboat incharter and/or outcharter
foreign flag tonnage necessary to satisfy business requirements. Attachment III to SeaRiver's October 24, letter
details all of the Exxon affiliates's owned, operated, and chartered foreign flag vessels. 

SeaRiver advises that Exxon is a participant in the Revised Voluntary Tanker Agreement (MARAD Contract MA-11725)
under which Exxon agrees to make foreign flag tanker tonnage capacity available to the U.S. to further meet (beyond
the SeaRiver U.S. flag tonnage) emergency national defense needs. The Bahamian registered vessels which are noted
in Attachment III to the October 24 letter are covered by the Agreement. 

This application may be inspected in the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person, firm or corporation
having any interest in such application and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must by 5:00 PM
on December 7, 1994, file written comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person
seeking to oppose the application must file a petition for leave to intervene. The petition shall state clearly and
concisely the grounds of interest, and the alleged facts relied on for relief. The Maritime Administration will consider
any comments submitted and take such action with respect thereto as may be deemed appropriate.

Automobili Lamborghini; Grant of Application for Temporary Exemption From 
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 214 



Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. of Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, (``Lamborghini'') applied for a temporary exemption
from the dynamic side impact protection requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 214 

Side Impact Protection

. The basis of the application was that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship to a company that has
tried to comply with the standard in good faith. 

Notice of receipt of the application was published on September 28, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment
(59 FR 49462). This notice grants the exemption. 

On May 16, 1994, Lamborghini petitioned NHTSA to permit Chrysler Corporation to include Lamborghini vehicles in
its vehicle fleet for the purpose of compliance with Standard No. 214's phase-in calculation for enhanced side protection.
In the alternative, it petitioned NHTSA to grant the company a temporary exemption from the side impact standard's
new performance requirements until September 1, 1996. On August 5, 1994, NHTSA denied Lamborghini's request to be
included in Chrysler's fleet because Chrysler had sold its interest in Lamborghini on January 31, 1994, to a group
of investors led by MegaTech Ltd., a Bermuda corporation. At the same time, NHTSA informed Lamborghini that it would
proceed to consider the question of temporary exemption. Lamborghini supplemented its application on August 22,
1994. 

Lamborghini has manufactured only 1,475 motor vehicles over the past five years, approximately 25% of which have
been sold in the United States. Denial would therefore mean loss of the important U.S. market until compliance could
be achieved, an estimated 250 sales of 670 produced between January 1, 1995 and August 31, 1996. The applicant had operating
losses in 1993 of approximately $5,000,000, and in 1992 of approximately $28,000,000. For 1991 it had an operating
profit of almost $5,000,000. 

While it was owned by Chrysler, Lamborghini vehicles were scheduled to be modified during the last year of the phase-in
period which ends with vehicles produced on August 31, 1996, because of the low number of vehicles produced and the
lead time necessary for engineering and tooling modifications. Chrysler's sale of Lamborghini, therefore, has
placed the applicant in a difficult position since, before the sale, ``Lamborghini had a good faith basis for believing
that it would not need to meet the requirements of Standard 214 until the production year beginning September 1, 1996
* * *.'' Lamborghini was left without sufficient lead time to comply 100% of its production by either
September 1, 1994 or September 1, 1995, and, since it produces only a single model, cannot avail itself of the phase-in
requirement.

Accordingly, it has begun the preliminary work required to effect compliance in production vehicles manufactured
beginning July 1996. During that time, it estimates that it will spend between $500,000 and $900,000 on research,
development, and tooling changes. 

Lamborghini argued that an exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of motor vehicle
safety because it is ``one of the last small, pioneering and independent automobile manufacturers * * *
precisely the type of small manufacturer that the * * * temporary exemption authority is intended
to assist.'' Its vehicles ``are used predominantly for shorter pleasure, rather than commuting or longer, trips''
so that an exemption ``would have an imperceptible impact on motor vehicle safety.'' It points out that the livelihoods
of its workers in U.S. distributorships and dealerships would be affected by a denial. 

No comments were received on the application. 

The agency has reviewed Lamborghini's application. Given the fact that 25% of its sales over the past five years have
been in the U.S. market and that this is likely to be the case in the event an exemption is granted, it is manifest that
a denial until compliance with Standard No. 214 can be effected would cause the applicant substantial economic hardship
within the meaning of the statute. Indeed, Lamborghini has had to suspend production of its cars for the U.S. market
since September 1, 1994, and a present hardship already exists. Because of its previous relationship to Chrysler
for the purpose of compliance with the phase-in requirement, it had a good faith basis upon which to delay compliance
with Standard No. 214 until the end of the phase-in period, August 31, 1996. Although the company had net operating
losses of $5,000,000 in 1993, it is nevertheless prepared to spend an estimated $500,000 to $900,000 to achieve compliance
by July 1996. 

Furthermore, the estimated 250 cars that would be produced under an exemption are not a significant part of the nation's
vehicle fleet and, as the applicant argues, are generally not used in everyday driving. Presumably the company has
been meeting, and will continue to meet, the requirements of Standard No. 214 which continue in effect until the phase-in
period ends as of September 1, 1996. In this light, an exemption becomes one more of form than of substance. Lamborghini
has sold vehicles in the United States for the better part of 30 years and its, goodwill, dealers and service personnel
would be affected by its inability to continue business. 

In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship
to a company that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith, and that a temporary exemption is consistent with
the public interest and the objectives of motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, Automobili Lamborghini is hereby granted
NHTSA Exemption No. 94-6, expiring September 1, 1996, from 49 CFR 571.214 Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.

<DOCTITLE>General Motors Pickup Truck Defect Investigation </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Identification of information sought at public meeting.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 27, 1994, NHTSA published a notice that it will hold a public meeting on December 6, 1994 regarding the initial
decision by the Secretary of Transportation that certain pickup trucks manufactured by General Motors Corporation
(GM) with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails contain a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety. The purpose
of the meeting is to permit any interested person, including General Motors, to present relevant information to NHTSA
and the Secretary on the issue of whether a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety exists in these GM pickup trucks.
This supplemental notice identifies particular information that the Secretary believes could be useful in making
his final decision on whether to order a recall or to close the investigation.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 17, 1994, Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a announced his initial decision that model
year 1973-1991 full-sized GM pickup trucks and cab-chassis equipped with fuel tanks mounted outboard of the
frame rails contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety. At the same time, he released a comprehensive Engineering
Analysis (EA) Report that explains in detail the basis for the decision. A summary of that Report is set out in the 

Federal Register

 notice announcing that decision. 59 Fed. Reg. 54025 (October 27, 1994). 


The EA Report makes two fundamental findings. First, on the basis of statistical analysis, laboratory crash tests,
and a review of available information concerning specific real- world crashes, the EA Report demonstrates that the
GM pickups at issue exhibit an increased risk of fire in side-impact crashes compared to similar vehicles (specifically,
to contemporary Ford and Dodge full-sized pickups). Second, primarily on the basis of this increased risk and an analysis
of GM's actions (both at the time it designed the trucks and during the period they were in production), the Secretary
concluded that this increased risk is unreasonable. On the basis of these findings, and other supplementary information,
the Secretary made his initial decision that the GM pickups contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety. 
The Secretary also announced that, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.  30118 and 49 CFR 554.10, a public meeting will be held
on December 6, 1994, in order to afford GM and other interested persons an opportunity to present information, views,
and arguments on the issue of whether the vehicles covered by this initial decision contain a defect related to motor
vehicle safety. Following the public meeting, the Secretary will decide whether to order a recall of the vehicles
or to close the investigation. 
This defect investigation has raised many important and complex factual, legal, and public policy issues. Substantial
interest in those issues has been expressed by affected individuals, auto manufacturers, and members of the general
public. The Department believes that the December 6 public meeting will provide a valuable forum and opportunity
for both General Motors and the public to address these issues, either in support of or in opposition to the initial
decision. 
To assist in reaching a final decision, interested persons are requested to present relevant information and arguments
on issues raised by the investigation and in particular on the issues identified below. 


Issues Related to the Question of Increased Risk


1. Is there additional information supporting or rebutting the finding in the EA Report that the GM pickups exhibit
an increased risk of fire and fatalities/injuries due to fire in side-impact crashes? 
2. Is it appropriate in this investigation to focus only on side-impact crashes as opposed to other crash modes? What
is the most appropriate focus and why?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941117-2-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941117-2-00104 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Is it appropriate in this investigation to focus on fatal crashes, fatal crashes in which there was a fire, and/or
fatal crashes in which the fatalities are due to fire? Would other data provide a more appropriate basis for reaching
a decision on these issues? 
4. In ascertaining whether the design of the 1973-1987 GM pickups at issue here causes an increased risk of death
and injury in accidents, is it appropriate to compare those pickups to other contemporary pickups (i.e., 1973-1987
Ford full-sized pickups)? To what other vehicles, if any, should these GM pickups be compared? Please explain. 


Issues Related to the Question of Unreasonable Risk


1. What factors should be considered in determining whether the design of the GM vehicles creates an ``unreasonable
risk of death or injury'' due to post-crash fires? 
2. In materials submitted to NHTSA, GM presented a series of vehicle fire rate comparisons in an effort to demonstrate
that many other pairs of vehicles experience differences in the rate of fire-related fatalities that are greater
than the difference between GM and Ford pickups. Do vehicle pair rate comparisons provide an appropriate basis for
analyzing the issue of whether these vehicles present an unreasonable safety risk? If not, why not? If so, is the methodology
used by GM the best way to analyze the issue? Are there better comparative rate methodologies for evaluating the existence
of an unreasonable risk? 
3. Is the overall safety record of a vehicle relevant to the issue of unreasonable risk when the alleged defect relates
to a particular component or type of crash? If so, how relevant? 
4. Are the extent of a manufacturer's awareness of a potential or ongoing safety risk, and the extent of a manufacturer's
efforts to avoid that risk, relevant to the issue of whether an unreasonable risk exists? Is a manufacturer's failure
to implement measures to mitigate or eliminate an increased safety risk relevant to that issue? 
5. What weight should be given to the foregoing three factors, and any other relevant factors, in deciding whether
a vehicle contains a defect related to motor vehicle safety? 


Other Information Sought


1. Additional information concerning post-crash fires in real-world crashes involving the GM vehicles covered
by this investigation and comparable vehicles. 
2. Additional information regarding GM's awareness of an increased risk of post-crash fires due to the placement
of the fuel tanks outside of the frame rails of these trucks, both at the time of their design and afterward. 
3. Additional information regarding efforts by GM to eliminate or mitigate any safety risk associated with the location
of the fuel tanks in these vehicles, both at the time of their design and afterward. 
4. Information regarding what remedy or remedies would be appropriate if the vehicles in question are finally determined
to have a defect related to motor vehicle safety. 
As stated in the October 27 notice, persons wishing to make oral presentations are requested to notify Ms. Judy Taylor,
Office of Defects Investigation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5326, 400 Seventh Street
SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366-2850, before the close of business on November 28, 1994. Written comments
may be submitted to the same address and must be received not later than the beginning of the meeting on December 6, 1994.

Because many people may be coming from other cities to appear at the public meeting, NHTSA intends to give each person
who wishes to appear a reasonably precise idea of the day and time for his or her presentation. Therefore, the agency
urges persons desiring to appear to notify Ms. Taylor as soon as possible in order to properly organize the meeting.
Depending upon the number of persons who wish to appear, NHTSA may have to limit the time for each person's presentation
or arrange for group appearances.

 The Treasury Department is issuing a comprehensive list of all blocked persons and specially designated nationals
under the various sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control as of [insert date of filing],
to enhance public awareness of these persons and to facilitate compliance with the applicable prohibitions on dealing
in property in which these persons have an interest. This list includes designations pursuant to 31 CFR parts 500,
515, 550, 575, and 585.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Electronic Availability


This document is available as an electronic file on 

The Federal Bulletin Board

 the day of publication in the 

Federal Register

. By modem dial 202/512-1387 or call 202/512-1530 for disks or paper copies. This file is available in Postscript,
WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII.


Background


The following list contains the names of entities and individuals that the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets
Control has determined, as of November 14, 1994, to be (1) component agencies of a government subject to sanctions,
or, depending on the program subjecting them to sanctions, (2) organized or located in a country subject to economic
sanctions, (3) owned and controlled by persons that are organized or located in, or are nationals of, a country subject
to economic sanctions, or (4) owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf
of, the government of a country subject to economic sanctions. The listed specially designated nationals and blocked
persons relate to sanctions imposed against Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro). The list also includes the names of vessels determined to be the property of blocked persons.
The entities and individuals included in the list are subject to all prohibitions applicable to the government of
the country subject to economic sanctions with which they are associated. ``Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction,''
or ``U.S. persons,'' depending on the sanctions program, are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving
property in which any of these entities and individuals has an interest unless the transactions are exempted by statute
or licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Additionally, all assets within U.S. jurisdiction owned or controlled
by these entities and individuals are blocked and may not be transferred, withdrawn, exported or otherwise dealt
with. Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, or U.S. persons, are not prohibited, however, from paying funds owed
to any of these entities and individuals into a blocked account held in the name of the blocked entity or individual
in a domestic U.S. financial institution. Such payments must be reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control,
Compliance Division, pursuant to applicable regulations.
Determinations that persons are blocked or specially designated nationals under a particular sanctions program
are effective upon the date of determination by the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC''), acting
under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice of a blocking or designation is effective
upon the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 or upon prior actual notice. This list is not definitive or all-inclusive, and new 

Federal Register

 notices with regard to specially designated nationals or blocked persons may be published at any time. The absence
of any particular person from the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons is not to be construed
as evidence that the person is not a component agency of a government subject to sanctions; or organized or located
in a country subject to economic sanctions; or owned and controlled by persons that are organized or located in, or
are nationals of, a country subject to economic sanctions; or owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act
directly or indirectly on behalf of, the government of a country subject to economic sanctions. The Treasury Department
regards it as incumbent upon all U.S. persons or persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, depending upon the sanctions
program, to take reasonable steps to ascertain for themselves whether persons with whom they enter into transactions
fall into one of these categories.
A listing of citations to previous 

Federal Register

 notices and rules through November 14, 1994 is included at the conclusion of this notice. Users are advised to check
the 

Federal Register

 and 

The Federal Bulletin Board

 routinely for additional names or other changes to the listings. Entities and individuals on the list are occasionally
licensed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control to transact business with U.S. persons or persons subject to U.S.
jurisdiction in anticipation of removal from the list or because of foreign policy considerations in unique circumstances.
Current information on licenses issued with regard to blocked persons or specially designated nationals may be obtained
by calling the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Licensing Division (202/622-2480).

<DOCTITLE>The Edmund S. Muskie Fellowship Program; Request for Proposals</DOCTITLE>




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Academic Programs, Academic Exchanges Division, European Branch of the United States Information
Agency's Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs announces opportunities for regionally and professionally accredited
U.S. institutions offering degree and executive education programs at the master's level in business administration,
economics, law, or public administration, to host graduate students from Armenia, Azerbaijan* (see program overview
below), Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Ukraine, or Uzbekistan for one- or two-year, degree, certificate, or professional development programs under the
auspices of the 1995 Edmund S. Muskie Fellowship Program. Priority will be given to institutions which can provide
academic guidance and professional development support to Fellows and which have experience working with international
students. Institutions which are approved to host 1995 Edmund S. Muskie Fellows will automatically be eligible to
host 1995 Freedom Support Act (FSA) Graduate Fellows in the same disciplines.



Current Host Campuses



U.S. institutions currently hosting 1993 and/or 1994 Muskie Fellows in degree, certificate, or professional development
programs that wish to receive Fellows again in 1995 in the 

same 

fields of study will not be required to complete the institutional application 

providing the 1995 academic program, support services, and cost-sharing level remain consistent with these 1994
programs. 

Current host institutions must demonstrate intent to receive 1995 Muskie Fellows in the same field(s) through a separate
renewal process outlined below.

Institutions which were approved to host Edmund S. Muskie Fellows through the 1993 or 1994 competitions but which
actually hosted only Freedom Support Act (FSA) Graduate Fellows may submit renewal requests as detailed below.

Current host institutions that wish to host Fellows in a different academic field must submit a full application to

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Edmund S. Muskie Program is administered by USIA through cooperative agreements to the following organizations:
The American Council of Teachers of Russian/American Council for Collaboration in Education and Language Study
(ACTR/ACCELS), the Institute of International Education (IIE), the International Research & Exchanges Board
(IREX), and the Soros Foundations. Under these agreements ACTR/ACCELS, IIE, IREX, and the Soros Foundation are responsible
for the recruitment, selection, academic placement, and monitoring of Fellows.




Please Note: The Edmund S. Muskie Fellowship Program is not intended as a precursor to doctoral studies in the United
States. At the end of their designated academic and internship programs, Fellows are required to return to their home
countries to fulfill the two-year home residency requirement as specified in the Exchange Visitor (J-Visa) regulations.
ACTR, IREX, Soros, and IIE will not approve the transfer of visa sponsorship to universities or the extension of visas
for the purpose of Ph.D. programs or other additional academic study.
Overall authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended
Public Law 87-256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the United States
to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of other countries by means of
educational and cultural exchange, to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the
educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other
nations * * * and thus assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic, and peaceful relations
between the United States and other countries of the world.'' Pursuant to the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs
authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative
of the diversity of the American political, social and cultural life. Programs shall also ``maintain their scholarly
integrity and shall meet the highest standards of academic excellence or artistic achivement.''


Program Overview


The Edmund S. Muskie Program was established in Fiscal Year 1992 to promote democratic and economic development in
Armenia, Azerbaijan,* Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian
Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. It is an academic program providing graduate level
instruction at the master's level in business administration, economics, law, and public administration along
with exposure to the concepts of market economics and democratic principles. A professional affiliation experience
and networking opportunities are major program components.

*Please note: 

Programs with Azerbaijan are subject to restrictions of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act: Employees of the government
of Azerbaijan or any of its instrumentalities are excluded from participation, and no U.S. participant overseas
may work for the Government of Azerbijan or any of its instrumentalities. In addition, the Government of Azerbijan
or any of its instrumentalities will have no control in the actual selection of participants.




Fellows are identified through a merit-based, open competition and a rigorous selection process implemented by
ACTR/ACCELS, IIE, IREX, and the Soros Foundation, in conjunction with USIA, professional associations, and U.S.
faculty from the four academic fields. Semi-finalists in all disciplines will take the Test of English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL). Candidates for degree programs in business administration will take the Graduate Management
Admission Test (GMAT), and candidates for degree programs in economics will take the Graduate Record Examination
(GRE). Candidates for the law program must have an undergraduate law degree from their home country. Fellows are matched
with universities by selection committees composed of graduate admissions officers and faculty in the appropriate
disciplines. Placements are determined according to Fellows' academic interests and needs. Fellows may not choose
their own academic placements.

To be eligible for a Muskie Fellowship, applicants must be citizens of one of the fifteen countries targeted by the
Program, have successfully completed an undergraduate program, be proficient in spoken and written English at the
time of application, demonstrate professional aptitude and leadership potential in the field of specialization,
and be under the age of 40. Applicants for professional development programs must have a minimum of three years relevant
work experience in addition to an undergraduate degree. To be eligible for awards in law candidates must have received
an undergraduate diploma in law. Individuals currently enrolled in academic programs in the U.S., persons working
or earning a living in the United States, spouses of U.S. citizens, or individuals who have applied for an immigrant
visa or political asylum to any country are not eligible for the Muskie Program. Muskie Fellows under the terms of the
grant and under the laws governing the student visa required for participation in the Program, must return to their
home country for a period of a least two years immediately upon completion of the academic program and internship.
Visa sponsorship will not be transferred to universities or other sponsors and visas will not be extended for the purpose
of pursuing doctoral or other additional studies in the United States.

No financial support or provision is made for Fellows' dependents under the Muskie Program.
Muskie Fellows receive scholarships for international transportation, domestic transportation within the United
States, stipend, health insurance, full or partial tuition, room/board, and other expenses.

Fellows who receive TOEFL scores below 550 will enroll in courses of English as a Second Language (ESL) in summer 1995.
Whenever possible, Fellows who receive TOEFL scores above 550 will take part in summer pre-academic programs prior
to arrival at their host universities.
Currently 136 students are enrolled at U.S. institutions under the auspices of the 1994 Muskie Program. Approximately
140 Fellows will be selected for participation in the 1995 Muskie Program.



Program Guidelines


The Muskie Fellowship comprises the degree, certificate, and professional development programs outlined below.
Fellows will enter U.S. graduate studies in the 1995 fall semester.


Degree and Certificate Programs


In general, Fellows with degree awards in business administration and economics should take part in two-year academic
programs leading to the degree of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) or Master of Arts (MA), respectively.
Internships should take place during the summer between the first and second years of study. All programs in law must
lead to the Master of Laws (LLM) degree. Fellows with awards in law generally participate in nine-month LLM programs
followed by a three-month internship; however, longer LLM programs are also admissible. Fellows with degree awards
in public administration should take part in one- or two-year programs leading to the Masters of Public Administration
(MPA) or Master of Arts (MA) degree. In some cases, certificates may be awarded instead of degrees. Three-month internships
should take place during the summer of 1996, after one year or academic study.


Professional Development Programs


The Professional Development awards are specifically designed for mid-career professionals with at least three
years substantive work experience prior to application. These non-degree programs in business administration,
economics, and public administration generally include two semesters of tailored academic study at the mater's
level, followed by up to six months of practical training. The law program for mid-career professionals should lead
to the LLM degree with up to six months of practical training after the period of academic study.


Program Requirements and Review Criteria


U.S. institutions may apply to receive Fellows individually or in groups of two to ten people representing one or any
combination of the four disciplines. Host institutions for 1995 Muskie Fellows will be selected by ACTR/ACCELS,
IIE, IREX, the Soros Foundation, and USIA, based on the following criteria:

a. Strength of academic program_Academic rigor and demonstrated capacity to meet participant needs.

b. Track record_Expericence working with and providing a full range of support services for international students.
Recognition of and compliance with the intent, rules, and regulations governing the Muskie Program.
c. Professional support_Ability to facilitate professional affiliations and internships.

d. Academic support_Capacity to assign a faculty advisor and a Muskie Program coordinator to provide academic guidance,
logistical support, and assistance in arranging enrichment activities.
e. Cost-effectiveness_Ability to provide a high quality program for lowest costs. A key measure of cost-effectiveness
is the host institution's program cost per Fellow. The Agency also reviews the ratio of cost-sharing to program costs
exhibited through such means as tuition scholarships, fellowships, or reduced room and board expenses.

f. Geographic diversity_The Agency Seeks to achieve maximum geographic diversity in the selection of host institutions.

g. Evaluation plan_Proposals should outline methods for monitoring the academic progress and integration of Fellows
in the campus and community.

h. Adherence of proposed activities to the criteria outlined above and the goals of the Edmund S. Muskie Fellowship
Program.
Institutions receiving two or more Fellows are encouraged to provide commensurate cost-sharing for such groups.
The academic interests and professional needs of candidates selected as Fellows will be considered in the final designation
of U.S. host institutions.
Proposals must be submitted to ACTR/ACCELS, IIE, IREX, or the Soros Foundations, according to discipline and type
of program (degree, certificate, or professional development), as indicated above.

Renewal Process for Current Host Institutions


Institutions currently hosting Edmund S. Muskie Fellows under the 1993 and/or 1994 Programs are eligible to submit
a renewal application. U.S. institutions currently hosting 1993 or 1994 Freedom Support Act Fellows that applied
to and were approved by the 1993 or 1994 Muskie university competitions are also eligible to submit a renewal application.
In order to apply to host Fellows in the same field(s), universities must submit a letter confirming that the academic
program, professional and enrichment support, and adherence to other grant requirements will, at a minimum, remain
consistent with current levels. The letter must also indicate the desired number of Fellows to be hosted, the type
of program in which they will be placed (degree, certificate, or professional development), the name of the Muskie
coordinator, the 1995-96 academic calendar, and the amount of cost-sharing provided for each Fellow, adjusted
as needed for 1995-96 costs. Current host institutions need to contact the appropriate contract organization
(ACTR/ACCELS, IREX, Soros or IIE) to receive the required budget worksheet that must be submitted along with the letter.
Original letters must be received by the appropriate contact organization by January 31, 1995.





Please Note: 

Those institutions currently hosting 

only 

Freedom Support Act Graduate Fellows and which were not approved through either the 1993 or 1994 Muskie university
competition must submit a complete application to be considered to host 1995 Muskie Fellows.


Agency Cost Sharing Guidelines


U.S. institutions hosting Muskie Fellows are strongly encouraged to provide cost-sharing toward tuition and/or
room and board expenses, so that greater numbers of students may take part in the program. Cost-sharing may also be
in the form of direct program and participant costs. Indirect and administrative costs will not be considered allowable
cost-sharing items, nor will these costs be covered by the Muskie Program. The basis for determining the value of cash
and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110 (Revised), Subpart C.23_Cost-Sharing
and Matching and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide the minimum amount
of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution.
Preference will be given to institutions that provide cost-sharing on 

direct participant costs. 

While the Agency strongly encourages cost-sharing, it is not a requirement. Institutions unable to offer cost-sharing
are eligible to apply.
