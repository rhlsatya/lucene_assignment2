Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt
& Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of
certain front compressor fan hubs and shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius. This action would reduce
the initial inspection interval for front compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft,
establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture installed in a Boeing 737 aircraft that resulted in the release of
fan blades and portions of the hub outer rim. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fracture
of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Discussion 



On July 15, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Airworthiness Directive (AD) 93-14-14,
Amendment 39-8638 (58 FR 39644, July 26, 1993), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan
engines, to require initial and repetitive inspections for cracks, and removal from service, if necessary, of certain
front compressor fan hubs. Front compressor fan hubs installed on engines in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft
must be inspected according to a more aggressive schedule than other installations. In addition, that AD requires
shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius area of hubs that pass the inspections. That action was prompted
by reports of two front compressor fan hub fractures on engines operating in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft.
That condition, if not corrected, could result in a fracture of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an
uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. 

Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture on a PW JT8D engine
installed on a Boeing 737 aircraft. The examination of the failed hardware revealed the failure mechanism to be identical
to that described in AD 93-14-14. The analysis conducted for that AD concluded that the vibratory stress
environment that caused fan hub fractures was the most severe for engines installed in the No. 2 position on Boeing
727 aircraft. Therefore, the FAA addressed this population in a more aggressive manner than engines installed in
other aircraft, or in the No. 1 or No. 3 position on Boeing 727 aircraft. The FAA determined that a similar, but less severe
stress environment existed in engines installed in other aircraft or positions other than the No. 2 position in the
Boeing 727 aircraft, and inspection and shotpeening requirements were specified for these engines in AD 93-14-14.
Since the failure of the fan hub installed in the Boeing 737 aircraft, the FAA has reassessed the risk analysis for all
installations and determined that the predicted risk level should be reduced. Therefore, the FAA proposes to supersede
AD 93-14-14 with a reduced initial fan hub inspection requirement for engines installed in all positions
of all applicable aircraft, by requiring engines removed from the Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position to adhere to the
Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position inspection requirements, and by establishing a compliance end-date. 


The FAA has received comments from operators that the wording of paragraph (b)(4) of AD 93-14-14 is confusing.
The FAA has revised the wording to emphasize that the repetitive inspection is required at the next opportunity when
the front compressor fan hub is accessible at the detail level in the shop only after accumulating 2,500 additional
cycles in service (CIS) since the last inspection. 

In addition, the FAA has revised the wording in paragraph (d) that defines a shop visit as an engine removal for engine
maintenance that cannot be performed while installed in the aircraft. 

Since publication of AD 93-14-14, PW has issued Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6104, Revision 3, dated
June 16, 1994, that describes the reduced initial inspection intervals for the applicable engine installations.


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93-14-14 to reduce the initial inspection interval for front
compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft, revise the compliance requirements for
repositioned engines, establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements.


The FAA estimates that 1475 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry and 690 domestic uninstalled engines would
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 12 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,428,900. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

Operating Permits Program Rule Revisions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency, (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period for proposal to revise the operating permits program regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On August 29, 1994, EPA proposed in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44460) revisions to the operating permits regulations in part 70 of chapter I of title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations. The comment period provided in that notice was 90 days, closing on November 28, 1994. Today's action
extends that comment period an additional 45 days until January 12, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Part 70 contains regulations requiring States to develop, and submit to EPA for approval, programs for issuing operating
permits to major, and certain other, stationary sources of air pollution. The minimum elements of operating permits
programs are contained in part 70 which was promulgated on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32250).




Subsequent to promulgation of part 70, nearly 20 entities, including State and local governments, environmental
groups, and industry associations, petitioned for judicial review of the part 70 regulations. One of the key aspects
of the litigation and of an operating permits program is the system for revising permits to incorporate changes at
permitted sources. 

Several requests for an extension of the comment period on the proposal notice have been received to allow time for
preparation of comments primarily on how to fashion a more workable permit revision system. Because of the complexity
of the proposed revisions, potential commenters assert that the 90-comment period provided is not long enough to
prepare comprehensive comments on the permit revision system as well as all the other proposed revisions. An additional
45 days is therefore being provided for development and submittal of comments.

Significant New Uses of Lead; Extension of Comment Period 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is extending the comment period for an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) for significant new uses of
lead issued under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Significant new use rules for lead would
require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of lead and
lead compounds for uses identified by the Agency as significant new uses. The ANPR was published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 28, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49484), EPA published an ANPR for significant new uses of lead issued under section 5(a)(2)
of TSCA. Significant new use rules for lead would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the
manufacture, import, or processing of lead and lead compounds for uses identified by the Agency as significant new
uses. 


EPA issued this ANPR to: (1) Communicate its intention to regulate significant new uses of elemental lead and lead
compounds; (2) identify components of its proposed regulatory approach; (3) request comment on issues related to
this approach; and (4) request comment and information on existing uses of lead that would help support EPA's selection
of proposed criteria for defining significant new uses of lead. Written comments on the ANPR were to be received on
or before November 28, 1994. 
EPA has received several requests from trade associations seeking a 60-day extension of the public comment
period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information requested in the ANPR. EPA believes that
providing an additional 60-day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. The Agency, therefore, is
extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written
and electronic comments submitted in response to the ANPR must be received on or before January 27, 1995.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice responds to a notice of request for comments that NHTSA published in 1993 implementing the grant of a petition
by Robert Bosch GmbH. It proposes an amendment to the Federal motor vehicle standard on lighting that would permit
replaceable lenses on integral beam and replaceable bulb headlamps that incorporate on-board headlamp aimers,
provided that such headlamps meet more rigorous environmental tests. The benefit of headlamps with replaceable
lenses is that the lens or reflector could be replaced in the event of breakage of either without the present necessity
to replace both components if only one is damaged.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 12, 1993, NHTSA published a Notice of Request for Comments in implementation of a grant of a petition for rulemaking
submitted by Robert Bosch GmbH (58 FR 42924). The notice sought views relevant to a decision on whether to proceed with
rulemaking to amend Standard No. 108 to allow the lens to be replaceable on a replaceable bulb headlamp equipped with
an on-vehicle aiming device. In addition to comments on the five benefits ascribed by Bosch to replaceable lens headlamps,
NHTSA asked for comments on fifteen relevant issues. The reader is referred to the notice for further information.



Comments were submitted by 21 interested persons: Advocates for Highway Safety (Advocates), American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), American Honda, Fiat Auto R&D USA, Ford Motor Company, General Electric
Worldwide Automotive Lighting (GE), General Motors Corp. (GM), Hella KG Hueck & Co., KC Hilites, Koito Manufacturing
Co. Inc., Oscar Lidstrom, Jr., Maine Bureau of Highway Safety, Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, Mercedes-Benz
of North America, Osram Sylvania, Inc., PACCAR, Inc., Stanley Electric Co. Ltd., Virginia State Police, Volkswagen
of North America (on behalf of itself and Audi), Volvo of North America, and J. L. Witt. The concept of replaceable lenses
for certain headlamps was opposed by three commenters: Advocates, GE, and KC Hilites. Six others expressed reservations:
AAMA, GM, Maine, Massachusetts, Stanley, and Koito. The remaining 12 commenters either actively supported the concept
or submitted comments that did not indicate opposition to it. Where appropriate, these comments are mentioned in
the discussion of issues that follows. 
NHTSA's evaluation of the comments that were submitted has synthesized agency concerns into three issues: the photometric
performance of headlamps after relensing, the durability performance of headlamps before and after relensing,
and the economic benefits to the consumer of replaceable lens headlamps. 


Photometric Performance of Headlamps After Relensing 


The first issue of concern is whether a headlamp with a replaceable lens will provide photometric performance equivalent
to a headlamp using the original lens. NHTSA had previously denied two petitions (from GM and BMW of North America)
for replaceable lens headlamps, principally from concern for potential aiming problems and corroded reflectors.

The potential for misaim has two bases. The first is relevant to mechanically aimable headlamps, which have three
alignment pads on the lens to orient alignment tools. Some designs use pads ground to the individual characteristics
of each reflector/lens assembly. This creates lamp-to-lamp differences in lenses, irrelevant when the lens is permanently
attached to the reflector assembly, but of possible concern when lenses may be replaced. Even in designs without custom
ground pads, continuation of proper aim is dependent upon the repeatability of the attachment of the lens to the reflector.
Small differences in fit or gasket crush could modify the interaction between the reflector and the lens and thereby
reorient the aiming pads. 
The aiming pad issue does not arise under the Bosch petition because it includes only headlamps with on-board aiming
devices, which aim the reflector without reference to the lens. Bosch provided data from photometric tests demonstrating
that, absent the aiming pad considerations, headlamp photometry was insensitive to lens replacement. The illumination
at required test points produced by the test reflector and bulb was nearly identical in each test, using five replaceable
lenses with different production dates. The differences between lenses of the same part number and any variations
in lens alignment due to repeated replacement had no apparent effect on the photometric performance of the combination
of new components.

Advocates had criticized the minimum ``above-horizontal'' illumination requirements established by the agency
for 1994 and newer model vehicle headlamps as providing poorer performance than that of sealed beam headlamps. It
opposed lens replacement on the basis of a potential for a further reduction in ``above-horizontal'' illumination
which it believed would result from deviations in lens alignment during replacement. The Bosch data should allay
Advocates' concern, as should a comment by Osram Sylvania that headlamp photometry is not sensitive to the slight
misalignments possible during lens replacement. Although Osram Sylvania had other criticisms of replaceable lenses,
it reported that common design practices for replaceable bulb headlamps limit the sensitivity of photometric performance
to lens misalignment and that replacement lenses need not be identical to original lenses to maintain equivalent
photometric performance. 

In summary, comments and data submitted to the docket are persuasive that photometric performance of new lamps is
not sensitive to typical production variations of replacement lenses. For the reasons expressed above, it appears
that headlamps with on-vehicle aiming and replaceable lenses are equivalent in photometric performance to headlamps
with on-vehicle aiming and bonded lenses. 


Durability Performance of Headlamps Before and After Relensing 


For new headlamps, Standard No. 108's tests for dust penetration, corrosion, humidity, vibration, and water sealing
should assure that headlamps with replaceable lenses will have a lens-to-reflector sealing that is equivalent to
the protection provided by headlamps with bonded lens/reflector assemblies. However, if the reflector of a headlamp
is affected by exposure during the period when the vehicle is operated with a broken lens or by improper cleaning attempts
during relensing, there is a strong possibility that an owner may continue to use the unit after relensing without
being aware of its degraded performance. Less than half of all states have periodic vehicle inspection, and those
that do differ in their rigor. Thus, inspection programs cannot be expected to detect the decreased photometric performance
of headlamps with degraded reflectors. The second potential problem is that the lens-seal integrity could be lost
during relensing, and that an otherwise good reflector would be subject to moisture and dust for the remaining life
of the vehicle. 

Reflector degradation was not a concern before 1983 when replaceable bulb headlamps were allowed. In a sealed beam
lamp, a crack in the lens large enough to admit moisture would cause the filament to fail, necessitating the replacement
of the entire headlamp. However, replaceable bulb headlamps can continue to operate despite a broken lens, and the
possibility of degraded reflectors was considered by the agency during the course of rulemaking that allowed them.
The requirement for a bonded lens was motivated in part by NHTSA's desire to avoid creating a potential safety problem
that had been impossible when Standard No. 108 allowed only sealed beam headlamps. It is a conservative requirement
that results in the replacement of reflectors when the condition of the lens indicates possible long term exposure
of the reflector to water and dirt. Even a small hole can cause the headlamp to fill with water due to condensation during
the heating and cooling cycle of lamp use. 

A potential safety disadvantage of the bonded lens requirement is that the cost of replacing a headlamp rather than
a lens may tend to delay or to discourage repair altogether. However, the desire to maintain the aesthetic quality
of a newer vehicle and the obvious performance problem of a cracked lamp containing moisture should motivate many
owners to make a replacement, even if costly. A more powerful motivation is provided by the vehicle inspection programs
maintained by less than half of the states. Typically, the states inspect for aim and for damaged lenses, and in some
instances inspect replaceable bulbs for maximum power to prevent the use of high powered ``off road'' aftermarket
bulbs. But even strict states, such as Virginia, do not inspect for the low light output that would identify headlamps
with degraded reflectors. Many commenters who favored the concept of replaceable lenses voiced concerns about the
potential loss of performance of relensed units. AAMA suggested replaceable lenses for integral beam headlamps
as well as for those with replaceable bulbs, but it commented that any rulemaking allowing replaceable lenses must
assure that reflectors are designed to be more resistant to abrasion and solvents, with special durability and environmental
qualification requirements added. American Honda was concerned about technical problems which may exist in ensuring
that photometric performance is equal to the level of performance before the lens was damaged, and ensuring adequate
sealing against dust and moisture after the lens alone is replaced. GE commented that the average consumer or automotive
mechanic does not have the background and understanding to make the decisions necessary to determine if a headlamp
is safely repairable. Osram Sylvania agreed with the Bosch petition that reflector surfaces can be cleaned during
lens replacement, but it cautioned that the reflector can be damaged by improper cleaning and handling. It also advised
that the touch of human hands can deposit skin oil on the reflector with the possible consequences of reflector fogging,
reduced output and increased glare. It further commented that the lens replacement process could break the sealing
coat, protecting the thin aluminum coating on the reflector from moisture, which could lead to a very rapid loss of
reflecting area and photometric performance. 

Volkswagen's comments also responded to questions about performance loss of relensed lamps. It suggested that only
specially trained dealer service personnel should install lenses, presumably refusing to relens degraded lamps,
and that state inspections should monitor the condition of reflectors. These steps may be feasible in Europe where
reflector corrosion, at least in older designs, is a problem requiring universal inspection and where the manufacturers
control the replacement lens supply. But they are not effective in the United States. Less than half the States have
inspections, and those that do are not required to cover the condition of the reflector because it was never a concern
during the long era in which sealed beams were the only type of headlamps allowed. Also, the U.S. aftermarket would
not be limited to OEM lenses (conferring on dealers the power to refuse to repair degraded lamps) because non-OEM manufacturers
would be free to manufacture components and sell them directly to vehicle owners.

Volkswagen and American Honda commented that replaceable 
lens headlamps could be designed to require removal of the 
headlamp from the vehicle in order to replace the lens. This 
would have the effect, desirable to the commenters, of causing 
owners to rely on the vehicle manufacturer's dealers for lens 
replacement. However, causing lens replacement to be more 
expensive and less convenient diminishes the prospect of greater 
headlamp maintenance in states without inspection. Further, 
owners compelled by state inspection to replace parts often 
insist on making their own repairs to minimize their burden. 
Making the task unnecessarily complex only increases the chances 
that the owner will make a poor repair. In the case of HID 
integral beam headlamps, easy removal of the lens without 
disturbing the other components may reduce high voltage hazards 
during owner repairs. The better solution, suggested by the AAMA 
and others, is to adopt durability and environmental requirements 
for replaceable lens headlamps to increase the likelihood that 
relensed headlamps will perform satisfactorily regardless of who 
services them. This solution minimizes the potential loss of 
performance from degraded reflectors and maximizes the potential 
for inexpensive voluntary lens repairs in states without 
inspections. 

The most detailed comments to the question of reflector 
durability were those of Ford Motor Company. They contain a 
comprehensive statement of the reflector durability problem and 
some general guidance concerning appropriate test procedures. 
Ford commented:

 


Replaceable bulb headlamps currently incorporate reflective 
surfaces not specifically designed to withstand direct 
environmental exposure or abrasion. If the condition 
prompting replacement of a lens has resulted in 
contamination or discoloration of the reflector surface 
(e.g., as might occur due to a lens crack or loss of 
integrity of the lens/reflector seal), a degradation in 
photometric performance would be expected, as compared to a 
new replacement headlamp. Attempts to clean a contaminated 
reflector, as by wiping, could result in abrasion to the 
metallized surface, possibly resulting in degraded 
photometric performance and/or increased glare. Ford 
therefore recommends that rulemaking on replaceable lens 
headlamps consider the need for the reflective surfaces of 
replaceable lens headlamps to withstand appropriate 
environmental exposure and cleaning operations.




Ford's recommendations were: 





Ford recommends that headlamps with replaceable lenses, in 
addition to present requirements applicable to replaceable 
bulb headlamps, be subjected to salt-fog, moisture and dust 
exposure without the lens in place. Additionally, the 
reflector surface should be capable of withstanding 
resistance to chemicals that are likely to be used by 
consumers or repair facilities to clean contaminated 
reflector surfaces. Subsequent to appropriate environmental 
and chemical exposure, the reflector should be cleaned 
according to a prescribed procedure. When fitted with a 
lens following exposure and cleaning, the headlamp should be 
capable of meeting the same photometric requirements 
applicable to replaceable bulb headlamps with bonded lenses. 
Aftermarket lens manufacturers should be required to certify 
that any headlamp for which the lens is intended is capable 
of meeting photometric requirements when fitted with a lens 
of that design. Additionally, aftermarket replacement 
lenses should be accompanied with complete instructions for 
properly removing the old lens, cleaning the interior of the 
headlamp body, cleaning and preparing the mating surface on 
the headlamp body and installing the new lens on the 
headlamp body.

 


The durability and environmental requirements for the 
present replaceable bulb headlamps and the deliberations that led 
to them may be useful in considering reasonable requirements for 
the reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps. When the agency 
amended Standard No. 108 to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, it 
was aware that German vehicle inspection data showed significant 
rejections due to dull, corroded and damaged headlamp reflectors. 
Thus, NHTSA promulgated an appropriate test of corrosion 
resistance for replaceable bulb headlamps for use in the United 
States. The lamp assembly must be exposed for ten days in a salt 
spray chamber, with the additional requirement than the bulb be 
removed and the spray deactivated during the last hour of all but 
two test days. The test put a premium on the ability of the lens 
to protect the reflector from the salt spray. It also required a 
degree of direct corrosion resistance exceeding the performance 
of some European headlamps by having the lamps exposed to several 
hours of salty air in the chamber without direct spray. In its 
original form, the rule required that the headlamp pass the 
photometric test at the completion of the corrosion test. The 
post-exposure photometric test was later eliminated because of 
the possibility of salt deposits that could not be removed easily 
from a headlamp with a bonded lens.

A corrosion test of increased rigor for reflectors of 
replaceable lens headlamps would remove much of the safety 
concern about relensing lamps that have become contaminated with 
dust and moisture. The agency is proposing a specific 
environmental test for reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps 
which it believes is consistent with Ford's recommendations while 
imposing minimum testing burdens. NHTSA is proposing an 
additional salt spray test with the following features for new 
replaceable lens headlamps: (a) A 24 hour exposure to salt spray 
with the lens removed, (b) a 48 hour drying period, (c) cleaning of 
the reflector according to instructions to be furnished with 
replacement lenses and included in the owner's manual, (d) a non-magnified examination for corrosion, and (e) a photometric
test of 
the headlamp as reassembled with a new lens. The proposed 
exposed reflector test mimics the existing test of headlamps with 
lenses but with a much reduced duration since reflector exposure 
in service would not be continuous. However, it makes use of the 
expected salt deposit formation to test the durability of the 
reflector coating to cleaning. Finally, it would require the 
manufacturer of a headlamp with a replaceable lens to demonstrate 
photometric compliance of the reassembled cleansed lamp. 

Ford recommended three distinct tests of headlamp reflector 
exposure to salt-fog, moisture, and dust, while the agency 
proposes a single test. Comment from parties familiar with 
reflector construction and exposure testing is sought. The 
following questions are of particular interest: 

(1) A cracked lens frequently causes a headlamp to partially 
fill with water. Is the moisture and exposure time involved in 
an ASTM B 117-73 salt spray test sufficient to test moisture 
resistance of reflectors? If not, what test would be sufficient? 

(2) The present dust test for replaceable bulb headlamps 
uses Portland cement as dust, and the agency presumes that Ford's 
comment refers to the same kind of dust test. Cleaning the 
reflector after Portland cement dust exposure may be equivalent 
to a rigorous abrasion test. The agency believes that the 
proposed salt-spay test will coat the headlamp reflector with 
salt deposits and that the subsequent cleaning will provide an 
adequate abrasion test. However, does a 24-hour salt spray test 
deposit enough salt to act as a de facto abrasion test? Should a 
particular method of salt removal be required or should the 
manufacturers' cleaning instructions dictate the test procedure, 
as proposed? Is a Portland cement dust test as well as a salt 
spray test of reflectors needed, and if so, why? Should a direct 
abrasion test be used rather than the indirect abrasion of 
cleaning, and if so, what procedure would be appropriate? 

(3) Is the proposed 24-hour salt spray test followed by 48 
hours drying time sufficient to test the headlamp reflectors and 
the metal light shields sometimes used? What corrosion criteria 
are appropriate for light shields? Can rusty water dripping from 
metal light shields eventually cause otherwise durable headlamp 
reflectors to fail because of stains? 

(4) The present standard for replaceable bulb headlamps 
exposes lamp assemblies with the bulb removed (but the lens 
attached) for eight hours to humid salty air in a salt spray 
chamber with the salt spray turned off. Is this present test 
(followed by a photometric test and whatever cleaning is 
necessary) sufficient to qualify headlamp reflectors for use with 
replaceable lenses without the proposed direct salt spray test or 
the moisture, dust and salt spray tests recommended by Ford? 

The existing Standard No. 108 also includes a chemical 
resistance test of the exterior of the lamp to fuel, tar remover, 
power steering fluid and antifreeze. NHTSA has tentatively 
concluded that the test should be extended to headlamp reflectors 
using chemicals suggested by the manufacturer in the cleaning 
instructions or with a realistic probability of use by vehicle 
owners despite the manufacturer's instructions. Chemicals in the 
latter category would include tar remover, lacquer thinner and 
mineral spirits. The manufacturer's instructions may concentrate 
on water soluble contaminants because of the salt spray test. 
The inclusion of the other chemicals gives the owner a means to 
remove organic contaminants without resorting to abrasion. Since 
mineral spirits is a major constituent of tar remover, a separate 
test for mineral spirits appears unnecessary. 

The plastic lenses on replaceable bulb headlamps 
manufactured for use in the United States are given a hard 
protective coating that would be expected to exceed the reflector 
coating requirements established by the proposed tests. NHTSA 
expects that similar coating methods could be used to create 
robust reflectors for replaceable lens headlamps. It would be 
reasonable to expect successful lens replacement by vehicle 
owners, especially if the lens attachments were designed to be 
accessible without disturbing the headlamp aim. The requirement 
for headlamp reflector durability also reduces concern about 
untrained persons installing the lens seal. Should an owner 
install the seal incorrectly, causing moisture to collect inside 
the lamp, the reflector will not degrade quickly. The visible 
moisture would serve as a telltale, and an owner motivated to 
replace the lens initially would be motivated to disassemble, 
clean and reinstall the lens until the desired repair was 
successful. If manufacturers choose to design headlamps for ease 
and economy of lens replacement by owners, the prospect of better 
lamp maintenance in non-inspection States is realistic. 



Economic Benefits to the Consumer of Replaceable Lenses

The cost to replace two replaceable bulb headlamps can equal 10 percent of the value of an entire car after it is 5 to 8
years old. Consumers used to the cost of sealed beam headlamps are critical of state vehicle inspection programs when
they force the replacement of headlamps at costs which far exceed those of sealed beams. When Standard No. 108 was amended
to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, the economic consequences of lens/reflector assembly replacement were not
considered to be relevant to safety, and the ability to replace the light source gave some promise of consumer benefit.
Ironically, the economic burden to consumers now fuels a safety debate about whether the reluctance of owners to replace
expensive cracked lamps or the possibility of degraded performance of relensed lamps is the greater threat to safety.
The styling benefits of replaceable bulb headlamps over sealed beams have resulted in large potential cost penalties
and an unquantifiable degree of performance loss when the headlamps are damaged. 

Volkswagen commented that the cost to replace a headlamp is 7 to 8 times that of the lens alone. It cited examples of lamps
costing $215 to $270 and estimated the cost of replaceable lenses in the $30 to $40 range. Mercedes estimated the cost
of replaceable lenses at $126 to $150 and complete headlamps at $250 to $640 with on-board aiming. While the cost of
headlamps with the fasteners, gaskets, and indexing features required for replaceable lens designs would be higher
than the cost of headlamps with simple bonded lenses, reductions in repair costs of 50% to 85% appear to be likely. 

The agency anticipates that replaceable lens designs would be attractive only for headlamps using glass lenses.
These are predominantly used on imported vehicles. Replaceable bulb headlamps which have coated polycarbonate
plastic lenses are extremely resistant to cracking and chipping. AAMA commented that the impact resistance of plastic
lenses significantly reduces any servicing need to provide replaceable lenses. Glass lenses are less expensive
than coated plastic lenses, and they have greater resistance to high operating temperatures and abrasion by headlamp
wipers. 

However, the additional cost of a replaceable lens design would probably negate the economic advantage a manufacturer
might achieve by changing to a less expensive replaceable glass lens when it had been using bonded plastic lenses.
It is likely that the market for replaceable bulb headlamps with replaceable lenses would be confined to a small segment
of the import market in which headlamp wipers or high operating temperatures dictate the choice of glass lenses. 

Bosch's petition covered only replaceable bulb headlamps. However, AAMA commented that a greater economic benefit
of replaceable lenses could be found in integral beam headlamps. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are being developed
for use as integral beam headlamps, and their operating temperatures are expected to dictate the use of glass lenses.
An integral beam headlamp is required to be manufactured with the lens, bulb, reflector, cable and high voltage source
configured as an indivisible whole. HID headlamps are much more costly than replaceable bulb headlamps, and the prospect
of replacing the whole lamp (at perhaps $1000) in order to repair a cracked lens may be a significant impediment to introduction
of the technology. Since the industry-imposed economic burden on the consumer is the agency's primary reason for
considering replaceable lens headlamps, it is appropriate to include integral beam headlamps in the proposal. 



Proposed Amendments 



NHTSA is implementing its conclusions by proposing appropriate amendments to Standard No. 108. As noted above, the
proposed amendments cover integral beam headlamps as well as those with replaceable bulbs. The proposal requires
redefinitions of ``integral beam headlamp'' and ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' to clarify that some types of these
headlamps need not have a bonded lens reflector assembly, those with a vehicle headlamp aiming device (VHAD) conforming
to Standard No. 108. Under the proposal, each replacement lens would also have to be accompanied by an appropriate
replacement seal, and instructions to the user on how to remove and replace the lens, clean the reflector, and seal
the lens to the lamp. Manufacturers of replacement lenses would mark them with a DOT symbol which will be the manufacturer's
certification that installation of the lens on the headlamp for which it is intended will not create a noncompliance
with Standard No. 108. A new section is proposed that would add the chemical and corrosion resistance tests discussed
above. 

The greatest impact of the proposal will be on future HID integral beam headlamps which may require heat resistant
glass lenses rather than impact resistant plastic lenses. These head-lamps will be very costly and their replacement
will involve high voltage components. The development of durable reflectors to make them suitable for replaceable
lens will be an important step in making HID lamps practical. Additionally, should future changes to the standard
accommodate HID light sources in replaceable bulb headlamps, the ability to have replaceable lenses would enhance
their economic viability as well. 

The comments suggest that it is not critical to require replacement lenses to be identical to original lenses in order
to maintain photometric performance in compliance with the standard. The only necessary requirement is that the
replacement lens maintain compliance of an otherwise compliant headlamp in all respects including sealing. An additional
practical requirement is that a replacement lens be supplied with a new seal and instructions for cleaning the reflector
and installing the lens and seal. 



Request for Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted.

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion. 

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR Part 512. 

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments
on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information
as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to examine the docket for new material. 

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail. 



Effective Date 



The effective date of the final rule would be [30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

]. Because the final rule establishes no additional burden on any party, it is hereby tentatively found for good cause
shown that an effective date for the amendments to Standard No. 108 that is earlier than 180 days after their issuance
would be in the public interest. 



Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This action has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking action is
not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking
action is to afford a further optional means of compliance with the headlamp requirements of Standard No. 108. While
a final rule could result in higher prices for buyers of glass-lensed headlamps of certain types, these initial costs
could be offset by reduced repair costs during the life of the vehicle or the headlamp. These cost impacts are not deemed
significant and preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. It is not anticipated
that a final rule based on this proposal would have a significant effect upon the environment. The design and composition
of headlamps which take advantage of this option may change from those presently in production but it is anticipated
that the kind of materials used will be the same. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The agency has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and headlamps, those affected by the rulemaking action, are generally not small businesses within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly
affected because the price of new vehicles and the optional headlamps would be only minimally impacted. While the
price of new vehicle equipment might be somewhat higher if the optional headlamp is used, the cost of repair of such
equipment will be significantly lessened. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 



This rulemaking action has also been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612, and NHTSA has determined that this rulemaking action does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Civil Justice 



A final rule based on this proposal would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 (formerly section
103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle
safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30163 (formerly 15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has determined that Deer Creek summer steelhead in Washington do not constitute a ``species'' under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended, (ESA) and, therefore, do not qualify for listing under the ESA at this time. However,
Deer Creek summer steelhead are part of a larger evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) that may warrant listing under
the ESA, and for which a status review is currently underway.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Petition Background


On September 21, 1993, NMFS received a petition from Washington Trout to list indigenous, naturally-spawning Deer
Creek summer steelhead (

Oncorhynchus

 

mykiss

) as an endangered species and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. NMFS published a notice on December 23,
1993 (58 FR 68108), that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the listing may be warranted.
To ensure a comprehensive status review, NMFS solicited information and data concerning the present and historic
status of the Deer Creek summer steelhead population and whether this population qualifies as a ``species'' under
the ESA. NMFS also requested information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for Deer Creek summer steelhead.
NMFS also initiated an expanded status review for all coastal steelhead in California, Oregon, and Washington. This
status review was expanded to include Idaho in response to a petition submitted by the Oregon Natural Resources Council
and 15 co-petitioners. NMFS initiated the status review for steelhead throughout its range in the four states on May
27, 1994 (59 FR 27527).


Biological Background


The NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center Biological Review Team has conducted a status review and prepared an
administrative report summarizing the conclusions of the status review, ``Conclusions of the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center's Review of a Petition to List Deer Creek Summer Steelhead (North Fork Stillaguamish River, Washington)
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act,'' which provides more detailed information, discussion, and references.
This report is available upon request (see 

ADDRESSES

) and is summarized below.
Deer Creek is a tributary of the North Fork Stillaguamish River in Washington. The Deer Creek Watershed covers 177
km

2

 in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington. Deer Creek and its steelhead fishery have been the subject of many sporting
journal articles and popular literature. Logging in the Deer Creek Basin began in the 1920s. Timber harvest activities
accelerated in the early 1950s, and approximately 48 percent of the basin was clear-cut between 1952 and 1985. In 1984,
a large landslide, which remains active despite restoration efforts, introduced a tremendous amount of sediment
into Deer Creek. The 1984 landslide reduced viable spawning and rearing habitat for the summer steelhead population,
which was already in decline.
The name steelhead refers to the anadromous form of rainbow trout. Recently, the scientific name for the biological
species that includes both steelhead and rainbow trout was changed from 

Salmo

 

gairdneri

 to 

Oncorhynchus

 

mykiss

. This change reflects a belief that all trouts from western North America share a common lineage with Pacific salmon.
The present endemic distribution of steelhead extends from the Kamchatka Peninsula, Asia, east and south, along
the Pacific coast of North America, to Malibu Creek in southern California.
Steelhead exhibit a wide variety of life history strategies. In general, steelhead migrate to sea after spending
2 years in fresh water and then spend 2 years in the ocean prior to returning to fresh water to spawn. Deviations from
this basic pattern are common. Some spawners survive and return to the ocean for 1 or more years between spawning migrations.
Steelhead exhibit two spawning migration strategies. ``Summer steelhead'' enter fresh water between May and October,
and begin their spawning migration in a sexually immature state. After several months in fresh water, summer steelhead
mature and spawn. ``Winter steelhead'' enter fresh water between November and April with well developed gonads.
In drainages with sympatric populations of summer and winter steelhead, there may or may not be temporal or spatial
separation of spawning.


Consideration as a ``Species'' Under the ESA


To qualify for listing as a threatened or endangered species, Deer Creek summer steelhead would have to be a ``species''
under the ESA. The ESA defines a ``species'' to include any ``distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate
*** which interbreeds when mature.'' NMFS published a policy (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991) on how it will apply the
ESA ``species'' definition to Pacific salmonid species, including steelhead. This policy provides that a salmon
population will be considered distinct, and hence a species under the ESA, if it represents an evolutionarily significant
unit (ESU) of the biological species. The population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: (1) It must
be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units and (2) it must represent an important
component in the evolutionary legacy of the biological species. The first criterion, reproductive isolation, need
not be absolute, but must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences to accrue in different
population units. The second criterion is met if the population contributes substantially to the ecological/genetic
diversity of the species as a whole. Further guidance on the application of this policy is contained in ``Pacific salmon
(

Oncorhynchus

 spp.) and the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act,'' which is available upon request (see 

ADDRESSES

).


Reproductive Isolation


In the Stillaguamish River Basin, three summer-run stocks and one winter-run steelhead stock are recognized. Run
timing is similar among the Stillaguamish River Basin summer steelhead stocks; however, spawn timing appears to
be later for Deer Creek summer steelhead than for other summer steelhead populations within the basin. Although run
timing differs between the Stillaguamish River summer and winter steelhead stocks, there is substantial overlap
in the time of spawning of the two run types.
It was commonly thought that the high gradient reach of Deer Creek between approximately river kilometer 2.4 and 7.2
comprised a ``cumulative velocity barrier'' to winter steelhead (C. Kramer, Area Fish Biologist, Washington Department
of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), pers. comm., May and July 1994). However, other evidence suggests that this barrier may
not be permanent, and recent flooding may have shifted the Deer Creek bedload sufficiently to facilitate passage
of winter steelhead, thereby allowing for the possibility that summer steelhead are not reproductively isolated
from winter steelhead.
In general, genetic studies of coastal steelhead populations have demonstrated that summer and winter steelhead
from the same stream tend to resemble one another genetically more than they resemble populations with similar run
timing from different drainages. These results suggest that summer and winter steelhead do not represent two independent
monophyletic units. Allendorf (1975) reported that coastal summer steelhead, including the Deer Creek population,
were ``genetically indistinguishable from the coastal winter run populations.'' A more recent study (Phelps 

et

 

al

., in press) involving a larger set of gene loci found some evidence of differentiation between summer and winter steelhead
in the Puget Sound region. The later study also found that Deer Creek summer steelhead are ``relatively distinct''
from other Puget Sound steelhead and show a higher degree of genetic similarity to winter steelhead from the Stillaguamish
and Skykomish rivers than to other summer steelhead populations.
A variety of out-of-basin steelhead stocks have been released in the Puget Sound area, and summer steelhead of Columbia
River (Skamania stock) origin have been released in the North Fork Stillaguamish River since the 1960s (C. Kramer,
WDFW, pers. comm., May and July 1994). However, recent genetic data (Phelps 

et

 

al

. in press) found no evidence that Deer Creek summer steelhead have been substantially affected by these releases.


Ecological/Genetic Diversity


In Oregon, only three coastal basins have naturally-occurring summer steelhead (Siletz, Umpqua, and Rogue basins).
In contrast, all major river basins in the North Puget Sound region (Nooksack/Samish, Skagit, Stillaguamish, and
Snohomish basins) are known to have naturally-occurring summer steelhead. The discontinuous range of coastal summer
steelhead is consistent with the polyphyletic origin of this life history inferred from genetic data. However, the
Puget Sound region is (or was) conducive to the development of the summer steelhead life history, and within the Puget
Sound region, Deer Creek is not unique, or even unusual, in supporting summer-run steelhead.
The most common age structure for coastal steelhead from British Columbia to California is 2/2 (2 years of freshwater
residence followed by 2 years in the ocean). Specific information about the age structure of steelhead in the Puget
Sound region is limited. Based on scale samples from fish caught by anglers, Deer Creek summer steelhead are reported
to be primarily (95 percent) 2/1, with the remainder being 3/1 (C. Kramer, WDFW, pers. comm., May and July 1994). Other
Puget Sound steelhead, both summer- and winter-run, also have the 2/1 life history, but sampling has not been sufficient
to quantitatively describe age structure in these populations. According to anecdotal information, the adult size
at spawning of other summer steelhead stocks (South Fork Nooksack, Finney Creek, Sauk River, and Canyon Creek) is
similar to Deer Creek summer steelhead, and this suggests that other steelhead populations in the Puget Sound region
share the same adult body size and other life history features with Deer Creek summer steelhead.


Determination


Deer Creek summer steelhead appear to be temporally and spatially isolated from other populations of summer steelhead
in the Stillaguamish River Basin. Genetic data support the hypothesis that Deer Creek summer steelhead are isolated
from other Puget Sound steelhead populations for which data are available. However, some uncertainty remains regarding
the relationship between Deer Creek summer steelhead and nearby winter-run populations, both in the Stillaguamish
River and, perhaps, in upper Deer Creek. Despite this uncertainty, NMFS has concluded, based on all available information,
that Deer Creek summer steelhead probably meet the first criterion to be an ESU_that is, substantial reproductive
isolation from other conspecific populations.
Although the genetic data show that Deer Creek summer steelhead are relatively distinct from other Puget Sound steelhead,
the genetic differences are not large in an absolute sense. Therefore, these genetic differences provide little
insight into the second ESU criterion, contribution to ecological/genetic diversity of the species as a whole. Deer
Creek summer steelhead differ from many other coastal steelhead populations in that most of the adults return after
only 1 year in the ocean, but the limited available information indicates that this is also observed in other Puget
Sound steelhead populations. NMFS found no other phenotypic or life history traits, or habitat features, that distinguish
the Deer Creek summer steelhead population from those in adjacent areas. Therefore, NMFS concludes that Deer Creek
summer steelhead do not meet the second criterion to be considered an ESU and are not, by themselves, a ``species''
under the ESA. Therefore, a proposal to list Deer Creek summer steelhead under the ESA is not warranted at this time.
However, Deer Creek summer steelhead are undoubtedly part of a larger ESU that may warrant listing under the ESA, and
NMFS will identify the extent of this ESU during its current Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California steelhead
status review (59 FR 27527, May 27, 1994). Detailed information provided in the petition for Deer Creek steelhead
will be considered during this expanded status review.
