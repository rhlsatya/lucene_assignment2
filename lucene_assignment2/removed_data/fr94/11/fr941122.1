</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule reduces the Federal reimbursement rate for certain costs of State agencies in administering the
Food Stamp Program. These changes are mandated by the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act of 1993 (Leland Act).
The Leland Act reduces the Federal rate of reimbursement for fraud control, automated data processing development,
and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements costs. This rule proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations
to comply with Leland Act mandates on these funding provisions. In addition, this rule proposes to limit the period
that a State agency may retroactively claim Federal funding of administrative costs for Food Stamp Program activities
and allows the costs of certifying Aid to Families with Dependent Children households for food stamps to be charged
to the Food Stamp Program for Federal reimbursement purposes.

Executive Order 12866


This proposed rulemaking has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget
under Executive Order 12866.


Executive Order 12372


The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551 and information on
State agency administrative matching grants for the Food Stamp Program is listed under No. 10.561. For the reasons
set forth in the final rule and related notice to 7 CFR 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the
scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.


Executive Order 12778


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive
effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which
would otherwise impede its full implementation . This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified
in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule
or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp
Program the administrative procedures are as follows:
(1) For program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and
7 CFR 273.15;
(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules
related to non-QC liabilities) or Part 283 (for rules related to QC liabilities);
(3) For program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at
7 CFR 278.8.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354,
94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). William Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified
that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will
affect the State and local agencies which administer the Food Stamp Program, by modifying the recordkeeping and reporting
requirements applicable to them, and modifying the rates of Federal funding reimbursement for certain Food Stamp
Program activities.

The requirement under the Leland Act to eliminate enhanced 
funding levels for certain Program activities, resulted in the 
need for the Department to revise forms FNS-366A, Budget 
Projection, and SF-269, Financial Status Report to include a 
column for reporting activities funded at the 50 percent funding 
rate. The SF-269 is a nationwide form required by OMB to be used 
by all government agencies to report financial status. The 
Department regulations at 7 CFR 3015.84 implemented this 
mandatory use of SF-269. The revisions have been sent to the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been approved 
under OMB No. 0584-0083 for the FNS-366A and 0505-0008 for the 
SF-269. OMB also requires the use of form SF-270 when an agency 
wants to adjust the Program's financial status when the letter-of-credit is not used. The Department regulations
at 7 CFR 
3015.84(b) implemented this mandatory use of SF-270. A specific 
reference to the use of form SF-270 for Food Stamp Program 
purposes appears in  277.11 of this proposed action. While the 
form is approved for use by OMB under OMB No. 0505-0008, the 
Department had inadvertently neglected to inform OMB of the 
burden hours associated with the use of this form for Food Stamp 
Program purposes. For Food Stamp Program purposes only, burden 
associated with SF-270 is estimated to average l hour per 
response. This estimated burden assumes that each respondent (53 
State welfare agencies) would submit a SF-270 at least three 
times annually. Thus, burden associated with OMB No. 0505-0008 
will increase an estimated 159 hours annually. Pursuant to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the increased 
burden estimate will be forwarded to OMB for inclusion into the 
overall burden estimates approved under OMB No. 0505-0008. 
The public reporting burden discussed in the previous paragraphs 
for OMB Nos. 0584-0083 and 0505-0008 includes the time for 
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, 
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding 
this burden estimate or any aspect of the information collection 
requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to 
the State Management Section, Program Accountability Division 
(address above) and to the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 20503, Attn: Wendy Taylor, Desk Officer for FNS. 
The remaining provisions of this proposed rulemaking do not 
contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to 
approval by OMB. 


Background 


The Leland Act (Pub. L. 103-66), signed on August 10, 1993, made 
a number of changes to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended 
(the Food Stamp Act). This proposed rulemaking pertains to the 
administrative funding rate provisions established in Section 
13961 of the Leland Act. These provisions are discussed in the 
following paragraphs. 
Most State agency food stamp administrative costs are reimbursed 
by the Department's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the 
Federal reimbursement rate of 50 percent. However, certain State 
agency activities are reimbursed at higher or ``enhanced'' rates, 
including fraud control, automated data processing (ADP) system 
development, and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement 
(SAVE). Under the current rules in 7 CFR 277.4, 277.15, 277.18, 
and 277.19 of Food Stamp Program Regulations, the Federal 
reimbursement rates for these activities were, until 
April 1, 1994, 75 percent for fraud control, 75 or 63 percent for 
ADP development, and 100 percent for SAVE. 
Section 13961 of the Leland Act reduces the Federal reimbursement 
rate for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs to the 
regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement level. The new rate was 
effective April 1, 1994 and applies to costs incurred on or after 
April 1, 1994. 
Costs for a particular activity listed above for which a legal 
liability to pay existed at or before the close of business on 
March 31, 1994 may be claimed at the enhanced rate in effect at 
that time for the particular activity. Costs satisfying this 
condition are direct costs of goods and other property delivered 
to and accepted by the State or local agency; direct costs of 
services rendered to the State or local agency by employees, 
contractors, subrecipients and other payees; and associated 
indirect costs. All costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994, 
including costs for which obligations (encumbrances) but not 
liabilities to pay had been created before April 1, 1994, shall 
be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate 
unless written approval is subsequently received from FNS 
delaying the effective date, under certain specified 
circumstances, as explained below. If FNS grants such approval 
after the April 1, 1994 effective date, an appropriate adjustment 
in Federal funding will be made. 


Fraud Control Activity_Sections 277.4, 277.15, 272.2 


On August 10, 1979, the Department published a final rule at 44 
FR 47037 which allows enhanced Federal reimbursement at the 75 
percent rate for food stamp investigations and prosecutions. 
Food Stamp Program regulations also refer to Federal 
reimbursement as Federal Financial Participation (FFP). The 
Department set out the procedures for State agencies to receive 
75 percent FFP for fraud control activity in that rule. 
Section 13961 of the Leland Act amended Section 16 of the Food 
Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2025) to reduce the Federal reimbursement 
rate for fraud control activity from 75 percent to the regular 50 
percent rate. The new rate is effective, by law, on 
April 1, 1994. 
The new rate applies to food stamp investigations, prosecutions, 
administrative disqualification hearings, claims collections, and 
other allowable fraud control activity. It applies to all such 
costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994.

Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.15 of Food Stamp Program 
regulations, State agencies are required to submit a fraud 
control plan prior to receiving the enhanced funding. A plan is 
not currently required under the regulations for standard fraud 
funding. In Fiscal Year 1993, all State agencies submitted or 
extended their current fraud control plans and all State agencies 
received enhanced fraud funding. The Department is proposing to 
retain the requirement for a fraud control plan. The Department 
believes a fraud control plan is an important management tool in 
combatting fraud and an important component of the State agency's 
Plan of Operation. Further, because program benefits are fully 
funded by the Department, the Department has an interest in 
seeing that State agencies develop and implement an effective 
fraud control plan. However, the Department is proposing to drop 
the other specific requirements in  277.15 (e.g., job title of 
Investigator, separate claims units, etc.) that pertain solely to 
enhanced funding for fraud control activity. Fraud control 
activity performed either by investigators or certification 
workers would be eligible for 50 percent funding. 
The Department is also proposing to change the timing of the 
submission of the fraud control plan. Under current rules the 
Fraud Plan is submitted annually to FNS as an attachment to the 
FNS-366B, Program Activity Statement, 45 days after the end of 
the 

State's

 fiscal year. For most States which operate on a 
July 1 to June 30 fiscal year, this created an August 15 deadline 
for the fraud control plan. The Department is proposing a new 
 272.2(e)(10) which would create a uniform due date of August 
15th for all State agencies, regardless of their 

State

 fiscal 
year. The change will ensure that the fraud control plan is 
submitted prior to the start of the 

Federal

 fiscal year to which 
it applies, and it links submission of the fraud control plan 
with the submission of the Budget Projection Statement which is 
also due August 15. The Department believes the planning and 
budgeting of program activity should be linked since significant 
changes in planned activity may also mean changes in Federal 
funding. The Department is proposing to make conforming 
amendments to  272.2(a), (c)(3), and (e)(3). 
The Department further proposes to remove  277.15 and incorporate 
the retained provisions elsewhere in the regulations. As noted 
above, the Department intends to retain the fraud control plan 
requirements in  277.15(c) by incorporating these requirements 
into the Plan of Operation requirements at 7 CFR 272.2(d). The 
Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to 
 272.2(a)(2), (c)(3), and (d)(1), as appropriate, related to the 
due date of the plan and the relocation of the submission 
procedure from (c)(3) to (e)(10). The Department is not 
proposing to create new requirements for the fraud control plan 
but to extend the current requirements and change the due date 
for this plan. The Department is proposing to reserve section 
277.15 for future use. 
Because the Department is proposing to move the fraud control 
plan submission requirement to  272.2(d)(1)(xi), the current 
submission requirement in  272.2(c)(3)(i) is being deleted. The 
deletion of paragraph (i) requires redesignating  272.2(c)(3)(ii) 
as  272.2(c)(3). Although the wording must be changed slightly 
to accomodate the restructuring of the paragraph, the 
requirements in the current  272.2(c)(3)(ii) for submission of 
certain interagency agreements are unchanged. 
The Department also intends to incorporate the provision 
regarding the funding rate for investigations of retail or 
wholesale food concerns currently found in  277.15(f)(2), with a 
slight modification for clarity, into a new paragraph (e) of 
 277.4.

On June 11, 1982, the Department published a rule at 47 FR 25496 
to implement section 129 of Public Law 96-249, which allowed 
enhanced FFP at the 75 percent level for costs associated with 
the planning, design, development, acquisition, or installation 
of ADP systems. On January 19, 1994, the Department published 
another final rule at 59 FR 2725 which reduced the Federal 
reimbursement rate to the 63 percent level effective 
October 1, 1991 for system proposals which were approved on or 
after November 28, 1990 unless the State had an approved Advance 
Planning Document and had submitted an Implementation Advance 
Planning Document with all the paperwork required for approval 
prior to November 28, 1990. The requirements and procedures for 
State agencies for system development at both the enhanced and 
standard rates of funding were codified in 7 CFR 277.18 of Food 
Stamp Program Rules. 
Section 13961 of the Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Food 
Stamp Act to reduce the rate of Federal funding for system 
development to the regular 50 percent rate. The change in rates 
is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. 
The new rate applies to costs associated with the planning, 
design, development, acquisition, or installation of ADP systems. 
The change in the funding rate applies to new proposals as well 
as proposals approved prior to April 1, 1994 at the enhanced rate 
of either 75 or 63 percent. Previously approved projects will 
continue to be reimbursed at the enhanced rate for costs 
incurred, as defined in the Background section of this preamble, 
only through March 31, 1994. The Federal reimbursement rate will 
then drop to the regular 50 percent rate for the time remaining 
in the approval period. Modifications on or after April 1, 1994 
to existing systems will be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent 
rate. All new systems developed on or after April 1, 1994 will 
be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent rate.

Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.18(c), the State agency is 
required to obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans 
to acquire ADP equipment or services with enhanced Federal 
funding, regardless of the cost, or at the regular funding rate 
if total acquisition costs meet or exceed $500,000 in Federal and 
State funds. By dropping enhanced funding, the dollar threshold 
before FNS approval is required for all ADP systems would be the 
standard $500,000 threshold applicable to the regular funding 
requirements at  277.18(c). As a result of this change, 
modifications or revisions to systems and services previously 
approved at the enhanced funding rate described at  273.18(c) but 
which the total cost of the system does not meet or exceed 
$500,000 would no longer be subject to prior FNS approval 
beginning April 1, 1994, as long as the total cost of the system 
remains under $500,000. 
Accordingly, the Department will retain most of the requirements 
of  277.18, but is proposing modifications to that section. The 
proposed modifications include the elimination of requirements 
that pertain solely to enhanced funding and retention of the 
baseline requirements and dollar thresholds for FNS funding 
systems under the standard funding at  277.18(b), (c)(1)-(c)(2), 
(d)(1)-(d)(2), (e)(1) and (p)(5). In addition, the Department 
proposes to retain certain conditions set forth in  277.18(g)(1) 
and (g)(2) that are currently tied to receipt of enhanced funding 
since the Leland Act amendments made these conditions applicable 
to receipt of funding at the standard funding rate. Therefore, 
the Department is proposing that as a condition of receiving 
approval for funding at the 50 percent standard funding rate, the 
proposed ADP system must: (1) Assist the State agency in meeting 
the requirements of the Food Stamp Act; (2) meet the Model Plan 
requirements specified in  272.10 of this part; (3) provide for 
more efficient and effective administration of the program; and 
(4) be compatible with other such systems used in the 
administration of State agency plans under the Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Accordingly, the 
Department proposes to amend  277.18(g)(1) and (g)(2) to set out 
these conditions and to revise the heading of the section to read 
``Conditions for Receiving FFP.'' The Department is further 
proposing to extend the requirements at  277.18(g)(3) to all ADP 
systems. That section currently requires that the proposed ADP 
systems receiving enhanced funding be Statewide and integrated 
with AFDC, unless the State agency can demonstrate that a local, 
dedicated or single function system will provide for more 
efficient and effective administration of the program. The 
Department is proposing to modify this requirement so it applies 
to all ADP systems regardless of funding level. 
The Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to 
 274.12(k) to reflect the elimination of enhanced funding for the 
development of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems which 
are components of complete ADP systems to be developed in 
accordance with  277.18(g). 


SAVE_Section 277.19 


On October 7, 1988 at 53 FR 39433, the Department published a 
rule which authorized 100 percent Federal funding for State and 
local agency costs incurred in the verification of the documented 
alien status of Food Stamp Program applicants through the SAVE 
program. The requirements to receive the enhanced funding are at 
 277.19. 
Section 13961 of Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Act (7 
U.S.C. 2025) to reduce Federal funding for SAVE activity from the 
100 percent reimbursement rate to the regular 50 percent rate. 
The change in rates is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. 

The new rate applies to State and local agency costs incurred in 
the verification of the documented alien status of Food Stamp 
Program applicants through the SAVE program. The current rule at 
 272.11(e) requires State agencies to submit a SAVE plan as an 
attachment to the State agency's Plan of Operation prior to 
receiving funding. The current rule at  277.19 sets forth the 
required conditions for obtaining 100 percent FFP for SAVE. The 
Department is proposing to retain the current requirement for a 
SAVE plan at  272.11 but is proposing to delete  277.19.

The current rule at 7 CFR 277.19 requires FNS approval prior to 
acquisition of any ADP equipment for SAVE. The proposal to 
eliminate 7 CFR 277.19 modifies this requirement so that ADP 
equipment for SAVE would require prior approval by FNS only if 
the cost is above the cost thresholds in  277.18. Under current 
rules in  277.19, non-ADP equipment for SAVE having a net unit 
cost of $25,000 or more must receive prior FNS approval. 
However, with the elimination of  277.19, the net acquisition 
cost threshold in Section (B)(3) of Appendix A to 7 CFR Part 277 
would apply. This provision provides that prior FNS approval 
would be required for the acquisition of equipment having a 
useful life of more than one year and a net acquisition cost of 
more than $5,000 per unit after allocation to FNS as projected 
for one year after purchase. 



State Agency Implementation 



To implement this provision as of April 1, 1994 with minimum 
disruption to the Program, State agencies may wish to begin 
taking appropriate steps early. State agencies may wish to 
obtain the additional State funding from their State legislatures 
to offset the reduction in the Federal rate of reimbursement, cut 
back total administrative expenses prior to Federal cost sharing 
as of April 1, 1994, reallocate resources to or realign functions 
to maintain current levels of effort and to ensure the efficiency 
and effectiveness of overall operations. 



Delaying the Effective Date



Section 13971 of the Leland Act 
allows the April 1, 1994 effective date for the change in the 
Federal reimbursement rates to be delayed by the Secretary of 
Agriculture in the case where a State's legislature meets 
biennially and is not scheduled to meet in calendar year 1994. A 
delay may be obtained for such a State only if the State 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is 
no mechanism for appropriating additional State funds prior to 
the next legislative session. 

It is the Department's intent that State agencies submit their 
requests to delay the effective date early, and not wait for the 
completion of the rulemaking process. It is in the State 
agency's interest to apply early for a delay in the effective 
date so a decision on the State agency's request may be made 
promptly. To allow adequate time for the review of these 
requests prior to the effective date, FNS instructed its regional 
offices to notify State agencies that they would need to submit 
their requests to FNS by December 31, 1993. State agencies were 
informed of this deadline in letters which were issued by FNS 
regional offices during the last week of October 1993 and the 
first week of November. The Department will, however, consider 
requests submitted after the deadline.

A final rule will not be published prior to the April 1, 1994 
effective date in the Leland Act. The Department has made 
decisions on requests for a delay of the effective date based on 
the policy set out in the previous notifications to the States 
and reflected in the following paragraphs of this section of the 
preamble. Comments on the proposed policy are welcomed. 

As stated in the previous paragraph, a State agency which 
believes it meets the above criteria for a delay of the effective 
date was instructed to submit its request to FNS by 
December 31, 1993 to allow for adequate time for FNS to review 
the request prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date. The 
Department required that the request contain the following: 

(1) Documentation showing that the State legislature meets 
only biennially; 

(2) Documentation showing that the State legislature does 
not meet in calendar year 1994; 

(3) Certification by the State's chief legal officer, along 
with any supporting documentation, that there is no mechanism 
under the State constitution and laws for appropriating funding 
prior to the next regular legislative session; 

(4) Information as to when the next regular legislative 
session is scheduled to start and, if available, is expected to 
end. 

The issue of whether a State's laws permit the appropriation of 
funds prior to the next regular legislative session is a legal 
question. State agencies must provide supporting documentation 
where appropriate such as specific provisions of law dealing with 
when the State legislature is scheduled to meet in a regular 
session, and with the appropriation process. The wording of the 
Leland Act essentially requires State agencies to provide proof 
that something does not exist_that no mechanism for 
appropriating funds prior to the next regular legislative session 
exists under the State's constitution and laws. However, it 
would be too burdensome for FNS to require that a State agency 
provide FNS a complete set of its laws as proof that no such 
mechanism exists. 

However, in all cases, FNS needs some assurance that a thorough 
and accurate review of State law has been made. Accordingly, the 
Department proposes that a signed statement from the State's 
chief legal officer_the Attorney General or equivalent 
official_certifying that no such mechanism exists with brief 
supporting documentation, if any, should suffice in most cases. 
The Department believes it is appropriate and necessary for State 
agencies to provide such a certification regarding the State's 
laws.

It should be noted here that the Leland Act specifies that there 
be no mechanism for appropriating funding prior to the next 
regular legislative session in order to qualify for a delay of 
the effective date. The language in the Act refers to an 
appropriating mechanism. If the State legislature fails to 
appropriate the additional State funds in a regular session, no 
delay in the effective date will be granted. Also, the Leland 
Act does not authorize a delay in the effective date if a State 
legislature is scheduled to meet in regular session in calendar 
year 1994, but sometime after April 1, 1994. 

For some State agencies, the State legislature may not be 
scheduled to meet in regular session during calendar year 1994, 
but the State's laws allow the State legislature to be called 
into special session or provide other means (other than a special 
session) by which the State may appropriate additional funds. A 
request for a delay of the effective date should be submitted if 
a State with a biennial legislature which does not meet in 
calendar year 1994 has no mechanism to appropriate the additional 
State funds under State law other than to call a special 
legislative session to appropriate the additional State funds. 
For purposes of deciding whether or not to grant a request for a 
delay in the effective date, the Department is proposing to 
define ``special legislative session'' to mean a legislative 
session that is not scheduled to occur on a regularly scheduled 
basis. Thus, a regularly scheduled short legislative session in 
even number years to consider necessary or emergency bills would 
be considered a regular legislative session. Legislative 
sessions that are not scheduled on a standing regular basis and 
must be called under State law for a specific purpose would be 
considered a special legislative session. 

The Department is taking this proposed position because it 
recognizes that in many cases a special legislative session could 
cost a State more than the additional State administrative 
funding that would be involved for the Food Stamp Program. In 
addition, this position conforms with AFDC's policy and 
procedures for implementing Section 13741 of the Leland Act which 
makes a similar change in Federal reimbursement rates for the 
AFDC Program. State agencies should note that this position 
treats State agencies with biennial legislatures the same 
regardless of whether or not the State has called a special 
session in calendar year 1994 for some specific purpose or has 
chosen not to call a special session. 

The Department has also considered how it would interpret the 
criteria in Section 13971 of the Leland Act that a State have ``no 
mechanism, under the constitution and laws of the State, for 
appropriating the additional funds required * * * before the next 
such regular legislative session * * *'' The Act is not clear as to 
what kind of appropriating mechanism would meet the test. 
Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines an 
appropriation as a sum of money set aside or allotted by official 
or formal action for a specific use. Accordingly, State 
appropriation mechanisms could be interpreted to include the 
process by which the State legislature or other entities in the 
State appropriate funds as well as State procedures to set aside 
funds from discretionary or emergency accounts for specific 
purposes. 

In general, State constitutions and laws provide for 
appropriation by the State's legislature. However, some State 
laws also provide other funding mechanisms such as voter 
initiatives to appropriate funds, procedures allowing State 
officials or emergency commissions to authorize the spending of 
funds from the State treasury, another program's revenue account, 
or an emergency account, and procedures by which funds previously 
appropriated for one program may be transferred to another 
program. The Department recognizes that while these mechanisms 
may exist under State law, they may not be useable by the State 
for several reasons. Voter initiatives to amend the constitution 
or law to provide State funding require months just to raise the 
issue to a sufficient number of voters and schedule an election 
and are beyond the control of the State. Regarding the spending 
of discretionary or emergency funds, State officials would be 
reluctant to declare an emergency in order to utilize emergency 
procedures to transfer funds from the State Treasury or other 
accounts to the State's Food Stamp Program for a non-emergency 
purpose. Further, the interpretation of what is a State 
appropriation under State law as opposed to emergency funds 
transfer mechanisms varies by State. The Department believes 
that State legal officers are in the best position to determine 
what are the appropriation mechanisms that are readily available 
and useable under the State law. Accordingly, the Department is 
proposing to interpret the law to cover only mechanisms by which 
the State legislature appropriates funding and not to cover voter 
initiative mechanisms and State transfer mechanisms from 
discretionary or emergency accounts.

In March 1994, the Department approved enhanced funding extension 
requests from four State agencies using this policy. The 
Department acted on these requests prior to the rulemaking so the 
State agencies affected would know their Federal funding status 
prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date mandated in the law. 
If a decision by FNS to grant a delay is made after 
April 1, 1994, an adjustment will be made so an affected State 
agency can receive enhanced Federal funding retroactive to 
April 1, 1994 for eligible costs. 

If approval is granted to delay the effective date, Section 13971 
of the Leland Act provides that the delayed effective date would 
be the first day of the first calendar quarter which begins after 
the close of the State's regular legislative session. In such a 
case, State agencies would be required to promptly advise FNS in 
writing as to the actual date the next regular session of the 
State legislature is completed once such session is completed so 
the delayed effective date can be determined. 


Enhanced Funding for Low Payment Error Rates 


Under Section 16(c) of the Food Stamp Act and the current rules 
at  277.4(b), the Federal share of administrative costs specified 
in section 16(a) of the Food Stamp Act may be enhanced from the 
regular 50 percent rate to a maximum of 60 percent after the end 
of the Federal fiscal year if the State agency qualifies by 
achieving a low payment error rate. Costs which were eligible 
for greater enhanced funding rates under section 16 (a), (g), and 
(j) of the Act (fraud control costs, ADP development, and SAVE) 
were ineligible for the 60 percent enhancement. With the drop in 
the funding rate to 50 percent, these three activities now become 
eligible along with other costs funded at the 50 percent rate for 
the increased Federal reimbursement rate of up to 60 percent if 
the State agency meets the low payment error rate specified in 
 277.4. The enhanced funding may only be paid on costs shared at 
the 50 percent level to State agencies who qualify. The 
Department proposes to amend  277.4, to allow these three new 
activities to become eligible for the 60 percent enhanced funding 
by removing  277.4 (b)(1), (b)(10), (b)(11) and (b)(12), 
redesignating the remaining provisions, and by revising newly 
designated paragraph (b)(7). 


Deadline for Filing Claims for Retroactive Funding_Section 277.11 


Current rules at  277.11 do not limit State agencies from making 
claims for prior year administrative costs. The one exception is 
that the provision at  277.15(b) limits 75 percent funding for 
fraud control activities to prior year costs incurred in the 
Federal fiscal year during which a State agency initially applied 
for 75 percent funding. However, State agencies may make claims 
for prior year fraud control activities at the 50 percent Federal 
reimbursement rate with no time limit. 
State agencies are currently required at  277.11 to submit a Form 
SF-269, Financial Status Report, on a quarterly basis to report 
program costs and to support the claims made for Federal funding. 
Final reports are due December 30 for the preceeding Federal 
fiscal year which runs from October 1 through September 30. In 
addition, after the fiscal year is over, State agencies may 
request retroactive funding for past years or pay back FNS for 
inadvertent overclaims by submitting an SF-270, Request for 
Advance or Reimbursement. It is the SF-270 adjustments which, 
under current rules potentially may go on without end. In Fiscal 
Years (FY) 1991 through 1993, FNS received SF-270 requests for 
retroactive funding from State agencies going back as far as FY 
1981 and SF-270 payments from State agencies to FNS going back to 
FY 1979 and prior years for the Food Stamp Program.

The Department proposes to amend  277.11 to add a new paragraph 
(d)(1) which would limit the time period during which State 
agencies may file a request for retroactive funding. The 
intended effect of this proposal is to limit State agency and FNS 
resources toward the present operation of the program. The 
Department believes State agencies have a responsibility to 
properly claim Federal funding on a timely basis. 
Other Federal programs currently have claim limitations in place. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has claim 
limits on grants to State agencies for the Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children and Medicaid Programs. For example, in those 
programs, DHHS will reimburse a State agency only if the State 
agency files a claim for an expenditure within two years after 
the calendar quarter in which the State agency made the 
expenditure. In this rule, the Department is proposing a similar 
limitation for the Food Stamp Program. 
The Department proposes in new  277.11(d)(3) to provide, that 
subject to the availability of funds, FNS would reimburse a State 
agency for an allowable expenditure at the appropriate Federal 
reimbursement rate only if the State agency files a claim with 
FNS for that expenditure within two years after the calendar 
quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. In the 
case of 75 percent funding for fraud control activity, the same 
two-year limit would apply to claims for retroactive 75 percent 
fraud funding but there would be an additional limit in that the 
retroactive funding would not be available prior to the year in 
which the State agency applied for 75 percent funding. 
Further, the Department proposes in new  277.11(d)(2) to provide 
that subject to the availability of funds and any required FNS 
approval related to the Advance Planning Document under 7 CFR 
277.18(c), FNS would reimburse State agencies for the purchase of 
automated data processing (ADP) equipment and services at the 
appropriate reimbursement rate in effect at the time the 
equipment or service was received only if the State agency files 
a claim with FNS for that expenditure within two years after the 
calendar quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. 
This proposed time limit applies to ADP expenditures approved for 
funding at the enhanced rate and at the regular rate. 
The Department's proposal in new  277.11(d)(4) would provide for 
certain exceptions to the two-year limit. State agencies may 
request a waiver of the time limit in writing in advance of the 
deadline. In order to be granted by FNS, the request must 
include supporting explanation, justification and documentation. 
In addition, as set forth in proposed  277.11(d)(5) the time 
limit would not apply to audit exceptions, or where FNS 
determines there was good cause resulting from circumstances 
beyond the State agency's control for filing a late claim. An 
audit exception means a proposed adjustment by the Department to 
any expenditure claimed by a State agency by virtue of an audit. 
Finally, the Department's proposal would limit the time period 
for the use of the SF-270 to repay FNS for an overclaim to three 
years from the end of the Federal fiscal year unless litigation, 
an audit, or a claim is pending at the end of the three-year 
period. FNS reserves the right to assert a claim against State 
agencies for amounts due when an SF-270 is not submitted by the 
State agency to repay any money due FNS. 
Note that under the current program rules at  277.12, State 
agencies are required to maintain all financial records for three 
years unless there is pending litigation, or an unresolved audit 
or claim. If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before 
the expiration of the three-year period, the applicable records 
shall be retained until these have been resolved. The Department 
is not proposing any changes to these record retention 
requirements in this rule. 


AFDC/Food Stamp Certification Costs_Section 277.9 


The Department is also proposing amendments to current 
regulations to correspond to current practice related to the 
charging of certain food stamp certification costs to the Food 
Stamp Program. 
The current regulations at  277.9 provide that any cost related 
to determining the Food Stamp Program eligibility of Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cases is to be included 
as part of the AFDC determination costs and claims and not as an 
allowable cost for FNS reimbursement. However, beginning 
October 1, 1983, as a result of a Memorandum of Understanding 
between the Department and DHHS, the Department changed this 
policy, but not the regulatory provision, so that the incremental 
cost of certifying AFDC households for Food Stamp Program 
benefits shall be charged to FNS, not to the Office for Family 
Assistance, DHHS. State agencies were notified by FNS regional 
offices of this change in August 1983. Beginning 
October 1, 1983, State agencies have been allowed to charge such 
costs to FNS.

The Department is proposing that this longstanding practice be codified in the Food Stamp Program Regulations. The
Department proposes to amend  277.9(b) to provide that the incremental cost of certifying AFDC cases for food
stamp benefits would be an allowable cost for FNS reimbursement at the standard Federal reimbursement rate. This
proposed provision modifies program regulations so that they conform to current policy and practice.


Effective Dates and Implementation Requirements


The Department is proposing that all the provisions in  277.11 regarding time limits for State agencies to file
claims to amend a prior expenditure report to request retroactive funding for costs previously incurred will be effective
the first day of the first calendar quarter occurring not less than 60 days following publication of the final rule.
The Department proposes that the provision at  277.9(b) on the charging of food stamp certifications of AFDC
households become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule since it does not require any special
implementation efforts on the part of State agencies since the change merely conforms the regulations to current
practice.
Pursuant to Section 13971 of the Leland Act, the reduction in FFP rates mandated by Section 13961 of the Leland Act was
effective on April 1, 1994, unless the Department grants a delay in certain limited circumstances, as specified in
this proposed rule.
In the last week of October and the first week of November 1993, the Department briefed State agencies administering
the Food Stamp Program on how to implement the new Federal funding rates for FNS-366A, Budget Projection, and
SF-269, Financial Status Report, actual cost reporting and payment purposes effective April 1, 1994. The prompt
implementation was necessary prior to rulemaking to comply timely with the Leland Act's mandate to reduce the Department's
share of State agency administrative costs to the mandated rate as of April 1, 1994, and to minimize the need for revised
reporting by State agencies related to budget projections for FY 1994 and actual cost reporting on or after April 1,
1994. It also gave lead time to State agencies opting to seek from their State legislatures additional State funds
to offset the reduction in the rate of Federal funding. State agency budget projections for FY 1994 should take into
account the new funding rate as of April 1, 1994. Beginning April 1, 1994, State agencies began drawing down Federal
funds for expenditures based on the new funding rate for these activities. Effective with the third quarter Fiscal
Year 1994 SF-269 report, State agencies will begin reporting costs using the new funding rate for these activities.
Costs incurred by the State or local agency on or after April 1, 1994 will be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal
reimbursement rate. State agencies currently report the amount of Federal funds requested on the FNS-366A,
Budget Projection, and actual costs on the SF-269, Financial Status Report. For reporting purposes, the Department
is proposing to require State agencies to begin reporting budget and cost information using the new lower Federal
reimbursement rate for costs incurred for periods beginning on or after April 1, 1994.
Section 13961 of the Leland Act, which reduces the enhanced funding for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs,
applies, by its terms, to costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994. The deadline for submitting a request to delay the
effective date for the reduction in enhanced funding is December 31, 1993 as specified in letters sent by FNS regional
offices to State agencies in the last week of October and the first week of November 1993. However, the Department will
consider requests submitted after that date.
The conforming amendments to Food Stamp Program regulations in   272.2, 272.11, 272.13, 274.12, 277.4,
277.15, 277.18, and 277.19 will be effective 30 days following publication of the final rule.


Public Comments


This rule proposes to bring the regulations into conformity with the Leland Act. Publication of the rule does not change
the implementation guidance which was issued by the Department beginning in late October 1993. The Department is
merely proposing to incorporate the new Federal reimbursement rate for these activities into the regulations. Although
the Department has taken action to ensure prompt implementation of the new reimbursement rate effective April 1,
1994, this rulemaking is still necessary in order to conform the regulations to the new rate.
The Department requests public comments because they may be beneficial to the rulemaking. However, commenters should
note that the new Federal reimbursement rate and the implementation date for the reduction in the Federal reimbursement
rate were mandated in the Act and are not items involving Departmental discretion. Only the decision of whether a State
agency has demonstrated that it meets the criteria for a delay of the effective date involves some degree of Departmental
discretion. Any comments received by the deadline stated above for comments will be considered prior to publication
of a final rulemaking.

(d) 

Time Limit for State Agencies to File Claims. 
(1) After the deadline in paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the final Form SF-269 report, State agencies shall
use the Form SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, as needed within three years of the end of the Federal
fiscal year to amend a prior expenditure report pertaining to such Federal fiscal year. The three-year reporting
deadline may be extended by FNS if litigation, an audit, or a claim is unresolved at the end of the three-year period.
The SF-270 shall be used to amend prior expenditure reports, and to request reimbursement for any additional
funding due or to pay back to FNS any inadvertent prior overclaim. Requests for reimbursement will only be honored

if the claim is filed within the timeframe in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. FNS reserves the right to bill State
agencies for amounts due FNS due to an overclaim even if no SF-270 has been submitted. 
(2) Subject to the availability of funds from the appropriation for the year in which the expenditure was incurred,
FNS may reimburse State agencies for an allowable expenditure only if the State agency files a claim with FNS for that
expenditure within two years after the calendar quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. FNS will consider
non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting
records of the State agency in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
(3) For Automated Data Processing (ADP) expenditures approved under  277.18(c), subject to the availability
of funds and required FNS approval related to the Advance Planning Document, FNS may reimburse State agencies for
allowable expenditures at the appropriate rate in effect at the time the 
equipment or service was received only if the State agency files for a claim with FNS within two years after the calendar
quarter in which the funds were obligated. FNS will consider non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been
made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting records of the State agency in accordance with generally
accepted accounting 
principles. 
(4) Waiver requests for an extension of the deadline in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section may be granted
by FNS only if the request was submitted in writing to FNS prior to the applicable deadline. The State agency's request
for a waiver must include a specific explanation, justification, and documentation of why the claim will be late and
when the claim will be filed. 
(5) The time limits in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will not apply to any of the following: 
(i) Any claim for an adjustment to prior year costs previously claimed under an interim rate concept; 
(ii) Any claim resulting from an audit exception; 
(iii) Any claim resulting from a court-ordered retroactive payment. However, this provision does not bind FNS to
a State or Federal decision when FNS was not a party to the action; 
(iv) Any claim for which FNS determines there was good cause for the State agency's not filing it within the time limit.
Good cause is lateness due to circumstances beyond the State agency's control such as Acts of God or documented action
or inaction of the Federal Government. It does not include neglect or administrative inadequacy on the part of the
State, State agency, legislature, or any of their offices or employees.

Requirement for prior FNS approval. 

A State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section when it
plans to acquire ADP equipment or services which it anticipates will have total acquisition costs of $500,000 or more
in Federal and State funds. However, a State agency shall obtain prior written approval from FNS for the acquisition
of ADP equipment or services to be utilized in an EBT system regardless of the cost of acquisition. A State agency shall
also obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans to noncompetitively acquire ADP equipment or services from
a nongovernmental source which cost more than $100,000 in Federal and State funds. The State agency shall request
prior FNS approval by submitting the Planning APD or Implementation APD signed by the appropriate State official
to the FNS Regional Office.


* * * * *



(e) 

APD Update._

(1) 

General sub- 
mission requirements. 

The State agency 
shall submit an APD Update for FNS approval for all approved Planning and Implementation APD's when total acquisition
costs exceed $1 million. * * *


* * * * *



(g) 

Conditions for Receiving FFP._

(1) A State agency may receive FFP at the 50 percent reimbursement rate for the costs of planning, design, development
or installation of ADP and information retrieval systems if the proposed system will:

(i) Assist the State agency in meeting the requirements of the Food Stamp Act;

(ii) Meet the program standards specified in  272.10(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this chapter, except for the
requirements in  272.10 (b)(2)(vi), (b)(2)(vii) and (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter to eventually transmit data
directly to FNS;

(iii) Be likely to provide more efficient and effective administration of the program; and

(iv) Be compatible with other such systems utilized in the administration of State agency plans under the program
of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).

(2) State agencies seeking FFP for the planning, design, development or installation of automated data processing
and information retrieval systems shall develop Statewide systems which are integrated with AFDC. In cases where
a State agency can demonstrate that a local, dedicated, or single function (issuance or certification only) system
will provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program, FNS may grant an exception to the Statewide
integrated requirement. These exceptions will be based on an assessment of the proposed system's ability to meet
the State agency's need for automation. Systems funded as exceptions to this rule, however, should be capable to the
extent necessary, of an automated data exchange with the State agency system used to administer AFDC. In no circumstances
will funding be available for systems which duplicate other State agency systems, whether presently operational
or planned for future development.


* * * * *

(5) 

Costs. 

Costs incurred for complying with the provisions of paragraphs (p)(1) through (p)(3) of this section are considered
regular administrative costs which are funded at the regular FFP level.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action proposes several changes in Food Stamp Program rules relating to the limit on deductible excess shelter
expenses and use of standard utility allowances. The major change would implement a provision of the Mickey Leland
Childhood Hunger Relief Act as set forth in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The provision would increase
Program benefits to households that have no elderly or disabled members by gradually increasing and then, in 1997,
removing the limit on the amount of excess shelter expenses these households can deduct from their income to determine
eligibility and benefits. The changes in provisions for standard utility allowances would allow State agencies
to use allow use of additional standards and would simplify requirements for determining entitlement to a standard.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Classification 


Executive Order 12866 


This proposed rule has been determined to be economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget. 


Executive Order 13272 


The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule in 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V and related Notice (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope
of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601-612).
Ellen Haas, Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, has certified that this rule does not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The changes will increase benefits to food
stamp recipients and simplify administration of the Program by State and local welfare agencies. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). 


Regulatory Impact Analysis 


Need for Action 


This action is required by section 13912(b) of Pub. L. 103-66, which amended Section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act
to provide for incremental increases in the excess shelter expense deduction in July 1994 and October 1995 and the
elimination of the limit on the amount of shelter expenses that may be deducted from the net income of a household that
does not contain an elderly or disabled member, effective January 1, 1997. 



Benefits 


This action increases benefits to households with high shelter expenses and simplifies administration of the Program
by State and local offices. 


Costs 


It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the Food Stamp Program by approximately $40 million in FY
1994, $125 million in FY 1995, $190 million in FY 1996, $490 million in FY 1997, and $620 million in FY 1998. 



Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive
effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which
would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified
in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule
or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp
Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) for Program benefit recipients_State administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures
issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities)
or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures
issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8.

Background


1. Excess Shelter Cap_7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) and 273.9(d)(8)


Under current rules at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5), households are entitled to a deduction from income for excess shelter expenses,
i.e., shelter expenses (including rent or mortgage and utilities) that exceed 50 percent of the household's net income
remaining after all other deductions. For households with an elderly or disabled member (as defined in 7 CFR 271.2),
all of the excess shelter expenses are deducted. For other households, only excess shelter expenses up to a limit are
deducted. This limit, usually referred to as the ``shelter cap,'' is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the shelter,
fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30. In FY 1994, the cap is $207 for the contiguous 48 States and
the District of Columbia, $359 in Alaska, $295 in Hawaii, $251 in Guam, and $152 in the Virgin Islands.
Section 13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act (Leland Act), Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-66, enacted August 10, 1993, 107 Stat. 312), amended section 5(e) of
the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (as amended), (the Act) 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to provide for incremental increases in the shelter
cap and for the elimination of the cap according to the following schedule:



1. Effective July 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $231 a
month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, $402 in Alaska, $330 in Hawaii, $280 in Guam, and $171
in the Virgin Islands.
2. Effective October 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $247
a month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, $429 in Alaska, $353 in Hawaii, $300 in Guam, and $182
in the Virgin Islands.
3. Effective January 1, 1997, the limit on the excess shelter expense deduction is removed.



According to the legislative history of the Leland Act (

Congressional Record,

 S10725, August 6, 1993), the changes in the shelter cap are designed to provide more food stamps to families with especially
high rent and utility bills. To implement section 13912 of Pub. L. 103-66, 7 CFR 273.9(d)(8) will be amended to
add the statutorily imposed increased shelter cap amounts effective in July 1994 and October 1995 and to indicate
that the shelter cap will be eliminated effective January 1, 1997. Those regulatory changes are mandated by statute
and, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), are therefore not subject to public comment.
This action proposes to amend the homeless shelter expense provisions of 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) to eliminate the reference
to the excess shelter cap. Current regulations provide that State agencies may develop their own standard estimate
of the shelter expenses of households in which all members are homeless and do not receive free shelter throughout
the month. State agencies that do not want to develop their own standards may use the estimate provided by the Department.
The regulations provide that this homeless shelter estimate will be updated annually using the same method as is used
to index the excess shelter cap. Since the excess shelter cap will be set at the amounts established by the Leland Act
beginning July 1, 1994 and will be removed in January 1997, we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) effective July
1, 1994 to provide that the homeless shelter expense estimate will be revised each October 1 to reflect changes in the
shelter, fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the CPI-U for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30.
The homeless shelter estimate will be adjusted on October 1, 1994 and each October 1 thereafter. State agencies will
be notified of the amount by memorandum prior to each change. State agencies will still have the option of developing
and using their own estimates.

2. Standard Utility Allowances_7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)


The legislative history of the Leland Act (

Congressional Record,

 S10725, August 6, 1993 and House Report 103-213, p. 924, August 4, 1993) indicates Congressional intent that
the excess shelter expense deduction be simple to administer and that the standard utility allowance facilitate,
rather than hinder, program simplification. We have reviewed the regulations governing shelter expenses and utility
standards to determine how they might be improved. As a result, we are proposing to revise 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) in its entirety.
In section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2014(e)), Congress authorized use of a standard utility allowance (standard)
in computing a household's excess shelter deduction to reduce the burden on State agencies and households of having
to report, verify, and calculate actual utility costs. However, subsequent legislation and numerous regulatory
revisions have resulted in increasingly complicated requirements for use of the standards. State agencies have
complained that current regulations are confusing and, by their very complexity, defeat the purpose of using standards.
Rules published October 17, 1978 (43 FR 47846, 47865-66) required State agencies to establish a standard utility
allowance which households could include in claiming their shelter costs. Households that incurred costs for electricity
and fuel for heating, cooling, or cooking were allowed to use the State agency's single utility standard which included
these costs. Alternatively, States were allowed to develop separate standards for each utility. A household incurring
a cost for any of these utilities was allowed the option of claiming actual costs or the standard in the calculation
of benefits.
To give State agencies more flexibility in operating the Program, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982,
Pub. L. 97-253, (September 8, 1982, 96 Stat. 775-6), made use of a standard utility allowance a State agency
option. In doing so, the use of the standard became more complex. Use of a single standard that included heating or cooling
costs was restricted to those households that incurred heating or cooling costs separately from their rent or mortgage.
However, households in 

public 

housing who were billed only for excess usage were prohibited from using this standard. These households were required
to use actual expenses. The law also required State agencies to prorate the standard among separate households who
lived together and shared heating or cooling expenses.
Interim regulations implementing the provisions of Pub. L. 97-253 were issued on November 16, 1982 (47 FR 51551)
and made final on June 21, 1983 (48 FR 28190). (Readers may refer to the preambles of these regulations for a full explanation
of the changes.) The rules implemented the prohibition against use of a heating or cooling standard by households
in 

public

 housing. In addition, the rules provided that renters in 

private

 housing could receive the heating or cooling standard only if the amount of heating or cooling usage was established
through a separate meter. Households not entitled to the heating or cooling standard could claim actual costs.
Legislation governing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEA) program also has had an effect on use of the heating
or cooling standard by households receiving LIHEA and further complicated this policy. The Low-Income Home Energy
Assistance Act of 1981, Title XXVI, Pub. L. 97-35, enacted August 13, 1981, (42 U.S.C. 8621, 

et seq.

) required State agencies to exclude LIHEA payments from income in assistance programs, including the Food Stamp
Program. Under the food stamp rules, households that received direct LIHEA payments and still incurred a heating
or cooling expense in excess of the LIHEA payments were allowed use of the heating or cooling standard. However, households
that received LIHEA assistance in the form of vendor payments made to the energy provider were not entitled to the heating
or cooling standard. Section 273.10(d)(1)(i) provided that any expense covered by an excluded reimbursement or
vendor payment was not deductible. As early as 1981, lawsuits were filed challenging the Department's position on
this issue. (See 

Schmeige 

v. 

USDA,

 693 F.2d 55 (8th Cir. 1982), 

Idaho 

v. 

Block,

 784 F.2d 895 (9th Cir. 1986); and 

Seban 

v. 

Block,

 626 F. Supp. 545 (S.D. Ind. 1985)).
The Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-198 (December 23, 1985) amended the Food Stamp Act to provide that households
which incurred out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses over and above their LIHEA or similar energy assistance
payments were entitled to receive a standard allowance for heating or cooling costs. In the context of entitlement
to a heating or cooling standard, out-of-pocket expenses are those that exceed any energy assistance payments made
to or on behalf of the household. The law allowed State agencies to develop two standard allowances including heating
or cooling expenses: One standard for households that did not receive indirect energy assistance payments and a second
standard for households that received indirect payments and incurred out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses.
(The preamble to regulations published May 21, 1986, 51 FR 18744, 18746, contains a complete explanation of the provisions.)
The amendments to the Food Stamp Act made by the Food Security Act of 1985 were nullified by the Human Services Reauthorization
Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-425 (September 30, 1986), which included a provision affecting the treatment of LIHEA
payments in calculating an excess shelter expense deduction. Section 504(e) of that law provided that LIHEA payments
must be treated consistently regardless of how the payments are distributed to the household and that the full amount
of the payments was to be deemed expended by the household for heating or cooling expenses.
A final rule published February 23, 1987 (52 FR 5434) amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) and 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to require
State agencies to consider energy expenses covered by LIHEA payments made to the energy supplier on behalf of the household
(indirect payments) as deductible shelter expenses. State agencies were required to consider all households receiving
LIHEA as eligible to claim the heating or cooling standard whether or not the household had any out-of-pocket expense.
The rule eliminated a State agency's option to use a separate heating or cooling standard allowance for those households
which received indirect LIHEA payments.

State agencies have indicated that the legislative conflict between the desire to avoid reducing a household's food
stamp allotment when it receives energy assistance and the principle that the heating or cooling standard should
be allowed only when a household actually incurs an out-of-pocket heating or cooling expense has resulted in regulations
that are error-prone and difficult to administer. Numerous policy memoranda and clarifications have been issued
to assist State agencies in determining the circumstances under which a household is entitled to a heating or cooling
standard. However, State agencies continue to raise questions concerning use of the standard. 
Within the constraints of the Food Stamp Act and legislation governing the LIHEA program, we are proposing to revise
7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) to assist State agencies in using a heating or cooling standard and to provide greater flexibility
in developing other standards. Under this proposal, provisions relating to standard utility allowances would be
organized into the following areas: (a) Developing and updating standard utility allowances, (b) entitlement to
a heating or cooling standard, (c) household option, and (d) sharing utility costs. We are also proposing to add the
last sentence of current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) regarding allowable cooling costs to the list of allowable utility
costs in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C) so that all allowable utility costs are listed in one paragraph. The proposed changes
are discussed below. 
a. Developing and updating standard utility allowances. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i), (iii), (iv),
(v), and (vi) set forth the requirements for developing standard utility allowances. They allow State agencies to
use seasonal standards; annual standards that do not have to be adjusted seasonally; separate standards for each
utility expense; or single utility standards that include the cost of heating or cooking fuel, cooling, electricity,
water, sewerage, garbage or trash collection, and the basic service fee for one telephone. 
In an effort to ease confusion and clarify the rules regarding the establishment of utility standards, we are proposing
to consolidate the current rules into a single, revised paragraph, 
7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i). At the same time, we are proposing several changes in existing policy. The changes in policy
are described below. 
Several State agencies have requested and have been granted waivers to use a combined standard for all nonheating
or noncooling expenses. As justification for their waiver requests, State agencies cite difficulty in obtaining
verification for utility expenses and, consequently, increased errors relating to shelter costs when certifying
households. To provide greater State agency flexibility without the need for waivers and to reduce the error-prone
use of actual utility expenses, we are proposing in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) to allow State agencies to develop standard
utility allowances for individual utilities and a combination of utilities. As provided in current regulations,
the allowances may be seasonal or annualized to include costs for all seasons and may be varied by household size or
geographic location. Although the proposal for a combined standard is not as broad as some standards currently in
use, we believe it would provide some additional flexibility to State agencies and would reduce the number of cases
in which workers must verify actual expenses without greatly increasing Program costs.

As provided in current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) and under our proposal, State agencies would not be permitted to develop
a separate standard or decrease the heating or cooling standard for households that receive LIHEA payments. However,
a State agency would be able to develop and use a separate heating/cooling standard for households that receive energy
assistance other than energy assistance provided under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. In developing
other standard utility allowances, State agencies would be required to include only the allowable costs identified
in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C). No additional costs could be added. 
Therefore, under the proposed revision of 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i), State agencies would be allowed to develop the following
standards: (a) A separate standard for each type of utility expense; (b) a standard that includes heating or cooling
costs; (c) a telephone standard; and (d) a combined standard that includes electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage
or trash collection and is available only to households that incur the cost of electricity and either water or sewerage.
State agencies would be allowed to add the telephone standard to a separate standard for electricity, for example,
for households that incur both expenses. The telephone standard could also be added to the combined standard to allow
use of a standard for households that incur costs for electricity, sewerage or water, and telephone.
State agencies could use the heating or cooling standard for households that incur a heating or cooling cost and an
individual standard for households that incur an expense for only one utility, such as electricity. Because State
agencies may develop a variety of standards, the proposed rule specifies that no household shall receive more than
one standard for the same utility expense. For example, if the State agency's combined standard includes the expense
of a basic telephone, a household that receives the combined standard would not also be entitled to a separate telephone
standard. Households whose only utility expense is for a telephone would be entitled to the telephone standard only.

The proposal would require State agencies that develop new standard utility allowances to use FCS-approved methodologies.
The State agency would be required to review the standards annually and submit revised amounts to FCS for approval.
State agencies would be required to submit methodologies used in developing and updating standards to FCS every 3
years. They would also be required to submit the methodologies when they are revised or upon a request from FCS. We are
requiring State agencies to submit methodologies every 3 years so that we will be able to monitor State agency development
and use of standards. 
b. Entitlement to a heating or cooling standard. Another complex and confusing area of policy involving standard
utility allowances is determining who is entitled to a standard that includes heating or cooling costs. We are proposing
in revised  273.9(d)(6)(ii) to clarify and simplify these rules. In doing so, we are attempting to eliminate
inequities that exist in the application of current policy. 
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii) provide that a heating or cooling standard shall be made available only
to households that incur out-of-pocket heating and cooling costs separately from their rent or mortgage and to households
that receive LIHEA. Renters must be billed on a monthly basis by their landlords for actual usage as determined through
individual metering to be entitled to use the standard. Recipients of indirect energy assistance payments other
than LIHEA must incur expenses in excess of the payments during the certification period to qualify for the heating
or cooling standard. Households in public or private housing with a central meter who are billed only for excess usage
are not permitted to use the standard. A household not entitled to the standard can claim actual expenses. 
As indicated above, provisions of interim regulations published November 16, 1982 (47 FR 51551) and finalized June
21, 1988 (48 FR 28190) limited use of the heating or cooling standard by households in public or private housing to those
households whose costs could be verified by separate metering. Previously, households in public or private housing
who could verify that they incurred heating or cooling costs separately from their rent were entitled to use the heating
or cooling standard. Although these households were no longer entitled to a heating or cooling standard under food
stamp rules, they were entitled to the heating or cooling standard if they received LIHEA. Therefore, State agencies
had to determine which households would or would not receive LIHEA before food stamp eligibility and benefits could
be determined. This presented a problem for State agencies, particularly when there was no easy method for exchanging
information with the LIHEA agency. Although this policy has been in effect for some time now, State agencies still
experience difficulty in anticipating entitlement to a heating or cooling standard when a household is entitled
solely because of receipt of LIHEA payments.

Our first proposed change to the rules governing the use of a heating or cooling standard is to provide direct entitlement
to a standard by households in private housing who have heating or cooling costs apart from or in addition to their rent.
Under the proposal, these households would be entitled to use the heating or cooling standard even if their actual
utility usage is not determined by separate metering. 
The amount of the expense could be determined and verified by means other than separate metering, such as a statement
from the landlord. If, in addition to rent, the landlord charges a flat amount for utilities each month which includes
the cost of heating or cooling, the household would be entitled to the heating or cooling standard. Regulations at
7 CFR 273.2(f)(1)(iii) do not require State agencies to verify entitlement to a standard allowance. However, entitlement
to a standard may be verified if it is questionable, as provided in 7 CFR 273.2(f)(2)(i) or under 7 CFR 273.2(f)(3) as
a State agency option. The proposed rule retains the statutory prohibition against use of the heating or cooling standard
by households in 

public

 housing. 
This proposed change would extend use of the standard to households that live separately but share a utility meter.
Under current policy, if two households live separately but have one meter, the households are prohibited from sharing
the standard, and the State agency cannot grant the standard to both households even though both incur heating or cooling
costs. Under the proposed change, the State agency would be required to grant the full heating or cooling standard
to both households if both incur or anticipate incurring out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses separately from
their rent or receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA. 
A second proposed change in the standard utility allowance rules stems from numerous policy questions that have been
raised regarding when and how often a household has to incur an expense in order to be eligible for an annualized heating
or cooling standard. As indicated above, State agencies currently may choose between seasonal heating or cooling
standards and an annualized standard that includes year-round heating and cooling costs. State agencies have complained
that regulations and policy regarding use of an annualized standard are confusing and difficult to administer. We
are proposing in this rule to simplify the regulations for determining when a household is entitled to an annualized
standard utility allowance that includes heating or cooling costs. 
Annualized standards represent the average monthly heating and cooling costs for the entire year. This means that
in some months during the year, and perhaps during the certification period, the household may not have any heating
or cooling costs. For example, a household that previously had no heating or cooling costs applies in June and does
not anticipate incurring any heating or cooling costs during the summer months. However, the household will incur
heating costs in the fall. Regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(d)(4) provide that the State agency shall calculate a household's
expenses based on the expenses the household expects to be billed for during the certification period. Therefore,
if the household above is certified for three summer months and incurs no heating or cooling costs, the household is
not entitled to an annualized standard that includes heating costs. If the household is certified for six months and
anticipates incurring heating costs in the fall, however, it is entitled to the heating standard. State agencies
have complained that this policy is difficult to administer and can result in inequities. 
To reduce the problems associated with determining when a household is entitled to an annualized heating or cooling
standard, we are proposing in this rule that a household that currently incurs or expects to incur out-of-pocket heating
or cooling costs during the next heating or cooling season (except a household in public housing with a central meter
where the household is billed only for excess usage) is entitled to an annualized heating or cooling standard regardless
of when the certification period begins or ends. 
This rule further proposes that the household shall continue to be entitled to the standard until it no longer expects
to incur heating or cooling costs during the next heating or cooling season. The State agency would be required to reexamine
a household's entitlement to the heating or cooling standard at recertification, when the household moves, or when
the household voluntarily reports a change affecting entitlement to the standard.

Under this proposal, a household with no heating or cooling costs which is certified for three summer months and which
expects to be billed for heating costs in the fall would be entitled to a heating or cooling standard at the time of certification.
Also, a household that incurred no heating or cooling expenses in the past which moves to a living arrangement where
it will incur heating costs in the next heating season would be allowed the annualized standard from the time of the
move. If a State agency uses seasonal standards, households would be entitled to the appropriate seasonal standard
if they incur or expect to incur a qualifying expense (or receive or expect to receive a LIHEA payment) during the season
covered by the standard. 
We believe this proposal is more equitable and easier to administer than current policy. We would appreciate specific
comments supporting the proposal or pointing out any problems with the proposed change. 
Although food stamp households are categorically eligible for LIHEA, not all food stamp households receive the assistance,
either because they do not apply for it or because LIHEA funds run out before all eligible households can be served.
This makes it extremely difficult for State agencies to know in advance whether or not a household will receive LIHEA
and be entitled to the standard. To grant the standard beginning with the month the household reports receipt of LIHEA
would not meet the intent of the LIHEA legislation. Therefore, we are also proposing in revised  273.9(d)(6)(ii)
that the State agency shall allow a heating or cooling standard to households that receive or anticipate receiving
LIHEA in the next heating or cooling season. These households shall continue to be entitled to the standard until they
no longer receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA in the next heating or cooling season. The State agency would consult
with the household concerning the household's intention to apply for LIHEA, determine whether or not the household
received LIHEA for the previous season at the same address, and contact the LIHEA agency if necessary to determine
the availability of funds and the likelihood that the household will receive energy assistance. The case worker would
document the case file to support the decision to allow or deny use of the standard. 
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(C) require that households incur recurring costs for heating or cooling
in order to qualify for a heating or cooling standard. The regulations are confusing in that they specify that the household
must be billed regularly, but, if the household is not billed regularly, it may use the standard between billing periods
if it is otherwise eligible to use the standard. Under this proposed revision, the regulatory provisions for billing
would not be needed. Entitlement to the heating or cooling standard would be based on anticipated expenses. Most households
that are responsible for paying heating or cooling expenses have these expenses on a recurring basis. Therefore,
we are proposing to remove the provisions regarding recurring costs from the regulations. We are also proposing to
remove the provisions in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(C) and 7 CFR 273.10(d)(6) regarding households that incur out-of-pocket
expenses for heating or cooling in excess of non-LIHEA energy assistance. These provisions would also be unnecessary
under the proposed revision of the regulations. Any household that receives LIHEA or incurs an out-of-pocket expense
for heating or cooling (except a household in public housing billed only for excess usage) would be entitled to an annualized
heating or cooling standard. 
We are also proposing a conforming amendment to 7 CFR 273.10(d)(3) to provide that standard utility allowances shall
be allowed in accordance with 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6). This change is necessary because the provisions allowing the averaging
of fluctuating expenses and the determination of entitlement to an annualized heating or cooling standard based
upon anticipated heating or cooling costs are exceptions to the provisions regarding billed expenses in 7 CFR 273.10(d)(2)
and anticipating expenses in 7 CFR 273.10(d)(4). 

c. Household option. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(vii) require State agencies to advise households
at the time of certification that, except for the telephone allowance, they may deduct their actual verified utility
costs or the standard allowance throughout the certification period. The State agency is also required to advise
households that they may switch between the use of actual utility costs and the standard at the time of recertification
and one additional time during each twelve-month period. 
State agencies have pointed out that households may move from one residence to another more frequently than once a
year. Current policy is that the household's eligibility for the heating or cooling standard must be redetermined
at the time of the move. We have granted waivers to several State agencies to allow households to choose between actual
expenses or the standard when the household moves without having the choice count as a ``switch.''

This rule proposes to include the provisions of current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(vii) regarding the household option to
use a standard or actual costs in revised  273.9(d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also adds a provision requiring
State agencies to give households that move the option of actual expenses or a standard utility allowance based on
circumstances at the new address. When a household reports a move, it would be the State agency's responsibility to
redetermine the household's entitlement to a standard and give the household the opportunity to choose between actual
costs and the standard, if the household is entitled to the standard. Households that report a move would be granted
the standard on the same basis as applicants. If the household anticipates that it will receive LIHEA or incur out-of-pocket
heating or cooling expenses during the next heating or cooling season at the new address, it would be allowed use of
the standard. The household's choice of a standard or actual costs when it moves would not be considered a switch. 
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(iii)(C) provide that the State agency may mandate use of the telephone allowance
even if actual telephone costs are higher. This provision was included in the regulations because of the concern of
State agencies that use of actual telephone costs would be extremely error-prone. We believe that use of an adequate
telephone standard increases the administrative efficiency of determining a household's excess shelter expense
without any significant adverse effect on households. Therefore, we are proposing to retain the provision of current
7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(v)(C) concerning the telephone allowance and incorporate it in revised  273.9(d)(6)(iii).

 
d. Prorating standard utility allowances. Under section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act, State agencies are required to
prorate a heating or cooling standard among households that live together and share the heating or cooling expense.
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(viii) require State agencies to prorate a standard allowance among households
that live together and share utility expenses. It is not clear in the regulations whether proration is limited to the
heating or cooling standard or whether other standards, such as a telephone standard, must also be prorated among
the households contributing to the payment of the utility cost. Questions have arisen concerning proration of a heating
or cooling standard when one household pays for heat, for example, and another household pays for the water. We believe
it is equitable to prorate any standard among the households sharing the expense included in the standard. 

The current provision indicates that if the State agency is unable to accurately determine the pro rata share of utility
costs paid by the parties, the State agency may use the actual utility costs paid by each household. The regulations
provide that under no circumstances shall the total amount of utility costs used to determine the amount of the deduction
exceed the total amount of actual utility costs for the residence. 

Under this proposed rule, households would be able to share a standard or claim actual verified costs. They would not
be allowed to use a combination of these methods in claiming a deduction for utility expenses. That is, State agencies
could not allow one household to claim a share of the utility standard and allow another household sharing the expense
to claim actual costs. We believe that allowing a combination of actual expenses and a share of the standard is burdensome
on State agencies.

Under this proposal, the total allowable deduction for the residence would not exceed actual costs or one standard
allowance. If one household pays all the utility expenses, that household would be entitled to the applicable standard
or could claim actual costs. The household that did not pay any utility costs would not be able to claim any actual utility
costs or any part of a standard. If one household pays for heat and the other household pays another expense, such as
water, a standard that includes the costs of heating and water would be prorated between the households according
to a method established by the State agency. 

We propose to provide in revised  273.9(d)(6)(iv) of this rule that the State agency shall prorate any utility
standard among all parties incurring an expense covered by the standard or allow actual costs incurred by each party.
The State agency would be able to determine the proration method if a standard is prorated. 



Corrections 



We are taking this opportunity to correct the reference in the first sentence of 7 CFR 273.12(a)(1)(i) to the joint
processing regulations. The correct citation is 7 CFR 273.2(j)(3). 

 


Implementation 



In accordance with the requirements of section 13971(b)(6) of Pub. L. 103-66, this rule provides that the increase
in the excess shelter expense deduction to $231 in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia ($402 in Alaska,
$330 in Hawaii, $280 in Guam, and $171 in the Virgin Islands) will be effective and must be implemented on July 1, 1994;
that the increase to $247 in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia ($249 in Alaska, $353 in Hawaii, $300
in Guam, and $182 in the Virgin Islands) will be effective and must be implemented on October 1, 1995; and that removal
of the excess shelter deduction limit will be effective and must be implemented on January 1, 1997. The changes in provisions
for the homeless shelter estimate in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(i) will be effective July 1, 1994. State agencies are required
to adjust all cases on January 1, 1997 to reflect the deduction for all allowable excess shelter expenses. Restored
benefits must be provided to all households whose cases are not adjusted on the required implementation date. Variances
resulting from implementation of the final rule would be excluded from quality control consideration for 120 days
from the required implementation date in accordance with section 13951 of Pub. L. 103-66. 

We are proposing that the changes in requirements for standard utility allowances made by this rule be effective and
implemented 120 days after publication of the final rule. The affected regulatory sections are: 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C),
273.9(d)(6), 273.10(d)(3), 273.10(d)(6), and 273.12(a)(1)(i). State agencies would be required to adjust the
cases of ongoing households at the next recertification, at household request, or when the case is next reviewed,
whichever comes first. Variances resulting from implementation of the provisions of the final rule shall be excluded
from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date.

(d) 

Income deductions. * * *

(5) Shelter costs. 

(i) Homeless households

. * * * The Department will revise the homeless shelter expense estimate each October
1 to reflect changes in the shelter, fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the CPI-U for the 12 months
ending the preceding June 30 and will notify State agencies of the adjusted amount. * * * 

(ii) 

Household shelter deduction

. 
* * * 

(C) The cost of heating and cooking fuel, cooling (verifiable expenses relating to the operation of air conditioning
systems or room air conditioners), electricity, water, sewerage, garbage and trash collection, the basic service
fee for one telephone (including tax on the basic fee), and fees charged by the utility provider for initial installation
of the utility. One-time deposits shall not be included as shelter costs. 



* * * * * 



(6) 

Standard utility allowances

_(i) 

Developing and updating standard utility allowances. 

A State agency may develop the following standard utility allowances (standards) to be used in place of actual costs
in determining a household's excess shelter deduction: a separate standard for each type of utility expense; a single
standard for all utilities that includes heating or cooling costs; a telephone standard; and a combined standard
that includes electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage or trash collection that is available only to households
that incur the costs of electricity and either water or sewerage. 
The State agency shall submit proposed standards to FCS for approval. The State agency shall update the standards
annually and submit revised amounts to FCS for approval. State agencies shall submit methodologies used in developing
and updating standards to FCS for review every 3 years, when there is a change in the methodology, and upon a request
from FCS. State agencies may use a heating or cooling standard, a combined standard, and individual standards. However,
they shall not allow households the use of two standards that include the same expense. The State agency may elect to
use seasonal standards that include heating or cooling costs or an annual standard that does not have to be adjusted
seasonally. The State agency may vary the allowance by factors such as household size or geographical area. Only utility
costs identified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section shall be used in developing standards. The State agency
shall not use a reduced standard for households that receive assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance
Act (LIHEAA) of 1981. Households shall be allowed to use standards that include heating or cooling costs in accordance
with paragraphs (d)(6)(ii), (d)(6)(iii) and (d)(6)(iv) of this section. Households whose only utility expense
is for a telephone are entitled to only the separate telephone standard if one has been developed by the State agency.

(ii) 

Entitlement to a heating or cooling standard. 

A standard with a heating or cooling component shall be made available to households that incur heating or cooling
expenses separately from their rent or mortgage or expect to incur such expenses in the next heating or cooling season,
except households in public housing units which have central utility meters and charge households only for excess
utility costs. Households that receive assistance under the LIHEAA but do not incur out-of-pocket heating or cooling
expenses are also entitled to a standard that includes a heating or cooling component on the same basis as households
that incur such costs. Households that receive other indirect energy assistance are entitled to a standard that includes
heating or cooling only if they incur out-of-pocket expenses for heating or cooling costs. Entitlement to an annualized
heating or cooling standard shall continue until the household no longer incurs or expects to incur a heating or cooling
expense or no longer receives or expects to receive a LIHEAA payment during the next heating or cooling season. If the
State agency elects to use seasonal standards, the State agency shall ensure that a standard is provided only to households
that incur or expect to incur an expense that would entitle the household to the standard or receive or expect to receive
a LIHEAA payment during the season covered by the standard. 


(iii) 

Household option. 

The State agency shall advise a household at the time of certification and whenever it reports a move that it may deduct
verified actual utility costs (for any allowable expense identified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C) of this section)
it incurs rather than the standard (except for the telephone standard) throughout the certification period if actual
expenses are more than the standard or the household is not eligible for the standard. The State agency may require
use of the telephone standard for the cost of basic telephone service even if actual costs are higher. The State agency
shall also inform the household that it may switch between use of actual utility costs and the standard at recertification
and one additional time during each twelve-month period. 



(iv) 

Sharing utility expenses. 

If a household lives with and shares utility expenses with another individual, another household, or both, the State
agency shall prorate a standard among the household and the other individual, household, or both, or allow the actual
costs of each household. The State agency shall determine the proration method if a standard is used. 


* * * * * 



(8) 

Adjustment of shelter deduction

. (i) * * * Effective July 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, the excess shelter expense
deduction shall not exceed $231 a month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, $402 in Alaska, $330
in Hawaii, $280 in Guam, and $171 in the Virgin Islands. 
Effective October 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $247 a
month in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, $429 in Alaska, $353 in Hawaii, $300 in Guam, and $182
in the Virgin Islands. Effective January 1, 1997, the limit on the excess shelter expense deduction is removed.

Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors) proposes to amend a provision of the Uniform
Rules of Practice and Procedure adopted by the Board. The proposal is intended to clarify that the rules' provisions
relating to 

ex parte

 communications conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, the proposed
amendment would clarify that the 

ex parte

 provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision of the Administrative
Procedure Act.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


 In August 1991, the Board of Governors adopted the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (``Rules'') (56 FR 38048,
Aug. 9, 1991). The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) have also adopted the Rules (OCC, 56 FR 38024,
Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The
Board of Governors now proposes to amend one aspect of the Rules relating to 

ex parte 

communications to clarify that the Rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The other
agencies are considering proposing a similar amendment. 
Currently,  263.9 of the Rules prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from
making an 

ex parte

 communication to the Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When
the Rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991)
explained that the proposed rule regarding 

ex parte 

communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding 

ex parte

 communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA
itself. 

The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's 

ex parte 

communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 

outside the agency

'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 

Intra-agency 

communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended
decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel.
The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party
on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate.


5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial
staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. 



The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, neglected to mention the separation of functions concept explicitly,
and appeared to apply the 

ex parte 

communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the
agency head, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested
in the proceeding'' on the other. The Board of Governors does not interpret this provision as limiting agency enforcement
staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however,
the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the 

ex parte 

communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The Board of Governors did not intend this result. 


The proposed amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting
the prohibition on 

ex parte 

communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States. 


II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board of Governors hereby certifies that this proposed
rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly,
a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

This proposed rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure
exclusively. Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised
regulation is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 737-300, -400, and -500 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes. This proposal
would require replacement of the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. This proposal is prompted by reports
of a binding condition in the clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are 
intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane due to binding of a clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer
trim electric actuator.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Comments Invited 


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by 
submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications 
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address 
specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for 
comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. 
The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and
after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing
each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-198-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter. 


Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket 
No. 94-NM-198-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056. 


Discussion 


Recently, the FAA has received reports from operators of Boeing Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series
airplanes that the stabilizer trim wheel continued to turn after the switches for the stabilizer trim had been operated
and released. Investigation revealed that the clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator may
have caused the clutch to bind intermittently. 

Normally, when the switches for the stabilizer trim are operated, the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator
turns and engages either the ``nose up'' or the ``nose down'' clutch, which causes the stabilizer to move. When the
switches for the stabilizer trim are released, the clutch disengages, and the actuator continues to turn until it
stops (coasts) 
through deceleration. Under normal operating conditions, the stabilizer movement stops 
immediately after the clutch disengages. 
However, a binding clutch may cause the stabilizer to continue to move while the electric actuator coasts. The stabilizer
may move in the direction it was last commanded or it may reverse and move in the opposite direction. The direction depends
on which clutch disk is binding. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the
airplane. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
737-27A1191, Revision 1, dated November 3, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of horizontal
stabilizer trim electric actuators, having part number (P/N) 10-62033-3, with a different model (P/N
10-62033-4) that eliminates the problems associated with binding of the clutch disk. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the electric actuator of the stabilizer trim with a different
model. The actions would be 
required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described 
previously.

 

[

Note: 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association 
(ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may 
misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability 
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the 
AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly 
assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability
provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such
a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative
method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note
has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.]

 


There are approximately 1,448 Model 737-300, -400, and -500 series airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 590 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD,
that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average
labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be approximately $600 per airplane. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $495,600, or $840 per airplane.


The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 (Military) Series
Airplanes and Model MD-88 Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 (military) series airplanes and Model MD-88 airplanes.
This proposal would require a visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs on the
ignition selector switch, and removal and correct installation of any improperly installed wire termination lugs.
This proposal would also require application of sealant to the wire termination lugs and the attachment screws. This
proposal is prompted by a report that, during the manufacturer's production flight testing, an abnormal engine start
valve open annunciation for engine No. 2 occurred and resulted in an uncontained failure of the engine starter. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent engine
components, and possible fire in the cowling, due to an uncontained failure of the engine starter.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received.
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket.
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-172-AD.''

Availability of NPRMs


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-172-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.


Discussion


The FAA has received a report that, during the manufacturer's production flight testing, an abnormal engine start
valve open annunciation for engine No. 2 occurred on a Model DC-9 series airplane. After the airplane landed,
inspection revealed that an uncontained failure of the engine starter on engine No. 2 had occurred. Investigation
revealed that a wire termination lug in the ignition selector switch was installed barrel down, and consequently,
contacted an adjacent terminal, causing an electrical short. This electrical short at the ignition selector switch
caused the engine start valve to stay open and resulted in an uncontained failure of the engine starter. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent engine components, and possible
fire in the cowling.
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-9 Service Bulletin 24-121, dated February 24,
1992, which describes procedures for visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs
on the ignition selector switch. This service bulletin also describes procedures for removal and proper installation
of the wire termination lug if it is found to be installed incorrectly. Additionally, the service bulletin describes
procedures for the application of a sealant to the termination lugs and attachment screws.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination
lugs on the ignition selector switch. The proposed AD would also require removal of the wire termination lugs and reinstallation,
if they are installed improperly. Additionally, the proposed AD would require the application of a sealant to the
termination lugs and attachment screws. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously.



[

Note:

 As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.]



There are approximately 1,954 Model DC-9, DC-9-80, and C-9 series airplanes, and Model MD-88
airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,097 airplanes of U.S. registry would
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be nominal. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $131,640 or $120 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft

The Proposal




The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace to accommodate a VOR runway 27 SIAP, at Rantoul National Aviation Center Airport, Rantoul, IL. Controlled
airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect
of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions
from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined
area which would enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently
in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Liability of Third Parties Paying or Providing for Wages: Suit Period and Its Extension and Maximum Amount Recoverable



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed amendments regarding the liability of lenders, sureties, or other third persons
for withholding taxes when those persons have supplied funds, either directly to employees or to or for the account
of an employer, for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer.



The amendments revise the regulations under section 3505(b) with regard to the maximum liability of third parties
who supply funds for wages. The amendments also revise the regulations under section 3505 to increase the period of
limitations for collection after assessment of third-party liability, consistent with the statutory extension
of general limitation on collections the Internal Revenue Code, and to permit the third party to consent to extend
that period of limitations. The proposed amendments affect third parties paying or providing for wages.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed changes to  31.3505-1. Section 3505 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code) was added by section 105(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-719 (1966). Treasury
regulations were issued with an effective date of August 19, 1976 (TD 7430). Neither the Code section nor the regulations
has been amended since enactment or issuance, respectively. Since the issuance of the regulations, courts have consistently
determined the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds for wages in a manner that is contrary to the existing
regulations. Administrative difficulties have also arisen because the self-imposed period of limitations on collection
of these liabilities differs from the Code's general limitation on collections, and there is no provision in the regulations
to extend this period by agreement.

The proposed amendments revise the regulations with regard to the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds
for wages to conform to judicial interpretation of the statute. To aid administration of this provision, the proposed
amendments also (i) increase the self-imposed period of limitations for collection of section 3505 liabilities,
consistent with the 1990 extension of the Code's general limitation on collections (See section 6502), from 6 years
to 10 years and (ii) add a provision allowing this period to be extended with the consent of the third party.



Explanation of Provisions



Under section 3505(b), if a lender, surety, or other person (the lender) supplies funds to or for the account of an employer
for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer, and the lender has actual notice or knowledge
(within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) that the employer does not intend or will not be able to make timely payment
or deposit of the required withholding taxes, the lender shall be liable to the United States in a sum equal to the taxes
(together with interest) that are not paid over to the United States by the employer with respect to those wages. The
lender's liability for withholding taxes, in lieu of the employer, is limited to an amount equal to 25 percent of the
amount of wages so supplied to or for the account of the employer. Code section 3505(b) (final sentence).

Existing regulations provide that the 25-percent limitation applies only to the tax, and not the interest on that
tax, with the result that the lender could be held liable for more than 25 percent of the amount of funds it supplied.
The courts that have addressed this issue, however, have held that the 25-percent limitation on the amount of wages
supplied by a third party is an absolute cap with respect to the recovery of withholding taxes and prejudgment interest.


United States v. Metro Constr. Co., Inc.,

 602 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1979); 

United States v. Intercontinental Ind., Inc.,

 635 F.2d 1215 (6th Cir. 1980); 

United States v. Hannan Co.,

 639 F.2d 284 (5th Cir. 1981); 

Taubman v. United States,

 449 F. Supp. 520 (E.D. Mich. 1978). 

See also O'Hare v. United States,

 878 F.2d 953 (6th Cir. 1989); 

United States v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc.,

 956 F.2d 703 (7th Cir. 1992); 

United States v. Vaccarella,

 735 F. Supp. 1421 (S.D. Ind. 1990).

The proposed amendments conform the existing regulations to judicial interpretation and clarify that interest
will continue to be computed in addition to any withholding tax liability, but only to an overall maximum of 25 percent
of the amount of the funds supplied by the lender.

The proposed revisions to the regulations also change the period of limitations for collection of the withholding
taxes and interest from six years to ten years. This revision will conform the period of limitations for the purposes
of section 3505 with the general rule on limitations on collection. See Internal Revenue Code section 6502, amended
by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-508,  11317(a)(1) (1990).

Finally,  31.3505-1(d)(3) has been added to the regulations to provide for extensions of the period of
limitation for collection because, on occasion, the IRS or the lender requires additional time for compliance with
the regulation.



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.



Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely
submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will
be published in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is Robert Walker, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (General Litigation).
However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework;
Reopening of the Public Comment Period



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Reopening of the public comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 6, 1994, EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of certain organic hazardous air pollutants from
aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities which are part of major sources under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act
as amended in 1990. The period for receiving public comment on the proposed rule ended on September 15, 1994. This action
announces the reopening of the comment period to take comments on several amendments to the proposed rulemaking and
other issues raised during the original comment period; clarification of the intent of a proposed requirement; and
a correction of a typographical error.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background



On June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29216), national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the aerospace manufacturing
and rework source category were proposed. Since that time, the EPA has received information on several aspects of
the proposed rule which has led to the amendments being proposed in this notice for the following sections of the proposed
subpart GG of 40 CFR part 63:   63.742, 63.745, 63.747, 63.749, 63.751, and 63.752. These sections deal
with definitions, standards for primer and topcoat application operations, standards for chemical milling maskant
application operations, compliance determinations, monitoring requirements, and recordkeeping requirements,
respectively, for the NESHAP for aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities. This notice announces the reopening
of the comment period for the aerospace NESHAP. However, only comments limited to the subjects listed below will be
considered.

(1) Correction of a typographical error regarding a request for comments for commercial exterior primers;

(2) Proposal of a more stringent inorganic HAP emission control requirement for new primer and topcoat application
operations and proposal of definition of high efficiency particulate air filter;

(3) Proposal to eliminate the exemption for chemical milling maskant application operations for use with Type I chemical
milling etchants;

(4) Clarification of the intent of the proposed requirement for control devices used to control emissions from coating
application operations;

(5) Proposal of reduced recordkeeping requirements to encourage the use of a low VOC primer;

(6) Request for comment on depainting for private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft;

(7) Request for comment on use and efficiency of control devices for depainting operations using HAP-containing
chemicals; and

(8) Request for comment on determining the appropriate length of the rolling material balance period for liquid-liquid
material balances for carbon adsorbers used as control devices for solvent recovery systems.

These actions are further discussed in Part III of this preamble.

As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 59 FR 29217, the EPA traditionally issues a draft CTG containing
recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than issue a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA used the
notice of proposed rulemaking to request public comment on draft best available control measures (BACM), which is
the same as the proposed maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for coatings and solvents. Comments on the
proposed rule and on the proposed amendments in this document will also be considered in formulating a final BACM.

The proposed regulatory text is not included in this 

Federal Register

 notice, but is available in Docket No. A-92-20 or by written or telephone request from the Air and Radiation
Docket and Information Center (see 

ADDRESSES

). This notice with the proposed regulatory language is also available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN),
one of EPA's electronic bulletin boards. The TTN provides information and technology exchange in various areas of
air pollution control. The service is free, except for the cost of a phone call. Dial (919) 541-5742 for up to a
14,400 bps modem. If more information on TTN is needed, call the HELP line at (919) 541-5384.



II. Summary of and Rationale for Changes to the Proposed Rule and Request for Public Comments



A. Correction: Request for Comments on Commercial Exterior Primers



Section II.B.2.a of the preamble to the proposed rule requested comments concerning whether the proposed organic
HAP and VOC limits for commercial exterior topcoats represents demonstrated technology. This section should have
referenced commercial exterior primers rather than topcoats. Consequently, the specific paragraph in this section
(see 59 FR 29224, middle column) should read as follows:




The EPA has received information indicating that the organic HAP and VOC content limits for primers do not represent
demonstrated technology for exterior commercial primers. Consequently, the EPA is soliciting comments on whether
a separate category should be developed for exterior commercial primers with organic HAP and VOC content levels higher
than the proposed levels for primers. These comments should provide a technical justification for a higher limit,
including why currently available commercial primers cannot be used by all sources.

B. Amendment: New Source Requirements for Inorganic HAP Emissions from Coating Operations



The EPA has received information that at least one facility is controlling inorganic HAP emissions from coating operations
to a greater degree than that required in the proposed rule. This facility is using high efficiency particulate air
(HEPA) filters in addition to the filtration methods required in the proposed rule. Consequently, the EPA is proposing
that  63.745 require new primer and topcoat application operations to use HEPA filters in addition to the requirements
specified in the rule proposed on June 6, 1994. Finally, the EPA is proposing that these sources keep records of documentation
supplied by the filter manufacturer that the filter being used meets the HEPA filter requirements specified in the
definition in  63.742 being proposed by this notice.



C. Amendment: Inclusion of Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operations for Use With Type I Chemical Milling
Etchants



As proposed on June 6, 1994, the rule would apply only to those chemical milling maskant application operations in
which Type II chemical milling etchants are subsequently used. This was based on information the EPA received showing
that no facilities had implemented controls (either low VOC product substitutions or control devices) on chemical
milling maskant application operations for use with Type I chemical milling etchants. Since proposal, the EPA has
received comment that there is at least one chemical milling maskant application operation for use with Type I chemical
milling etchants (which are not currently covered in the proposed rule) with reduced organic HAP and VOC content levels.
The information supplied to the EPA, however, did not detail the applicability of this chemical milling maskant to
all Type I etchant operations.

The MACT floor for chemical milling maskant application operations, as determined by the average of the best performing
12 percent of sources for which the EPA had emission information, included the use of control devices (e.g., carbon
adsorbers) as well as low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskants. As mentioned above, the applicability
of the low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskant for which the EPA received comment is unknown. However,
the use of the same control device technology as used for Type II chemical milling operations is applicable to Type
I chemical milling operations. Consequently, the EPA is proposing to eliminate the exemption in  63.747 for
chemical milling maskants used with Type I etchants and require them to meet the same requirements as chemical milling
maskants for use with Type II etchants. This will allow the use of any low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling
maskant that meets the 160 grams per liter (1.3 pounds per gallon) organic HAP and VOC content limits or the use of control
devices as specified in the proposed rule.



D. Amendment: Requirement for the Capture of All Emissions by Control Devices



The proposed rule required that whenever a control device is used to meet the emission limitations specified, the
owner or operator must meet two provisions in order to demonstrate compliance. The first is that the overall control
efficiency, taking into account capture and control efficiency, must be at least 81 percent. The second provision,
as specified in   63.745(c)(1), 63.747(d)(1), 63.749(d)(4)(ii)(A), and 63.749(g)(3)(ii)(A) of the
proposed rule, requires that all of the emissions from the respective operations be captured and controlled by the
control device. In addition, the latter two paragraphs specify that all emissions must be controlled other than ``incidental
emissions that may escape the capture system.'' 

The EPA has reviewed these provisions based on comments that have been received concerning their enforceability.
Based on this review, the EPA has concluded that the provision specifying an overall control efficiency is adequate
to ensure application of MACT. The additional language only added confusion to the proposed rule without any added
environmental benefit. The EPA, therefore, is deleting from the proposed rule the four paragraphs referenced above
concerning the capture of all emissions from coating operations.



E. Amendment: Reduced Recordkeeping Requirements for Low Organic HAP and VOC Content Primer



The EPA has received information that a low organic HAP and VOC content (approximately 250 grams VOC per liter (2.1
pounds per gallon) less water and exempt solvents) military waterborne primer has been qualified according to military
specification MIL-P-85582A, Type I, Class II. While this primer may not represent demonstrated technology
for all types of uses, the EPA wishes to encourage the use of low organic HAP and VOC content coatings. Consequently,
the EPA is proposing to amend the recordkeeping requirements of  63.752 of the proposed rule to require that
only annual purchasing records be maintained on the use of any primer that contains a maximum of 250 grams organic HAP
per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water as applied and 250 grams VOC per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water
and exempt solvents as applied. This significantly reduces the recordkeeping from the monthly records required
for coatings with higher organic HAP and VOC contents.



F. Request for Comments: Depainting Requirements for Private, Corporate, and Small Commuter Aircraft



The EPA has received comments that the proposed standards for depainting do not represent demonstrated technology
for private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft. Specifically, the commenters stated that depainting of these
aircraft cannot be accomplished through the use of non-HAP chemical strippers or media blasting methods. One commenter
also stated that the physical characteristics of the coatings typically used on the exterior of private and corporate
aircraft cannot be removed by the non-HAP chemical strippers currently on the market. Another comment concerned
the use of a control device, such as carbon absorbers followed by a catalytic incinerator, to reduce emissions from
depainting operations where HAP-containing chemical strippers are used as an alternative means of compliance.

<PARENT> FR941122-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In order to obtain additional and more specific information on this sector of the aerospace rework industry, the EPA
is requesting data and information on the following specific issues: 
1. One commenter stated that to achieve the finish quality demanded by private and corporate aircraft purchasers,
the aircraft manufacturers are using coatings that have a cross-linked polymer structure. According to the commenter,
the structure of these coatings does not allow the non-HAP chemical strippers to penetrate the coating in order to
break the bond between the coating and substrate. The EPA requests information on whether non-HAP chemical strippers
have been shown to be effective on this type of coating. Commenters are requested to provide as many details as possible
of non-HAP chemical depainting processes such as type and number of aircraft depainted, specific type of primer and
topcoats removed, VOC content (as applied, less water and exempt solvents) of the primer and topcoat removed, and
method of disposal of the waste stripper. Information on the cross-linked polymer coatings (e.g., VOC content, manufacturer)
and its finish characteristics are also requested. 
In addition, the EPA requests comments on whether coatings other than cross-linked polymers can be used on private
and corporate aircraft. Information requested includes: whether substitute coatings can be used to achieve similar
finishes; whether these other coatings are easier to strip; VOC content (as applies, less water and exempt solvents)
of these other coatings; application methods; whether changing coatings or not painting aircraft would affect aircraft
safety; and the economic impacts of changing coatings or not painting aircraft. 
2. Another commenter focused on the thin exterior skin panels of private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft.
The commenter said that since weight is a critical parameter for these aircraft, very thin exterior skin panels, that
are very susceptible to damage from blast depainting methods, are typically used. The commenter states that as a consequence,
no rework facilities are currently using blast depainting methods on these aircraft.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941122-1-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941122-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Information on this topic is requested from any facility that has evaluated or is currently using any blast depainting
method or non-chemical means to remove coatings from the exterior of private, corporate, or small commuter aircraft.
Specifically, the information should document both successful and unsuccessful applications of blast or mechanical
depainting methods for these aircraft, or any other aircraft with similarly thin exterior skin panels. Any information
on the generation and control of emissions from blast or mechanical depainting operations (of any type of aircraft)
would also be beneficial. 


G. Request for Comment: Control Devices for Depainting Operations Using HAP-Containing Chemicals 


Another commenter recommended that conventional chemical strippers (containing HAPs) be allowed when emissions
are reduced through the use of a control device. The commenter stated that a combination of a carbon adsorber and catalytic
incinerator can achieve greater than 99 percent removal efficiency, and would be essentially equal to the depainting
standard of no HAP emissions. 
Information submitted on this topic should address the feasibility of installing such a control system, including
cost and ability to achieve greater than 99 percent removal efficiency on a dilute airstream. Also, since some portion
of the volatile HAP content of conventional strippers will be retained in the waste sludge produced from the operation,
commenters should detail the ultimate fate of emissions from the volatile HAPs in the waste stream. For example, a
conventional waste treatment system may aerate the waste stream as an initial processing step, emitting the volatile
HAPs at that point. However, other waste treatment methods may destroy HAPs before the aeration step. Comments are
also requested on whether a standard allowing the use of control devices to reduce emissions from depainting operations
should apply only to the depainting of private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft, or if it should apply to military
and commercial aircraft as well. 


H. Request for Comment: Appropriate Length of Rolling Material Balance Period for Liquid-Liquid Material Balances
for Carbon Adsorbers Used as Control Devices on Solvent Recovery Systems 


The EPA proposed Method 309, ``Method to Determine Length of Rolling Period for Liquid/Liquid Material Balance Method''
to determine the length of the rolling material balance period for the liquid-liquid material balance for carbon
adsorbers used as control devices on solvent recovery systems. Several comments have been received concerning whether
Method 309 is the most appropriate method for the aerospace industry in all instances. Therefore, the EPA is requesting
comment on alternatives to Method 309. Information in support of alternatives to Method 309 
should include how the length of the balance period is determined; discussions of operations that make an alternate
determination of length appropriate; discussions concerning how compliance is indicated and ensured with the alternative
determination; whether the alternative determination has been approved by state or local air pollution agencies
in permits or other documents; and why Method 309 does not allow for the alternative determination. 


III. Administrative Requirements 


A. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The changes detailed in this notice will have the following effects on the information collection burden (recordkeeping,
reporting, and monitoring requirements) of the proposed rule: 
(1) The request for comments concerning commercial exterior primers does not affect the information collection
burden of the proposed rule; 
(2) New sources would be required to use HEPA filter and to maintain records documenting that the filters used meet
the requirements of HEPA filters, but this would not significantly increase the recordkeeping burden; 
(3) The inclusion of Type I chemical milling maskants would require the same recordkeeping and reporting requirements
as specified for Type II chemical milling maskants. Since the EPA has no information on which to base an estimate of
the number of facilities currently using Type I chemical milling etchants, the magnitude of the effect on the information
collection burden cannot be made; 
(4) The deletion of the requirement to capture and control all of the emissions from coating operations does not affect
the information collection burden of the proposed rule; and 
(5) Reducing the recordkeeping requirements for low organic HAP and VOC content primers will result in a decrease
in the information collection requirements for those facilities that use these primers. However, the EPA has no information
on which to base an estimate of the number of facilities that will use the low organic HAP and VOC content primers. Therefore,
the magnitude of the effect on the information collection request burden cannot be made. 
Even though the effect on the information collection burden cannot be completely quantified, the EPA believes that
it will not significantly change. Therefore, the Information Collection Request document developed for the proposed
rule has not been revised. 


B. Executive Order 12866 Review 


This rule was classified as ``non-significant'' under Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, was not reviewed by
the Office of Management and Budget.

Clean Air Act Proposed Interim Approval of Title V Operating Permits Program; Ventura County Air Pollution Control
District, California


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes interim approval of the Operating Permits Program submitted by the Ventura County Air Pollution
Control District (APCD) for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements that mandate that states develop,
and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background and Purpose


As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules that define
the minimum elements of an approvable state operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of state operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250
(July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 CFR part 70. Title V requires states to develop and submit to EPA, by
November 15, 1993, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other
sources.
The Act requires that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The
EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act, which outlines criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date,
or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.



II. Proposed Action and Implications


A. Analysis of State Submission


The analysis contained in this notice focuses on specific elements of Ventura's title V operating permits program
that must be corrected to meet the minimum requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The full program submittal, the Technical
Support Document (TSD), which contains a detailed analysis of the submittal, and other relevant materials are available
for inspection as part of the public docket. The docket may be viewed during regular business hours at the address listed
above.


1. Title V Program Support Materials


Ventura's title V program was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on November 16, 1993. Additional
material was submitted on December 6, 1993. The submittal was found to be administratively complete on February 4,
1994. The Governor's letter requesting source category-limited interim approval, California enabling legislation,
and Attorney General's legal opinion were submitted by CARB for all districts in California and therefore were not
included separately in Ventura's submittal. The Ventura submission does contain a complete program description,
District implementing and supporting regulations, and all other program documentation required by  70.4.
An implementation agreement is currently being developed between Ventura and EPA.


2. Title V Operating Permit Regulations and Program Implementation 


Ventura's regulations that implement part 70 include Rule 8, Access to Facilities; Rule 15, Standards for Permit
Issuance; Rule 15.1, Sampling and Testing Facilities; Rule 23, Exemption from Permit; Rule 26.1, New Source Review
(definitions of ``modified emissions unit,'' ``new emissions unit,'' and ``stationary source'' only); Rule 29,
Conditions on Permits (paragraph C only); Rule 33, Part 70 Permits; and Rule 42, Permit Fees. These rules, in conjunction
with authorities granted under California State law, substantially meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, sections
70.2 and 70.3 for applicability; sections 70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 for permit content, including operational flexibility;
section 70.7 for public participation and minor permit modifications; section 70.5 for complete application forms;
and section 70.11 for enforcement authority. Although the regulations substantially meet part 70 requirements,
there are several program deficiencies that are outlined under section II.B. below as interim approval issues and
further described in the Technical Support Document. 



Variances.

 Ventura County APCD has the authority to issue a variance from requirements (except the requirement to obtain a permit
to construct or operate)imposed by state and local law. See California HSC sections 42350-42364 and Ventura
Regulation VII. In the opinion submitted with California operating permit programs, California's Attorney General
states that ``[t]he variance process is not part of the Title V permitting process and does not affect Federal enforcement
for violations of the requirements set forth in a Title V permit.'' (Emphasis in original.) 
The EPA regards the State and District variance provisions as wholly external to the program submitted for approval
under part 70 and consequently is proposing to take no action on these provisions of state and local law. The EPA has
no authority to approve provisions of state law that are inconsistent with the CAA. The EPA does not recognize the ability
of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty to comply with a federally enforceable part 70 permit, except
where such relief is granted through procedures allowed by part 70. A part 70 permit may be issued or revised (consistent
with part 70 permitting procedures), to incorporate those terms of a variance that are consistent with applicable
requirements. A part 70 permit may also incorporate, via part 70 permit issuance or revision procedures, the schedule
of compliance set forth in a variance. However, EPA reserves the right to pursue enforcement of applicable requirements
notwithstanding the existence of a compliance schedule in a permit to operate. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C),
which states that a schedule of compliance ``shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with,
the applicable requirements on which it is based.''



Permit content.

 EPA is specifically approving the General part 70 Permit Conditions that were submitted as part of Ventura's part
70 program. Any modifications to these general conditions must be approved by EPA. Failure to include these conditions
in part 70 permits will be cause for EPA to object to a District operating permit. See  70.8(c)(1).
Ventura's permit content rule (Rule 33.3) does not include the level of detail regarding periodic monitoring found
in  70.6(a)(3)(i)(B). Paragraphs A.1. and A.3. of Rule 33 more generally address the requirements for periodic
monitoring. These paragraphs provide that operating permits issued pursuant to this rule will assure compliance
with all applicable requirements and will include conditions establishing all applicable emissions monitoring
and analysis procedures etc., required under all applicable requirements. Although the rule does not explicitly
state that the periodic monitoring or testing will be ``sufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time period
that are representative of the source's compliance period * * *,'' the more general language
cited above is consistent with this requirement. Should Ventura draft a permit that does not meet the requirements
of  70.6(a)(3)(i)(B), EPA will exercise its authority under  70.8(c)(1) and will object to the permit.



Insignificant activities.

 Section 70.4(b)(2) requires states to include in their part 70 programs any criteria used to determine insignificant
activities or emission levels for the purposes of determining complete applications. Section 70.5(c) states that
an application for a part 70 permit may not omit information needed to determine the applicability of, or to impose,
any applicable requirement, or to evaluate appropriate fee amounts. Section 70.5(c) also states that EPA may approve,
as part of a state program, a list of insignificant activities and emissions levels which need not be included in permit
applications. Under part 70, a state must request and EPA must approve as part of that state's program any activity
or emission level that the state wishes to consider insignificant. Part 70, however, does not establish appropriate
emission levels for insignificant activities, relying instead on a case-by-case determination of appropriate
levels based on the particular circumstances of part 70 program under review. 
Ventura provided its current permit exemption list as its list of insignificant activities. Because EPA was provided
no criteria or information on the level of emissions of activities on Ventura's exemptions list and no demonstration
that these activities are not likely to be subject to an applicable requirement, EPA cannot propose full approval
of the list as the basis for determining insignificant activities. 
For other state programs, EPA has proposed to accept, as sufficient for full approval, emission levels for insignificant
activities of 2 tons per year for criteria pollutants and the lesser of 1000 pounds per year, section 112(g) de minimis
levels, or other title I significant modification levels for HAPs and other toxics (40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(i)). EPA
believes that these levels are sufficiently below applicability thresholds for many applicable requirements to
assure that no unit potentially subject to an applicable requirement is left off a title V application and are consistent
with current permitting thresholds in Ventura County. EPA is requesting comment on the appropriateness of these
emission levels for determining insignificant activities in Ventura County. This request for comment is not intended
to restrict the ability of the District to propose and EPA to approve other emission levels if the District demonstrates
that such alternative emission levels are insignificant compared to the level of emissions from and types of units
that are permitted or subject to applicable requirements. 



Definition of title I modification.

 Ventura's definition of ``title I modification'' does not include changes reviewed under a minor source preconstruction
review program (``minor NSR changes''). The EPA is currently in the process of determining the proper definition
of that phrase. As further explained below, EPA has solicited public comment on whether the phrase ``modification
under any provision of title I of the Act'' in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5) should be interpreted to mean literally any
change at a source that would trigger permitting authority review under regulations approved or promulgated under
title I of the Act. This would include state preconstruction review programs approved by EPA as part of the State Implementation
Plan under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Clean Air Act. 
On August 29, 1994, EPA proposed revisions to the interim approval criteria in 40 CFR 70.4(d) to, among other things,
allow state programs with a more narrow definition of ``title I modifications'' to receive interim approval (59 FR
44572). The Agency explained its view that the better reading of ``title I modifications'' includes minor NSR and
pre-1990 NESHAP requirements, and solicited public comment on the proper interpretation of that term (59 FR
44573). The Agency stated that if, after considering the public comments, it continued to believe that the phrase
``title I modifications'' should be interpreted as including minor NSR changes, it would revise the interim approval
criteria as needed to allow states with a narrower definition to be eligible for interim approval.
The EPA hopes to finalize its rulemaking revising the interim approval criteria under 40 CFR 70.4(d) expeditiously.

1

 If EPA establishes in its rulemaking that the definition of ``title I modifications'' can be interpreted to exclude
changes reviewed under minor NSR programs, Ventura's definition of ``title I modification'' would be fully consistent
with part 70. Conversely, if EPA establishes through the rulemaking that the definition must include changes reviewed
under minor NSR, Ventura's definition of ``title I modifications'' will become a basis for interim approval. If the
definition becomes a basis for interim approval as a result of EPA's rulemaking, Ventura would be required to revise
its definition to conform to the requirements of part 70. 





Accordingly, today's proposed approval does not identify 
Ventura's definition of ``title I modification'' as necessary grounds for either interim approval or disapproval.
Again, although EPA has reasons for believing that the better interpretation of ``title I modifications'' is the
broader one, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to determine whether this is a program deficiency until EPA
completes its rulemaking on this issue.



3. Permit Fee Demonstration 



Section 502(b)(3) of the Act requires that each permitting authority collect fees sufficient to cover all reasonable
direct and indirect costs required to develop and administer its title V operating permits program. Each title V program
submittal must contain either a detailed demonstration of fee adequacy or a demonstration that aggregate fees collected
from title V sources meet or exceed $25 per ton of emissions per year (adjusted from 1989 by the Consumer Price Index
(CPI)). The $25 per ton amount is presumed, for program approval, to be sufficient to cover all reasonable program
costs and is thus referred to as the ``presumptive minimum'' ( 70.9(b)(2)(i)). 
Ventura has opted to make a presumptive minimum fee demonstration. Ventura's existing fee schedule requires title
V facilities to pay an average of $65.34 per ton in annual renewal fees. Ventura calculated its fee level at $65.34 per
ton by adding up the annual renewal fees paid by sources identified as title V facilities ($1,192,780), and dividing
that number by the permitted emissions (tons per year of regulated air pollutants) of those facilities (18,254.2
tons per year). The numbers in the calculation underestimate fee revenues and overestimate actual emissions, and
therefore result in a conservative calculation of the fees collected per ton of pollutant. Ventura's fee demonstration
shows that currently assessed renewal fees will be adequate to cover program costs for the next four years. For more
information, see section VI of Ventura's Title V Operating Permit Program Description, available in the docket.




4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act 





a. Authority and commitments for section 112 implementation.

 Ventura has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all section
112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in the State of California enabling
legislation and in regulatory provisions defining ``federally enforceable requirements'' and stating that the
permit must incorporate all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient
to allow Ventura to issue permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Ventura is able to carry out all section 112 activities.
For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this
rulemaking and the April 13, 1993 guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for Section 112
Activities,'' signed by John Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. EPA.



b. District preconstruction permit program to implement 112(g).

 As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Ventura is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from the
effective date of the part 70 program. Imposition of case-by-case determinations of MACT or offsets under
section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific
basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Ventura's preconstruction permitting program found in Ventura's Regulation
II under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition
period between title V approval and adoption of a District rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA
believes this approval is necessary so that Ventura has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions
for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides the authority
for approval of state air toxics programs, title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval
because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly
limited to section 112(g), and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under the Act.
If Ventura does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate
that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving Ventura's
part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.
This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the District is able to adopt regulations consistent
with any regulations promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration
of this approval to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Ventura, acting
expeditiously, will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing
here to limit the duration of this approval to 12 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations.
Comment is solicited on whether 12 months is an appropriate period considering Ventura's procedures for adoption
of regulations.


c. Program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated.

 Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval
of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section
112(l)(5) requires that the District's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation,
and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing
to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Ventura's program for receiving delegation of section
112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated. Ventura has informed EPA that it intends
to accept delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation, as provided for by sections 39658 and
42301.10 of the California Health and Safety Code. The details of this delegation mechanism will be set forth in an
Implementation Agreement between Ventura and EPA, expected to be completed prior to approval of Ventura's section
112(l) program for straight delegations. This program applies to both existing and future standards but is limited
to sources covered by the part 70 program. 



d. Commitments for title IV implementation.

 In a letter dated May 26, 1994, Ventura's Air Pollution Control Officer (APCO) committed to propose to the District
governing board (Board), a complete acid rain program, with sufficient time to submit the program to EPA by January
1, 1995. The APCO stated his intent to propose to the Board that they incorporate by reference the relevant provisions
of part 72. The letter further indicates that the incorporation by reference will automatically incorporate Federal
revisions to part 72. 



B. Proposed Interim Approval and Implications



The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by Ventura County APCD on
December 6, 1993. If EPA were to finalize this proposed interim approval, it would extend for two years following the
effective date of final interim approval, and could not be renewed. During the interim approval period, Ventura would
be protected from sanctions, and EPA would not be obligated to promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal permits
program for the District. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to
part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon the effective
date of interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
Following final interim approval, if Ventura failed to submit a complete corrective program for full approval by
the date 6 months before expiration of the interim approval, EPA would start an 18-month clock for mandatory sanctions.
If the District then failed to submit a corrective program that EPA found complete before the expiration of that 18-month
period, EPA would be required to apply one of the sanctions in section 179(b) of the Act, which would remain in effect
until EPA determined that Ventura had corrected the deficiency by submitting a complete corrective program. Moreover,
if the Administrator found a lack of good faith on the part of the the District, both sanctions under section 179(b)
would apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until the Administrator determined that the District had
come into compliance. In any case, if, six months after application of the first sanction, the District still had not
submitted a corrective program that EPA found complete, a second sanction would be required.
If, following final interim approval, EPA were to disapprove Ventura's complete corrective program, EPA would be
required to apply one of the section 179(b) sanctions on the date 18 months after the effective date of the disapproval,
unless prior to that date the District had submitted a revised program and EPA had determined that it corrected the
deficiencies that prompted the disapproval. Moreover, if the Administrator found a lack of good faith on the part
of the District, both sanctions under section 179(b) would apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until
the Administrator determined that the District had come into compliance. In all cases, if, six months after EPA applied
the first sanction, Ventura had not submitted a revised program that EPA had determined corrected the deficiencies
that prompted disapproval, a second sanction would be required. 
In addition, discretionary sanctions may be applied where warranted any time after the end of an interim approval
period if a state or district has not timely submitted a complete corrective program or EPA has disapproved a submitted
corrective program. Moreover, if EPA has not granted full approval to a title V operating permits program by the expiration
of an interim approval and that expiration occurs after November 15, 1995, EPA must promulgate, administer and enforce
a Federal permits program for that state of district upon interim approval expiration.


1. Ventura's Title V Operating Permits Program 


If interim approval is granted, Ventura must make the following changes to receive full approval: 


a. Insignificant activities.

 Rules 33.2 and 23 provide the framework for Ventura's insignificant activities provisions. For its program to be
fully approvable, Ventura must provide a demonstration that activities that are exempt from part 70 permitting are
truly insignificant and are not likely to be subject to an applicable requirement. Alternatively, the District may
restrict the exemptions to activities that are not likely to be subject to an applicable requirement and emit less
than District-established emission levels. The District should establish separate emission levels for HAPs and
for other regulated pollutants and demonstrate that these emission levels are insignificant compared to the level
of emissions from and type of units that are required to be permitted or subject to applicable requirements. 


b. Revision process for significant changes to monitoring terms and conditions.

 The definitions of ``minor permit modification'' and ``significant part 70 permit modification'' in Rule 33.1 must
be revised to ensure that significant changes to existing monitoring permit terms or conditions are processed as
significant permit modifications. See  70.7(e)(4). 


c. Operation of modifications prior to permit revision.

 
Except in the case when a federally enforceable permit condition would prohibit it, Ventura's Rule 33.9 A.1. allows
sources to make significant modifications prior to receiving a part 70 permit revision. In order to be consistent
with part 70, Ventura must revise its rule so that the only changes that may be operated prior to receiving a part 70 permit
revision are those modifications subject to section 112(g) and title I, parts C and D of the Act, and that are not prohibited
by the existing part 70 permit. Under part 70, if a proposed change does not meet these criteria, the source may not make
the change until the permitting authority has revised the source's part 70 permit. See  70.5(a)(1)(ii).


 d. Public notice.

 Revise Rule 33.7 B. to include notice ``by other means if necessary to assure adequate notice to the affected public.''
See  70.7(h)(1).


e. Permit content.

 Ventura's permit content requirements are found in Rules 33.3 and 33.9. These regulatory provisions adequately
address nearly all of the part 70 requirements. Certain elements (e.g.   70.6(a)(3)(ii)(B), 70.6(a)(6)(i)),
are more fully detailed in the General Part 70 Permit conditions, which were submitted in appendix B.2.b. of Ventura's
part 70 program submittal. Ventura must establish a binding requirement that the General Part 70 Permit Conditions
will be included in all part 70 permits. Ventura may accomplish this by modifying its regulation to reference the general
conditions that were submitted and approved by EPA, or by more fully addressing the conditions within the regulation.



f. Recordkeeping requirements.

 Revise Rule 33.3 permit content requirement to provide adequate specificity with regard to the applicable recordkeeping
requirements. See  70.6(a)(3)(C)(ii). 


g. Emissions trading under applicable requirements.

 
Add emissions trading provisions consistent with  70.6(a)(10), which require that trading must be allowed
where an applicable requirement provides for trading increases and decreases without a case-by-case approval.



h. Compliance schedule.

 Rule 33.3 B.2., which requires that a schedule of compliance be included in the permit, does not create an explicit
link with 33.9 B.4., which details the contents of a compliance schedule. Revise Rule 33.3 permit content requirements
to ensure that all elements of the compliance schedule under  70.5(c) are incorporated into the permit. 


i. EPA Notification of operational flexibility changes.

 
Rule 33.5 D. must be revised to incorporate EPA notification of changes made under the operational flexibility provisions,
either by providing for it within the regulation, or by making the general permit conditions, which do specify EPA
notification, required elements of each permit. See  70.4(b)(14)(ii) 



2. California Enabling Legislation 





Legislative source category limited interim approval issue.

 Because California state law currently exempts agricultural production sources from permit requirements, the
California Air Resources Board has requested source category limited interim approval for all California districts.
EPA is proposing to grant source category limited interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by
the California Air Resources Board on behalf of Ventura County on December 6, 1993. In order for this program to receive
full approval (and to avoid a disapproval upon the expiration of this interim approval), the California Legislature
must revise the Health and Safety Code to eliminate the exemption of agricultural production sources from the requirement
to obtain a permit. 
The above described program and legislative deficiencies must be corrected before Ventura can receive full program
approval. For additional information, please refer to the TSD, which contains a detailed analysis of Ventura's operating
permits program and California's enabling legislation.

 


III. Administrative Requirements


A. Request for Public Comments


The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed interim approval. Copies of Ventura's submittal and
other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional
Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered
by, EPA in the development of this proposed interim approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:



(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the approval process; and
(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will consider any comments received by [insert date 30
days after date of publication].



B. Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The EPA's actions under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permits
programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Because this action does not impose any new requirements,
it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These proposed rules would remove certain regulatory restrictions that conflict with implementation of the National
Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA). NVRA provisions will make it easier for individuals to vote in elections for
Federal office.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993, Public Law 103-31, contains three provisions which will
make it easier for individuals to register to vote in elections for Federal office. These include: (1) the simultaneous
application for or renewal of drivers licenses and voter registration (the motor voter part of the bill); (2) the adoption
and use of a ``mail'' application form for voter registration; and (3) the designation of State voter registration
agencies, including among others, all offices in a State that provide ``public assistance'' and ``State-funded
programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.''

As defined in the conference report, the term ``public assistance agencies'' include ``* * * those
State agencies in each State that administer or provide services under the food stamp, Medicaid, the Women, Infants
and Children (WIC) and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs''. H. Rep. No. 103-66 (1993),
p. 19.

According to section 7(a)(4) of the NVRA, public assistance offices shall: distribute mail voter registration forms;
provide assistance in forms completion; and provide a service to accept completed forms and to transmit them to appropriate
authorities. These services are to be available at the time of application, recertification, or renewal or when a
change in address is reported. The NVRA also contains provisions addressing how applicants and recipients of public
assistance are to be informed of their right to request or decline in this assistance. 

Section 7(a)(5) of the NVRA indicates that these offices shall not: seek to influence a party preference; display
party-affiliated materials; discourage registration; or imply in any way that the availability of services or benefits
is dependent upon a decision to register or not to register to vote.

Current regulatory provisions at 45 CFR 205.50(a)(4) and 42 CFR 431.307 (a)(2), (b), and (c) result in barring the
distribution of voter registration materials to AFDC and Medicaid applicants recipients. Enactment of the NVRA
mandates that State and local public assistance offices conduct such activities. In order to comply with these statutory
requirements, we propose to amend 45 CFR 205.50 and 42 CFR 431.307 to remove the bar from the States subject to NVRA.
The bar, however, would continue to apply to States that are exempt from NVRA. States that permit voter registration
at polling places (since March 11, 1993 or pursuant to State law enacted on or before that date) or States with no voter
registration requirements for any voter in the state with respect to an election for Federal office (since March 11,
1993) are exempt from NVRA requirements.

State agencies responsible for the administration of the AFDC and Medicaid programs have already been advised of
the availability of Federal financial participation (FFP) necessary to conduct voter registration assistance
in public assistance offices in accordance with Section 7 of the NVRA. The Administration for Children and Families
and the Health Care Financing Administration will issue further guidance in program instructions as needed to AFDC
and Medicaid agencies regarding the implementation of these provisions. All relevant Federal agencies will continue
to work closely with each other and with State public assistance agencies toward the successful implementation of
this Act.

Under Section 9 of the NVRA the Federal Election Commission (FEC) is required to develop a national mail voter registration
form for elections to Federal office and to submit reports to Congress to assess the impacts of the legislation each
odd-numbered year beginning June 30, 1995. The FEC published an NPRM related to these provisions in the 

Federal Register

 on March 10, 1994, 59 FR 11211. The comment period closed on April 11, 1994.



Executive Order 12866


Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these
priorities and principles.


Paperwork Reduction Act


These proposed regulations do not require any information collection activities and therefore no approval is necessary
under the Paperwork Reduction Act.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these proposed rules
is on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect benefits to individuals and payments to States.
Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 13, 1994, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 47034). This proposed rule would promulgate a new subpart regulating certain equipment requirements and operating
procedures for fish tender vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. These regulations would allow for the continued
cargo service by water to remote communities in Alaska while ensuring increased safety standards for the vessels
engaged in this trade.



The 

Federal Register

 incorrectly indicated the comment period would close November 14, 1993 vice November 14, 1994.

In an effort to be responsive to the best interests of the public and receive the greatest amount of input possible regarding
this proposed rulemaking, the Coast Guard has decided to reopen the comment period until December 31, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further Notice) aimed at establishing a flexible
regulatory scheme for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) systems in the 800 MHz band. The intended effect of this Further
Notice is to solicit comment on assignment of blocks of SMR spectrum in defined market-based service areas that will
facilitate the development of wide-area, multi-channel SMR systems that are comparable to and compete with cellular
and broadhand Personal Communications Services (PCS) systems; how the needs of smaller SMR systems primarily seeking
to provide local service can best be accommodated under the proposed licensing scheme; regulatory treatment of existing
SMR systems; application and licensing procedures for both the wide-area SMR spectrum blocks and locally licensed
SMR channels; continued licensing of SMR systems on 800 MHz General Category channels or on other non-SMR channels
through inter-category sharing; and competitive bidding procedures for resolution of mutually exclusive 800 MHz
SMR applications.

Summary of Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making



1. The Further Notice is intended to build upon and refine the Commission's previous efforts to promote the development
of wide-area SMR service in the 800 MHz band, particularly its 1993 Notice of Proposed Rule Making that initiated this
docket (8 FCC Rcd 3950 (1993), 58 FR 33062 (June 15, 1993)). The proposals presented in the Further Notice also are part
of the Commission's continuing implementation of the new regulatory framework for mobile radio services enacted
by Congress in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-66, 107 Stat. 312, 392 (Budget Act).


2 . In implementing the Budget Act, the Commission previously determined that its SMR channel assignment rules should
be revised to facilitate licensing in some portion of the 800 MHz SMR band on a Major Trading Area (MTA) basis. In the
Further Notice, the Commission proposes to divide the existing 14 MHz of SMR spectrum into two categories for future
licensing: (a) the 10 MHz ``upper block'', comprised of the 200 contiguous SMR channels (Channels 401 to 600), would
be licensed on an MTA basis; (b) the remaining 4 MHz, comprised of the 80 non-contiguous SMR channels, would be licensed
in groups of five channels on a local basis. The Commission tentatively concludes that the 10 MHz upper block of SMR
spectrum is best suited for wide-area licensing because of its contiguity.

3. The Commission also seeks comment on its tentative conclusion that the 80 non-contiguous SMR channels should be
licensed on a local basis. The Commission seeks comment on whether dividing the 800 MHz band spectrum in this fashion
is fair and equitable and also solicits alternative allocations that would fairly balance the interests of wide-area
and local SMR systems.

4. The Commission proposes to divide the upper 10 MHz ``MTA block'' into four blocks of 2.5 MHz, corresponding to 50
channels per block under our existing frequency allocation rules. The Commission seeks comment on whether the proposed
allocation is a fair division of channels within the MTA and will lead to efficient spectrum use and the appropriateness
of alternative block sizes both smaller and larger than 2.5 MHz.

5. In addition, the Commission tentatively concludes that a limit on the aggregation of 800 MHz SMR spectrum by a single
licensee within a particular MTA is unnecessary. The Commission previously concluded that 45 MHz cap on aggregation
of broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum, combined with existing service-specific caps for cellular and PCS,
was sufficient to maintain a competitive commercial mobile radio service market. The Commission nonetheless seeks
comment on whether there should be such an aggregation limit for 800 MHz SMR.

6. The Commission further propose to continue licensing SMR systems on the ``lower 80'' channels on a local basis in
order to provide opportunities for SMR operators who seek to provide local service. The Commission solicits comment
on two alternative approaches to local SMR licensing. The first alternative would be to continue licensing these
channels under the same geographic separation and channelization criteria that exist in the Commission's current
SMR rules. The second alternative would be to discontinue site-specific licensing and instead offer licenses for
individual channels or small channel blocks covering defined geographic areas. The Commission also seeks comment
on any possible licensing alternatives for the ``lower 80'' channels that might further promote the SMR operators'
ability to quickly gain access to spectrum and to provide efficient service to the public.

7. The Commission also proposes that MTA licensees will be entitled to use any available border area channels within
their spectrum blocks, subject to the relevant rules regarding international assignment and coordination of such
channels. The Commission seeks comment on this proposal and on how to license the channels in border areas that are
not contained in the proposed MTA block, which include both lower 80 SMR channels and channels that are allocated to
non-SMR services outside the border areas. The Commission proposes to license these channels on a channel-by-channel
basis.

8. The Commission believes that a key element in any new licensing scheme for wide-area SMR sytems is that licensees
be extended the same flexibility, to the extent feasible, as cellular and PCS licensees in terms of the location, design,
construction, and modification of their facilities throughout their service area. Thus, the Commission tentatively
concludes that MTA licensees in the 800 MHz band should be authorized to construct stations at any available site and
on any available channel within their MTAs (subject to their obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbents
as discussed 

infra

). It also proposes to allow MTA licensees to add, subtract, move, and otherwise modify their base station facilities
without any need for prior Commission consent, provided they notify the Commission of the coordinates and certify
compliance with other applicable FCC technical requirements.

9. The Commission proposes that if an incumbent fails to construct, discontinues operations, or otherwise has its
license terminated by the Commission, the spectrum covered by that incumbent's authorization should automatically
revert to the MTA licensee who has obtained the contingent rights to that spectrum. An additional proposal is that
the MTA license confer the right to negotiate with incumbent systems within the MTA to purchase or relocate their facilities.
In this regard, the Commission proposes that any request for transfer or assignment of an incumbent authorization
to the MTA licensee be presumptively considered in the public interest. The Commission seeks comment on these proposals
and other alternatives, including the costs and benefits associated with each alternative in markets that are heavily
occupied by incumbent licensees.

10. The commission tentatively concludes that incumbent SMR systems should not be required to relocate new frequencies,
but that decisions regarding relocation should instead be left to the parties involved and the marketplace. Thus,
it asks commenters to address: (a) whether relying on voluntary negotiations between MTA licensees and incumbents
will continue to provide sufficient inducement for incumbents to relocate; (b) whether the Commission should intervene
if incumbents refuse ``reasonable'' inducements to relocate; and, (c) what constitutes a ``reasonable'' inducement
and the specific form of intervention, if any, that should be taken by the Commission in those instances when the incumbent
has refused such inducements. The Commission also seeks further comment on mandatory relocation as an alternative
to voluntary arrangements between MTA licensees and incumbents similar to the Commission's provisions for relocation
of microwave licensees from the 2 GHz PCS band. In addition, the Commission solicits comment on possible mechanisms
for ensuring that all relocation costs to incumbents would be guaranteed by the MTA licensee, descriptions of specific
costs, both direct and indirect, that would be associated with relocation (including whether they should be fully
reimbursable by the MTA licensee), and whether MTA licensees should be required to offer some form of premium over
cost (

e.g.,

 additional channels or improved facilities) if they seek to invoke a mandatory relocation option.

11. Also, the Commission tentatively concludes that incumbent systems should not be allowed to expand beyond their
existing service areas on MTA-licensed channels without the consent of the MTA licensee. The Commission also proposes
to allow incumbent licenses to freely modify their facilities provided such modifications do not expand their service
areas. The Further Notice requests comment regarding the advantages and disadvantages of these proposals and specific
examples of circumstances under which incumbents should be permitted to modify their systems.

12. The Commission seeks comment on whether a fixed-radius protected service area (e.g., 30 kilometers which approximates
the 40 dBu signal strength contour of an SMR station operating with maximum facilities) should be established for
incumbent SMR systems so that such systems may construct new base stations within the existing station's 40 dBu signal
strength contour. The Commission asks commenters to include a technical analysis of this proposal and any alternative
proposals that permit greater flexibility for locally licensed SMR systems.

13. The Commission has previously concluded that the co-channel interference protection obligations of SMR MTA
licensees with respect to other MTA licensees would be similar to those imposed in the cellular and PCS services where
licensees are required to comply with interference protection criteria between Commission-defined service areas
only at service area borders. Thus, the Commission tentatively concludes that wide-area SMR licensees in the 800
MHz band should not be allowed to exceed a signal level of 22 dBuV/m at their service area boundaries (unless they negotiate
a different signal strength limit with all potentially affected adjacent licensees).

14. In addition, the Commission proposed to apply out-of-band emission rules only to the ``outer'' channels included
in a MTA license and to spectrum adjacent to interior channels used by incumbents. The proposed 800 MHz SMR emission
mask rule is that for any frequency outside an MTA licensee's frequency block, the power of any emission shall be attenuated
below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 plus 10 log 

10

 (P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation. The Further Notice seeks comment on this proposal
including a request for technical analysis of the proposal and discussion of any alternatives.

15. The Commission previously established a uniform 12-month period for constructing a standard base station in
all CMRS services licensed on a channel-by-channel basis. The Further Notice proposed to no longer grant extended
construction periods on non-MTA channels under  90.629 of the Commission's rules. The Commission seeks comment
on whether strict enforcement of this construction period will be an adequate protection against spectrum warehousing
on frequencies occupied by local SMR systems.

16. The Commission tentatively concludes that MTA licensees should have five years to construct their systems. Because
some existing wide-area SMR licensees have already been granted extended implementation periods of up to five years,
the Commission requests comment on how existing licensees with extended implementation periods should be treated.
It also asks commenters to address what is a reasonable timeframe for completing such systems given the technologies
presently available in the SMR market.

17. The Commission proposes that MTA-based 800 MHz SMR licensees be required to provide coverage to one-third of the
MTA population within three years of initial license grant and to two-thirds of the population by the end of their five-year
construction period. The Commission further proposed that an MTA licensee must satisfy these requirements regardless
of the extent of the presence of incumbents within its MTA block. The Commission also seeks comment on whether a specific
definition of what constitutes coverage should be adopted for this service, 

e.g., 

should single channel coverage be sufficient or should a mult-channel coverage requirement be imposed.

18. The Commission also tentatively concludes that an MTA licensee's failure to meet the coverage requirements imposed
either at the third or fifth years of its construction period should result in forfeiture of the license. This penalty
for failure to comply with coverage requirements is consistent with the penalties provided in the Commission's broadband
PCS rules and would allow the spectrum to be made available to other qualified applicants.

19. The Commission tentatively concludes that the eligibility rules for the General Category channels and Industrial/Land
Transportation and Business Category Channels (collectively, ``Pool Channels'') should be revised to prohibit
SMR and non-SMR applicants from applying for the same channels in the future. The Commission seeks comment, however,
on how the spectrum should be allocated to address the relative demand for SMR and non-SMR services. One alternative
would be to eliminate SMR eligibility for all future licensing on General Category and Pool Channels. Another alternative
would be to prohibit future inter-category sharing by SMR applicants on Pool Channels, but to designate a portion
of the General Category for SMR-only licensing while the remaining channels would be available only to non-SMR licensees.
A third alternative would be to designate the entire General Category for future licensing exclusively to SMR applicants.
In light of the proposed restriction on future SMR use of Pool Channels, and possibly, General Category channels that
are designated for non-SMR use, the Commission also tentatively concludes that other Part 90 services should be restricted
from future eligibility for licenses on SMR Category channels. The Further Notice seeks comment on this proposal,
including whether incumbent SMRs on the General Category or Pool Channels should be allowed to apply for new authorizations
on these channels.

20. The Commission proposes that both existing licensees and new applicants should be eligible for MTA licenses as
well as for local licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band. It requests comment on this proposal, including whether there is
any need to restrict eligibility for MTA licenses to incumbent licensees (or to restrict eligibility based on other
criteria) if competitive bidding procedures are used.

21. For 800 MHz SMR MTA licenses, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those used for licensing
of PCS based on the common use of Commission-defined geographic areas and spectrum blocks to define the scope of licenses
in both services. The Commission seeks comment on this view, and on any alternative procedural approach that commenters
may consider appropriate. It also proposes (1) to treat all MTA applicants as initial applicants for public notice,
application processing, and competitive bidding purposes, (2) to require applicants for MTA-based SMR licenses
to file an initial ``short-form'' application to qualify for competitive bidding, after which the successful bidder
files a ``long form'' application, and (3) to adopt rules analogous to its PCS rules with respect to application content,
amendment and modification of applications, return of defective applications, waiver procedures, and petitions
to deny. In addition, the Commission proposes to allow a limited opportunity for MTA applicants to cure minor defects
in their short-form applications (but not to allow major amendments after the expiration of the short-form filing
window) and to adopt rules regarding major and minor modification of MTA licenses and petition to deny procedures
(including ``greenmail'' restrictions limiting payments that a petitioner may receive in exchange for agreeing
to withdraw a petition) that are consistent with its PCS rules.

22. The Commission also seeks comment on licensing procedures for local SMR channels. If local licensing is based
on defined service areas, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those used for the licensing
of MTA blocks. If, on the other hand, site-specific licensing is adopted for the locally licensed SMR channels, the
Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those recently adopted for non-cellular Part 22 licensees.
To the extent that 800 MHz SMR channels continue to be licensed on a site-specific basis, the Commission proposes to
classify the following as ``initial'' applications for new authorizations: all applications for new frequencies
or for stations more than 2 kilometers from an existing facility using the same channel.

23. In addition, the Commission recently indicated that for CMRS providers licensed on a site-specific basis, major
modifications include a change in frequency, an increase in the effective radiated power or antenna height above
average terrain in any azimuth, or a change in location. The Commission seeks comment on the applicability of this
definition to locally licensed SMR systems and whether there are other types of modifications that should be deemed
major in this context. The Commission proposes that major modification applications would be subject to filing window
and cutoff procedures and processed on a first-come, first-served basis, except that (1) modification applications
that are mutually exclusive with initial or modification applications filed on the same day would be classified as
members of a ``same day filing group,'' and (2) modification applications filed within the 30-day public notice period
of a competing initial application would be considered part of the 30-day filing group. In both cases, the mutually
exclusive group of applications would be designated for comparative hearing (unless the parties negotiate a legal
settlement) because the Budget Act does not permit the use of competitive bidding procedures to determine whether
a modification application should be granted. The Further Notice seeks comment on whether our proposed definitions
and procedures for dealing with modification applications are appropriate for licensing of local SMR channels.
It also proposes adoption of petition to deny procedures for local SMR licensing similar to those proposed for MTA-based
licensing. The Commission seeks comment, however, on whether petitions to deny locally licensed SMR applications
should be filed within the initial 30-day public notice period following acceptance of such applications, or only
after an auction winner has been determined, as is proposed in the case of MTA applications. In either case, the Commission
intends to review only petitions filed against the auction winner.

24. The Commission proposes to classify all MTA licensees presumptively as CMRS providers because they are likely
to provide interconnected service as part of their service offering. It further proposes that such presumption may
be overcome by demonstrating that their service does not fall within the CMRS definition. In addition, the Further
Notice proposes not to apply this presumption prior to August 10, 1996 in the case of any MTA licensee who was previously
licensed in the SMR service as of August 10, 1993, and is therefore not subject to CMRS regulation for three years from
the Budget Act's enactment date. It also seeks comment on whether the presumption of CMRS status should apply to licensees
authorized for the 80 locally licensed channels.

25. The Commission believes that multiple bidding methodologies may be required for licensing of 800 MHz SMR service
because the two proposed categories of licenses (MTA-based and local) will vary significantly from one another in
terms of expected value and interdependence. In addition, it believes that competitive bidding in the 800 MHz SMR
service presents a number of variables that have not been presented in other services for which auction rules have
been developed. In particular, the proposed licensing of local SMR channels on a site-specific basis requires examination
of how competitive bidding would work in a context where mutually exclusive applicants have applied for overlapping
rather than identical authorizations.
26. The Commission tentatively concludes that simultaneous multiple round bidding is most likely to award MTA licenses
to bidders who value them most highly. the Further Notice asks commenters whether any other competitive bidding designs
might be more appropriate for the MTA-based licensing of 800 MHz SMR spectrum. Assuming simultaneous multiple round
auctions are used, the Commission also seeks comment on which blocks should be auctioned together, the intervals
between rounds in each auction, and the sequencing of each auction. Its tentative view is that all MTA licenses should
be auctioned simultaneously because of the relatively high value and significant interdependence of the licenses.
The Further Notice seeks comment on its view and on possible alternatives for grouping of licenses.
27. The Commission tentatively concludes that a simpler and less costly auction method, such as single round sealed
bid auctions, should be used for licensing the 80 local SMR channels. The Further Notice also asks commenters to suggest
alternative bidding designs. For example, if these channels are licensed on a site-specific basis, one alternative
would be to allow mutually exclusive applications to use negotiated settlements or coordination to minimize the
number of overlapping applications that would require resolution by competitive bidding. Another alternative
would be to divide the local 80 SMR channels into defined geographic areas (

e.g.,

 BTAs) and small blocks of channels (

e.g.,

 five or ten channels) and conduct a series of separate auctions for mutually exclusive applications within each area/block
combination. The Commission seeks comment on the practicality of these alternatives, whether these auctions for
the local licenses should be conducted separately or simultaneously, and how such licenses should be ordered for
auction purposes.
28. The Commission also seeks comment on bidding procedures to be used in 800 MHz SMR auctions, including bid increments,
duration of bidding rounds, stopping rules, and activity rules. Assuming that simultaneous multiple round auctions
are used for MTA-based SMR licenses, the Commission generally proposed to use the same or similar bidding procedures
to those used in simultaneous multiple round bidding for MTA-based PCS licenses. In the case of locally licensed 800
MHz SMR channels, the Further Notice seeks comment on bidding procedures that would be appropriate depending on whether
single round sealed bid auctions or an alternative auction methodology is used. It generally proposed to follow the
procedural, payment, and penalty rules established in Subpart Q of Part 1 of the Commission's Rules, but seeks comment
on whether any service-specific modifications of these rules are needed based on the particular characteristics
of the 800 MHz SMR service.
29. As in the case of other auctionable services, the Commission proposes to require SMR auction participants to tender
in advance to the Commission a substantial upfront payment as a condition of bidding. It seeks comment on whether the
standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops a bidder anticipates
bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for 800 MHz SMR services. The Commission also proposes to require
that winning bidders for 800 MHz SMR licenses supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to
bring their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s).

30. The Commission further proposes to adopt bid withdrawal, default, and disqualification rules for 800 MHz SMR
licensing based on its general competitive bidding rules and seeks comment on these proposals. Under these procedures,
any bidder who withdraws a high bid during an auction before the Commission declares bidding closed, or defaults by
failing to remit the required down payment within the prescribed time, would be required to reimburse to the Commission
the difference between its high bid and the winning bid amount the next time the license is offered by the Commission,
if the subsequent winning bid is lower. A defaulting auction winner would be assessed an additional penalty of three
percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less. In the
event that an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified, we propose to re-auction the license either to
existing or new applicants. The Commission would retain discretion, however, to offer the license to the next highest
bidder at its final bid level if the default occurs within five business days of the close of bidding.

31. The Further Notice also proposes to adopt the transfer disclosure requirements contained in Section 1.211(a)
of the Commission's rules for all 800 MHz SMR licenses obtained by competitive bidding and specific rules governing
unjust enrichment by designated entities. Generally, applicants transferring their licenses within three years
after the initial license grant will be required to file, together with their transfer application, the associated
contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, and all other documents disclosing the total consideration
received in return for the transfer of its license.

32. The Commission also proposes to apply its previously adopted special rules prohibiting collusive conduct in
the context of competitive bidding to the 800 MHz SMR service and seeks comment on this proposal.

33. The Further Notice proposes specific measures and eligibility criteria for designated entities, 

i.e., 

businesses owned by minorities and/or women, small businesses, and rural telephone companies. The Commission seeks
comment on these proposals, and specifically on identifying special provisions that will create meaningful incentives
and opportunities for such entities that are tailored to the unique characteristics of the 800 MHz SMR service.

34. The Commission proposes to utilize bidding credits and a tax certificate program to encourage participation
by businesses owned by women and minorities in auctions for the 800 MHz SMR service. It seeks comment on whether the
likely value of MTA-based SMR licenses would support a 40 percent bidding credit, but proposes a bidding credit of
25 percent for the ``lower 80'' channel licenses given their expected lower value. To prevent unjust enrichment by
women and minorities trafficking in licenses acquired through the use of bidding credits, the Further Notice proposes
imposition of a forfeiture requirement on transfers of such licenses to entities that are not owned by women or minorities.

35. The Commission also proposes to establish a tax certificate program under which tax certificates would be issued
to: (a) non-controlling initial investors in minority and women-owned 800 MHz SMR applicants and licensees, upon
the sale of their non-controlling interests; and, (b) 800 MHz SMR licensees who assign or transfer control of their
licenses to minority and women-owned entities. It also proposes to impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer
or assignment of 800 MHz SMR licenses obtained through the benefit of tax certificates.

36. In terms of eligibility criteria, the Commission proposes that in order to be deemed a business owned by minorities
and/or women, minorities or women must have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and a 50.1 controlling interest
in the designated entity. For limited partnerships, the general partner must be a minority and/or a woman (or an entity
100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) that owns at least 50.1 percent of the partnership equity.
In the PCS context, the Commission established an alternative definition for minority- and female-owned businesses
whereby women and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent
of the voting stock (in the case of corporations). The Further Notice seeks comment on which of these definitions is
most appropriate for purposes of determining designated entity eligibility in the 800 MHz SMr service, or whether
both definitions should be adopted in the alternative. It also proposes to apply to the 800 MHz SMR applicants the same
affiliation and attribution rules for calculating equity and stock ownership previously adopted in the PCS context.

37. The Commission proposes to adopt installment payments for small businesses bidding for 800 MHz SMR licenses.
To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of installment payment provisions meant
for small businesses, the Commission also proposes to make the unjust enrichment provisions in its general competitive
bidding rules applicable to installment payments by SMR applicants. The Commission seeks comment on this proposal
including whether additional unjust enrichment provisions are necessary for the 800 MHz SMR service.

38. In terms of eligibility criteria, the Commission presents two alternatives for a small business definition.
One alternative is the existing SBA net worth/net income size standard where an entity would qualify as a small business
if its net worth is not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding
years not in excess of $2 million. A second alternative is adoption of a gross revenue standard like that used in the
broadband PCS context. The Further Notice requests commenters to address whether the SBA definition or a gross revenue
standard should be used and the appropriate gross revenue threshold for the 800 MHz SMR context.

39. The Commission seeks comment on Whether bidding credits or other special provisions should be provided for rural
telephone companies, but does not propose to adopt such special provisions.
40. In addition to the special provisions proposed above for designated entities, the Commission solicits comment
on the following alternatives and related issues for the 800 MHz SMR service: (1) expansion of eligibility for installment
payments to designated entities other than small businesses; (2) reduction in upfront payment for any class of designated
entities; (3) the costs and benefits with respect to auction administration and designated entity participation
associated with a reduced upfront payment in the 800 SMR service in the absence of a spectrum set-aside; and (4) whether
the ``lower 80'' channels should be designated as an ``entrepreneurs' block.'' The Commission tentatively concludes
that it would not be feasible to designate an MTA channel block as an entrepreneur's block because the large number
of incumbents already licensed throughout the proposed MTA band make it virtually impossible to identify a particular
block that would be suitable. On the other hand, an entrepreneurs' block approach could be more feasible for the ``lower
80'' channels, which we contemplate will be used primarily, if not exclusively, for operation of local SMR systems.
41. In addition, if the Commission adopts an entrepreneurs' block approach, it seeks comment on how eligibility for
the block should be defined. Specifically, commenters are asked to address whether applicants other than designated
entities should be eligible to bid for entrepreneurs' block licenses, whether the same financial caps should be applied
for determining eligibility for SMR entrepreneurs' block licenses, how designated entities should be treated within
the entrepreneurs' block in terms of eligibility criteria and special provisions. The Further Notice also requests
comment on whether the definitions for small businesses and business owned by minorities and/or women should be different
for purposes of determining eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block, what specific special provisions should
be afforded to designated entities within the entrepreneurs' block, what type of attribution and affiliation rules
should apply, and what additional measures are needed to protect against unjust enrichment.



Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (IREA) of the expected impact on small entities of the policies and rules proposed in this Further Notice
of Proposed Rule Making. Written public comments are requested on the IRFA.



A. Reason for Action



This rule making proceeding was initiated to secure comment on proposals for establishing a flexible regulatory
scheme for the 800 MHz SMR service that would promote efficient licensing and enhance the service's competitive potential
in the commercial mobile radio marketplace. The proposals advanced in the Further Notice are also designed to implement
Congress's goal of regulatory symmetry in the regulation of competing commercial mobile radio services as described
in Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 153(n), 332, as amended by Title VI of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). The Commission also seeks to adopt rules regarding competitive bidding
in the 800 MHz SMR service based on Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 309(J), which delegates authority
to the Commission to use auctions to select among mutually exclusive applications in certain services, including
800 MHz SMR.

B. Objectives



The Commission proposes changes to its rules for the 800 MHz SMR service that are intended to promote the growth of both
traditional local SMR service and emerging wide-area SMR services, and to enhance the ability of all SMR providers
to compete in the larger commercial mobile services market. Specifically, the Commission seeks to designate a block
of contiguous spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR band for licensing to wide-area systems to enable them to use innovative wideband
technologies and compete more effectively against Personal Communications Services and cellular, which also use
contiguous spectrum. The Commission proposes to license non-contiguous spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR band on a local
basis to provide opportunities for smaller SMR systems that seek to provide local niche services. It also seeks to
encourage more efficient use of spectrum in congested areas and to accommodate technologically advanced systems.
Finally, the Further Notice seeks to establish a new licensing mechanism for the 800 MHz SMR service that will significantly
streamline the processing of applications, reducing the administrative burden for both applicants and the Commission.



C. Legal Basis



The proposed action is authorized under the Budget Act, Pub. L. No. 103-66, title VI, Section 6002, and Sections
2(a), 3(n), 4(i), 302, 303(g), 303(r), 309(i), 309(j), 332(a), 332(c), and 332(d) of the Communications Act of 1934,
47 U.S.C. 152(a), 153(n), 154(i), 302, 303(g), 303(r), 309(i), 309(j), 332(a), 332(c) and 332(d), as amended.



D. Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements



Under the proposal contained in the Further Notice, SMR licensees who obtain MTA-based licenses may be required to
report information regarding location of their facilities and coverage of their service areas. SMR applicants seeking
treatment as ``designated entities'' may also be subject to reporting and recordkeeping requirements to demonstrate
compliance with our competitive bidding rules.



E. Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules



None.



F. Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved



The Further Notice potentially affects numerous small entities already operating 800 MHz SMR systems on frequencies
that would be designated for licensing on a wide-area bases. The Further Notice of proposed Rule making tentatively
concludes that existing licensees on these frequencies should be allowed to continue operating under their existing
authorizations, but also seeks to encourage voluntary frequency transfers or other arrangements to allow for efficient
spectrum use. The competitive bidding proposals contained in the Further Notice also could affect small entities
seeking initial licenses in the 800 MHz SMR service. The Further Notice proposes special provisions in the Commission's
auction rules to benefit ``designated entity'' applicants, including small businesses. After evaluating comments
filed in response to the Further Notice, the Commission will examine further the impact of all rule changes on small
entities and set forth its findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

(a) MTA-based licensees authorized in the 816-821/861-866 MHz band pursuant to section 90.661 may construct
and operate base stations using any frequency identified in their spectrum block anywhere within their authorized
MTA, provided that:

(1) The MTA licensee affords protection, in accordance with  90.621(b), to all previously authorized co-channel
stations that are not associated with another MTA license.

(2) The MTA licensee complies with any rules and international agreements that restrict use of frequencies identified
in their spectrum block, including the provisions of section 90.619 relating to U.S./Canadian and U.S./Mexican
border areas.

(3) The MTA licensee limits its field strength at any location on the border of the MTA service area in accordance with
 90.771.

(b) In the event that the authorization for a previously authorized co-channel station within the MTA licensee's
authorized spectrum block is terminated or revoked, the MTA licensee's co-channel obligations to such station will
cease upon deletion of the facility from the Commission's licensing record. The MTA licensee then will be able to construct

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announces negative 90-day and 12-month findings on 11 petitions to
list 20 invertebrates under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. After careful assessment of the best scientific
and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the petitioned species, the
Service either finds that the petitioners have not presented substantial information indicating the requested
actions may be warranted (90-day finding) or determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time (12-month
finding).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533 

et seq.

), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum
extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be
published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the Service finds that a petition presents substantial information indicating the requested action may be warranted,
then the Service initiates a status review on that species. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that for any petition
that presents substantial scientific and commercial information, a finding be made within 12 months of the date of
receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but
precluded from immediate proposal by other pending proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species. Such 12-month
findings are to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

The Service has made negative 90-day findings on 7 of the 11 petitions to list 16 invertebrates; the Marin blind harvestman,
Anza Borrego blind harvestman, Silver Creek blind harvestman, Ross micro-blind harvestman, Ubick's gnaphosid
spider, unsilvered fritillary butterfly, Jacalitos jerusalem cricket, Berkeley ground cricket, Jacalitos shield-backed
katydid, splendid shield-backed katydid, Antioch shield-backed katydid, San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper,
Lompoc grasshopper, Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper, Central Valley grasshopper, and Mexicali lubber grasshopper.
The Service finds that the petitioners have not presented substantial information indicating the requested actions
for these 16 taxa may be warranted. In addition, the Service has made negative 12-month findings on 4 of the 11 petitions
for 4 invertebrates; the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman, Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman, Yontocket ringlet
butterfly, and Opler's longhorn moth. The Service has been assessing the status of these four taxa since their designation
as category 2 candidates. Minimal new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign
these invertebrates to category 2. As a result, the Service determines that the petitioned action is not warranted
at this time. These four taxa will be retained in category 2.

On July 6, 1989, the Service received a petition from Dr. Thomas Briggs of the California Academy of Sciences to list
the Marin blind harvestman (

Calicina diminua

) as an endangered species. The letter, dated July 6, 1989, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name,
signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. 
The petition stated that the Marin blind harvestman is known only from a portion of Burdell Mountain in Marin County,
California. This species was described from 18 specimens collected under rocks in serpentine grassland at this location
(Ubick and Briggs 1989). The threat cited by the petitioner is the construction of the Buck Center for Research on Aging.
The proposed project includes the designation of a 300-acre conservation area and a 188-acre development area. The
proposed activities include a research center, a residential area, parking lots, and roadways. The Marin blind harvestman
is only known from three locations, two occurring on the proposed Buck Center for Research on Aging site (EIP Associates
1992). Based on an analysis of the draft environmental impact report for the proposed project, one of two serpentine
rock outcrops containing the species would be damaged or lost (EIP Associates 1992, Western Ecological Services
Company 1990). The extent of adequate surveys for this species that have been conducted in suitable habitats in Marin
County is not clear. A map displaying the geological features of Burdell Mountain and adjacent areas was also examined
in conjunction with this review. The 1:250,000 geological base map for the Santa Rosa Quadrangle (California Division
of Mines and Geology 1980) reveals other serpentine outcrops within the general vicinity of Burdell Mountain. Some
of these outcrops appear to provide approximately the same combination of geographic features as the known habitats
on Burdell Mountain. The petition and supporting documentation indicate that adequate surveys of these other potential
habitats were not conducted for the Marin blind harvestman. Moreover, because the petition did not present information
on whether the Marin blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution
and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of
the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that
the requested action may be warranted. 



On July 17, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Mr. Darrell Ubick of the California Academy of Sciences
to list the Anza Borrego blind harvestman (

Sitalcina borregoensis

) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated July 14, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and
contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. 

According to the petition, the Anza Borrego blind harvestman is known only from an isolated palm grove at Mountain
Palm Springs, a canyon in Anza Borrego State Park in San Diego County, California. Within this site, the petitioners
reported that harvestmen have been found only at a ``few moist spots near the palm trees.'' They stated the animal could
be harmed by any development at this location. Mountain Palm Springs is an unimproved campground that is regularly
patrolled by park rangers (Bill Tippets and Mark Jorgensen, California Department of Parks and Recreation, pers.
comm., November 16, 1990). Off-road vehicle use, which has caused extensive habitat destruction in other areas of
the southwestern United States, is not a problem at this location (Mark Jorgensen, 

ibid.

). Six palm (

Washingtonia filifera

) groves occur in the immediate vicinity of the campground and 25 palm groves exist in Anza Borrego State Park, of which,
five are located within 10 miles of Mountain Palm Springs. The petitioners did not indicate if surveys had been conducted
at any of these other similar habitats. Moreover, because the petition did not present information on whether the
Anza Borrego blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution
and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of
the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that
the requested action may be warranted.

On July 17, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Ubick to list the Silver Creek blind harvestman (

Calicina jungi

) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated July 14, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and
contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners.
The petition stated that the Silver Creek blind harvestman is known only from rocky serpentine grassland, 0.9 miles
southeast of the junction of Silver Creek and San Felipe Roads, near San Jose in Santa Clara County, California. The
petitioners noted that urban development imperils this species and a pipeline was laid through its habitat on or before
1990. In a letter dated January 13, 1990, the petitioners stated they had searched for blind harvestmen and micro-blind
harvestmen in the vicinity of Silver Creek and Metcalf Canyon Roads in the San Jose area during 4 days in 1966 and 1 day
in 1983. The petition and supporting documentation indicate that the surveys of these other potential habitats for
the Silver Creek blind harvestman were inadequate. Though the Silver Creek blind harvestman may be declining, additional
adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner
presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present
substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.
On October 31, 1989, the Service received a petition from Briggs to list the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman (

Microcina lumi

) as an endangered species. The letter, dated October 26, 1989, was clearly identified as a petition and contained
the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. The Fairmont micro-blind harvestman
was designated a category 2 candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56 

FR

 58804).
The petitioner stated that the known distribution of the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman is limited to two serpentine
outcrops on Fairmont Ridge, near the City of San Leandro in Alameda County, California. The petitioner stated that
all other suitable habitats in this area have been searched without success. A proposed housing development and overgrazing
by livestock were cited as the basis for the requested action. The Service reviewed the petition and supporting documents,
including a scientific paper describing the genus 

Microcina

 and the species 

M. lumi

 (Briggs and Ubick 1989) and a map displaying the geological features of Fairmont Ridge and adjacent areas. This map,
a 1:250,000 geological base map for the San Francisco quadrangle (California Division of Mines and Geology 1980),
reveals other serpentine outcrops within the general vicinity of Fairmont Ridge. Some of these outcrops appear to
provide approximately the same combination of geographic features as the known habitats on Fairmont Ridge. Though
urban development and grazing remain a threat in the species' known habitat, other potential habitats remain unsurveyed
for the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman. Moreover, no new information was received or available to the Service beyond
that used to assign this species to category 2. As a result, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific
and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the Fairmont micro-blind
harvestman and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time.
On March 22, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Ubick to list the Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman
(

Microcina edgewoodensis

) as an endangered species. The letter, dated March 20, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the
names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. The Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman
was designated a category 2 candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56 

FR

 58804).
According to the petitioners, the Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman is known only from Edgewood County Park and
a site west of Interstate Highway 280 in San Mateo County, California known as the ``Triangle'' (these two localities
were cited as three sites in the petition). This species was described from three male specimens collected at these
two locations (Briggs and Ubick 1989). The animals were found beneath rocks in serpentine grassland adjacent to scrub
oaks. The threat cited by the petitioners is unspecified development at the Triangle. The Service is not aware of any
development currently proposed for this specific area. In addition, serpentine grassland in this area is being protected
due to the presence of the threatened bay checkerspot butterfly (

Euphydryas editha bayensis

). A study commissioned by the County of San Mateo determined that it is not feasible to construct a golf course at Edgewood
County Park (Thomas Reid Associates 1993). The County of San Mateo has designated Edgewood County Park as natural
open space (Barrales and Huening 1993, San Mateo County Board of Supervisors 1993). In light of the above discussion
and because no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this species to category
2, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present
and future threats facing the Edgewood micro-blind harvestman and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted
at this time.

On December 3, 1991, the Service received a petition from Briggs to list the Ross micro-blind harvestman (

Microcina

 sp.) as an endangered species. The letter, dated November 27, 1991, was clearly identified as a petition and contained
the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner.
The petition reported the Ross micro-blind harvestman is known only from specimens collected in February 1991 on
a portion of Bald Hill in Ross, Marin County, California. The petitioner, a blind harvestmen specialist, stated that
this is a valid species based on morphological characters. This undescribed species was collected under sandstone
rocks in a grassland-oak and bay woodland ecotone directly east of the summit of Bald Hill at an elevation of 880 feet.
The petitioner cited a proposed residential development as the threat to the Ross micro-blind harvestman. A residential
development had been proposed for this site and a final environmental impact report was certified by the Ross Planning
Commission (Gary Broad, Ross Planning Department, pers. comm., 1993). However, the project was denied by the City
Council and court challenges by the project proponent were unsuccessful. Projects may be proposed for this location
in the future but none have been made to date. As a result, the Service considers such threats to the Ross micro-blind
harvestman to be of low magnitude and non-imminent. Because the petition did not present information on whether the
Ross micro-blind harvestman may be declining or located elsewhere, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess
its distribution and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data
on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information
that the requested action may be warranted.
On December 11, 1992, the Service received a petition from Ubick to list Ubick's gnaphosid spider (

Talanites ubicki

) as a threatened or endangered species. The letter, dated November 29, 1992, was clearly identified as a petition
and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioner.
The petition stated that Ubick's gnaphosid spider is only known from a single locality on the southern slope of Burdell
Mountain in Novato, Marin County, California (Platnick and Ovtsharenko 1991). The habitat at the site consists of
serpentine grassland. Gnaphosids are small, hunting spiders that construct a tubular retreat under stones and in
debris and hunt at night from this location (Borror 

et al.

 1976; Jones 1983). The petitioner cited urban development as the threat to this species and stated that part of the
locality inhabited by Ubick's gnaphosid spider has been destroyed by a road that was constructed a few years ago. The
proposed project, the Buck Center for Research on Aging, includes the designation of a 300-acre conservation area
and a 188-acre development area. Proposed activities include a research center, a residential area, parking lots,
and roadways. The information provided by the petitioner indicates that the remaining portions of the serpentine
rock outcrops inhabited by Ubick's gnaphosid spider are located within the conservation area. The petition from
Ubick did not indicate if adequate surveys had been conducted at other similar habitats in the area. Beyond the information
described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines
that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.
Ms. Katrin Snow of the Xerces Society in Portland, Oregon, petitioned the Service to list Opler's longhorn moth as
an endangered species in a letter dated December 19, 1990, which was received on January 14, 1991. The letter, dated
December 19, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation,
address, and telephone number of the petitioner. Opler's longhorn moth was placed in category 2 on November 21, 1991
(56

Opler's longhorn moth is a member of the longhorn moth family, the Adelidae (Davis 1987, Powell 1969). It is a small,
dark bronze colored, day flying moth with long antennae. The adults have a wingspan ranging from approximately 9 to
14 millimeters. Opler's longhorn moth is recorded from 18 sites extending along the west side of the San Francisco
Bay from 5 miles southeast of Nicasio in Marin County south to the Gilroy area of Santa Clara County and from the Oakland
area on the inner Coast Ranges. A single population is known from central Santa Cruz County. Excepting the Santa Cruz
County locality that consists of a grassland habitat derived from marine sand deposits, Opler's longhorn moth is
restricted to sites within serpentine grassland. The extent of survey efforts that have been conducted in suitable
habitat in the San Francisco Bay area is unclear. At least 13 areas with serpentine soils within the range of Opler's
longhorn moth cover more than 40 acres each (McCarten 1986, 1987). The larvae of Opler's longhorn moth feeds on 

Platystemon californicus 

(cream cups), a widespread annual plant. In contrast to other invertebrate groups, such as butterflies and tiger
beetles, whose biology, ecology, and biogeography are well known, few amateur or professional entomologists collect
or study adelid moths and other microlepidoptera. Though urban development threaten a portion of the species' range
of Opler's longhorn moth, additional status information (e.g., rangewide surveys) are needed prior to proposing
the species. Moreover, no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this
species to category 2. As a result, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information
available regarding the present and future threats facing Opler's longhorn moth and determines that the petitioned
action is not warranted at this time. 

On January 8, 1990, the Service received a petition from Dr. Dennis Murphy of the Stanford University Center for Conservation
biology to list the Yontocket ringlet butterfly (

Coenonympha tullia yontocket

) as a threatened or endangered species. The petitioner stated that the insect merits protection under the Act because
it is known only from a single coastal dune locality in Del Norte County, California. The area is used for target shooting,
off-road vehicles, garbage dumping, and camping, all potentially damaging activities to this population. Invasive
exotic vegetation and potential housing development also likely imperiled the area. Based on this information,
the Service issued a 90-day finding on November 1, 1991, which found that the petition presented substantial information
indicating that the requested action may be warranted (55 FR 46801). A status review of the Yontocket ringlet butterfly
was initiated at the same time. 

The Yontocket ringlet butterfly was described by Porter and Mattoon (1989) from 76 specimens collected at several
sites extending from Lake Earl to the mouth of the Smith River in Del Norte County, California. These sites likely represent
a single population. The animal was found in dunes with coniferous lee slopes and grassy exposed slopes, and among
dunes on slightly elevated ground around seasonally marshy sphagnum bogs. Sterling Mattoon (

in litt., 

1991) provided information regarding the range of the yontocket ringlet butterfly and presented data showing that
the 11 known populations of this species range from Enderts Beach, 5 miles south of Crescent City, north along the coast
to the mouth of the Pistol River, Curry County, Oregon. A population is known approximately 0.7 to 2.2 miles inland
from the vicinity of the town of Carpenterville in Curry County. This substantially increases the number of populations
and extends the range of the species approximately 22 miles north and 15 miles south of its previously known distribution.
The type and degree of threats to these populations were not stated in the petition and other information available
to the Service. In light of these data gaps, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial
information available regarding the present and future threats facing the yontocket ringlet butterfly and determines
that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. 

On January 6, 1992, the Service received a petition from Drs. Dennis Murphy and Alan Launer of the Stanford University
Center for Conservation Biology to list the unsilvered fritillary butterfly (

Speyeria adiaste adiaste

) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated December 31, 1991, was clearly identified as a petition
and contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioners.


The petition stated that the unsilvered fritillary butterfly has been recorded from San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa
Cruz counties (Sterling Mattoon, pers. comm., 1992; C.D. Nagano, unpub. obs.). This species is now found primarily
in areas along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains or east of the crest in the northern and central areas of Santa Cruz
County (Steiner 1990). The petitioners reported that recent colonies are known from four general areas in this region.
The biology, ecology, and biogeography of the unsilvered fritillary is not well known. The foodplant of the larvae,
violets (

Viola 

sp.), is found in fern-dominated grassland glades or wetland areas. A large population occurs within Big Basin Redwood
State Park in Santa Cruz County. The potential threats include urban development and suppression of fire. Lack of
fire may allow succession to proceed and eliminate suitable foodplant and larval habitat. Although, the unsilvered
fritillary butterfly may be declining, existing information is not available to estimate the extent or rate of changes
in habitat or population levels. Further surveys are needed to adequately assess its distribution and population
status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner few data presented little else on the status of the
animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that the
requested action may be warranted. 

On March 3, 1993, the Service received a petition from David Weissman to list the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket (

Stenopelmatus nigrocapitatus

), Berkeley ground cricket (

Neonemobius eurynotus

), Jacalitos shield-backed katydid (

Ateloplus joaquin

), splendid shield-backed katydid (

Ateloplus splendidus

), Antioch shield-backed katydid (

Neduba extincta

), San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper (

Trimerotropis bernardi

), Lompoc grasshopper (

Trimerotropis occulens

), Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper (

Trimerotropis occidentaloides

), Central Valley grasshopper (

Conozoa hyalina

), and the Mexicali lubber grasshopper (

Spaniacris destricola

) as endangered species. The letter, dated February 28, 1993, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the
name, signature, address, and telephone number of the petitioner.

The petitioned species are characterized by a substantial lack of information regarding their geographical range,
ecological requirements, and population status. The Natural Diversity Data Base of the California Department of
Fish and Game had no records of any of these animals. 

The petition stated that the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket is known from Jacalitos Canyon and the Panoche Hills in Fresno
County, and Kettleman Hills in Kings County. Tinkham and Rentz (1969) reported records from two localities in Tulare
County and three localities in western Fresno County. The Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket is restricted to areas containing
sandstone and is found primarily under rocks at the bases of hillsides (Tinkham and Rentz 1969). No data are available
on the specific localities or status of the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket. The petitioner stated that the Jacalitos
shield-backed katydid is known from two male specimens. No information was presented on the specific localities,
habitat requirements, or status of the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid. Oil drilling and livestock grazing were
cited as threats to these two animals. Jacalitos Canyon is included as a conservation area in the Coalinga Habitat
Conservation Plan (Ron Rempel, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm. 1993). No urban development is
proposed or likely in this area because of a lack of water. Indirect protection for the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket
and the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid may be provided by the presence of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (

Vulpes macrotis mutica

) and blunt-nosed leopard lizard (

Gambelia silus

) in the area. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal.
Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested
action may be warranted. 

The splendid shield-backed katydid is only known from two localities, Barstow and 3 miles west of Essex, San Bernardino
County, California. This species has been found in creosote bushes (Rentz and Birchim 1968). The petitioner stated
that a female specimen reported from the Imperial Valley in Imperial County, California, is apparently a different
species. No information was presented to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or population
status of this animal. No threats to this species were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service. Beyond
the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service
determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.

The petition and other information available to the Service indicate that the Berkeley ground cricket is known from
four localities in the San Francisco Bay area of California (Rehn and Hebard 1918, Weissman and Rentz 1977, Vickery
and Weissman 1989). A population is protected at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and another population is unprotected
in a heavily grazed pasture on Stanford University (Weissman and Rentz 1977). The petitioner stated that grazing
may benefit the species. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of
the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that
the requested action may be warranted. 
The Antioch shield-backed katydid is known only from a single male specimen collected in 1937 at the Antioch sand dunes
in Contra Costa County, California (Rentz 1977). Though the dunes historically covered an estimated 190 acres, only
70 acres remain (United States Fish and Wildlife Service 1984). The natural habitats in this area have been adversely
effected by industrialization, sand mining, urbanization, agricultural land conversion, off-road vehicles,
wildfire, and other human impacts. As suggested by its specific epithet, the Antioch shield-backed katydid is presumed
extinct, given the extent of habitat loss and absence of any observations since 1937. Diligent searches for this animal
have been conducted by numerous professional and amateur entomologists over a period of several decades but no further
individuals have been located (Powell 1978, Rentz 1977). Conversely, if the species is still extant on the sand dunes,
it likely would be protected because most of the remaining natural dunes are secured by the Service's ownership and
management of the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge was created to protect the endangered Lange's
metalmark butterfly (

Apodemia mormo langei

), Contra Costa wallflower (

Erysimum capitatum 

ssp. 

angustatum

), and the Antioch Dunes evening primrose (

Oenothera deltoides 

ssp. 

howellii

). Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal, which is
possibly extinct. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information
that the requested action may be warranted. 
The San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper is known only from Vivian and High Creeks in the San Bernardino Mountains
of San Bernardino County, California (Otte 1984, Rentz and Weissman 1984). The species inhabits ponderosa pine forest
at altitudes of 1820 to 2743 meters (Rentz and Weissman 1984). Little information is available on the specific localities,
habitat requirements, or status of this species. No threats to this animal were cited in the petition or are otherwise
known to the Service. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the
animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the
requested action may be warranted. 
The Lompoc grasshopper is known from Lompoc in Santa Barbara County and Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo County during
the month of August (Otte 1984). No data are available to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements,
or status of this animal. No threats to this species were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service.
Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested
action may be warranted. 
The Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper is known only from the western Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura
Counties. This species has been found on bare hillsides and along dirt trails in chaparral (Rentz and Weissman 1981).
The petitioner did not cite any threats, but noted that two locations inhabited by this species have been destroyed
by development. Little information exists on the habitat requirements or status of this species. Beyond the information
described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines
that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted. 
The Central Valley grasshopper is known from four localities in the Central Valley and the Delta region of California
(Otte 1984, Strohecker 

et al. 

1968). The petitioner stated that this species has not been collected since 1953. The Central Valley grasshopper
has been found on low, dry desert flats during the months of July and August in the vicinity of Bakersfield, Ceres, and
Turlock (Otte 1984). No data are available to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or status
of the Central Valley grasshopper. No threats to this animal were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the
Service. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the
requested action may be warranted.

The Mexicali lubber grasshopper is known from eastern Riverside and Imperial counties in California, and Baja California
Norte in Mexico. According to Stohecker 

et al. 

(1968) and Helfer (1963), this animal is an inhabitant of low, silt or dry, sandy desert areas that are subject to extremely
high temperatures. The petitioner did not cite any threats to this species, however, three populations have been
eliminated by development in 1961 and 1972 (Tinkham 1975). Rehn and Grant (1961) and Tinkham (1975) provided information
on the ecology and some populations of this animal. No current information is available on the status of the Mexicali
lubber grasshopper. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the
animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the
requested action may be warranted. 


Petition Findings 


After careful assessment of the scientific and commercial information contained in the petitions, referenced in
the petitions, and otherwise available to the Service at this time, the Service finds that 7 of the 11 petitions for
16 taxa do not present substantial information that listing the Marin blind harvestman (

Calicina diminua

), Anza Borrego blind harvestman (

Sitalcina borregoensis

), Silver Creek blind harvestman (

Calicina jungi

), Ross micro-blind harvestman (

Microcina 

sp.), Ubick's gnaphosid spider (

Talanites ubicki

), unsilvered fritillary butterfly (

Speyeria adiaste adiaste

), Jacalitos jerusalem cricket (

Stenopelmatus nigrocapitatus

), Berkeley ground cricket (

Neonemobius eurynotus

), Jacalitos shield-backed katydid (

Ateloplus joaquin

), splendid shield-backed katydid (

Ateloplus splendidus

), Antioch shield-backed katydid (

Neduba extincta

), San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper (

Trimerotropis bernardi

), Lompoc grasshopper (

Trimerotropis occulens

), Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper (

Trimerotropis occidentaloides

), Central Valley grasshopper (

Conozoa hyalina

), and Mexicali lubber grasshopper (

Spaniacris destricola

) may be warranted. In addition, the Service determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time for
4 of the 11 petitions for four taxa involving the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman (

Microcina lumi

), Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman (

Microcina edgewoodensis

), Yontocket ringlet butterfly (

Coenonympha tullia yontocket

), and Opler's longhorn moth (

Adela oplerella

). These four taxa will be retained in category 2. The Service will continue to accept information on the status of these
20 species until further notice. If information becomes available indicating that listing as endangered or threatened
is appropriate, the Service would propose to list any such species.

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the framework procedure for adjusting management measures of the Fishery Management Plan for
the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), NMFS proposes to reduce the bag limit for red snapper to zero for
the operator and crew of a vessel operating as a charter vessel or headboat; reduce the daily bag limit for red snapper
to five for other persons subject to the bag limit; and increase the minimum allowable size of red snapper, currently
14 inches (35.6 cm), to 15 inches (38.1 cm) for persons subject to the bag limit. NMFS also proposes to delay the opening
of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. NMFS intends that these management measure adjustments,
if adopted in final, become effective January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year. The intended effects
of this rule are to prevent overfishing of red snapper and to ensure that the commercial red snapper fishery is open
when demand for fresh fish is at its highest. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery
Management Council (Council) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 641.

The red snapper stock assessment completed by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, in September 1994 indicated
that the spawning potential ratio (SPR) has increased from less than 1 percent in 1984 to about 2 percent in 1994. This
increase is due to the conservation measures already in place. However, the FMP has a goal of 20 percent SPR for all reef
fish, and a target date for recovery of the overfished red snapper stock by the year 2009. Based on data in the assessment
and the FMP's rebuilding schedule, the Council's Reef Fish Stock Assessment Panel (SAP) calculated the allowable
biological catch (ABC) as having an upper limit of 6.00 million pounds (m lb) (2.72 million kg (m kg)). The Council's
Socioeconomic Panel (SEP) recommended that the ABC be established specifically at 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg). 

Based on the SAP's and SEP's reports, the Council recommends a continuation of TAC at the upper end of the ABC range,
6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg), for 1995. A 1995 TAC of 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg) is consistent with the FMP's rebuilding program for red
snapper, and is within the framework bounds established in the FMP. NMFS is requesting public comment on the Council's
recommended TAC for 1995. 



Proposed Management Measures Associated With Red Snapper TAC 



The FMP's framework procedure requires that allocations of the red snapper TAC be based on a historical 51/49 commercial/recreational
harvest ratio. A TAC of 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg), therefore, results in a commercial quota of 3.06 m lb (1.39 m kg) and a recreational
allocation of 2.94 m lb (1.33 m kg). The recreational fishery is managed by bag and minimum size limits, currently 7
fish and 14 inches (35.6 cm), respectively. The 1994 stock assessment showed that the recreational fishing harvest
greatly exceeded the recreational fishery allocation in 1992, 1993, and is expected to do so in 1994. 

To ensure that the recreational fishery does not exceed its 1995 allocation of 2.94 m lb (1.33 m kg), the recreational
harvest must be reduced by about 43 percent from the 1993 harvest level, estimated at approximately 5.10 m lb (2.31
m kg). Preliminary estimates presented to the Council by its staff indicated that a 15-inch (38.1-cm) size limit and
5-fish bag limit together would achieve a 38-percent harvest reduction from the 1993 level, assuming the validity
of a 33-percent release mortality utilized in the stock assessment. The remaining necessary harvest reduction of
5 percent is expected to result from the proposed catch restriction for charter vessel and headboat operators and
crew. The Council heard extensive public testimony from charter vessel and headboat operators who claimed that severe
adverse social and economic impacts would result from reduction of the red snapper bag limit, particularly if decreased
to less than five fish per customer. Several of these operators suggested elimination of red snapper harvest by the
charter vessel and headboat operators and crew to help achieve the necessary reduction in recreational harvest (compared
to 1993 levels). Industry representatives who testified to the Council characterized that measure, considered
as an alternative, as less disruptive than a severe reduction in the bag limit. 

The Council, following its review of all available information, determined that more restrictive red snapper size
and bag limits are necessary to avoid additional overruns of the recreational allocation that could lead to overfishing.
Accordingly, the Council recommended, and NMFS is proposing: (1) 
A reduction of the bag limit for red snapper to zero for charter vessel and headboat operators and crew; (2) a reduction
of the daily bag limit for red snapper to five for other persons; and (3) an increase in the minimum allowable size of
red snapper to 15 inches (38.1 cm), applicable to red snapper taken under the bag limit. If adopted in final, these measures
would be made effective January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year. 

The proposed reduction in the red snapper recreational catch is designed to maintain allocations between the recreational
and commercial sectors and to ensure that the total red snapper harvest in 1995 remains within the TAC level, thereby
adhering to the FMP's stock rebuilding program. 

Since the Council submitted its recommended 1995 management measures for red snapper, NMFS has completed a new evaluation
of the probable magnitude of the 1994 and 1995 recreational red snapper harvests; this analysis assumes implementation
of the proposed measures for 1995 contained in this rule. Based on this evaluation, NMFS is concerned whether these
proposed measures will adequately constrain recreational catches to the level of the sector's allocation in 1995.
This recent evaluation shows a clear increasing trend in the proportion of trips to offshore waters that are returning
with red snapper that may, in part, result in recreational fishery catches well above the allocation. The Council
is expected to review this recent information on anticipated recreational fishery catches. Comments are invited
as to whether additional adjustments to bag limits and size limitations may be needed to meet stock recovery goals.


In addition to changes in recreational fishery measures, the Council recommended, and NMFS is proposing, a delay
in the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. The proposed delayed opening date
was requested by fishermen to help ensure that the fishery would remain open during the entire Lenten season when there
is a higher demand for fresh fish. 

The Council's recommended changes are within the scope of the management measures that may be adjusted by the framework
procedure for adjusting management measures referred to at 50 CFR 641.28 and specified in the FMP. The Director, Southeast
Region, NMFS, initially concurs that the Council's recommended changes are consistent with the objectives of the
FMP, the national standards for fishery conservation and management and other provisions of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act, and other applicable law. Accordingly, the Council's recommended changes are
published by NMFS as a proposed rule for public comment.

Minority Report 



A minority report signed by five Council members raises several objections to the proposed red snapper management
measures, including alleged deficiencies in fishery data supporting the Council's recommendations and an alleged
inadequate assessment of the impacts of bag limit reductions on headboat and charter vessel operators and crew. The
report does not object to the delayed opening of the commercial red snapper season. Copies of the minority report are
available (see 

ADDRESSES

). NMFS is considering and reviewing the minority report. Any final rule implementing the approved measures in the
regulatory amendment will respond to comments on the proposed rule received by NMFS during the 15-day comment period,
including the issues raised in the Council's minority report. 



Classification 



This proposed rule was determined to be not significant under E.O. 12866. 

NMFS has determined that the proposed change in the red snapper bag limit and the restriction on the allowable harvest
of red snapper for headboat and charter vessel captains and crew could affect more than 5 percent of gross for-hire
commercial revenues. As a result, the proposed action could cause a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities, and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared. A copy of this analysis is available
(see 

ADDRESSES

). 

NMFS is proposing a 15-day comment period on this rule, as opposed to a maximum of 30 days allowed under the FMP's framework
procedure, in order to provide an opportunity for participation by the public while ensuring that the proposed measures,
if adopted in final, can be implemented by January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year.

Acid Rain Program: Permits



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101-549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act),
authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11,
1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules.
On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues.

 


Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility
of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that
is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and
that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be
designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table
A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' 

The Agency is proposing to revise the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the
statutory ``control'' requirement for substitution plans is met. Because the rule revision is consistent with the
August 10, 1994 settlement and the Agency does not anticipate receiving adverse comments, the revision is also being
issued as a direct final rule in the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 If no significant, adverse comments are timely received, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this
proposed rule and the direct final rule in the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

 will automatically go into effect on the date specified in that rule. If significant, adverse comments are timely
received on any provision, that provision of the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comment received
on that provision will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the relevant portions of this proposed rule.
Because the Agency will not institute a second comment period on this proposed rule, any parties interested in commenting
should do so during this comment period.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to alter the Los Angeles, CA, Class B airspace area. This proposal would lower the ceiling of the
Los Angeles Class B airspace area from 12,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) to 10,000 feet MSL; raise the base altitude west
of Santa Monica, CA, from 4,000 feet MSL to 7,000 feet MSL to provide for more airspace for uncontrolled traffic to navigate
outside of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area; and expand the eastern, southern and southeastern boundaries for
additional airspace for the arrival of high performance aircraft. This action would improve aviation traffic flow
and enhance safety in the Los Angeles area while accommodating the concerns of airspace users.

On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91-78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782)
which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's).

On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule which requires Mode C equipment when operating within 30 nautical miles
of any designated TCA primary airport from the surface up to 10,000 feet MSL, except for those aircraft not originally
certified with an engine driven electrical system or which have not subsequently been certified with such a system
installed (53 FR 23356).

On October 14, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirements
for conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule: (a) Established a single-class TCA; (b)
requires the pilot in command of a civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilot certificate,
except for a student pilot who has received certain documented training; and (c) eliminated the helicopter exception
from the minimum navigational equipment requirement.

On December 17, 1991, the FAA published a final rule on airspace reclassification (56 FR 65655) of those airspace designations
described in part 71 of the FAR. As a result of this reclassification, that airspace formerly referred to as the Los
Angeles, CA, Terminal Control Area was reclassified to the Los Angeles, CA, Class B airspace, effective September
16, 1993.



Background



The Class B airspace (TCA prior to September 16, 1993) program was developed to reduce the midair collision potential
in the congested airspace surrounding airports with high density air traffic by providing an area in which all aircraft
will be subject to certain operating rules and equipment requirements. The density of traffic and the type of operations
being conducted in the airspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midair collisions. In 1970,
an extensive study found that the majority of midair collisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft
and an air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor common to these conflicts was the mix of
uncontrolled aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating under instrument
flight rules (IFR). Class B airspace areas provide a method to accommodate the increasing number of IFR and VFR operations.
The regulatory requirements of Class B airspace areas afford the greatest protection for the greatest number of people
by giving air traffic control (ATC) increased capability to provide aircraft separation service, thereby minimizing
the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft. To date, the FAA has established a total of 29 Class B airspace area
designations. The FAA is proposing to take action to modify or implement additional Class B airspace areas to provide
greater protection of air traffic in the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.

Class B airspace areas are published in Paragraph 3000 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994. The Class B airspace area listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The standard configuration of a Class B airspace area consists of 3 concentric circles centered on the primary airport
extending to 10, 20, and 30 nautical miles respectively. The vertical limits of the Class B airspace area should normally
not exceed 10,000 feet MSL, with the floor established at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriate for
operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteria may be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent
regulatory airspace, and other factors unique to the area.


Pre-NPRM Public Input


As announced in the 

Federal Register 

on April 22, 1992, pre-NPRM airspace meetings were held on June 23, 25, 30 and July 1, 1992, at Brentwood, San Diego,
Los Alamitos, and Walnut, California, respectively, to encourage the public and airspace users to participate in
developing the design for the Los Angeles Class B airspace area modification 57 FR 14670. Comments on this proposed
modification were provided by private citizens, local government agencies, user groups, and local airport authorities.
These comments were considered in the proposed modification of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area.
Pilot groups were concerned more about the aviation aspects of the proposal, while some homeowners were more concerned
with the non-aviation aspects. Lowering the ceiling of the proposed airspace from 12,500 to 10,000 feet MSL generated
positive response from most pilots, because pilots would be able to overfly the Class B airspace area and descend south
of the Class B airspace area while conforming to the mode C requirement. Some homeowners viewed this modification
negatively. Current flight tracks bring aircraft over their homes, and lowering the ceiling of the proposed airspace
would bring these aircraft in closer proximity to their homes. It should be noted that this proposed action does not
propose a change to these flight tracks, as they now exist.
Both groups had positive comments on raising the floor in the Malibu area to provide additional VFR operations. Expansion
of the Class B airspace boundaries generated conflicting comments. Homeowners saw the regulatory airspace as growing
for no reason, while pilots viewed the growth of regulatory airspace as providing additional controlled airspace
for high performance aircraft from the east, southeast and south. Other comments are discussed below in the ``Proposal''
section.


The Proposal


The FAA proposes to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the existing Los Angeles
Class B airspace area, based on safety and operational needs. The FAA's responsibility is to manage efficiently and
safely the airspace surrounding the Los Angeles area. This proposal would lower the ceiling of the Los Angeles Class
B airspace area from 12,500 feet mean seal level (MSL) to 10,000 feet MSL; raise the base altitude west of Santa Monica,
CA, from 4,000 feet MSL to 7,000 feet MSL to provide more airspace for uncontrolled traffic to navigate outside of the
Los Angeles Class B airspace area; and expand the eastern, southern and southeastern boundaries for additional controlled
airspace for the high performance aircraft. The proposed alteration is depicted in the attached chart.
The following proposed modifications of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area are as follows:
Area A. That airspace extending from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 34

'
'W. (INISH intersection); to the point of beginning.
This change is necessary because of the concentration of high performance aircraft operating very close to the surface
as they arrive and depart Los Angeles International (LAX), the Class B airspace primary airport. The proposed modification,
which incorporates the suggestion made by the Southern California Airspace User's Group to relocate the boundary
of the area, would reduce the area size to the north of Los Angeles, thereby enabling aircraft utilizing the VFR Special
Flight Rules Area to enter the traffic pattern sooner for the Santa Monica Airport. Additionally, this would allow
aircraft at Santa Monica Airport to enter the traffic pattern at a more reasonable altitude. General aviation user
groups actively supported this modification with the assurance that the VFR Special Flight Rules Area would remain
available for transition through the Class B airspace.

The number of turboprop aircraft operating at LAX has increased. The proposed modification would accommodate the
requirement to contain turboprop operations within the Class B airspace area, segregating them from jet operations.
Overwater portions of this area, used by VFR traffic for banner tows and low level sightseeing, would not be adversely
affected by this change.

Area B. That airspace extending upward from 1,500 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning

The proposed modification would ease the restrictions on aircraft transiting north from Santa Monica and make navigation
between the Los Angeles Class B airspace area and the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, CA, Class C airspace area
less difficult. Reducing this area of the Class B airspace area would increase the usable airspace for GA and emergency
response aircraft as well as facilitate navigation clear of the Class B airspace area.

The proposed change would move the northern boundary of this area south and remove V-186, below 8,000 feet MSL,
from the Class B airspace. This will make navigation simpler and reduce the probability of an inadvertent Class B airspace
violation. Currently, Area D contains a portion of V-186 from 4,000 feet to 12,500 feet MSL and is located 20 to
25 miles east of Los Angeles. V-186 is a primary route used for VFR navigation around the Los Angeles Class B airspace.
To remain clear of the Class B airspace, VFR aircraft must navigate north of this airway. Navigation in this area is
difficult for VFR traffic because of the rising terrain.

With regard to Areas E and F, arrival traffic to Los Angeles from the east descends on the CIVET Southern California
Terminal Airspace Realignment (STAR) arrival profile. This allows aircraft to descend on the glideslope, approximately
50 miles from the airport. This is the busiest route in the Los Angeles Basin. Traffic on this route must descend through
an area surrounded by numerous VFR flyways with a mix of IFR traffic arriving, departing, and overflying the various
airports in the Los Angeles Basin. Because of the analysis of near midair collision reports (NMAC), concern exists
regarding the airspace between the outer boundary of the current Class B airspace and the Ontario Class C airspace,
approximately 35 miles east of Los Angeles. In this area, high performance aircraft are descending out of 10,000 feet
MSL, and VFR aircraft are navigating around the Class B airspace. This proposal would provide additional airspace
for large jet aircraft within the Class B airspace area. Terrain features would be used to provide an easily discernible
boundary to assist VFR aircraft in avoiding the Class B airspace. The extension of the Class B airspace area between
25 nautical miles (NM) and 35 NM east provides additional airspace for high performance aircraft in the Class B airspace
area and provides better separation from other aircraft operating near the Class B airspace.

With regard to Areas G, H, I, and J, major airspace modifications are proposed because of the implementation of the
STAR (Southern California Terminal Airspace Realignment) plan and the resultant increase in the traffic routed
inbound to LAX from the south. The Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) sequences traffic from
Asia and the Pacific arriving over the Santa Catalina Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation
(VORTAC) with arrival traffic from Mexico, South America, and San Diego routed over the Seal Beach VORTAC (SLI). It
is important that this traffic descend in a timely manner, as delays could affect the eastbound departure traffic.
To facilitate this mix of traffic, the proposed Areas G, H, and I are designed to facilitate both the arrival and departure
traffic without interfering with existing VFR routes. Area G would allow aircraft arriving from the south to remain
within the Class B airspace as they descend to the final approach course. Depicted VFR flyways at 3,500 and 4,500 feet
MSL will remain unaffected. Area H would allow VFR aircraft to climb eastbound, east of the Seal Beach VORTAC, while
enabling Los Angeles approach to utilize altitudes compatible with the final approach course. Area I has been proposed
using geographical coordinates and terrain features to facilitate the efficient use of this airspace. Area J would
allow VFR flight at 7,500 feet MSL which user input indicated was a commonly used altitude for VFR flight to and from
Santa Catalina. This proposed area would not eliminate established VFR transition routes. 

Area K. That airspace extending upward from 5,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning

'
'W. (INISH Intersection); to the point of beginning. 

Located entirely offshore, Area K is designed to accommodate high performance traffic departing LAX, via the LAXX
ONE Departure, as well as arrival traffic when Los Angeles is in an east flow configuration. This area is not utilized
by VFR aircraft on a routine basis; however, based on the recommendations of local pilots, the area was designed to
accommodate GA operations offshore south of Palos Verdes, CA. 

Area L. That airspace extending upward from 2,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning
at lat. 33

The proposed Area L aligns with V-27. This would allow navigation along V-27, while in the Class B airspace
area. 

Area M. That airspace extending upward from 7,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning

The proposed Area M would contain high performance aircraft arriving from the north, when LAX is in an east traffic
flow configuration. To mitigate the impact of this area on VFR traffic and to prevent adverse effects, the floor of
the Class B airspace area in this area is proposed to be 7,000 feet MSL. This would provide additional airspace for VFR
operations.

The proposed Area N modification would allow for more airspace for aircraft departing LAX and would allow aircraft,
northbound over Santa Monica, to execute an earlier turn westbound. Additionally, this change would benefit VFR
operations by providing additional airspace for uncontrolled VFR aircraft to overfly Point Dume, CA.


Regulatory Evaluation Summary


The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive Order
12866, and therefore no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with the Department
of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the anticipated costs and benefits, which are summarized
below. For more detailed economic information, see the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket.


Benefit-Cost Analysis


The proposal would improve aviation traffic flow and enhance aviation safety by altering Class B airspace in and around
LAX while accommodating the legitimate concerns of airspace users. 


Costs


The FAA has determined that there would be little or no costs associated with implementation of the proposed modification
to the LAX Class B airspace area to either the agency or aircraft operators. The determination for each potential cost
is discussed below.
The proposed rule would not impose any additional administrative costs on the FAA for either personnel or equipment.
The additional operations workload generated by the proposed rule would be absorbed by current personnel and equipment
resources which are already in place. The cost of revising aeronautical charts to reflect the change of the airspace
would not add to the normal requirement of routine and periodic updating of the charts. 
Aircraft operating in the vicinity of the proposed expanded Los Angeles Class B airspace area should already have
two-way radio communications capability because the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area is surrounded by
Class C and D airspace areas. Thus, little if any, additional communication equipment should be required by this proposal.
To minimize any radio installation costs that may occur, the FAA would provide cutouts along the floor of the proposed
expanded Class B airspace area. In addition, procedural agreements between ATC and affected satellite airports
could be used to avoid imposing radio installation costs on operators at these airports. Additionally, the cost to
pilots who avoid the Los Angeles Class B airspace area should not increase significantly. Only small deviations from
the current flight paths would be required to avoid the proposed expanded Los Angeles Class B airspace area. 
Ordinarily, aircraft operating in and above the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area would be required to have
Mode C transponders as a result of the Mode C rule. However, all of the airspace that would be included in the proposed
expanded Class B airspace area lies entirely within the Los Angeles Mode C Veil centered around LAX. Therefore, the
FAA contends that all aircraft operating in or above the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area already have Mode
C transponders. 


Benefits


The proposed rule is expected to generate benefits primarily in the form of improved traffic flow while enhancing
safety. Enhancements to safety come in the lowered risk of midair collisions (despite the rise in traffic density)
due to the increased ATC control of the modified airspace.
This proposed rule would benefit GA aircraft operators by reducing the size of the various subareas of the Class B airspace
area, thus increasing usable airspace for GA aircraft. Additionally, it would simplify the airspace and reduce possible
pilot confusion. Also, areas B and C would be reduced to allow more airspace with less restrictions for emergency response
aircraft.
In view of the minimal cost of compliance versus enhancements to aviation safety and efficiency, the FAA has determined
that the proposed rule is cost-beneficial.


Regulatory Flexibility Determination


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review proposed rules which may have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities which could be potentially affected
by the implementation of this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire owning nine or fewer aircraft.

Only those unscheduled aircraft operators without the capability to operate under IFR conditions would be potentially
impacted by the proposed rule. The FAA believes that all of the potentially impacted unscheduled aircraft operators
are already equipped to operate under IFR conditions. This is because such operators fly regularly in airports where
radar approach control services have been established. Therefore, the FAA believes this proposed rule would have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

International Trade Impact Assessment



The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor would it have an effect on the sale of United States products or services in foreign countries. The proposed rule
would neither impose costs on aircraft operators nor aircraft manufacturers (United States or foreign).



Federalism Implications



This proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined that this proposed
rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Analysis



The procedures implemented by this rule have been determined to not significantly affect the quality of the human
environ
