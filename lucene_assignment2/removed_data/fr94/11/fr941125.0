SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36691-36692, Docket No. 94-068-1), we amended the tuberculosis regulations
in 9 CFR part 77 by removing Louisiana from the list of modified accredited States in  77.1 and adding it to the
list of accredited-free States in that section. 

Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before September 19, 1994. We did not receive any comments.
The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 

This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>








Change in Organizational Title and Telephone Numbers 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations regarding petitions for rulemaking to indicate the
current title of the organization within the NRC from which a prospective petitioner may seek consultation before
filing a petition for rulemaking. This amendment also supplies the current telephone numbers for a prospective petitioner
to contact the NRC before filing a petition for rulemaking.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is revising the regulations in 10 CFR Part 2 that pertain to filing of petitions
for rulemaking to reflect a name change of the NRC organization from which a prospective petitioner may consult with
the NRC before filing a petition for rulemaking. This action indicates that the name of the Regulatory Publications
Branch, in the Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, has been
changed to the Rules Review and Directives Branch (RRDB). The current telephone number on which a prospective petitioner
may directly contact RRDB is now (301) 415-7158. The public access toll free telephone number, (800) 368-5642,
is unchanged. 
Because this is an amendment dealing with agency practice and procedures, the notice and comment provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act do not apply pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). The amendment is effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

. Good cause exists to dispense with the usual 30-day delay in the effective date because the amendment is of a minor
and administrative nature dealing with a change to an organizational name and telephone number. 


Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
final rule. 


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150-0036.

Capital Adequacy: Net Unrealized Holding Gains and Losses on Available-For-Sale Securities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has determined not to adopt its proposal to include the Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities''
(FAS 115), adjustment for net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in Tier 1 capital.
Based upon analysis of the comments received and having considered the potential consequences of including the FAS
115 adjustment in Tier 1 capital, the OCC, in consultation with the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (Federal banking agencies), determined not to amend the definition
of Tier 1 capital as previously proposed. 



The OCC also decided to maintain the current requirement that national banks deduct net unrealized losses on equity
securities when calculating Tier 1 capital. However, because FAS 115 changed the names and requirements of the security
classifications in the investment portfolio, this final rule amends the definition of common stockholders' equity
to reflect the revised classifications used for equity securities that are not in the trading account.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


Under the current OCC minimum capital requirements (leverage ratio) and the risk-based capital guidelines set forth
at 12 CFR part 3 appendix A, section 1(c)(7), a major component of Tier 1 capital is common stockholders' equity. Common
stockholders' equity currently includes:
(1) common stock,
(2) common stock surplus,
(3) undivided profits,
(4) capital reserves,
(5) adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, and
(6) net unrealized losses on noncurrent marketable equity securities. The net unrealized losses are those recorded
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 12, ``Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities'' (FAS
12). 


FAS 115 


In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 115. This statement superseded FAS 12. FAS
115 required that all securities be grouped into one of three classifications: held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale.
Most significantly, FAS 115 established net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
as a new component of common stockholders' equity. 
FAS 115 defines available-for-sale securities as those securities that a bank does not have the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity, and does not intend to trade actively as part of its trading account. FAS 115 increases
the number of securities that banks must account for at market value. Consequently, numerous securities previously
reported by banks at amortized cost will now be reported at their market value. In August 1993, the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) announced the adoption of FAS 115 for regulatory reporting purposes,
effective January 1, 1994. Accordingly, all national banks follow FAS 115 for reporting purposes. 


Proposal 


On April 18, 1994, the OCC proposed to adopt FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes (59 FR 18328, April 18, 1994). The
other Federal banking agencies published similar proposals to adopt FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes. See
58 FR 68563 (December 28, 1993) (Federal Reserve Board); 58 FR 68781 (December 29, 1993) (Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation); 59 FR 32143 (June 22, 1994) (Office of Thrift Supervision). The OCC issued the proposal to promote greater
consistency of regulatory capital rules with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). At the same time,
the OCC wanted to understand the industry sentiment regarding the costs and benefits of adopting FAS 115, and to determine
banks' assessment of their ability to manage the potential volatility in regulatory capital.

The comment period for the OCC's proposal closed on May 18, 1994. Among the 69 commenters, 61 were banks, thrifts or
holding companies; five were financial institution trade groups; one was a public accounting firm; one was an investment
banking firm, and one was a clearinghouse association. Fifty-five of the commenters opposed the proposal to include
net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities in Tier 1 capital. 
Opposition to the proposal focused on the belief that including the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities in regulatory capital would result in excessive volatility in regulatory capital levels. Many commenters
observed that temporary market conditions could cause banks to change capital levels. Although an interest rate
change causing a change in a security's market value may be temporary, the fluctuation in Tier 1 capital could trigger
more permanent regulatory provisions and sanctions tied to a bank's level of capitalization. For example, a change
in capital could limit a bank's ability to acquire brokered deposits or increase a bank's deposit insurance premiums.
In an extreme case, a bank could be subject to prompt corrective action restrictions, sanctions, and penalties. 
A few commenters were critical of the market value accounting approach. These commenters believe that recognizing
unrealized gains and losses directly in capital would present a misleading report of a bank's financial condition.
Although these unrealized gains and losses may reflect market value, banks may never realize the dollar values of
these unrealized gains and losses. Several commenters believe that FAS 115 is not consistent in its approach because
it requires banks to account for certain assets at fair market value while liabilities are valued at cost. These commenters
believe that by focusing only on certain assets, FAS 115 does not properly consider the effects of market changes on
other components of bank balance sheets. 
Several commenters opposed this proposal because of another recent OCC notice of proposed rulemaking to link the
lending limits on loans to one borrower to the capital adequacy rules (59 FR 6593, February 11, 1994). These commenters
observed that if the OCC adopts both proposals, an unacceptable level of volatility would be introduced to bank lending
limits. As a result, the capital rules could restrain a bank's ability to lend to a single borrower in times of rising
interest rates. 
Of the ten commenters favoring the proposal, eight believe that the OCC should make its capital adequacy rules consistent
with GAAP. Several of these commenters indicated that they would incur additional recordkeeping expenses if the
regulatory definition of capital differs from the GAAP definition. These commenters believe that the regulatory
burden would be increased by excluding the FAS 115 adjustment from Tier 1 capital. However, several commenters from
smaller banks contradicted this view. These commenters stated that adoption of the proposal to include net unrealized
holding gains and losses in stockholders' equity would increase regulatory burden because they would have to change
their investment and portfolio management procedures.

A few commenters believe that adoption of the proposed rule would be consistent with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), Pub. L. 102-242 (1991). Specifically, the commenters refer
to section 121 of FDICIA which requires that the Federal banking agency regulatory accounting policy, applicable
to reports or statements filed with Federal banking agencies, be no less stringent than GAAP. 
Several commenters indicated that they did not see any benefit from implementing FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes.
They believe that the costs of implementing the proposal would exceed any benefits obtained. These commenters believe
adoption of the proposal would reduce bank profitability. These commenters also believe that greater volatility
in the investment portfolio would translate into greater volatility in bank capital. 
Several commenters believe that banks may change their investment strategies to avoid the potential adverse consequences
of volatility in capital levels. These commenters predict that banks would attempt to manage the volatility by purchasing
lower-yielding securities of shorter duration. Banks would shorten the duration of their securities to minimize
the potential for depreciation due to increases in interest rates. Banks could also limit the types of securities
acquired to those with less interest rate risk. Portfolios with lower volatility risk would produce lower yields,
resulting in smaller profit margins. 
A few commenters observed that to avoid volatility in regulatory capital, bank management may pay more attention
to the short-term impacts of portfolio decisions instead of emphasizing long-term investment management strategies.
The proposal could result in a reduction of a portfolio manager's flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.



Commenter Alternatives 


Several commenters suggested alternative methods of adopting FAS 115 for regulatory capital. A few commenters suggested
revising the regulatory capital rules to include the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities in Tier 2 capital. However, the OCC believes that adoption of this alternative would increase the complexity
of the risk-based capital calculations. In addition, because FAS 115 significantly increased the number of securities
subject to market valuation, including the unrealized gains and losses in Tier 2 capital may not prevent volatility
in regulatory capital levels. 
Several commenters suggested that other balance sheet accounts, particularly liabilities, should be reported
at their market values. These commenters argue that regulatory capital could then include the net unrealized holding
gains and losses on these other balance sheet accounts. This would result in a more consistent treatment of assets
and liabilities. The OCC agrees that a more consistent method of applying market values to assets and liabilities
would result in a better approach. However, since the FASB was unable to identify a workable approach for valuing liabilities
when it developed FAS 115, the OCC concluded that this modification would require considerably more research. Therefore,
the OCC concluded that it could not implement this suggestion at this time.

Another commenter suggested that the OCC include net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities in regulatory capital, but exclude the adjustment from capital calculations that are tied to other regulations
such as prompt corrective action or FDIC insurance premiums. This approach would also be complex and burdensome and
essentially require a bank to maintain yet another set of capital calculations. Accordingly, the OCC determined
not to implement this alternative. 
Another commenter suggested that banks disclose market values but exclude them from regulatory capital. Since the
OCC has adopted FAS 115 for regulatory reporting, but will not adopt it for regulatory capital purposes, in effect,
the OCC is implementing this suggestion. 


The Final Rule 


After considering all the comments received, the OCC, in consultation with the other Federal banking agencies, decided
not to adopt the proposal to include the net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
in the definition of common stockholders' equity. The significant changes in market interest rates that occurred
during the first two quarters of 1994 demonstrated that bank capital levels could be significantly more volatile
if the definition of common stockholders' equity included the FAS 115 adjustment for net unrealized holding gains
and losses. This is especially true for smaller banks that tend to have more of their assets in marketable securities.
Additionally, smaller banks may lack the financial resources to establish a portfolio management function dedicated
to hedging interest rate risks. 
Based on the comment letters received, the OCC determined that including the FAS 115 adjustment in capital could have
consequences that may adversely impact the banking industry. For example, market-driven fluctuations in interest
rates could cause temporary changes in regulatory capital levels, which in turn could trigger inappropriate regulatory
intervention. In addition, industry profitability could decline due to higher expenses and lower investment yields,
simply due to the accounting implications of FAS 115. The OCC is concerned that adoption of the proposal would encourage
management to place excessive weight on the accounting implications of their decisions, rather than on their long-term
economic impacts. 
Additionally, the OCC is concerned that the lack of consistent application of market valuation for assets and liabilities
would present a misleading report of a bank's regulatory capital. Since FAS 115 only requires market value accounting
for certain segments of the investment portfolio, only one side of the balance sheet reflects the impact of interest
rate changes. The OCC believes it would be inappropriate to take regulatory action without evaluating the impact
of rate changes on both sides of the balance sheet. 
The OCC, considered the comments received regarding FDICIA's requirement that regulatory accounting policy be
no less stringent than GAAP. In fact, section 121 of FDICIA (12 U.S.C. 1831n) requires that policies applicable to
reports and statements filed with the Federal banking agencies conform to GAAP. The section does not require the calculation
of an institution's regulatory capital or the components of regulatory capital to conform to GAAP, and the legislative
history of the section indicates that was not the intent of Congress. By adopting FAS 115 for regulatory reporting
purposes, the OCC's policy conforms to the section 121 requirement. 
Although the OCC and other Federal regulatory agencies attempt to conform to GAAP when formulating regulatory policy,
it is not always appropriate. When formulating GAAP, the accounting policy makers do not focus on the unique capital
adequacy requirements of banks. Moreover, the bank regulators' framework of bank supervision is being linked increasingly
to capital levels. Therefore, it is logical to expect some differences between GAAP and bank regulatory policy in
appropriate circumstances. In fact, the definition of capital in the capital adequacy rules already differs from
the GAAP definition. For example, the regulatory definition includes a limited amount of the allowance for loan and
lease losses (ALLL) in Tier 2 capital, while the GAAP definition of capital does not include any amount of ALLL. By adopting
FAS 115 for regulatory reporting, the agencies minimized the difference between the Reports of Condition and Income
(Call Reports) and financial reports issued under GAAP. 
Additionally, the OCC and the other Federal banking agencies recognize that the net unrealized holding gains and
losses recorded under FAS 115 are often temporary.

<DOCNO> FR941125-0-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Therefore, because Tier 1 capital, or ``core capital,'' is intended to be permanent in nature, the OCC believes the
definition of Tier 1 capital should not include these unrealized gains and losses. Such treatment would be inconsistent
with the capital measurement and standards provisions of the Basle Accord, an international agreement of the central
banks and supervisory authorities of ten countries. 



Change to Common Stockholders' Equity 


In addressing the issues raised by the commenters on the merits of including unrealized gains and losses in regulatory
capital, the OCC considered eliminating the requirement to deduct unrealized losses on noncurrent marketable equity
securities. However, the OCC believes the use of amortized cost is relevant for debt securities but not for equities.
Absent the default of the issuer, a debt security will realize its face amount. However, an equity security does not
have a maturity value. Consequently, the market value of an equity security represents the best measure of its worth.


The OCC believes market value is the appropriate method of valuing equities, but does not believe it is appropriate
to include unrealized gains in regulatory capital. The OCC and the other Federal agencies have a long-standing policy
of excluding all unrealized gains from Tier 1 capital and do not believe it is appropriate to deviate from this policy.
Accordingly, the OCC decided to retain the requirement to deduct unrealized losses on equity securities. This final
rule clarifies the description of the deduction and revises the definition of common stockholders' equity to reflect
the new security classification specified under FAS 115. Accordingly, banks must adjust Tier 1 capital for net unrealized
holding losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values held in the available-for-sale portfolio.




Other Issues 


To ensure regulators do not ignore significant unrealized depreciation in the market value of securities when assessing
a bank's safety and soundness, examiners will consider both unrealized gains and losses in their evaluation of the
adequacy of a bank's regulatory capital. When unrealized losses could threaten a bank's financial condition, other
regulatory actions that are based on regulatory capital may be initiated. 

Examiners will use their discretion to determine if a national bank has taken an investment approach that is inconsistent
with the OCC's description of suitable investment practices. If it appears that an institution is artificially manipulating
security classifications to increase regulatory capital, examiners may require banks to account for securities
at market values instead of amortized cost. The OCC plans to issue additional guidance that will describe how unrealized
gains and losses will be considered and what actions examiners will take when they detect gains trading and other unsafe
practices. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this final rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility
analysis is not required. This final rule will not increase the number of banks that do not meet regulatory capital
standards. The effect on capital will be minimal regardless of bank size. 



Executive Order 12866 



The OCC has determined that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.

Corrections to final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains corrections to recent amendments to Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34962) that were published in the 

Federal Register 

on Thursday, November 17, 1994 (59 FR 59612). Rule 10b-10 requires brokers and dealers that effect a securities
transaction for a customer to send an immediate confirmation containing information relevant to the transaction.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires, among other things, that non-market maker brokers
and dealers disclose their mark-ups and mark-downs in riskless principal transactions in equity securities. This
disclosure requirement was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1977 in Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 13508, and amended in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34962.



Need For Correction



The amendments to Rule 10b-10 contain an error in the mark-up and mark-down disclosure requirements for riskless
principal transactions in equity securities. Specifically, the modifying term ``equity'' was omitted from (a)(2)(ii)(A)
of Rule 10b-10. This disclosure requirement should apply solely to equity securities.



Correction of Publication



Accordingly, the publication on November 17, 1994 containing the adoption of amendments to Rule 10b-10 which
were published in 59 FR 59612 is corrected as follows:



 240.10b-10 

[Corrected]



On page 59621, in the first column,  240.10b-10, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) in the second line, the word
``that'' is removed and the phrase ``an equity'' is added to precede the word ``security''.

On page 59621, in the first column,  240.10b-10, paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) in the fifth line, the word ``equity''
is added to precede the word ``security''.

Alternative Minimum Taxable Income


<AGENCY>
AGENCY

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION

: Final regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY

: This document contains final regulations relating to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The regulations provide
guidance on the computation of alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) with respect to items that are determined
by reference to adjusted gross income (AGI). The regulations affect taxpayers who are subject to the alternative
minimum tax.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background


On March 18, 1994, a notice of proposed rulemaking (IA-4-94) was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12880) which contained proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 55 of
the Internal Revenue Code (Code). A detailed explanation of the proposed regulations is contained in the preamble
to those regulations. The proposed regulations provide that, in general, all Code provisions that apply in determining
the regular taxable income of a taxpayer also apply in determining the AMTI of the taxpayer. However, the proposed
regulations provide that, for purposes of computing the AMTI of a noncorporate taxpayer, all references to the taxpayer's
AGI in determining the amount of any item of income, exclusion, or deduction must be treated as references to the taxpayer's
AGI as determined for regular tax purposes.

The IRS received written comments on the proposed regulations and on June 6, 1994, held a public hearing on those regulations.
After consideration of the comments received and the statements made at the public hearing, the proposed regulations
are revised and adopted as final regulations by this Treasury decision.



Discussion



In the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress expanded the application of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for individual
taxpayers. Although Congress generally intended that the AMT be treated as a tax system separate from and parallel
to the regular tax system, in certain limited instances deviations from the separate and parallel concept may be necessary
to reduce complexity and ease administrative burden. See Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, 100th Cong., 

General Explanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986

 438 n.9 (Comm. Print 1987).

Some commentators suggested that there should be even greater conformity between the AMT and regular tax systems
than that provided in the proposed regulations. These commentators urged that, in computing AMTI, all references
to taxable income or a component thereof (such as AGI, modified AGI, earned income, or taxable business income) should
be treated as references to regular taxable income or a component thereof for purposes of determining any item of income,
exclusion, or deduction.

Other commentators stated that any regulatory attempt at conformity was inappropriate. According to these commentators,
the separate and parallel system should be adhered to in full.

Finally, there were some commentators who suggested that taxpayers be allowed to make a binding election to make computations
based either on regular tax AGI or AMT AGI.

If, in computing AMTI, all items of income, exclusion, or deduction that are determined by references to defined measures
of income were based on such defined measures as determined for regular tax purposes, the system envisioned by Congress
would be substantively changed. Accordingly, the final regulations have not been expanded to provide that all references
to taxable income, or a component thereof, be treated as references to regular taxable income, or a component thereof,
in computing AMTI. The final regulations clarify, however, that for purposes of computing the AMTI of a noncorporate
taxpayer, all references to the taxpayer's modified AGI in determining the amount of any item of income, exclusion,
or deduction must be treated as references to the taxpayer's modified AGI as determined for regular tax purposes.

The final regulations also do not adopt the suggestion that an election be permitted to use either regular tax AGI or
AMT AGI in computing AMTI. Such an election would add administrative complexity to the AMT and would be contrary to
the goal of simplicity sought by these regulations.

The proposed regulations were intended to reduce complexity without deviating from the separate and parallel concept
to such an extent that the purpose of the AMT provisions would be subverted. The Treasury and the IRS believe that the
general intent of Congress to apply the AMT on a separate and parallel basis is not undermined where this concept is
not followed in limited, specific instances for the purpose of reducing some of the complexity and recordkeeping
burdens of the AMT. Accordingly, the final regulations adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations in full.

The IRS will continue to consider other possible areas of the AMT where the separate and parallel concept should, on
a limited basis, be modified in order to reduce complexity. The IRS may, in the future, address other possible areas
through regulations or other published guidance.



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small businesses.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is Forest Boone of the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax and
Accounting). However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.

(b) 

Items based on adjusted gross income or modified adjusted gross income.

 In determining the alternative minimum taxable income of a taxpayer other than a corporation, all references to the
taxpayer's adjusted gross income or modified adjusted gross income in determining the amount of items of income,
exclusion, or deduction must be treated as references to the taxpayer's adjusted gross income or modified adjusted
gross income as determined for regular tax purposes.

Costs of Incarceration



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule provides for the collection and establishment of a fee to cover the cost of incarceration of inmates
committed to the custody of the Attorney General, and for the further administration of this procedure by the Director,
Bureau of Prisons. This rule is promulgated to implement newly enacted statutory authority on recovering the costs
of incarceration. The rule also is intended to help ensure the continued efficient operation of federal correctional
institutions, including the provision of beneficial programming for inmates.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 5, 1994, the Department of Justice published a proposed rule, to be codified at 28 CFR part 0, providing for
the assessment and collection of a fee to cover the costs of incarceration of inmates committed to the custody of the
Attorney General, and for the further administration of this procedure by the Director, Bureau of Prisons. (59 FR
15880.) The other provisions for the administration and collection of the fee had been contained in a proposed rule
previously published on June 28, 1993. These provisions will be promulgated by the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) in a
separate document.




Comments on the proposed rule were received from one individual. A portion of these comments related to the provisions
previously proposed on June 28, 1993 which are to appear in the Bureau's final rule. These comments are noted here and
will be fully addressed in the Bureau's document.


The commenter objected to the proposed rule stating that the fee was clearly a punishment which would be additional
to any imposed by the court. The commenter stated that the basis of the proposed rule was unexplained and alleged that
the fee would prove to be an economic hardship to inmates, that inmates would be at greater risk to return to criminal
behavior upon release from prison, and that families of inmates would be impoverished through application of the
regulations. In response, the Department notes that the regulations implement the clearly stated provisions of
the statute to establish and collect a fee to cover the costs of confinement. The statute (Pub. L. 102-395, section
111, 106 Stat. 1828, 1842) and implementing Bureau regulations also clearly provide for protection against unduly
burdening the inmate or the inmate's dependents, including cases where a judge has imposed or waived a fine pursuant
to section 5E1.2 (f) and (i) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, or any successor provisions. Further discussion
of these protections are contained in the final rule to be published by the Bureau of Prisons.
The commenter claimed that the proposed rule was unfair to pretrial inmates who cannot afford bail. The Department
notes that the statute and regulations are not applicable to pretrial inmates.


The commenter objected to the delegation to the Director of Bureau of Prisons of the authority to collect the fine and
to promulgate all regulations concerning the collection of the fee, claiming that the Director did not have the expertise
for collecting the fee and was not in a position to understand the ramifications of imposing the fee. In making this
point, the commenter suggested that a judge was better suited to understand ``* * * the ramifications
of this punishment fine [sic].'' In response, the Department notes that existing Bureau regulations on inmate financial
responsibility (see 28 CFR part 545, subpart B) demonstrate the Bureau's expertise in such matters. As noted above,
the fee to cover the cost of incarceration is required under statutory authority and further delegation of this authority
by the Attorney General outside the executive branch, as suggested by the commenter, would be inappropriate.

The commenter disagreed with the Attorney General's certification pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, arguing that imprisoned people
may own small businesses in whole or in part. As noted in its response to comment in the April 5, 1994 proposed rule, the
Attorney General's certification pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-12, is appropriate
in this case. Inmates and their families in general do not satisfy the definition of a ``small entity'' under the Act.
Furthermore, any inmate who owns a small business in whole or in part is separately enjoined by Bureau regulations
from conducting such business while incarcerated.

The commenter objected to the provision treating revocation of parole or supervised release as a separate period
of incarceration for which a fee may be imposed. As previously noted in its response to comment in the April 5, 1994 proposed
rule, the Department believes this interpretation is reasonable because, in each instance, the offender's conduct
results in a distinct incarceration period and an additional expense to the Attorney General for the cost of the confinement.

The commenter expressed concern over the determination of the exact cost of imprisonment, citing higher figures
allegedly mentioned in news stories. The Department notes that the determination of each year's fee through computation
of the formula contained in  0.96c(b) is designed to prevent any confusion over what is the cost of incarceration
in the federal system.

This rule is a matter of internal department management. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order
12866.

Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in the Attorney General by law, including 5 U.S.C. 301 and 28 U.S.C.
509-510, part O of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:



PART O_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for 28 CFR part O continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 301; 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 515-519.




2. In subpart Q, a new  0.96c is added to read as follows:



 0.96c 

Cost of incarceration.



(a) The Attorney General is required to establish and collect a fee to cover the cost of one year of incarceration. These
provisions apply to any person who is convicted in a United States District Court and committed to the custody of the
Attorney General, and who begins service of sentence on or after December 27, 1994. For the purposes of this subpart,
revocation of parole or supervised release shall be treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may
be imposed.

(b) The fee to cover the costs of incarceration shall be calculated by dividing the number representing the obligation
encountered in Bureau of Prisons facilities (excluding activation costs) by the number of inmate-days incurred
for the year, and by then multiplying the quotient by 365. The resulting figure represents the average cost to the Bureau
for confining an inmate for one year.

(c) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons is delegated the authority to collect the fee to cover the cost of incarceration
from inmates committed to the custody of the Attorney General and to promulgate all regulations concerning the collection
of the fee.

(d) The Director shall review and determine the amount of the fee not less than annually in accordance with the formula
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The Director shall publish each year's fee as a Notice in the 

Federal Register

.

 Final rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into on October 6, 1994, between the Government of the United States
and the Royal Cambodian Government, the Office of Foreign Assets Control is unblocking assets in which Cambodia or
a national thereof has an interest, blocked pursuant to the Foreign Assets Control Regulations.

WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII. 


Background 


On January 3, 1992, former President Bush lifted the trade embargo against Cambodia and authorized new financial
and other transactions with Cambodia and its nationals. Property blocked as of January 2, 1994, because of an interest
therein of Cambodia or its nationals, however, remained blocked pending a settlement agreement between the two countries.
On October 6, 1994, a settlement was reached between the United States Government and the Royal Cambodian Government,
providing that Cambodian property be unblocked. Accordingly, this rule amends  500.570 of the Foreign Assets
Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 500, to unblock assets in which there is an interest of Cambodia or a national thereof
effective November 25, 1994, with the exception of funds blocked in the name of the Exchange Support Fund for the Khmer
Republic (the ``ESF''). ESF funds, representing contributions of various countries to assist in financing Cambodia's
foreign exchange costs of imports and related services, will be unblocked in coordination with the various donor
countries. 
The authorization in  500.570 does not excuse compliance with any applicable provision of law, nor compliance
with reporting requirements imposed by general or specific licenses with respect to transactions prior to November
25, 1994. Further, the amendment does not affect penalty or enforcement proceedings with respect to violations of
part 500 arising prior to that date. 
Because the FACR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, does not apply.

Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Cambodia, Finance, Foreign investments in U.S., Foreign
trade, International organizations, North Korea, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities,

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 500 is amended as follows:

All transactions otherwise prohibited by this part which involve property in which Cambodia or a national thereof
has an interest, other than property blocked in the name of the Exchange Support Fund for the Khmer Republic, are authorized.

Interim Final Rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Section 1176 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103-160,
the Department of the Army is amending the regulations governing eligibility for interment in Arlington National
Cemetery to include former prisoners of war (POWs).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of the Army is amending 32 CFR Part 553 in accordance with Section 1176 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103-160. That Section extended eligibility for interment in Arlington National
Cemetery to any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active military, naval,
or air service and who dies on or after the date of enactment of the 1994 Authorization Act (November 30, 1993). 




This rule governs eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery, an Army national cemetery which is under
the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. Because the rule pertains to a military function of the Department
of the Army, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. It is hereby certified that this interim final rule
will not have a significant impact on small businesses or governments in the area. 



List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 553

was forcibly detained or interned in line of duty_

(i) By an enemy government or its agents, or a hostile force, during a period of war; or 

(ii) By a foreign government or its agents, or a hostile force, under circumstances which the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs finds to have been comparable to the circumstances under which persons have generally been forcibly detained
or interned by enemy governments during periods of war. 

(2) The term ``active military, naval, or air service'' includes active duty, any period of active duty for training
during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line
of duty, and any period of inactive duty training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an
injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty.

Disability Due to Impaired Hearing 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs adjudication regulations regarding the definition of disability
due to impaired hearing to clarify that it merely sets forth the base criteria for determining the point at which impaired
hearing is considered a disability. This document does not constitute a substantive change to the regulation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The amendment made by this document was published as a proposal in the 

Federal Register

 of September 16, 1993, 58 FR 48483-4. Interested persons were invited to submit comments on or before October
18, 1993. 



We received one comment from Disabled American Veterans. The commenter agreed that this change ought to be made but
stated that this rulemaking presents VA with an opportunity to reexamine the criteria for determining the point at
which hearing loss is a disability and suggested that VA adopt a different formula. We appreciate the commenter's
interest in this issue. The suggestion, however, is clearly beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 
The information in the proposed rule still provides a basis for this final rule. Accordingly, the proposed rule is
adopted without change. 
The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of section 603 and 604.

OMB Approval Numbers Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Technical amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, this notice displays the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control
numbers issued under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) for the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations,
Final Rule, as published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 27, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA is today amending the table of currently approved information collection request (ICR) control numbers issued
by OMB for various regulations. Today's amendment updates the table to accurately display those information requirements
promulgated under the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations, Final Rule which appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on June 27, 1994 (59 FR 33042). The affected regulations are codified at 40 CFR Part 79. EPA will continue to present
OMB control numbers in a consolidated table format to be codified in 40 CFR Part 9 of the Agency's regulations, and in
each CFR volume containing EPA regulations. The table lists the section numbers with reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, and the current OMB control numbers. This display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification
in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320.



The ICRs were previously subject to public notice and comment prior to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there
is ``good cause'' under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this
table without prior notice and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further notice and comment would
be unnecessary. For the same reasons, EPA also finds that there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

Alcohol Testing; Amended Implementation Dates for Pre-Employment 
Alcohol Testing and Mandatory Reasonable Suspicion Testing 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FRA amends the implementation dates for pre-employment 
alcohol testing and mandatory reasonable suspicion testing to allow 
Class II and Class III railroads to implement these types of 
testing simultaneously with random alcohol testing (on July 1, 
1995, and January 1, 1996, respectively). This new implementation 
schedule provides more time for smaller railroads to phase-in 
alcohol testing. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On February 15, 1994, FRA issued a final rule [59 FR 7448] 
establishing a railroad industry alcohol misuse prevention program. 
For random alcohol testing only, FRA adopted a three-tier 
implementation schedule, similar to the one used to phase-in random 
drug testing. All other types of alcohol testing (pre-employment, 
return to service, follow-up, and mandatory reasonable suspicion 
testing for both alcohol and drugs) were to begin on January 1, 
1995, for all classes of railroads. 

In response to a Petition for Reconsideration filed by the 
American Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) on April 15, 1994, 
FRA has decided to allow Class II and Class III railroads to phase-in pre-employment alcohol testing and mandatory
reasonable 
suspicion testing according to the implementation schedule 
previously established for random alcohol testing. Thus, Class II 
railroads must now implement pre-employment alcohol testing and 
mandatory reasonable suspicion testing together with random alcohol 
testing beginning on July 1, 1995, and Class III railroads must now 
implement pre-employment alcohol testing, mandatory reasonable 
suspicion testing, and random alcohol testing beginning on January 
1, 1996. FRA anticipates that there will be few, if any, return to 
service or follow-up alcohol tests until implementation of 
mandatory reasonable suspicion and random alcohol testing is 
completed, and that any tests that occur before implementation will 
presumably be under railroad authority. The implementation date 
for return to service or follow-up alcohol testing therefore 
remains January 1, 1995. The amended implementation dates in this 
rule allow smaller railroads more time to purchase evidential 
breath testing devices, make contractual arrangements and train 
supervisors on the new testing requirements. This amendment also 
conforms FRA's implementation dates to those adopted by other 
operating administrations. 

This rule does not change the implementation schedule for 
Class I railroads. As before, Class I railroads must implement 

all

 
types of alcohol testing, including mandatory reasonable suspicion 
testing according to the new procedures now contained in 
 219.303(b) (see discussion below), beginning on January 1, 1995. 
A railroad may not implement pre-employment alcohol testing or 
mandatory reasonable suspicion testing before its specified 
implementation date, and may not, of course, implement random 
alcohol testing until its plan has been approved by FRA. The 
schedule for submission of random alcohol testing plans remains the 
same: Class I railroads must submit their plans by August 15, 1994; 
Class II railroads must submit by February 15, 1995; and Class III 
railroads must submit by August 15, 1994. 

Although Class II and Class III railroads may not conduct 
mandatory reasonable suspicion testing before their respective 
implementation dates, they continue to be responsible for enforcing 
FRA's existing prohibitions against alcohol misuse and must enforce 
the new prohibitions contained in FRA's alcohol rule beginning on 
January 1, 1995. To enable smaller railroads to fulfill this 
responsibility, FRA will allow Class IIs and IIIs to continue to 
use 

existing

 for cause alcohol test procedures and safeguards 
currently in  219.303 until their respective deadlines for 
implementation of mandatory reasonable suspicion testing. These 
procedures were to be deleted effective January 1, 1995; FRA will 
instead continue them in force as paragraphs (c) through (e) of 
 219.303 until January 1, 1996, the deadline for Class IIIs to 
implement mandatory reasonable suspicion testing and switch to the 
new procedures, now in paragraph (b). Class IIs and IIIs also, of 
course, remain free to conduct reasonable suspicion tests under 
their own authority until they are required to implement mandatory 
reasonable suspicion testing.

Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policy and Procedures 



FRA has determined that this rule is nonsignificant under 
Executive Order 12866 and under the Department of Transportation's 
Regulatory Policy and Procedures. 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 was enacted by Congress 
to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and 
disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. FRA 
certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Federalism Implications 



This rule does not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among 
the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with 
Executive Order 12612, FRA has determined that this rule does not 
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of 
a Federalism assessment. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule does not change any previously approved information 
collection requirements. 



List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 219 



Alcohol and drug abuse, Railroad safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 





Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the preamble, FRA 
amends 49 CFR part 219 as follows: 



PART 219_CONTROL OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG USE 



1. The authority citation for Part 219 is revised to read as follows: 







Authority:

 49 U.S.C. 20103, 20107, 20111-20113, 20140, 21301 and 
21304; Pub. L. 103-272 (July 5, 1994); and 49 CFR 1.49(m). 






2. Part 219 is amended by revising  219.303 to read as 
follows: 



 219.303

Alcohol test procedures and safeguards. 



(a)(1) Each Class I railroad (including the National

commuter passenger service shall implement mandatory reasonable 
suspicion testing according to the procedures listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section beginning on January 1, 1995. 

(2) Each Class II railroad shall implement mandatory 
reasonable suspicion testing according to the procedures listed 
in paragraph (b) of this section beginning on July 1, 1995. 
Prior to that date, a Class II railroad may use the procedures 
described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

(3) Each Class III railroad (including a switching and 
terminal or other railroad not otherwise classified) shall 
implement mandatory reasonable suspicion testing according to the 
procedures listed in paragraph (b) of this section beginning on 
January 1, 1996. Prior to that date, a Class III railroad may 
use the procedures described in paragraphs (c) through (e) of 
this section. 
(4) In the case of a railroad commencing operations after 
January 1, 1996, the railroad shall implement mandatory 
reasonable suspicion testing not later than the expiration of 60 
days from approval by the Administrator of the railroad's random 
testing programs. 
(b) As provided for in subparagraph (a)(1) of this section, 
the conduct of alcohol testing under this subpart is governed by 
Subpart H of this part and Part 40 of Subtitle A of this title. 
(c) As provided for in subparagraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of 
this section, and except as provided in paragraph (f), the 
following conditions apply to breath testing authorized by this 
subpart. 
(1) Testing devices shall be selected from among those 
listed on the Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath 
Measurement Devices amended and published in the 

Federal Register

 
from time to time by the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation. 
(2) Each device shall be properly maintained and shall be 
calibrated or verified as to correct calibration by use of a 
breath alcohol simulator (calibrating unit) listed on the NHTSA 
Conforming Products List of Calibrating Units for Breath Alcohol 
Testers (as amended and published) with sufficient frequency to 
ensure the accuracy of the device (within plus or minus .01 
percent), but not less frequently than provided in the 
manufacturer's instructions. 
(3) Tests shall be conducted by a trained and qualified 
operator. The operator shall have received training on the 
operational principles of the particular instrument employed and 
practical experience in the operation of the device and use of 
the breath alcohol calibrating unit. A copy of the training 
program shall be filed with FRA in conjunction with the filing 
required by  217.11 of this title. 
(4) Tests shall be conducted in accordance with procedures 
specified by the manufacturer of the testing device, consistent 
with sound technical judgment, and shall include appropriate 
restrictions on ambient air temperature. 
(5) If an initial test is positive, the employee shall be 
tested again after the expiration of a period of not less than 15 
minutes, in order to confirm that the test has properly measured 
the alcohol content of deep lung air. 
(d) Because of the inherent limitations of the 
instrumentation, any indicated breath test result of less than 
.02 percent shall be deemed a negative test. 
(e)(1) In any case where a breath test is intended for use 
in the railroad disciplinary process and the result is positive, 
the employee shall be given the prompt opportunity to provide a 
blood sample at an independent medical facility for analysis by 
a competent independent laboratory. The railroad shall provide 
the required transportation to facilitate the blood test. 
(2) A blood test under this section shall conform to the 
following standards: 
(i) The specimen shall be collected in a medically 
acceptable manner by a qualified medical professional or 
technician using a non-ethanol swab and shall be deposited into 
a single-use sterile vacuum tube containing at least one percent 
sodium fluoride (and an anticoagulant). 
(ii) While the specimen remains in full view of the 
employee, the specimen shall be clearly labeled with the 
employee's name and/or a unique identifying number and shall be 
sealed with a tamperproof seal. 
(iii) The sample shall be handled in accordance with chain 
of custody procedures from the point of collection through 
analysis and secure storage at the laboratory. 
(iv) The sample shall be screened for alcohol only by a 
method reliable at a detection limit of not higher than .02 
percent. Any presumptive positive shall be confirmed by gas 
chromatography with a suitable internal standard. The screening 
run shall include at least 10% quality control samples. The 
confirmation run shall include ethanol standards (including an 
ethanol standard certified against or traceable to a primary 
standard), at least one blank specimen, other appropriate 
volatiles (e.g., isopropanol), and at least one control purchased 
commercially or provided through an external quality control 
program. Results declared positive on confirmation shall be 
consistent with pre-established criteria for retention time of 
internal and external standards. Blood alcohol concentration 
shall be reported only at values of .02 percent or greater within 
the linear portion of the standard curve. Unconfirmed 
presumptive positive results and values below .02 percent shall 
be reported as negative. Any quantitations to the third digit 
shall be rounded downward to two digits (i.e., .238% to .23%). 
(v) The remaining portion of any specimen testing positive 
shall be retained in secure frozen storage for at least one year, 
and the employee shall have the right to request a retest of the 
specimen at a competent independent laboratory within 60 days of 
the date of the laboratory report. 
(vi) Test results shall be reported to the Medical Review 
Officer who shall review and act upon the results in the same 
manner provided for drug urine testing in Subpart H of this part, 
except that fully quantitated results shall be made available to 
the employer representative. 
(3) If the blood test under this section is reported as 
negative, the breath test shall be deemed negative for all 
purposes. 
(f)(1) Under the circumstances set forth in  219.301, a 
railroad may require an employee to participate in a breath 
alcohol screening test solely for the purpose of determining 
whether the conduct of a test meeting the criteria of paragraph 
(a) is indicated. If the screening test is negative within the 
meaning of paragraph (b), the employee shall not be required to 
submit to further breath testing under this subpart. If the 
screening test is positive, no consequence shall attach except 
that the employee may be removed from covered service for the 
period necessary to conduct a breath test meeting the criteria of 
paragraph (a). 
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this 
section, the conduct of a screening test under paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section does not excuse full compliance with paragraph 
(a) of this section with respect to any breath test procedure 
which is then undertaken. If a screening test is positive, the 
following procedures govern: 
(i) An initial breath test shall be conducted meeting the 
criteria of paragraph (a) of this section. 
(ii) If that test is positive, a second breath test shall be 
conducted meeting the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section. 
(iii) The second test meeting the criteria of section (a) of 
this section must be conducted at least 15 minutes after the 
positive screening test conducted under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. However, since a waiting period of 15 minutes is 
sufficient to permit the dissipation of any alcohol in the mouth, 
the requirement of paragraph (a)(5) of this section that there be 
a period of at least 15 minutes between the two tests meeting the 
criteria of paragraph (a) of this section does not apply.

3. Section 219.501, as published at 59 FR 7462, February 15, 1994, is amended by adding a new paragraph 
(a), deleting paragraph (e), redesignating existing paragraphs (a) through 
(d) as paragraphs (b) through (e), and revising newly designated paragraphs (b) through (e) as follows: 



 219.501

Pre-employment tests. 



(a)(1) Each Class I railroad (including the National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation) and each railroad providing commuter 
passenger service shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing 
beginning on January 1, 1995. 

(2) Each Class II railroad shall implement pre-employment 
alcohol testing beginning on July 1, 1995. 

(3) Each Class III railroad (including a switching and 
terminal or other railroad not otherwise classified) shall 
implement pre-employment alcohol testing beginning on January 1, 
1996. 

(4) In the case of a railroad commencing operations after 
January 1, 1996, the railroad shall implement pre-employment 
alcohol testing not later than the expiration of 60 days from 
approval by the Administrator of the railroad's random testing 
programs. 

(b) Prior to the first time a covered employee performs 
covered service for a railroad, the employee shall undergo 
testing for alcohol and drugs. No railroad shall allow a covered 
employee to perform covered service, unless the employee has been 
administered an alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol 
concentration of less than .04 and has been administered a test 
for drugs with a result that did not indicate the misuse of 
controlled substances. This requirement shall apply to final 
applicants for employment and to employees seeking to transfer 
for the first time from non-covered service to duties involving 
covered service. If the test result of a final applicant for 
pre-employment indicates an alcohol content of .02 or greater, 
the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply. 

(c) No final applicant for employment tested under the 
provisions of this part who is found to have an alcohol 
concentration of .02 or greater but less than .04 shall perform 
safety-sensitive functions for a railroad, nor shall a railroad 
permit the applicant to perform safety-sensitive functions, until 
the applicant's alcohol concentration measures less than .02. 

(d) Tests shall be accomplished through breath analysis and 
analysis of urine samples. The conduct of breath alcohol testing 
and urine drug testing under this subpart is governed by Subpart 
H of this part and Part 40 of Subtitle A of this title. 

(e) As used in Subpart H with respect to a test required 
under this subpart, the term 

covered employee 

includes an 
applicant for pre-employment testing only. In the case of an 
applicant who declines to be tested and withdraws the application 
for employment, no record shall be maintained of the declination.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Two Puerto Rican Trees Determined To Be Endangered 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 (uvillo) and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 (chupacallos) to be endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. Both species
are small trees endemic to Puerto Rico. They are variously threatened by habitat destruction and modification, forest
management practices, hurricane damage, restricted distribution, and possible collection. This final rule implements
Federal protection and recovery provisions for these species as provided by the Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 




Eugenia haematocarpa 

was first collected in 1939 from Barrio Maizales in the municipality of Naguabo by Leslie R. Holdridge but was named
in 1963, 24 years later, by Henri Alain Liogier (Little et al. 1974; Proctor, pers. comm.). Since then, subsequent
collections have been made from the El Verde area of the Luquillo mountains, and it was also recently discovered (in
1990) from a privately-owned property located adjacent to the Carite Commonwealth Forest. 


Eugenia haematocarpa 

is a small tree, 6 meters (20 feet) tall and 12-13 centimeters (4.8-5.2 inches) in diameter. The elliptic
leathery leaves are 13-18 centimeters (5.2-7.2 inches) long, 6-8 centimeters (2.4-3.2 inches)
wide, almost stalkless, hairless, dull dark green on the upper surface, and light green beneath. Blades contain many
slender, slightly raised side veins, forming a prominent network. The flowers are produced on trunks, with slender,
nearly equal stalks. Flowers have a four-lobed rounded calyx, 1 millimeter (.04 inch) long; four rounded light pink
petals 3 millimeters (.12 inch) long; and numerous stamens. The fruit is a dark red, round berry 2.3-2.9 centimeters
(.9-1.1 inch) in diameter, containing a 1.6 centimeter (.6 inch) diameter seed. 


Eugenia haematocarpa 

is known from five localities in the wet montane forests of the Sierra de Luquillo and Sierra de Cayey. Less than 50 plants
are known from four populations within the Caribbean National Forest, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. A population
of approximately 15 plants occurs on private property adjacent to the Carite Commonwealth Forest in the Sierra de
Cayey. The populations within the Caribbean National Forest may be affected by forest management practices. The
population on private land may be affected by clearing of the vegetation. All the localities where the species occurs
were impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. The fact that the species produces edible fruits could make it an attractive
one for collecting. 



Pleodendron macranthum 

was discovered by the French botanist August Pl&eacute;e in 1822-1823 and was first described by Baillon under
the genus Cinnamodendron. In 1889 vanTieghem placed the species in the current genus, which honors its first collector
(Vivaldi et al. 1981.)

Pleodendron macranthum 

is an evergreen tree reaching 10 meters (33 feet) in height, with leathery, alternate, simple leaves about 8.5-12.5
centimeters (3.5-5.0 inches) long and 4.5-5.0 centimeters (1.7-2 inches) wide. The blades are
elliptic with the upper surface dark shiny green and the midvein sunken. The lower surface is pale green with a prominent
mid vein and with fine, parallel side veins. The leaf stalks are about 7 millimeters (.25 inch) long. The whitish bisexual
flowers are solitary and axillary, 2 centimeters (.8 inch) wide and with a 2.5 centimeter (1 inch) long flower stalk.
The cup-shaped calyx is persistent in the fruit, and the corolla contains 12 petals. The aromatic purplish black fruit
measures 2 centimeters (.8 inch) in diameter and contains many seeds. 
No observation or collection of the species was made for more than 40 years (Vivaldi et al. 1981). The species was rediscovered
some years ago, and is at present known from fewer than 50 individuals in 7 localities of the subtropical wet and the
subtropical montane wet forests of northern and eastern Puerto Rico. Three localities are within the Caribbean National
Forest and four within the Rio Abajo Commonwealth Forest. All the known sites may be impacted by forest management
practices. The Caribbean National Forest was severely impacted by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. 


Previous Federal Action 




Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

are considered to be critical plants by the Natural Heritage Program of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources.
They are also considered rare plants by the Center for Plant Conservation (Center for Plant Conservation 1992). 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

were recommended for Federal listing by the Smithsonian Institution (Ayensu and DeFilipps 1978). 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

were included among the plants being considered as endangered or threatened by the Service, as published in the 

Federal Register

 notice of review dated December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480); the November 28, 1983 update (48 FR 53680), the revised notice
of September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526), and the February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184) notice of review. In the 1990 notice, both
species were designated as category 1 (species for which the Service has substantial information supporting the
appropriateness of proposing to list them as endangered or threatened). 
In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 15, 1983 (48 FR 6752), the Service reported the earlier acceptance of the new taxa in the Smithsonian's
1978 book as under petition within the context of section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1982. Beginning in October
1983, and in each October thereafter, the Service made annual findings that listing 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions of a higher priority, and that additional data on vulnerability
and threats were still being gathered. A proposed rule to list 

Eugenia haematocarpa, Pleodendron macranthum 

and one other species, published on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49960), constituted the final 1-year finding in accordance
with section 4(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. 
The proposal to list 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

and 

Pleodendron macranthum 

also included the proposed listing of 

Coccoloba rugosa 

as threatened. After the proposed rule comment period had closed, the Service received information from a private
consulting firm indicating the discovery of additional populations of 

Coccoloba rugosa 

and questioning the appropriateness of protecting the species under the Act. The Service has not been able to fully
verify the new population data and will need additional time to conduct further surveys. This will likely take several
months and cannot be completed in time for the usual 12-month deadline established by the Act for completing action
on a proposed rule. The Act provides for a 6-month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding the sufficiency
or accuracy of the available data relevant to a final determination on a proposed listing. The Service finds there
is substantial disagreement with regard to the population status of 

Coccoloba rugosa 

and, therefore, is extending the deadline for a final decision on this species. A notice to extend the deadline is published
in the proposed rule section of today's 

Federal Register

. 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the September 24, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to
submit factual reports of information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate agencies
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Federal agencies, scientific organizations and other interested parties were
contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting general public comment was published in the ``San
Juan Star'' on October 10, 1993. Three letters of comment were received, one supported the listing, the other two provided
information but did not indicate either support or opposition.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 should be classified as endangered species. Procedures found at Section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR
part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to
be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors
and their application to 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 Alain and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 (Baill.) v. Tiegh are as follows: 


A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range



One of the five known populations of 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 in the Sierra de Cayey is located on private land and may be impacted by clearing of the vegetation. Although four of
the five populations of 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and all the known populations of 

Pleodendron macranthum

 are found on Federal and Commonwealth forest lands, the two species may be affected by forest management practices.



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



Taking for these purposes has not been a documented factor in the decline of these tree species. However, these species
may be very attractive for collectors due to their rarity. 


C. Disease or Predation



Disease and predation have not been documented as factors in the decline of these species.



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has adopted a regulation that recognizes and provides protection for certain Commonwealth
listed species. However, 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 are not yet on the Commonwealth list. Federal listing would provide immediate protection and, if the species are ultimately
placed on the Commonwealth list, enhance their protection and possibilities for research funding. 


E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence



One of the most important factors affecting the continued survival of these species is their limited number and distribution,
which makes the risk of extinction extremely high. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 dramatically affected the forests of eastern
Puerto Rico. Both 

E. haematocarpa

 and 

P. macranthum

 are known from such a small number of individuals that loss of genetic variation may be a factor in their future survival.

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 as endangered. 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 both occur at only a few localities and there are fewer than 75 individuals of each species. Due to their low numbers
and limited distribution, any adverse impact is likely to have a serious effect on their survival. The precarious
status of 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 makes extinction a distinct possibility and warrants their classification as endangered species. The reasons for
not proposing critical habitat for these species are discussed below in the ``Critical habitat'' section. 


Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations
(50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations
exists: (i) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of habitat can be expected
to increase the degree of such threat to the species, or (ii) Such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial
to the species. Designation of critical habitat for the species would not be prudent for both reasons. 
The number of individuals of 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 is sufficiently small that vandalism and collection could seriously affect the survival of the species. Publication
of critical habitat descriptions and maps in the 

Federal Register

 would increase the likelihood of such activities, which are difficult to enforce against and only partially regulated
by the Act. Additionally, no Federal activity is anticipated as being likely to affect these species except possibly
on U.S. Forest Service lands and lands owned by the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. 
Critical habitat also would not provide additional protection for the species under section 7 of the Act. Regulations
promulgated for the implementation of section 7 provide for both a ``jeopardy'' standard and a ``destruction or adverse
modification'' of critical habitat standard. In the case of 

E. haematocarpa

 and 

P. macranthum

, the only known suitable habitat is where these species currently occur. Because of the highly limited distribution
of the species, any Federal action that would destroy or have any significant adverse effect on their habitat would
likely result in a jeopardy biological opinion under section 7. Under these conditions, no additional benefits would
accrue from designation of critical habitat that would not be available through listing alone. The Service believes
that any Federal involvement in the areas where these plants occur can be identified without the designation of critical
habitat. All involved parties and landowners have been notified of the location and importance of protecting these
species' habitats. Should Federal involvement occur, habitat protection will be addressed through the section
7 consultation process, utilizing the jeopardy standard. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, Commonwealth, and private
agencies, groups and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the Commonwealth,
and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service
following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities
involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation
with the Service. No critical habitat is being proposed for these three species, as discussed above. Federal involvement
is anticipated for populations of 

Eugenia haematocarpa

 and 

Pleodendron macranthum

 located in the Caribbean National Forest. 

The Act and its implementing regulations set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all
endangered plants. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions,
in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export any threatened
or endangered plant, transport it in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or
offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce the species to possession from areas under
Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions
provided that a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, for endangered plants,
the 1988 amendments (Public Law 100-478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal
lands and the removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of endangered plants in knowing violation of
any Commonwealth law or regulation, including Commonwealth criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions to the prohibitions
apply to agents of the Service and the Commonwealth conservation agencies. 
The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63, also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities
involving endangered plants under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few permits for these species will
ever be sought or issued, since the species are not known to be in cultivation for commercial trade and are uncommon
in the wild.

It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable those activities that would
or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act at the time of listing. The intent of this policy is to increase
public awareness of the effect of the listing on proposed or ongoing activities. Of the seven known localities of 

Pleodendron macranthum

 all are located on public lands and of the five known localities of 

Eugenia haematocarpa 

all but one are located on public lands. Collection, damage or destruction of these species on Federal lands is prohibited,
although in appropriate cases a Federal endangered species permit may be issued to allow collection. Such activities
on non-Federal lands would constitute a violation of section 9 if conducted in violation of Commonwealth law. Section
15.01(b) of the Commonwealth ``Regulation to Govern the Management of Threatened and Endangered Species in the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico,'' states: ``It is illegal to take, cut, mutilate, uproot, burn or excavate any endangered plant species
or part thereof within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.'' The Service is not aware of any otherwise
lawful activities being conducted or proposed by the public that will be affected by this listing and result in a violation
of section 9. 

Questions regarding whether specific activities will constitute a violation of section 9 should be directed to the
Field Supervisor of the Service's Caribbean Office (see 

ADDRESSES

 section). Requests for copies of the regulations on listed species and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
should be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services (TE), 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta,
Georgia 30345-3301 (phone 404/679-7096, facsimile 404/679-7081). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this
determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

Summer Flounder Fishery 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notification of commercial quota increase and commercial quota availability. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this document to announce an increase in the commercial quota for the 1994 summer flounder fishery. The
intent of this document is to comply with an Opinion and Order issued by District Court Judge Robert Doumar, directing
NMFS to reset the quota equal to 19.05 million lb (8.6 million kg). This document advises the public that a quota adjustment
has been made and informs the public of revisions to state quotas necessitated by this adjustment. As a result of this
action, vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for the summer flounder fishery may resume landing summer flounder
in the State of Delaware until the 1994 quota is harvested. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Regulations implementing the Summer Flounder Fishery Management Plan (FMP) are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations
require NMFS annually to establish and apportion among the coastal states from Maine to North Carolina a commercial
quota for summer flounder. The process required to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each
state is described in 50 CFR 625.20. The commercial summer flounder quota for the 1994 calendar year, adopted pursuant
to these regulations, was initially set to equal 16,005,560 lb (7.3 million kg) (59 FR 10586, March 7, 1994). 


In a decision filed November 4, 1994, in the Norfolk Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia, Judge Robert Doumar ordered NMFS to increase the commercial quota to 19.05 million lb (8.6 million kg).

Section 625.20(d)(1) of 50 CFR requires that the annual quota (as ordered increased) be distributed to the coastal
states according to specified percentages. Section 625.20(d)(2) requires that any state which had landings in excess
of the state's quota in 1993 have its 1994 allocation adjusted by deducting the 1993 excess. This adjustment was made
to the initial 1994 quotas in a document published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 26971). These overages are likewise deducted from the Court-ordered quota in Table 1 below. 
Section 625.20(f) allows a state to transfer all or a portion of its commercial quota. The States of Connecticut, Maryland,
North Carolina, and the Commonwealth of Virginia made transfers to the State of Delaware, which were effective June
1, 1994 (59 FR 29207, June 6, 1994). The State of New Jersey made a transfer to the State of Connecticut, which was effective
September 29, 1994 (59 FR 50512, October 4, 1994). These transfers are reflected in Table 1 below.
Table 1 shows the allocation to each state of the court-ordered new quota, the 1993 overage amounts to be deducted,
the quota transfers made by the states, and the resulting final state quotas. 




As a result of this quota adjustment, the previous closure document effective March 30, 1994 (59 FR 15863, April 5,
1994) is rescinded and vessels may again land summer flounder in Delaware, until the available 1994 quota is harvested.
The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council has submitted to NMFS a recommended summer flounder coastwide quota
for 1995 of 19.4 million pounds (8.8 million kg). This recommendation did not account for the possible increase in
mortality that could occur from this upward adjustment of the quota in response to the Court Order. Consequently,
a re-examination of the factors in section 625.20 that must be considered in setting the annual quota will have to be
undertaken to assess what quota level in 1995 will assure attainment of the fishing mortality reduction goal of 0.53.
If the adjusted quota in 1994 is completely harvested, the current recommended quota for 1995 will have to be adjusted
downward.

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for yellowfin sole by operators of vessels using trawl gear in the Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 Pacific halibut
bycatch mortality allowance specified for the trawl yellowfin sole fishery.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management
Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.


The 1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the trawl yellowfin sole fishery, which is defined at  675.21(b)(1)(iii)(B)(1),
was established as 592 metric tons by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16,
1994). The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, in accordance with  675.21(c)(1)(iii), that the
1994 Pacific halibut bycatch mortality allowance for the trawl yellowfin sole fishery has been reached. Therefore,
NMFS is closing directed fishing for yellowfin sole by operators of vessels using trawl gear in the BSAI from 12 noon,
A.l.t., November 19, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

Federal Family Education Loan Program

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. These amendments
are needed to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), giving the Secretary additional
powers to assure the safety of reserve funds and assets maintained by guaranty agencies insuring educational loans
under the FFEL Program pursuant to agreements with the Secretary. The amendments further define ``reserve funds
and assets'' and establish the substantive standard for the return of ``unnecessary'' reserves. They also provide
procedural due process for challenges to these orders and for orders requiring that reserve funds and assets outside
of the guaranty agency's control be returned to it or to the Secretary.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental
Loans for Students Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed
Student Loan programs). These programs provide loans to eligible student or parent borrowers who might otherwise
be unable to finance the costs of postsecondary education. The loans are guaranteed by State or private, non-profit
guaranty agencies designated by the Secretary, which are required to maintain reserves to support those guarantees.




The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66) (OBRA), enacted August 10, 1993, added section
422(g)(1) of the HEA, which codified the long-standing and judicially-supported principle that guaranty agency
reserve funds and assets are ``the property of the United States to be used in the operation of * * *''
the FFEL Program and the Direct Loan Program. To protect the Federal fiscal interest in the guaranty agency reserve
funds and assets, OBRA authorized the Secretary to direct: (1) The return to the Secretary of ``unnecessary'' reserves
from guaranty agencies (section 422(g)(1)(A)), (2) the return to the guaranty agency or to the Secretary under specified
circumstances of guaranty agency reserves and assets held by, or under the control of, any other party (section 422(g)(1)(B)),
and (3) guaranty agencies to cease any ``misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure'' of reserve funds or assets
(section 422(g)(1)(C)). 

On August 10, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL Program in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 41184). Those proposed regulations were developed in accordance with section 422(g)(1)(D) of the HEA, which
requires that standards and procedures for section 422(g)(1)(A) and (B) be developed through negotiated rulemaking.
Monthly negotiated rulemaking sessions were held from January through June 1994 in and around Washington, DC. Consensus
was reached on all of the rules proposed in the NPRM and on the accompanying preamble discussion. The Secretary specifically
relies upon that consensus and preamble in issuing these final rules without substantive change from the NPRM.

These regulations improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, improve their capacity
to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school and to
pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. The student
aid programs also enable current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic and technologically
advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means for an increasing
number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate effectively,
and solve problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals.

Substantive Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



As explained below, the Secretary has not made any substantive changes from the NPRM. 



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the NPRM, 23 outside parties submitted timely comments on the proposed regulations. Fifteen commenters
explicitly support the consensus reached at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, and one commenter particularly
finds the preamble to the NPRM helpful. None of the commenters oppose the proposed regulations as a package. Some of
the comments suggest minor adjustments to the proposed regulations, and an analysis of those comments follows. Other
comments deal with matters not relevant to the regulations proposed in the NPRM. In the spirit of the consensus reached
at the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary has decided not to address specifically the other comments
at this time but may consider alternate approaches such as these when the impact of the regulatory changes made here
is evaluated based on actual experience. Accordingly, they are not discussed in the following analysis, although
all comments will continue to be available for public inspection as stated in the NPRM (59 FR 41187). 

Numerous comments refer to an additional rule to implement section 422(g)(1)(C) of the HEA and to a system of uniform
financial projections for guaranty agencies. The commenters request a formal comment process or at least an opportunity
to be consulted before the rule or system of projections is adopted. The NPRM (59 FR 41184, 41186) describes these items
and the Secretary's plans for them and explains that the additional rule is not subject to negotiated rulemaking.
Because of the need under section 482(c) of the HEA to publish these regulations by December 1, it was not possible to
keep the negotiated rulemaking proceeding open on a voluntary basis, as a number of commenters suggested. New regulations
are generally subject to public comment under the Department's normal rulemaking procedures; and, as stated in the
NPRM, the Secretary intends to engage in prior consultation with interested parties on an additional rule under section
422(g)(1)(C) of the HEA. In the meantime, as pointed out in the Conference Report on OBRA, the Secretary already has
the ability to deal with improper expenditures of reserve funds and assets. Authority for a system of financial projections
already exists under section 428(b)(2)(C) of the HEA and 34 CFR 682.414(b)(5), and the matter is more appropriately
viewed as a request for information from a guaranty agency under that authority than as a new regulatory requirement.
A preliminary version of a system of financial projections is currently under discussion with guaranty agencies.


One commenter, who was a representative of the guaranty agencies at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, went so
far as to argue that the later promulgation of a new regulation under section 422(g)(1)(C) of the HEA ``would be changing
one of the essential terms in the `deal' struck in these negotiations,'' and that ``[h]ad the non-federal negotiators
known of the Department's intention to proceed with a separate rulemaking . . . we would not have been so forthcoming
in our concessions.'' Although the Secretary appreciates that concessions were made by all negotiators, including
the Department's, in achieving consensus, this commenter misunderstands the operation of the negotiated rulemaking
process. Any interim agreements reached as the proceeding progressed were tentative only, subject to final confirmation
with respect to the entire package. In this case, consensus was achieved at the final negotiating session, while the
Secretary's draft proposal on improper expenditures had been withdrawn at a prior meeting. 



Section 682.410 Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement Requirements 

Section 682.410(a) Fiscal Requirements 

Section 682.410(a)(1) Reserve Fund Assets 





Comments:

 One commenter requested the Secretary to define sources of guaranty agency reserve funds that can be considered ``non-federal.''
Another urged that funds received from a State be included in the reserve fund only if they are ``used'' for guaranty
activities. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not see any need to define any portion of guaranty agency reserves as ``non-federal'' in these regulations.
The term ``non-federal'' does not appear in the new section 422(g)(1) of the HEA but instead in pre-existing section
422(a)(2), dealing with a previous authority for the provision and recall of Federal advance funds and other reserves.
Although the excerpt from the conference report on OBRA quoted in the NPRM (59 FR 41184) did use the term ``federal portion,''
it is not clear what was meant by this reference, or what significance it should be given in light of the unqualified
language of section 422(g)(1) itself and of prior court decisions defining the Federal interest in guaranty agency
reserve funds. In any event, the long-standing definition of reserve fund in  682.410 was based on sections
422, 428, and 432 of the HEA as they existed even prior to OBRA and does not require any additional authority from section
422(g)(1). All of the sources specified in  682.410 of the regulations may be applied only to the uses also specified
there. The particular subject of State sources was extensively discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding,
and the proposed language represents a compromise of competing positions that was agreed to at the proceeding. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 682.410(a)(2) Uses of Reserve Fund Assets 





Comments:

 One commenter elaborated on the explanation of 
new paragraph (a)(2)(xi) in the preamble by stating that the ``good faith'' proviso in the paragraph ``is a restatement
of the basic rule of non-retroactivity. * * *'' 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter's observation that this protection against application of certain new regulatory
provisions to conduct that occurred prior to their effective date is unavailable if the conduct was not consistent
with the ``laws, rules, standards, customs, and practices prevailing'' at the time of occurrence. It would not be
appropriate to offer a safe harbor to conduct that was questionable even when it occurred. 



Change:

 None 

Section 682.410(a)(3) Accounting Basis 



Comments:

 Numerous commenters urged that guaranty agency published financial statements continue to be based on generally-
accepted accounting principles. A few even urged that ED Form 1130, the basic form for guaranty agency financial reporting
to the Secretary, be changed to require reporting on an accrual basis, or at least in accordance with generally-accepted
accounting principles, and that other reserve fund assets be considered in determining satisfaction of reserve
ratio requirements. One commenter requested a specification of the first fiscal year to which this new paragraph
is applicable.

<DOCNO> FR941125-0-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion: 

The NPRM made clear that  682.410(a)(3) applies only to ``reserve fund reporting,'' and in that respect it merely
formalizes the existing instructions to Form 1130 (59 CFR 41185). Thus, the fact that the effective date of this regulatory
requirement is in the middle of a Federal fiscal year and may be in the middle of an agency's fiscal year should not be
a concern, and there is no need to specify an effective fiscal year. The new paragraph is not intended to require any
change in a guaranty agency's published financial statements or the method of computing its fund balance used in those
statements. It would not be appropriate, however, to change the accounting basis for Form 1130. Certain accrual and
deferral items are already collected by Items E-17 to E-22 of the form. Moreover, the Secretary believes
that the statutory reserve ratios of section 428(c)(9) of the HEA were selected by the Congress on the basis of the cash
reserve data collected on Form 1130, and a change in the method of computing the reserve ratio would accordingly also
require reconsideration of the appropriateness of the ratio itself. On the other hand, some agencies publish a so-called
reserve ratio that is computed in a different manner from that required by the statute and regulations. The Secretary
considers it to be misleading for a guaranty agency to do so without also publishing its statutory reserve ratio and
explaining the difference in computation. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.410(a)(5) Investments 





Comments: 

A commenter requested the Secretary to issue clearer guidelines for low-risk investments or to approve individual
agencies' investment policies. 



Discussion: 

The courts have confirmed that a guaranty agency's role with respect to its reserve fund and assets is ``analogous''
or ``akin'' to that of a trustee. See 

e.g., Education Assistance Corp. v. Cavasos, 

902 F.2d 617, 627 (8th Cir. 1990), 

cert. denied, 

111 S.Ct, 246 (1990); 

Ohio Student Loan Commission v. Cavasos, 

900 F.2d 894, 899 (6th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S.Ct. 245 (1990). Thus, there is a whole body of existing fiduciary
law to flesh out the Secretary's regulatory provisions for guaranty agency reserve funds and assets. To eliminate
any uncertainty, however, the Department is willing to review the investment policies of agencies at their request.




Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.410(a)(6) Development of Assets 





Comments: 

One commenter requested qualitative or quantitative guidance on the meaning of ``substantial'' with respect to
situations in which asset sharing for program and non-program uses requires cost sharing. 



Discussion: 

As indicated in the NPRM (59 FR 41185), this amendment was the subject of intense debate at the negotiated rulemaking
proceeding. Significant concessions were made by all negotiators to reach agreement on the amendment. As one commenter
put it, ``the guaranty agency negotiators gave up litigable positions'' on this provision, among others, to make
consensus possible. Therefore, the Secretary is particularly gratified that there has not been any negative comment
on this amendment. With regard to the word ``substantial,'' the Secretary is using it as an antonym for the word ``nominal,''
denoting situations in which it would not be productive to attempt to quantify the extent of nonprogram use. Although
even more specificity on substantiality might be desirable, the Secretary believes it is preferable to have that
arise from case-by-case analysis rather than initial regulatory prescription. The Secretary is willing to give
advance advice on particular situations in which there may be uncertainty. 

Finally, although there was no formal comment to this effect, the Secretary understands that there may be some misunderstanding
of the effect of the amendment when a guaranty agency makes a correct cost allocation at the outset. The statement in
the NPRM (59 FR 41186) that subsequent events would be governed by the recorded ownership interest of the asset obviously
assumes that the recordation is consistent with the cost allocation. A guaranty agency may not allocate substantial
costs to the reserve fund and then not give it credit for a proportionate ownership interest in the asset. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.417 Determination of Reserve Funds or Assets To Be Returned 

Section 682.417(b) Return of Unnecessary Reserve Funds 





Comments: 

One commenter requested that the Secretary analyze the economic impact of OBRA on guaranty agencies before requiring
the return of any reserves. Another commenter urged that the Secretary consider 10-year rather than five-year projections
in determining whether a guaranty agency has ``unnecessary'' reserves to be returned. Other commenters questioned
the sufficiency of the 60 days provided for the agency to provide the projections. 



Discussion: 

Requiring a complete analysis of the economic impact of OBRA before allowing the use of the Secretary's new power under
section 422(g)(1)(A) of the HEA would be the practical equivalent of delaying the effective date of the implementing
regulation. The issue of the first Federal fiscal year in which reserves could be called back under this new rule was
thoroughly discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding. The Secretary's position that the rule should not
be delayed beyond July 1, 1995, was ultimately accepted as part of the overall consensus. By that time actual data will
be available on the impact of the profit margin reductions resulting from various changes made to the HEA by OBRA and
on the first academic year of the Direct Loan Program. OBRA's future impact will be assessed through the agencies'
projections for the 1995 and next four Federal fiscal years. The Secretary considers the assumptions necessary for
10-year projections, however, such as aggregate student loan volume and general rates of interest and inflation,
to be too unreliable to be used as a basis for decision. This issue was specifically discussed at the negotiated rulemaking
proceeding, and five years was agreed upon as the term for the projections. Finally, since the guaranty agency should
already have provided the Secretary with projections under the new data collection program, 60 days should be ample
time to supplement them for this purpose. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.417(c) Notice 





Comments: 

One commenter suggested that a guaranty agency should be able to request additional information if the notice initiating
a proceeding for the return of reserve funds or assets does not contain sufficient information for it to prosecute
its appeal. Another asked that any protective order under paragraph (c)(2)(v) not be allowed to endanger its daily
operations in the absence of fraud or abuse. 



Discussion: 

No specific procedure is necessary for a party to request additional information from the Secretary. If the information
is in fact necessary, the notice directing the return would be defective if the information were not provided. Since
any protective order would only affect reserves to the extent that they had already been determined to be ``unnecessary,''
it is hard to understand how it could endanger the agency's daily operations. In any event, the deciding official could
expedite this aspect of any appeal. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.417(d) Appeal 





Comments: 

One commenter expressly agreed with the appeal procedure included in the proposed rule, while another requested
that the appeal be heard by a neutral third-party arbitrator. 



Discussion: 

The latter commenter misunderstands the nature of the appeal process. This is not a quasi-judicial administrative
proceeding. The appeal is merely an opportunity for the guaranty agency to have the authorized Departmental official's
action reviewed by a superior or peer within the Department. It would be inappropriate to place the Department's responsibility
on an outside decisionmaker.

Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.417(e) Third-Party Participation 




Comments:

 One commenter requested the Secretary to delete the provision for third-party participation in appeals, or at least
to specify the information that third parties may provide. 


Discussion:

 Third-party participation was an important component of the consensus reached at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding.
Students, schools, and lenders are the parties most affected by the financial condition of guaranty agencies, and
they should not be denied an opportunity to provide information in these proceedings. The Secretary does not believe
that it is appropriate to limit the information that third parties may provide. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.417(f) Adverse Information 




Comments:

 Two commenters requested that all third-party information be provided to the guaranty agency without a formal request
under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), not just adverse information considered by the deciding official. 


Discussion:

 This matter was also discussed at the negotiated rulemaking proceeding, and the guaranty agency negotiators agreed
that the agencies would usually already be aware of any favorable information that was submitted by third parties.
In any event, under  682.417(e)(2) all information submitted by third parties is available for public inspection
and copying. No formal FOIA request is necessary. 


Changes:

 None. 


Executive Order 12866 


These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the Title IV, HEA programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements were identified and justified in the
NPRM. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of these regulations justify the costs. 
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 


Assessment of Educational Impact 


In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would require transmission of
information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. 
Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

Fiscal requirements

 (1)

(

1

) These amounts were originally received by the agency under appropriate contemporaneous documentation specifying
that receipt was on a temporary basis only;
(

2

) The objective for which these amounts were originally received by the agency has been fully achieved; and
(

3

) Repayment of these amounts would not cause the agency to fail to comply with the minimum reserve levels provided by
paragraph (a)(10) of this section, except that the Secretary may, for good cause, provide written permission for
a payment that meets the other requirements of this paragraph (a)(2)(ix)(A).
(B) The repayment, prior to December 29, 1993, of amounts credited under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) or (a)(1)(ix) of this
section, if the agency demonstrates that_
(

1

) These amounts were originally received by the agency under appropriate contemporaneous documentation that receipt
was on a temporary basis only; and 
(

2

) The objective for which these amounts were originally received by the agency has been fully achieved. 
(x) Any other payments necessary to perform functions directly related to the agency's guaranty activities and for
their proper administration; 
(xi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any other payment that was allowed by law or regulation
at the time it was made, if the agency acted in good faith when it made the payment or the agency would otherwise be unfairly
prejudiced by the nonallowability of the payment at a later time; and 
(xii) Any other amounts authorized or directed by the Secretary. 
(3) 

Accounting basis. 

Except as approved by the Secretary, a guaranty agency shall credit the items listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section
to its reserve fund upon their receipt, without any deferral for accounting purposes, and shall deduct the items listed
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section from its reserve fund upon their payment, without any accrual for accounting purposes.

(4) 

Accounting records. 

(i) The accounting records of a guaranty agency must reflect the correct amount of sources and uses of funds under paragraph
(a) of this section. 
(ii) A guaranty agency may reverse prior credits to its reserve fund if_ 
(A) The agency gives the Secretary prior notice setting forth a detailed justification for the action; 
(B) The Secretary determines that such credits were made erroneously and in good faith; and 
(C) The Secretary determines that the action would not unfairly prejudice other parties. 
(iii) A guaranty agency shall correct any other errors in its accounting or reporting as soon as practicable after
the errors become known to the agency. 
(iv) If a general reconstruction of a guaranty agency's historical accounting records is necessary to make a change
under paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (a)(4)(iii) of this section or any other retroactive change to its accounting records,
the agency may make this reconstruction only upon prior approval by the Secretary and without any deduction from its
reserve fund for the cost of the reconstruction. 
(5) 

Investments. 

The guaranty agency shall exercise the level of care required of a fiduciary charged with the duty of investing the
money of others when it invests the assets of the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. It may
invest these assets only in low-risk securities, such as obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or
a State. 
(6) 

Development of assets. 

(i) If the guaranty agency uses in a substantial way for purposes other than the agency's guaranty activities any funds
required to be credited to the reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any assets derived from the reserve
fund to develop an asset of any kind and does not in good faith allocate a portion of the cost of developing and maintaining
the developed asset to funds other than the reserve fund, the Secretary may require the agency to_
(A) Correct this allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section; or 
(B) Correct the recorded ownership of the asset under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section so that_
(

1

) If, in a transaction with an unrelated third party, the agency sells or otherwise derives revenue from uses of the
asset that are unrelated to the agency's guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve
fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a percentage of the sale proceeds or revenue equal to the fair percentage
of the total development cost of the asset paid with the reserve fund monies or provided by assets derived from the reserve
fund; or 
(

2

) If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the
agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a fair percentage
of the fair market value or, in the case of a temporary conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset employed
for the unrelated use. 
(ii) If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in
that paragraph and makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, it shall correct the allocation
under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. 
(7) 

Third-party claims. 

If the guaranty agency has any claim against any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, the
claim is the property of the United States. 
(8) 

Related-party transactions. 

All transactions between a guaranty agency and a related organization or other person that involve funds required
to be credited to the agency's reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or assets derived from the reserve
fund must be on terms that are not less advantageous to the reserve fund than would have been negotiated on an arm's-length
basis by unrelated parties. 
(9) 

Scope of definition. 

The provisions of this  682.410(a) define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of the
Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant
to section 428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act. 
(10) 

Minimum reserve fund level. 

The guaranty agency must maintain a current minimum reserve level of not less than_
(i) .5 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1993;

(ii) .7 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1994;

(iii) .9 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1995;
and 
(iv) 1.1 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for each fiscal year of the agency that begins on or after January
1, 1996.
