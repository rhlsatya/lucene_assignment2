<DOCTITLE>Social Science Curriculum Development at Selected Central European Universities</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; Request for Proposals.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Advising, Teaching, and Specialized Programs Division of the Office of Academic Programs of the United States
Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance
award. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting the provisions described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3)
may apply to cooperate with USIA in the administration of Year One of a three to five-year project to support the development
of instruction in the social sciences, especially political science and public policy analysis, at universities
in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The primary departments participating in the project are the Center for Public Affairs
Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences, Hungary; the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University,
Poland; and the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. In addition
to supporting the development of programs at these core departments, the project will also enable scholars and students
from other institutions in the region to participate in the programs to be based primarily in Warsaw, Budapest, and
Cluj-Napoca. The project to be funded in Year One of this program may be implemented over a two-year period and will
assist in the development and teaching of up-to-date Western university-level social science curricula.



The rationale for the project is based on the expectation that after the students and faculty involved with this project
are equipped to analyze social, political, and public policy issues in an empirically grounded manner, empirical
research methods and analytical tools will increasingly inform public debate about these issues, and will encourage
cooperation among scholars and public servants.

The USIA solicits detailed proposals from U.S. educational institutions and public and private non-profit organizations
to develop and administer a comprehensive range of exchange mechanisms and related activities, including assistance
with curriculum and materials development and acquisition, and to identify and cooperate with appropriate U.S.
departments and scholars in support of the project. The award to cooperate with the USIA on Year One of the project will
be renewable for up to two additional fiscal years that may comprise up to four additional program years upon successful
completion of Year One activity. Applicants should propose detailed, creative programs for all three countries
for Year One of the project and should outline a strategy for the on-going assessment of Year One programs to determine
program effectiveness and to facilitate the definition of programs for two additional fiscal years. The cooperation
with USIA will include regular consultation with USIA and USIS field posts with regard to program implementation,
direction, and assessment. Proposals should demonstrate both an understanding of the issues confronting central
European universities and expertise in the teaching and practice of the social sciences in U.S. higher education,
including graduate education.

The funding authority for the program cited above is provided through the Support for East European Democracies Act
(SEED). Programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined in the Application
Package. USIA projects and programs are subject to the availability of funds.




ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/AS-95-01.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a nonpolitical character and should be
balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should
be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion,
geographic location, socioeconomic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere
to the advancement of this principle. Academic programs under the authority of the Bureau must maintain their scholarly
integrity.


Overview


The goal of the project is to assist the Center for Public Affairs Studies at the Budapest University of Economic Sciences,
the Institute of Sociology at Warsaw University, the Department of Political Science at Babes-Bolyai University,
and social science departments at other universities in the region to develop up-to-date curricula, revise existing
curricula, establish new courses, and develop and utilize new teaching methodologies and materials in local languages.
In addition to a common emphasis on public policy analysis, the program at Warsaw University will also include empirically
based approaches to the study of industrial relations, while at Babes-Bolyai University the program will also include
the study of comparative politics and other aspects of political science.
The curricular development at all three departments will emphasize empirical methods and will enable faculty and
students to gain experience with the tools for analyzing social, political, and public policy issues empirically.
At the conclusion of the project, the faculty at participating departments should be capable of teaching the newly
introduced or revised courses with appropriate teaching materials and should be able to participate more fully in
international scholarly dialogue in their respective disciplines. Students graduating from the participating
departments should be prepared to assume responsibilities in public service, education, and the private sector
with the expertise required to plan and evaluate programs responsibly.


Participants


The project is designed for the following participants: faculty and students associated with the departments identified
for primary support; faculty and students from other institutions in the region; and postdoctoral specialists from
the U.S. who are qualified to train the central European faculty and students (applicant organizations do not need
to obtain letters of commitment from the primary foreign institutions, which have indicated their interest and commitment
directly to USIA). The primary departments are:
(a) Budapest University of Economics, Center for Public Affairs Studies, to assist in developing the Center's program
for students specializing in empirically based public policy analysis;
(b) Warsaw University, Institute of Sociology, to develop programs of instruction in empirically based approaches
to industrial relations and public policy analysis;
(c) Babes-Bolyai University, Faculty of History and Philosophy, to develop a department of political science emphasizing
empirical methods, public policy analysis, and comparative politics.
(d) In addition, funds are available to enable the participation of faculty and students from other institutions
in Poland, Hungary, and Romania in programs offered in cooperation with the three core universities.


Logistics


The recipient organization will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include
providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making lodging and local transportation
arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing any necessary support material,
and working with the foreign participating universities, U.S. host institutions and individual grantees to achieve
maximum program effectiveness.


Visa/Insurance/Tax Requirements


U.S. lecturers and consultants participating in the project must be U.S. citizens. Programs must comply with 
J-1 visa regulations. Please refer to program specific guidelines in Application Package for further details.
Administration of the program must be in compliance with reporting and withholding regulations for federal, state,
and local taxes as applicable. Recipient organizations should demonstrate tax regulation adherence in the proposal
narrative and budget.


Program Description


Exchange and non-exchange activities should complement and reinforce one another within and among the primary supported
departments and at other institutions in Hungary, Poland, and Romania. The ability to coordinate and evaluate exchange
mechanisms and other activities to support the goal of faculty and curriculum development in the primary departments
and at other institutions will be critical to the success of the project.

The program description detailed in this Request for Proposals is for Year One of the project. The grantee organization
will cooperate with USIA, U.S. Information Service (ISIS) field posts, and participating departments in defining
the program mixture for two additional fiscal years' funding on the basis of formative program evaluations and assessments.
The following mechanisms will be utilized in Year One:
(a) Approximately twelve junior faculty development grants, to bring faculty to the U.S. for programs of six weeks
to one semester to develop new courses under the supervision of faculty members at leading U.S. departments in appropriate
fields;
(b) Approximately three senior lectureships, to send senior U.S. specialists for programs of approximately one
semester to teach courses, advise faculty, and assess program developments;
(c) Approximately four junior lectureships, to send recent graduates of leading U.S. doctoral programs for programs
of approximately two semesters to teach courses and participate with local faculty and students in research projects;
(d) Approximately eight distinguished consultancies, to send senior U.S. specialists (possibly including but
not limited to the faculty mentors of the foreign faculty development grantees) for programs of approximately two
weeks in length to teach short courses, advises faculty, and assess program developments;



(e) Approximately $160,000 total for all three countries for equipment, books, and journal subscriptions selected
to support instruction in the developing curricula;
(f) Translation of approximately twelve textbooks or collections of articles relevant to the program at each participating
institution;
(g) A program of locally based collaborative student/faculty research at each primary department to enable local
faculty and visiting U.S. lecturers jointly to train advanced students in empirical research skills by collaborating
on projects designed to study and analyze local social and political problems, particularly those related to democratization;
(h) Approximately four graduate student research awards (approximately one semester in length) for consultation
and study in the U.S. with scholars whose expertise is critical to the subject or methodology of the student's thesis
or other research interest;



(i) Intensive seminars to be held in cooperation with the participating departments for the purpose of developing
locally based scholarly networks and to include faculty members and advanced students from other institutions in
the region in discussions of the newly taught methodologies, subjects, and approaches.

Foreign-Trade Zone 93_Raleigh/Durham, NC, 
Application for Subzone Status, 
R.G. Barry Corporation, 
(Footwear and Thermal Comfort Products), 
Goldsboro, NC



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones 
Board (the Board) by the Triangle J Council of Governments, grantee of FTZ 93, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,
requesting special-purpose subzone status for the distribution facilities of R.G. Barry Corporation, located
in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones
Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed
on November 16, 1994. 

R.G. Barry is a manufacturer and distributor of comfort footwear (household slippers) and thermal comfort products
(heat seats, scarves, back warmers, hand warmers, pocket warmers, ear muffs and bread warmers) with total sales of
over $100 million (1993) and worldwide employment of 3,685 persons. The company has U.S. plants in San Angelo, Texas,
Goldsboro, North Carolina, and Laredo, Texas, with operational headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. An application
is pending with the FTZ Board for subzone status for warehouse/distribution activities at Barry's San Angelo plant
(FTZ Docket 34-94, 59 FR 56459, 11/14/94). 


R.G. Barry's Goldsboro, North Carolina plant is located at 2201 South John Street (172,020 sq. ft. on 35 acres), some
45 miles southeast of Raleigh. The facility (65 employees) is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of R.G.
Barry's footwear and comfort products. The products are generally made of domestic materials (polyester and other
man-made fibers), which are cut at Barry plants in the U.S. and sent to company plants abroad to be sewn. The finished
products are then shipped to Barry's U.S. distribution centers. While currently over five percent of the finished
products are reexported, the company plans to increase export activity to 14 percent. 

Zone procedures would exempt R.G. Barry from Customs duty payments on the foreign value involved in products that
are reexported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to defer Customs duties on the value added abroad.
The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the international competitiveness of the company's
domestic operations. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate
the application and report to the Board. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is January
30, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material 
submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 13, 1995).


A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Authority for Subzone Status; Merck & Co., Inc., (Pharmaceuticals), Elkton, VA</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order: 



Whereas, 

by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment * * * of foreign-trade
zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for other purposes,''
as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) is authorized to grant to
qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs ports of
entry; 



Whereas, 

the Board's regulations (15 CFR Part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when existing
zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved; 



Whereas, 

an application from the Culpeper County Chamber of Commerce, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 185, for authority to
establish special-purpose subzone status at the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities of Merck & Co., Inc.,
in Elkton, Virginia, was filed by the Board on December 14, 1993, and notice inviting public comment was given in the


Federal Register

 (FTZ Docket 63-93, 58 FR 68116, 12-23-93); and, 



Whereas, 

the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval of
the application is in the public interest; 



Now, therefore, 

the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 185C) at the plant site of Merck & Co., Inc.,
in Elkton, Virginia, at the location described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's regulations,
including  400.28.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Partial Termination of Antidumping Duty 
Administrative Review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request from IPSCO, Inc., the 
Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an 
administrative review of IPSCO, Inc. on September 8, 1994. On 
October 7, 1994, IPSCO timely withdrew its request for an 
administrative review of the above referenced order. Because 
there were no other requests for review of this company from any 
other interested party, the Department is now terminating this 
review with respect to IPSCO, Inc.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 30, 1994, the Department received a request from IPSCO, Inc. to conduct an administrative review of the 
antidumping duty order pursuant to  353.22(a)(2) of the 
Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.33(a)(2)). 


On September 8, 1994, the Department published in the 


Federal Register

 a Notice of Initiation for this review (59 FR 
46391). On October 7, 1994, IPSCO, Inc. withdrew its request for 
administrative review. This withdrawal was made within the time 
limits established in  353.22(a)(5) of the Department's 
regulations. No other interested party has requested an 
administrative review of IPSCO's entries in this proceeding. 
In accordance with  353.22(a)(5) of the Department's 
regulations, the Department has determined to terminate this 
administrative review for IPSCO, Inc. 
Absent a review, we shall instruct the Customs Service to 
liquidate IPSCO's entries. 
Furthermore, because IPSCO was a previously investigated 
company, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate found for IPSCO during the investigation,
as amended pursuant to an order of the U.S.-Canada binational panel.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Amendment to Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On May 26, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) submitted to the Court of International Trade (CIT) the
final results of redetermination pursuant to a remand in 

Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States 

(Court No. 93-09-00522, February 28, 1994). On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination
(Slip Op. 94-140). In accordance with that affirmation, we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative
review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, period with respect to Momoi Fishing Net Manufacturing Co. (Momoi).
Momoi's rate is zero percent for the 1990-1991 period.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




On February 28, 1994, the CIT, in 

Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States 

(Court No. 93-09-00522, February 28, 1994), remanded to the Department for redetermination the final
results of the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, administrative review of the antidumping finding on fishnetting
of man-made fiber from Japan (37 FR 11560, June 9, 1972).

In the Department's final results of administrative review, the dumping margin for Momoi's fishnetting sold or imported
into the United States for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, was 2.67 percent. Momoi's dumping margin for
those final results was calculated based on the price to Momoi's U.S. importers (

see Fishnetting of Man-Made Fiber from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review, 

58 FR 42291 (August 9, 1993)). Based on the information on the record, the Department concluded that the price to Momoi's
U.S. importers included U.S. Customs duties and brokerage expenses.

On February 28, 1994, the CIT remanded this case to the Department to reconsider whether Momoi's C.I.F. sales excluded
any charges for U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges in the calculation of United States price (USP) for
Momoi (

see Momoi Fishing Net Mfg. Co. v. United States

 (Court No. 93-09-00522)).



Final Remand Results



In accordance with the CIT's order, the Department revised its final results with respect to Momoi for the 1990-1991
administrative review of fishnetting of man-made fiber from Japan. Based on additional documents provided by Momoi
in response to a supplemental questionnaire issued by the Department, we determined that Momoi's C.I.F. sales prices
excluded U.S. Customs duties and U.S. brokerage charges. We determined that the revised weighted-average margin
based on this information for the period June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991, is zero percent.



Final Results of Redetermination



On September 8, 1994, the CIT affirmed our redetermination (Slip Op. 94-140). In accordance with that affirmation,
we are hereby amending the final results of the administrative review for the June 1, 1990, through May 31, 1991 period
with respect to Momoi. Momoi's rate for the 1990-1991 period is zero percent.

Since we have not conducted an administrative review of Momoi for a later period, we will instruct the U.S. Customs
Service to apply these amended results as a cash deposit for entries of merchandise produced by Momoi. This deposit
requirement, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review.

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.

This amendment to final results of antidumping duty administrative review notice is in accordance with section 751(a)(1)
of Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its intent to revoke the countervailing duty
order on aluminum sulfate from Venezuela (54 FR 51908; December 19, 1989). Domestic interested parties who object
to this revocation must submit their comments in writing not later than the last day of December 1994. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Department may revoke a countervailing duty order if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that it is no longer of
interest to interested parties. Accordingly, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4), we are notifying the public of our
intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on aluminum sulfate from Venezuela (54 FR 51908; December 19, 1989)
for which the Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review for the most recent four consecutive
annual anniversary months. 

In accordance with section 355.25(d)(4)(iii) of the Department's regulations, if no domestic interested party
(defined in section 355.2(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of the regulations) objects to the Department's intent
to revoke this order, and no interested party (defined in section 355.2(i) of the regulations) requests an administrative
review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity to request administrative review, we shall conclude
that the countervailing duty order is no longer of interest to interested parties and proceed with the revocation.
However, if an interested party does request an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice
of opportunity to request administrative review, or a domestic interested party objects to the Department's intent
to revoke, the Department will not revoke the order. 



Opportunity To Object 



Not later than the last day of December 1994, domestic interested parties may object to the Department's intent to
revoke this countervailing duty order. Any submission objecting to revocation must contain the name and case number
of the order and a statement that explains how the objecting party qualifies as a domestic interested party under sections

Seven copies of any such objections should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, Room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230.

 Notice of Determination Not To Revoke Countervailing Duty Orders. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing
duty orders listed below. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 31, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 44966) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty orders listed below. Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the
Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the
order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review
by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. 

Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke
these countervailing duty orders. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been
met, we will not revoke these orders. 

This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4).

</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






Authority:

 Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated November 3, 1994, the Governments of the United States and Malaysia agreed
to extend and amend their current bilateral textile agreement. The agreement is extended for a one-year period beginning
on January 1, 1995 and extending through December 31, 1995.

In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to establish sublimits for
Categories 611, 619, 620 in the Fabric Group for the 1994 agreement period and increase the current limits for the Fabric
Group and Categories 338/339 and 347/348. The limits for Categories 647/648 and 645/646 are being reduced to account
for additional flexibility which was applied as a result of the increases. In addition, the sublimits for Categories
334, 335 and 635 are being eliminated.

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

 notice 58 FR 62645, published on November 29, 1993). Also see 58 FR 65580, published on December 15, 1993.

The letter to the Commissioner of Customs and the actions taken pursuant to it are not designed to implement all of the
provisions of the MOU, but are designed to assist only in the implementation of certain of its provisions.

Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements


November 18, 1994.



Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: The directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on December 9, 1993, by the
Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive concerns imports of certain cotton,
wool and man-made fiber textiles and textile products and silk blend and other vegetable fiber apparel, produced
or manufactured in Malaysia and exported during the twelve-month period which began on January 1, 1994 and extends
through December 31, 1994.

Effective on November 28, 1994, you are directed, pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated November
3, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and Malaysia, to move Categories 611, 619 and 620 from Group II
to the Fabric Group and establish sublimits for Categories 611, 619 and 620. The import charges for Categories 611,
619 and 620 shall be moved from Group II and applied to the newly established sublimits in the Fabric Group. Further,
you are directed to eliminate the sublimits for Categories 334 and 335 in merged Categories 333/334/335/835 and 635
in merged Categories 634/635. The import charges for these sublimits shall be retained. You are directed to establish
and amend the following limits and sublimits, as provided under the terms of the November 3, 1994 MOU:






The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft Statement), Notice of Public Hearings on
the Draft Statement, and Floodplains/Wetlands Notification. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (Department) announces the availability of the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration
Project's Draft Statement (EIS-0221) prepared to assess the environmental and human health effects of the
design, construction, and operation of a proposed 250 (gross) megawatt electric (MWe) atmospheric circulating
fluidized bed cogeneration facility, to be located in North Codorus Township, York County, Pennsylvania. As one
of the proposals selected under Round I of the Clean Coal Technology Program, the Cogeneration Project would demonstrate
the applicability of atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion and cogeneration technology at a utility
scale. This technology, when compared to conventional coal burning technologies, would result in a cost effective
reduction in emissions of sulfur, oxides of nitrogen, and particles from a nominal 250-MWe (227 MWe net) coal-fired
power plant. The proposed action is the cost-shared Federal funding of the project by the Department of approximately
$75 million (about 20 percent of the total cost of approximately $350 million). The industrial partner for this proposed
project is York County Energy Partners, L.P., a project company of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. The proposed project
would be a cogeneration facility, supplying steam to be purchased by 
P.H. Glatfelter Company, and electricity that would be purchased by Metropolitan Edison Company. As a result of the
purchase of steam, P.H. Glatfelter Company's No. 4 power boiler would be placed on hot-standby status and operated
up to 720 hours per year in parallel with the proposed project. This would result in a net reduction in emissions of sulfur
dioxide and particles within York County, Pennsylvania. In addition, emission reduction credits for oxides of nitrogen
emissions would be transferred, in part, from the No. 4 power boiler to the proposed project in order to generate the
1.15 to 1 offsets required by law. 



The Draft Statement assesses the environmental impacts of the atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion
and cogeneration technology at a large utility scale and setting. The technologies to be demonstrated include a Foster
Wheeler 2,500 MMBtu/hr single-train atmospheric circulating fluidized bed boiler, incorporating selective non-catalytic
reduction for reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen, limestone injection for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide,
and fine particle filters for reducing particulate emissions. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background and Need for the Proposed Action 



The Department proposes to provide cost-shared funding support for the design, construction, and operation of a
250-MWe (gross) coal-fired atmospheric circulating fluidized bed cogeneration power plant at North Codorus
Township, Pennsylvania, to demonstrate the cost effective reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen,
and particulate matter. The proposed project was selected by the Department for negotiation of a Cooperative Agreement
for Federal assistance under the Clean Coal Technology Program. Following a 24-month demonstration period anticipated
to conclude in December, 1999, the facility would enter into commercial operation for a period of approximately 23
years. The proposed project would be located in North Codorus Township in York County, Pennsylvania, approximately
6 miles southwest of York, Pennsylvania. The proposed project would be built on property currently owned by P.H. Glatfelter
Company, which would purchase approximately 400,000 lbs/hr of steam for industrial use from the proposed cogeneration
project. 

In December 1985, Congress allocated funds to the Department for conducting the first round of the cost-shared Clean
Coal Technology Program. On 
February 17, 1986, the Department issued a Program Opportunity Notice soliciting proposals to conduct cost-shared
projects to demonstrate innovative, energy efficient, economically competitive coal-based technologies that
had potential for commercialization in the 1990s. In response to the solicitation, 51 proposals were received. From
these proposals, nine projects were selected by the Department in July of 1986 for negotiation, and a list of alternate
candidates was established in the event that one or more of the initial nine projects did not proceed. In June of 1989,
the Arvah B. Hopkins Circulating Fluidized Bed Repowering Project, proposed by the City of Tallahassee, Florida,
was selected from the alternate list. As originally envisioned, this project would have repowered one of the City
of Tallahassee's municipally-owned natural gas boilers with atmospheric circulating fluidized bed combustion
technology.

In early September 1991, the City of Tallahassee indicated that it no longer wished to proceed with the proposed project.
The City indicated its willingness to cooperate with the effort to relocate the project, and other potential hosts
for the project were then considered. Subsequently, the Department agreed to reassign the project to York County
Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The new sponsors
proposed to relocate the project from Tallahassee, Florida, to an industrial site adjacent to the J.E. Baker Company
quarry and brick manufacturing operations in West Manchester Township, York County, Pennsylvania, and to operate
the project as a cogeneration facility. Steam produced by the project would have been purchased by the J.E. Baker Company
and electricity would have been purchased by Metropolitan Edison Company. All other major aspects of the project
would have remained essentially unchanged from the original project. 

During the summer of 1992, York County Energy Partners sought opportunities for air emissions reductions from existing
companies in the vicinity of the proposed project as a means of acquiring air emissions offsets. Discussions with
P.H. Glatfelter Company indicated that the desired level of air emissions reductions could be achieved by relocating
the project to P.H. Glatfelter Company's paper mill facility in North Codorus Township, if the proposed York County
Energy Partners project could provide sufficient steam to largely displace an existing 
 P.H. Glatfelter Company coal-fired boiler. Additionally, it was determined that the co-location of the proposed
cogeneration project with P.H. Glatfelter Company's paper mill facility would enable York County Energy Partners
to treat and recycle wastewater from the mill for use as cooling water at the proposed cogeneration facility, thereby
greatly reducing the amount of fresh water used. Accordingly, on February 1, 1993, York County Energy Partners and
P.H. Glatfelter Company issued a joint statement that they were evaluating the feasibility of relocating the proposed
York County Energy Partners project to the North Codorus Township site. The Department was requested to consider
York County Energy Partners' proposed site change. The Department issued its approval of the proposed site change
in a memorandum dated June 23, 1993. 



Environmental Impact Statement Preparation 



The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act, as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508)
and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). In accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act, the Department determined that providing cost-shared funding for the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration
Project constitutes a major Federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore,
the Department has prepared a Draft Statement to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action, and reasonable
alternatives to the proposed action, on the human and natural environment. 

A Notice of Intent (Notice) to prepare an environmental impact statement and hold public scoping meetings was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on July 29, 1993 (58 FR 40631). The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of
the environmental impact statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited public participation
in the National Environmental Policy Act process. Scoping meetings were held on August 19, 1993 and October 5, 1993
in North Codorus Township and York, Pennsylvania, respectively. Overall, the Department received 614 comments.
As a result of the scoping process, the Department developed an Environmental Impact Statement Implementation Plan
to define the scope and to provide further guidance for preparing the environmental impact statement. 

The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts
of the proposed construction and operation of the York County Energy Partners Project at the proposed site. This Draft
Statement also considers the proposed action, an alternate site, and the no-action alternative, which includes
a scenario that reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to human
health, atmospheric resources, surface water, groundwater, socioeconomic resources (including environmental
justice), noise, and traffic from construction and operation of the proposed York County Energy Partners Cogeneration
Project have been analyzed. Impacts to biological resources, biodiversity, floodplains, and wetlands are also
considered. 



Floodplains/Wetlands Notification 



Pursuant to Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with
Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR 1022), notification is provided that portions
of electric connections and pipeline corridors proposed as components of the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration
Project would be constructed and operated in the 100-year floodplain (as depicted on the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's Flood Insurance Rate Map; Panel Number 422223 0005, 0010 and Panel Number 422227 0005, 0010). In addition,
portions of ladder tracks and a rail spur associated with the proposed project would also be located within the 100-year
floodplain. A total of approximately 1.1 acres would be expected to be utilized for placement of these ancillary facilities
within the 100-year floodplain. 

Small areas of the Codorus Creek's 100-year floodplain would be unavoidably impacted by development to connect the
proposed project with utility (electric) substation facilities. Approximately 14 to 22 power line utility poles
(required to provide a connection between the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Facility and Metropolitan-Edison's
existing Bair Substation) would be located within the 100-year floodplain of Codorus Creek. This electric interconnect
would intersect the floodplain on property controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and property owned by P.H.
Glatfelter Company. It is estimated that 4-8 utility poles would be located on land belonging to P.H. Glatfelter
Company, and 10-14 utility poles would be located on land controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. Placement
of these utility poles would impact approximately 0.013 acres of the 100-year floodplain. Construction and operation
of these electrical connections (and their rights-of way) would be conducted in accord with relevant regulatory
requirements and in consultation with appropriate regulatory agencies.

<TEXT>
 

Short segments of the proposed facility's steam supply pipeline to P.H. Glatfelter Company and condensate return
pipeline would also be located within an identified 100-year floodplain, affecting approximately 0.3 acres. A small
area (approximately 0.8 acres) of the Codorus Creek 100-year floodplain would be impacted by ladder tracks and rail
spur that would require an expansion of the existing YorkRail right-of-way on P.H. Glatfelter Company property.
The rail structures would be similar to, and closely parallel, the existing YorkRail Main line at the same elevation.


Impacts during construction would include equipment and vehicle access, earth disturbance, sedimentation, erosion
from exposed soils, damaged vegetation, and placement and compaction of fill to support new rail lines. In addition,
the steam and condensate return pipelines to P.H. Glatfelter Company would require permanent pipe supports to be
placed within the floodplain. During operation, there would be some periodic minor disturbance due to personnel
and equipment entry for inspection and maintenance of the new ladder tracks, rail spur, and above-ground steam and
condensate return pipelines to P.H. Glatfelter Company. 

The potential impacts and mitigation measures associated with the above proposed activities within identified
floodplains are discussed in Section 4 of the Draft Statement and constitutes the floodplains assessment in accordance
with 10 CFR Part 1022. 

Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action on floodplains may be submitted to the Department in accordance
with the procedures described below. 

In accordance with Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, and the Department's Procedures for Compliance
with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR Part 1022), wetlands protection has also
been considered in the Department's Draft Statement. Above- and below-ground pipeline connections between the
proposed new facility and existing facilities would require construction affecting approximately 0.5 acres of
wetlands. These wetlands would be temporarily disturbed as a result of construction and excavation activities associated
with pipeline installation. 

Four identified wetlands, along with Codorus Creek, would be potentially affected by the proposed project and utility
corridors. A fringe wetland bordering Mill Pond and Kessler Pond would be unavoidably affected by placement of permanent
pipe support foundations for a pipe rack supporting the steam and condensate return pipelines to the P.H. Glatfelter
Company facility. This wetland impact is unavoidable due to the proposed facility being sited on the opposite side
of Codurus Creek from the P.H. Glatfelter Company facility. Three other wetlands would be traversed by supply and
return pipelines for the proposed project cooling tower. A total of approximately 0.20 acre of these three wetlands
would be impacted for excavation and underground placement of cooling tower supply and return pipelines from the
proposed facility to P.H. Glatfelter Company facilities. 

During construction of the pipeline interconnect, vegetation would be selectively removed using manual labor whenever
possible in order to minimize potential impacts associated with mechanical clearing techniques. York County Energy
Partners would obtain regulatory approval prior to construction or disturbance of wetlands. Potential impacts
during construction and operation, such as erosion and sedimentation, would be controlled with appropriate mitigation
measures (such as silt fencing during construction). 

It should be noted, however, that construction of the proposed electrical interconnect corridor, the proposed rail
spur, and ladder track associated with this proposed project would not result in incursion into wetland areas. 

Potential environmental impacts to wetlands are discussed more fully in Chapter 4 of the Draft Statement and constitutes
the wetlands assessment in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022. Comments regarding the effects of the proposed action
on wetland areas may be submitted to the Department in accordance with the procedures described below.

<DOCTITLE>Southern Natural Gas Co.; Notice of Petition for Clarification or Waiver of Tariff Provisions</DOCTITLE>



November 18, 1994.



Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing a petition for
clarification or a temporary waiver of Section 23.2 (Credit Mechanism for Interruptible Transportation Revenues)
of the General Terms and Conditions (Section 23.2) of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1.

Southern states that waiver would allow Southern to defer making the revenue credits required by this section of its
tariff until such time as the fixed cost allocation to the interruptible transportation (IT) rate is established
with finality. In view of the Commission's order dated March 16, 1994, in Southern's Docket Nos. RP92-10-006,


et al.


 which requires that any change in the IT level of throughout made in the upcoming hearing in Southern Docket No. RP93-15-000
be applied retroactively, Southern states that it would be premature to make revenue credits at this time.





Southern states submits that such a clarification or waiver of Section 23.2 is warranted because the amount of fixed
costs allocated to IT service are now subject to revision retroactively and thus the appropriate credits cannot be
accurately calculated at this time. Given this uncertainty, Southern states that the Commission should waive compliance
with this provision of Southern's FERC Gas Tariff until such time as the necessary components for calculating such
credits are final and ascertainable.

Southern states that a copy of the filing is being served on all of Southern's customers.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November
28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

capacity and the Replacement Shipper utilizes a Secondary Point. CIG is clarifying that it will bill the Original
Shipper for all reservation charges applicable at the Secondary Point(s) even if those charges are higher than the
Original Shipper is paying at the Primary Point(s). CIG states it will bill the Replacement Shipper only the amount
that such party bid in order to acquire the capacity (through the capacity release program) unless the Original Shipper
requires payment or reimbursement of reservation charges by the Replacement Shipper. CIG states this change is being
made in keeping with the holdings of the Commission in 

ANR Pipeline Company,

 66 FERC  61,340 (1994) and 68 FERC   61,009 (1994).

Secondly, CIG is proposing to change the section of its tariff concerning posting of affiliate discounts. CIG is proposing
to post on its electronic bulletin board its discounts to affiliates 24 hours after the gas flows under the discounted
transaction. CIG states that this change is being made in keeping with the Commissions holding in Order No. 566-A
issued October 14, 1994.

CIG states that copies of this filing have been served on CIG's jurisdictional customers and public bodies.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections
385.211 and 385.214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211). All such petitions
or protests should be filed on or before November 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available

 Notice of Final Deadline for Filing Applications for Refund in Special Refund Proceeding No. LEF-0003, Apex
Oil Co., Apex Holding Co., Clark Oil & Refining Corp., Goldstein Oil Co., Novelly Oil Co. (AOC Acquisition Corp.)






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy has set the final deadline for filing Applications for
Refund from the escrow account established pursuant to a consent order entered into between the DOE and AOC Acquisition
Corp., Special Refund Proceeding No. LEF-0003. The previous deadline was July 31, 1992. The new deadline is
January 31, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy is hereby setting a final deadline for the filing of Applications
for Refund in the AOC Acquisition Corp. (AOC) refund proceeding. On August 20, 1991, we issued a Decision and Order
setting forth final refund procedures to distribute the monies in the oil overcharge escrow account established
in accordance with the terms of a consent order entered into by the DOE and AOC's predecessor companies. 

See Apex Oil Co., Apex Holding Co., Clark Oil & Refining Corp., Goldstein Oil Co., Novelly Oil Co.

, 21 DOE   85,341 (1991), 56 Fed. Reg. 50719 (October 8, 1991). That Decision established July 31, 1992 as the filing
deadline for purchasers of Clark refined products to submit refund applications.



Since July 31, 1992, we have routinely granted extensions of time to Clark customers who were unaware of the proceeding
or were in the process of gathering information to support their refund claims. We have now received 327 refund applications.
Given that the proceeding has been open for three years, we have concluded that eligible applicants have been provided
with more than ample time to file. We will therefore not accept applications that are postmarked after January 31,
1995. All Applications for Refund from the AOC Consent Order Fund postmarked after the final filing date of January
31, 1995, will be summarily dismissed. Any unclaimed funds remaining after all pending claims are resolved will be
made available for indirect restitution pursuant to the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act
of 1986, 15 U.S.C. 4501.

Title:

 National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (EPA ICR 

#

1463.03; OMB 

#

2050-0096). This ICR requests renewal of the existing clearance.



Abstract:

 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), and as amended in 1986,
establishes broad Federal authority to undertake removal and remedial actions in response to releases or threats
of releases of hazardous substances and certain pollutants and contaminants into the environment. The NCP establishes
procedures for data collection, analysis, and reporting to be conducted during remedial and removal actions at Superfund
sites.

The Response Program is comprised of activities that fall into two phases: the pre-remedial phase, during which the
extent of contamination at a site is assessed and those sites that represent the highest priority cleanup are identified;
and the remedial phase, during which investigations are conducted to determine viable remedies for a site, a remedy
is chosen and constructed, and the long-term operation and maintenance of the remedy is conducted.
This information collection addresses only the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in the remedial phase
of the response program under the current NCP.
The remedial phase begins once a site plan is proposed for listing on the National Priorities List. A detailed project
plan is developed, and a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility study (RI/FS) is begun. The RI/FS is a detailed site
evaluation and analysis conducted to determine the alternatives to be used to clean up a site. A progress report summarizes
the results, and a proposed plan is developed which identifies the preferred alternatives and informs the public
about how to participate in the remedy selection process. The final action is selected based on the RI/FS and public
comment, and is documented in a Record Decision (ROD). Remedial action begins following Agency signoff on the ROD.

Burden Statement: 

The average annual reporting burden for a state government that has the lead at a Superfund site is estimated to be 5,620
hours per site. This estimate includes time required to review instructions, search existing data sources gather
and maintain the needed data, estimate the information required, and complete and review the collection of information.
The average recordkeeping burden for a state government that has the lead at a Superfund site is estimated to be 620
hours per site.
The reporting burden for community members is estimated to average 330 hours per site. This reporting burden includes
time required to attend public meetings, interviews, or other review activities. There is no recordkeeping burden
for community members. 
States are not required to take on the role of the lead agency in remedial actions, and if they do accept the lead role
in a Superfund financed action, they are reimbursed by the Fund for their work.


Respondents: 

Any state which has the lead in remedial activities (in compliance with Federal standards at Superfund sites), and
community members participating in the determination of remedial activities at a Superfund site.


Estimated No. of Respondents: 

168 (8 state-lead sites, 160 communities).


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 

1.


Frequency of Collection: 

As needed to determine an optimal remedial action at a Superfund site.

Title:

 Hazardous Waste Generator Standards (EPA No. 820.06). This ICR is a renewal of an approved collection (OMB No. 2050-0035).



Abstract:

 The informational requirements for hazardous waste generators include pre-transport (separate for large and small
quantity generators), export, and recordkeeping requirements. Pre-transport requirements for large quantity
generators (LQGs) include documenting certain personnel information, such as job description and training, for
positions dealing with hazardous wastes; preparing and maintaining contingency plans; complying with emergency
reporting requirements; and recording when local firehouses decline to become more familiar with the generator's
facility and its waste. Also, LQGs using tank systems for accumulating hazardous waste may need to submit to one or
more of the following: a no-free-liquids demonstration, existing tank system assessments, an equivalent containment
exemption, a variance from secondary containment requirements, annual leak tests and inspections, an exemption
from the 24-hour leak detection requirement, new tank system assessments and certifications, an exemption from
the 24-hour waste removal requirement, release notifications and reports, and major repair certifications. Pre-transport
requirements for small quantity generators (SQGs) include notification in the event of a fire, explosion, or other
release threatening human health outside the facility or when the generator has knowledge that a spill has reached
surface water. 
 Export requirements include: providing notification of intent to export hazardous waste, renotification if conditions
are altered, filing an annual report summarizing information on all wastes exported, filing exception reports where
applicable, maintaining copies of relevant documents for a period of three years, and under certain circumstances
providing additional information, as requested by the receiving country. The Agency uses the information as an enforcement
tool, and to ensure that all hazardous waste generated in the Unites States is managed in a manner protective of human
health and the environment. 
All generators are required to keep records of test results, waste analyses, or other records documenting that a waste
is hazardous for at least three years. 


Burden Statement:

 The estimated average public burden per response for this collection is about 15 hours for large quantity generators,
2 hours for small quantity generators, 5 hours for exporters, and 2 hours for importers. This estimate includes all
aspects of the information collection, including recordkeeping. 


Respondents:

 Hazardous Waste Generators. 


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 67,037. 


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Revisions to the State of Michigan's Federally Approved Wetland Program Resulting From the Reorganization

ACTION:

 Notice of approval.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) approves the revisions
to the State of Michigan's federally approved wetland program resulting from the reorganization of the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) by Executive Order 1991-31.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background



On October 2, 1984, EPA published notice of its approval of the State of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program pursuant
to Section 404(g)(1) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344(g)(1). 49 FR 38948. Michigan's program became effective
October 16, 1984. 49 FR 38948 (October 2, 1984). 40 CFR 233.60.

40 CFR 233.16 requires that EPA review and either approve or disapprove of any revisions to a state's Section 404 wetlands
program based upon whether the revisions comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing
regulations. 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3) provides that, if EPA determines that a program revision is substantial, EPA must
provide public notice and an opportunity for public hearing on the revision.

Michigan's original program description submitted to EPA on October 26, 1983 specified that the Michigan Department
of Natural Resources (MDNR) was the agency responsible for implementing the permitting and enforcement components
of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. The Michigan Water Resources Commission (MWRC) was specified as the
agency responsible for insuring that wetland permitting was coordinated with state, interstate and federal-state
water related planning and review processes.

On November 8, 1991, the Governor of Michigan issued Executive Order 1991-31. Executive Order 1991-31,
which became effective on September 2, 1993, provides that: 



All the statutory authority, power, duties, functions and responsibilities of the Commission of Natural Resources
and the Department of Natural Resources * * * and of the director of the Department of Natural Resources
and of the agencies, boards and commissions contained therein * * * are hereby transferred to the director
of a new Michigan Department of Natural Resources, by a Type II transfer, as defined by Section 3 of Act No. 380 of the
Public Acts of 1965, being Section 16.103 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. 



Executive Order 1991-31 also provided that the responsibilties and authorities of the MWRC were transferred,
via a Type III transfer, from the Water Resources Commission to the director of a new MDNR. 
Pursuant to EPA's request, Michigan submitted numerous documents to EPA that were necessary for EPA to determine
whether the revisions to Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program resulting from Executive Order 1991-93 would
comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations and whether such revisions were
substantial. According to Michigan, there had been no substantive changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program
as a result of Executive Order 1991-31. Instead, according to Michigan, Executive Order 1991-31 merely
resulted in some reorganization within MDNR. Michigan certified in an Attorney General's Statement that all of the
state authorities included in Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description remained in full force and
effect after issuance of Executive Order 1991-31. 
Based upon its review of the documents submitted by Michigan, EPA made a preliminary determination that there had
been no substantial revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program as a result of Executive Order 1991-31.
However, because there appeared to be a significant amount of public interest in this matter, EPA chose to seek public
comment on its determination. Consequently, on April 21, 1994, EPA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of EPA's preliminary determination and stated that ``EPA is seeking public comment concerning whether any substantial
revisions to the State wetlands program were effected by the MDNR reorganization, and comment on Agency approval
or disapproval of any revisions to Michigan's wetlands program as outlined in Executive Order 1991-93 and MDNR's
December 15, 1993 submittal.'' The notice further emphasized that ``EPA is not seeking at this time, public comment
on unrelated issues regarding Michigan's wetland program.'' Finally, the notice stated that copies of Michigan's
description of the wetlands program, related correspondence and EPA's findings of no substantial revisions would
be available for public inspection at two locations in Michigan. 


II. Comments 


In response to the April 21, 1994 notice, EPA received comments from nine commenters who disagreed with EPA's preliminary
determination that Executive Order 1991-31 did not substantially revise Michigan's wetlands program. In
addition, the United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, stated that it agreed with EPA's preliminary
determination that Executive Order 1991-31 did not substantially revise Michigan's wetland program and offered
two additional comments. EPA's detailed responses to all comments received are set forth in a document entitled ``Response
to Comments Raised Regarding Revisions to Michigan Wetland Program.'' This document can be obtained from Mr. Douglas
Ehorn at the address and phone number listed above. A summary of the comments and EPA's responses to the comments is
provided below.

There were several comments that Executive Order 1991-31 has revised the public participation requirements
in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. Under 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3), changes in public participation requirements
must be considered to be substantial changes. These commenters, therefore, believe that Executive Order 1991-31
has effected a substantial revision in Michigan's wetland program. 
The public participation requirements for state Section 404 wetland programs are set forth at 40 CFR 233.32-34.
These provisions contain specific requirements regarding the need for, timing of, information contained in, method
of providing, and persons to be provided public notice of permit applications, draft general permits and consideration
of major permit modifications (40 CFR 233.32); the need for and method of conducting public hearings (40 CFR 233.33);
and the manner in which public comments must be considered and included in the official record in making permit determinations
(40 CFR 233.34). Michigan, in its October 26, 1983 program description, demonstrated that the MDNR had authority
to comply with all of the above requirements. 
As described above, MDNR is still the authority responsible for processing and making determinations regarding
wetland permit applications in Michigan. None of the public participation requirements that were applicable to
MDNR in processing and making determinations regarding wetland permit applications have changed as a result of Executive
Order 1991-31. Therefore, EPA did not receive any comments that suggested that the public participation requirements
applicable to MDNR in the processing and issuance of wetland permits had been changed or were in any way not in compliance
with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the public participation requirements of 40 CFR 233.32-34.
Instead, the comments on public participation focussed on three other issues. 
First, one commenter stated that public participation in the development of administrative rules implementing
Michigan's wetlands program has changed in that the Director of the MDNR now establishes the administrative rules
by which the program is administered rather than the Michigan Natural Resources Commission (``MNRC''). This commenter
stated that the Director of MDNR, unlike MNRC, is not subject to Michigan's Open Meetings Act and therefore the Director
can make final decisions on administrative rules pertaining to the wetlands program in closed meetings and the substance
of those meetings need not be recorded. The commenter suggested that this represents a significant change from the
way in which MNRC developed administrative rules for Michigan's wetlands program. 

EPA does not agree that this apparent change in the manner in which administrative rules are developed represents
a change in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. A state's federally authorized Section 404 wetlands program
consists of the statutes and rules which govern the state's program. EPA has no role to play in overseeing or dictating
how those statutes and rules are developed. Instead, EPA's role is to determine whether the statutes and rules which
comprise the program comply with minimum federal requirements for authorized programs, regardless of how the state
has developed those statutes and rules. If the state desires to change those statutes or rules, EPA has no role in determining
the manner in which those statutes or rules are changed, so long as the state submits the proposed changes to EPA for
review. Consequently, the applicability or inapplicability of the State's Open Meetings Act to changes in administrative
rules does not represent a change in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. 
The second reason suggested by commenters that Executive Order 1991-31 effected a change in public participation
requirements pertains to changes involving the manner in which Michigan ``assure[s] that any state * * *
whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written recommendation to the permitting state''
and ``assures continued coordination with Federal and Federal-State water related planning and review processes''
as required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) & (H) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344(h)(1)(E) & (H). In
Michigan's original program description submitted to EPA on October 26, 1983, Michigan stated that it could assure
such coordination because ``[t]he broad powers that were statutorily allotted to Michigan's Water Resource Commission
[``MWRC''] are more than sufficient'' to provide such assurances. 
Commenters noted that Executive Order 1991-31 abolished MWRC and transferred its responsibilities and authorities
to the Director of MDNR. These commenters claimed that MWRC was subject to the Open Meetings Act while the Director
of MDNR is not. Consequently, these commenters suggest, there has been a change in the opportunities for public participation
in the ``Federal and Federal-State water related planning and review processes.'' These commenters go on to suggest
that, because Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program must assure coordination with these planning processes,
a change in the public's opportunity to participate in those planning and review processes constitutes a change in
the wetlands program's public participation provisions. EPA does not agree that changes in Federal and Federal-State
planning and review processes in the State of Michigan are changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program.

Section 404(h)(1)(E), 33 U.S.C. 1344(h)(1)(E), requires that state wetland programs ``assure that any State * * *
whose waters may be affected by the issuance of a permit may submit written recommendations to the permitting State.''
Similarly, Section 404(h)(1)(H), 33 U.S.C. 1344(h)(1)(H), requires that state wetland programs ``assure continued
coordination with Federal and Federal-State water-related planning and review processes.'' Nothing in either
section or anywhere else in Section 404 or the regulations implementing Section 404 requires that a state, as part
of its Section 404 wetlands program, assure that the public is allowed to participate in any Federal, Federal-State
or interstate coordinating processes. EPA's review of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program, therefore, is limited
to a review of whether Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program contains provisions which assure the interstate,
intrastate and Federal-State coordination required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) and (H). As described below, EPA has
determined that Michigan's Section 404 wetland program does contain such assurances. 


Section 323.1 

et seq. 

of Michigan's Compiled Laws (Mich. Comp. Laws) established MWRC. Mich. Comp. Laws  323.2a(1) provides that
``[t]he water resources commission is designated the state agency to cooperate and negotiate with other governments,
governmental units and agencies thereof, in matters concerning the water resources of the state, including but not
limited to flood control, beach erosion control and water quality control planning, development and management.''
Michigan, in its October 26, 1983 program description, relied upon Mich. Comp. Laws  323.2a(1) as the basis
for assuring EPA that the interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E)
and (H) would occur. Section III.B.1 of Executive Order 1991-31 transferred all of these duties and authorities
from the MWRC to the Director of MDNR and the Michigan Attorney General has certified that these authorities remain
in full force and effect. Consequently, Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program assures that the interstate, intrastate
and Federal-State coordination required by Sections 404(h)(1)(E) and (H) shall take place through the MDNR. 

A number of commenters noted that the Michigan Attorney General's Statement failed to specifically mention that
MDNR, rather than MWRC, would be responsible for the interstate, intrastate and Federal-State coordination described
above. According to these commenters, this claimed failure rendered Michigan's modified program description ``deficient
on its face and, as a matter of law, [provides] an inadequate basis for public comment and provides EPA with an inadequate
basis on which to determine whether or not the Michigan wetlands permitting program currently complies with applicable
federal requirements.'' EPA disagrees. 

The basis for these commenters concern is their apparent belief that EPA must limit its review in this matter to the
documents included with Michigan's December 15, 1993 letter to EPA, which included the Attorney General's Statement
and Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description. However, 40 CFR 233.16(d)(1) provides that a State
may submit ``a modified program description 

or other documents 

which [EPA] determines to be necessary to evaluate whether the program complies with the requirements of the Act and
this part'' (emphasis added). As described above, Michigan submitted a number of other documents to EPA in addition
the December 15, 1993 letter, including a September 20, 1993 letter from Michigan which contained Executive Order
1991-31. As noted above, EPA's determination that Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program assures interstate,
intrastate and Federal-State coordination is based upon the Attorney General's Statement, Michigan's October
26, 1983 program description, and Executive Order 1991-31. All of these documents were included in the administrative
record which was made available for public review after EPA made its preliminary determination on April 21, 1994.


The third set of comments regarding how Executive Order 1991-31 effected a change in public participation requirements
pertained to the roles formerly played by the MWRC and the Michigan Natural Resources Commission (``MNRC'') as public
``sounding boards'' and sources of information pertaining to wetlands issues. According to these commentators,
Executive Order 1991-31, in abolishing the MWRC and changing the role of the MNRC effected a change in public
participation because the public now has less of an opportunity to understand issues or being decided or express concerns
regarding the state's wetland program. EPA does not agree that this represents a change in the public particpation
provisions of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. 

As described above, Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description indicated that federal public participation
requirements would be met based upon state statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to MDNR. There is nothing
in Michigan's original program description which indicated that either MWRC or MNRC would play any role as part of
Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program in assuring compliance with federal public particpation requirements.
Consequently, although these commissions may in fact have provided the public additional opportunities to receive
information about and to comment on wetland issues, those opportunities were above and beyond the opportunities
which were reviewed and approved by EPA as part of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. Consequently, the abolishment
of MWRC and change in role for MNRC did not revise the public participation provisions of Michigan's Section 404 wetlands
program. 

There were a number of comments regarding perceived changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program that have
occurred since it was first approved by EPA in 1984, but which were not related in any way to Executive Order 1991-31.
For example, commenters suggested that Michigan agencies and courts have interpreted the ``feasible and prudent
alternatives'' test under Michigan law in a manner inconsistent with the Clean Water Act Section 404(b)(1) guidelines.


As was stated in the April 21, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice, EPA's review in this matter is limited to a review of the revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program
that have resulted from Executive Order 1991-31. A number of commenters stated that EPA cannot so limit its review.
These commenters pointed to 40 CFR 233.1(b) which provides that ``[p]artial State programs are not approvable under
section 404.'' EPA does not agree that 40 CFR 233.1(b) is applicable here.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941125-2-00069 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The prohibition on approval of ``[p]artial State programs'' at 40 CFR 233.1(b) comes into play at the time when a state
is initially seeking federal approval of its Section 404 wetlands program. At that time, there is no Section 404 wetlands
program in the state. If the state fails to address all of the Section 404 requirements, 40 CFR 233.1(b) would prohibit
EPA from approving the program. The present matter involves review of possible revisions to Michigan's already approved
Section 404 wetlands program. 


40 CFR 233.16 contains the requirements pertaining to program revisions. 40 CFR 233.16(a) requires that a State keep
EPA informed of changes in the State's statutory or regulatory authority or other modifications which are significant
to administration of the State's authorized program. Under 40 CFR 233.16(e), EPA may request and a State must provide
documents or information whenever EPA believes that circumstances have changed with respect to the State's program.
Finally, whenever EPA or a State finds that the State program is in need of revision, EPA must review and approve or disapprove
of such revision. 40 CFR 233.16(d). 


In the present matter, EPA requested that Michigan submit information to EPA pursuant to 40 CFR 233.16 on whether any
revisions occurred in Michigan's federally approved Section 404 wetlands program as a result of Executive Order
1991-31. EPA has not requested information pertaining to any other issues regarding Michigan's Section 404
wetlands program. EPA is therefore limiting its review to the effects of Executive Order 1991-31. 


EPA appreciates the comments received on these matters, has forwarded them to Michigan and will consider them in the
context of EPA's ongoing oversight of Michigan's wetlands program. If, in the course of its ongoing oversight, EPA
determines that a program revision has occurred in any of the ways described in the comments, EPA will take the appropriate
steps as set forth at 40 CFR 233.16 to review and approve or disapprove of the revisions. 


There was one other comment, in addition to the comment pertaining to the feasible and prudent alternatives test,
which suggested that Michigan's wetland program failed to comply with the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations.
This comment was that Executive Order 1991-31 has ``substantially changed the criteria and burden of proof
by which the permitting agency routinely reviews or decides upon permits, thereby allowing agency action to take
place without assurance of minimum-floor compliance with the Section 404(b) guidelines as required by 40 CFR 233,
part 50.'' According to the commenter, ``[t]he Michigan Department of Natural Resources's (``MDNR'') flow-chart
for decision making * * * allows an agency to apply overly vague and broad evidentiary tests to routine
agency decisions when considering issuance of wetland permits.'' 

EPA does not agree that Executive Order 1991-31 has caused the changes suggested by the commenter. There is no
indication in any of the materials submitted by Michigan regarding any changes in criteria or burden of proof for decisionmaking.
EPA is not aware of any MDNR ``flow-chart'' that addresses wetland issues. The sole flow-charts in the documents submitted
by Michigan to EPA are flow charts contained in a December 13, 1991 Draft Plan for the Implementation of Executive Order
1991-31. Those flow-charts specifically pertain to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permits and permits to construct air emission sources. The December 13, 1991 Draft Plan also specifically states
that the wetland permitting process remains unchanged by Executive Order 1991-31. 

The United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service provided comments noting that it agreed with
EPA that Executive Order 1991-31 did not effect any substantial revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetland
program. The Fish and Wildlife Service also noted that there are a number of federally listed threatened and endangered
species present in Michigan and that, if EPA determines that EPA's approval or disapproval of the revisions in Michigan's
Section 404 wetlands program may affect these species, EPA would be required under Section 7(a) of the Endangered
Species Act to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service. 

As described above, Executive Order 1991-31 has not caused any substantive changes in Michigan's Section 404
wetlands program. Instead, the only effects that Executive Order 1991-31 have had on Michigan's Section 404
wetlands program have been to reorganize the MDNR and transfer certain authorities and duties of the MWRC to MDNR.
EPA therefore has determined that its approval of these revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program will
not affect endangered species. 

A number of commenters noted that, pursuant to 40 CFR  233.16(c), a state may not transfer all or part of its Section
404 program ``from the approved State agency to any other State agency'' until the new agency is approved by EPA. These
commenters claimed that Executive Order 1991-31 effectively abolished the ``old'' MDNR and created a ``new''
MDNR. These commenters suggested that this transfer of authority from the ``old'' MDNR to the ``new'' MDNR constituted
a transfer of authority from an ``approved Agency to any other State agency.''

EPA has determined that the revisions to Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program resulting from Executive Order
1991-31 are consistent with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations. Consequently,
MDNR is authorized to administer Michigan's Section 404 wetland program. The question of whether MDNR remained the
same agency or whether it became ``any other State agency'' as a result of Executive Order 1991-31, and therefore
whether it was authorized to administer Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program, is not at issue here. Nevertheless,
due to the significant number of comments on this issue, EPA believes it is appropriate to address this question here.


EPA recognizes that the Michigan Supreme Court has made clear that Executive Order 1991-31 created a ``new''
MDNR. 

Dodak

 v. 

Engler

, 443 Mich. 560 (1993). However, the Michigan Attorney General, in a letter dated November 8, 1993, has stated that
the Executive Order did not create a new agency. In either event, the question of whether MDNR is a ``new'' agency under
state law is not controlling with respect to whether there has been a transfer of authority from an ``approved Agency
to any other State agency.'' Instead, it is EPA's regulations which are controlling on this issue. 
EPA's regulations at 40 CFR 233.16(c) do not provide clear guidance on whether the reorganization and consolidation
of environmental programs accomplished by Executive Order 1991-31 constitutes a ``transfer'' of authority
requiring prior EPA approval. The preamble to the 1988 state wetland program regulations similarly fails to provide
any such guidance. See 53 FR 20764 (June 6, 1988). However, the 1980 preamble to the final National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (``NPDES'') state program rule, in addressing language at 40 CFR 123.62(c) which is similar to
that at 40 CFR 233.16(c), stated:

 


It was not the intent of the proposal nor is it of these final regulations to require EPA review in such cases [``nominal
changes'' in state agencies]. Only when controlling Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified
or supplemented, or when the State proposes to transfer all or part of a program from an approved State agency to another
State agency may EPA approval be necessary. Changes solely to the internal structure of an approved State agency,
with no changes in the overall authority of the agency, do not require EPA approval.

 


45 FR 33290, 33384 (May 19, 1980). 

Consistent with the above preamble language, EPA interprets the language of 40 CFR 233.16(c) as not applying to a mere
restructuring or internal consolidation of environmental programs within a state's executive branch. Instead,
the prior EPA approval requirement in 40 CFR 233.16(c) applies in situations where such restructuring or consolidation
impacts the controlling authorities by which a state implements the Section 404 wetland program. 

As described above, MDNR has been the approved State agency for implementation of Michigan's Section 404 wetland
program both before and after the Executive Order. MDNR's authority and responsibilities under State law pertaining
to wetland matters were not affected by Executive Order 1991-31. Consequently, there have been no changes of
any significance to the function or structure of the portions of MDNR that has been approved to implement Michigan's
Section 404 wetland program. Therefore, EPA does not agree with the commenters that Executive Order 1991-31
constituted a transfer of authority from an ``approved Agency to any other State agency.'' 

Finally, a number of commenters requested that EPA provide a public hearing on this matter. Pursuant to 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3),
EPA is required to provide an opportunity for a public hearing whenever a proposed revision is substantial. 40 CFR
233.16(d)(3) provides that ``substantial revisions include, but are not limited to, revisions that affect the area
of jurisdiction, scope of activities regulated, criteria for review of permits, public participation, or enforcement
capability.'' 

EPA has determined that Executive Order 1991-31, in reorganizing MDNR and transferring responsibilities
for assuring interstate, intrastate and federal-state coordination on wetland matters from MWRC to MDNR, has not
affected a substantial change in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program. EPA notes that these changes have not affected
any of the items listed in 40 CFR 233.16(d)(3). Moreover, EPA has found that the comments sufficiently addressed any
issues relevant to the effects of Executive Order 1991-31 and therefore has determined that a public hearing
would not be useful to aid in this review. EPA, therefore, is not providing an opportunity for a public hearing. 



III. EPA's Final Determination 



EPA, after review and consideration of all the information submitted by Michigan and the comments received, has determined
that the revisions to Michigan's wetland program effected by Executive Order 1991-31 comply with the Clean
Water Act and its implementing regulations. Moreover, EPA has determined that the revisions were not substantial.

<DOCTITLE>North Dakota; Adequacy Determination of the State's Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (Region VIII).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of tentative determination on application of the State of North Dakota for full program adequacy determination,
public comment period, and public hearing.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs
for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of
proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will allow both States and Tribes to apply for and receive
approval of a partial permit program. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs
as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to
promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements.
In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes
that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between
the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators
located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258
to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval
status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal Criteria will apply to all permitted and
unpermitted MSWLFs.


The State of North Dakota applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed North Dakota's
MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of the State's MSWLF permit program are adequate
to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. The State has revised the remainder of its permit program to
assure complete compliance with the revised Federal Criteria and gain full program approval. North Dakota's application
for full program adequacy is available for public review and comment. 
Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express
interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the
date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given in the 

DATES

 section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing. In
addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 section.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background 


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria. Subtitle D also requires that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal
solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill
this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule
(STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.

EPA intends to approve portions of State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets
the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval
to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority
to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe
also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. 


B. State of North Dakota 


On June 25, 1993, North Dakota submitted an application for partial program adequacy determination for the State's
MSWLF permit program. On October 5, 1993, EPA published a final determination of partial adequacy for North Dakota's
program. Further background on the final partial program determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 51821 (October
5, 1993). 
EPA approved the following portions of the State's MSWLF permit program: 
1. Location restrictions for airport safety (40 CFR 258.10 (a), (c), and (d)), flood plains (40 CFR 258.11), wetlands
(40 CFR 258.12), fault areas (40 CFR 258.13), seismic impact zones (40 CFR 258.14), and unstable areas (40 258.15).

2. Operating criteria for cover material (40 CFR 258.21), disease vector control (40 CFR 258.22), explosive gases
control (40 CFR 258.23(a)), air criteria (40 CFR 258.24), access requirements (40 CFR 258.25), run-on-run-off control
systems (40 CFR 258.26), surface water (40 CFR 258.27), and liquids restrictions (40 CFR 258.28). 
3. Design Criteria requirement for composite liners (40 CFR 258.40(b)). 
4. Ground-water monitoring for applicability and duration of monitoring (40 CFR 258.50 (a) and (e)); ground-water
monitoring systems including casing, number, depth, and spacing of wells (40 CFR 258.51 (c) and (d)); and ground-water
sampling and analysis including documentation procedures, frequency, and ground-water elevation measurements
(40 CFR 258.53 (a), (c), and (d)). 
5. Closure and post-closure care requirements including final cover design (40 CFR 258.60 (a) and (b)), final cover
description (40 CFR 258.60(c)(1)), waste inventory and schedule (40 CFR 258.60(c) (3) and (4)), beginning and completion
of closure (40 CFR 258.60 (f) through (j), post-closure care period (40 CFR 258.61 (a) and (b)), and post-closure plan

6. Financial assurance requirements including applicability (40 CFR 258.70) and allowable mechanisms (40 CFR 258.74).

EPA did not approve the following portions of the State's MSWLF permit program: 
1. North Dakota will revise its regulation and add a ``FAA notification'' requirement to comply with Part 258.10(b)
(airport safety). 
2. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal operating requirements for the exclusion
of hazardous waste (40 CFR 258.20), explosive gases control including monitoring and detection/remediation (40
CFR 258.23 (b) and (c)), and recordkeeping (40 CFR 258.29).

3. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal design criteria relative to protection of
ground-water (40 CFR 258.40 (a), (c), and (d)). 
4. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal ground-water monitoring requirements, including
no-migration demonstrations, scheduling, and alternative schedules (40 CFR 258.50(b) through 258.50(d)); number,
depth, and location of wells, and the use of multiunit ground-water systems (40 CFR 258.51 (a) and (b)); ground-water
sampling analytical methods (40 CFR 258.53(b)); background and statistical procedures (40 CFR 258.53 (e) through
(i)); detection monitoring (40 CFR 258.54); assessment monitoring (40 CFR 258.55); assessment of corrective measures
(40 CFR 258.56); selection of remedy (40 CFR 258.57); and, implementation of the corrective action program (40 CFR
258.58). 
5. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal closure and post-closure care requirements,
specifically final cover estimate (40 CFR 258.60(c)(2)); State notifications (40 CFR 258.60 (d) and (e)); post-closure
contact (40 CFR 258.61(c)(2)); and State notifications (40 CFR 258.61 (d) and (e)). 
6. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate financial assurance requirements for closure, post-closure,
and corrective action (40 CFR 258.71 through 258.73). 
On August 25, 1994, the State of North Dakota submitted an application for full program adequacy determination. EPA
reviewed North Dakota's application and tentatively determined that all portion of the State's Subtitle D program
will ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. 

Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve a State/Tribe's MSWLF program,
the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express
interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact within 30 days of the date of publication
of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on January 12, 1995 at the North Dakota Department of Health Environmental
Training Center, 2639 East Main Avenue, Bismarck, North Dakota 58501 at 10:00 a.m. 
At a meeting planned for late December 1994, the North Dakota State Health Council is expected to approve changes concerning
proposed amendments to the North Dakota Administrative Code, Article 33-20, Solid Waste Management and Land
Protection rules. 
At another meeting planned for mid-April 1995, the North Dakota State Health Council is expected to approve changes
concerning proposed amendments to the North Dakota Administrative Code, Article 33-16, Standards for Quality
of Ground-water Rules. 
If the State takes the necessary actions to bring the ground-water protection (design), ground-water monitoring,
and corrective action portions of their rules into full compliance with Federal Criteria, EPA is proposing full program
approval for the State of North Dakota. If the State of North Dakota does not take the above actions, EPA will not approve
their ground-water protection, ground-water monitoring, and corrective action requirements, and a partial program
approval will be issued. 
North Dakota has not asserted jurisdiction over ``Indian Country'' in its application for adequacy determination.
Accordingly, this approval does not extend to lands within ``Indian Country'' in North Dakota. Until EPA approves
a State or Tribal MSWLF permitting program in North Dakota for any part of ``Indian Country,'' as defined in 18 U.S.C.
1151, the requirements of 40 CFR part 258 will, after October 9, 1993, automatically apply to that area. Thereafter,
the requirements of 40 CFR part 258 will apply to all owners/operators of MSWLFs located in any part of ``Indian Country''
that is not covered by an approved State or Tribal MSWLF permitting program. 
EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and
during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy
for North Dakota's program. EPA will make a final decision on whether or not to approve North Dakota's program and will
give notice of it in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF Criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF Criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 


Compliance With Executive Order 12866 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 


Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this tentative approval will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This
proposed notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

 



Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005, and 4010 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended;
42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, and 6949(a).

<DOCTITLE>42 U.S.C. Section 122(g); Proposed Settlement of Administrative Order By Consent</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed 

De Minimis

 Settlement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

U.S. EPA is proposing to settle a claim under Section 122 of CERCLA with 

de minimis

 potentially responsible parties for costs that have been incurred during removal activities at the Great Lakes Asphalt
Facility in Boone County, Indiana. One hundred and eighty-three (183) Respondents have agreed to pay a total of $601,355.86.
The money will be used to reimburse the U.S. EPA for costs incurred during U.S. EPA's removal actions at the Facility.
In addition, the Respondents pay to the State of Indiana $40,761.14 and $40,000 for natural resource damages. This
action is being taken to settle all liability related to the Great Lakes Asphalt Facility with the Respondents pursuant
to the intent of Section 122(g) of CERCLA, as amended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Great Lakes Asphalt Facility, was originally an asphalt production facility. In 1979 and 1982, the use of several
tanks on the Facility were leased to the operators of the Enviro-Chem Site for the storage of ``synthetic fuel''. On
May 10, 1989, the Emergency Response Branch of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management was notified of
a release at the Facility. The release flowed north to contaminate the soil, a drainage system, a waterway and entered
Eagle Creek. U.S. EPA was notified on the day of the release and conducted cleanup activities at the facility. Removal
activities were completed by the U.S. EPA's Emergency and Enforcement Response Branch in the summer of 1990.



The Respondents are the alleged generators of the hazardous substances that were transshipped from the Enviro-Chem
Site to the Great Lakes Asphalt Facility. Each Respondent's share of the waste delivered to the facility is believed
not to exceed 1.0 percent of the total waste delivered at the facility.

A 30-day period, beginning on the date of publication, is open pursuant to Section 122(i) of CERCLA for comments on
the proposed settlement. Comments should be sent to the Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Region V, 77 West Jackson Street, Chicago, Illinois 60604-3590.

<DOCTITLE>The Bank of Montreal; Application To Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


The Bank of Montreal, Toronto, Canada, has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12
U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to retain its interest
in Burns Fry and Timmins Holdings Inc., Chicago, Illinois (Burns Fry), and, subsequent to the merger of the operating
subsidiaries of Burns Fry into Applicant's section 20 subsidiary, Harris Nesbitt Thomson Securities Inc., New York,
New York (Harris Nesbitt), to continue to engage indirectly through Harris Nesbitt in the following activities:
(1) providing investment and financial advice, including financial advice to Canadian federal, provincial, and
municipal governments; (2) providing securities brokerage service on a discount and full-service basis; (3) underwriting
and dealing in all types of bank-eligible securities; (4) acting as agent for issuers in the private placement of all
types of securities; (5) appraising real estate and tangible and intangible personal property, including securities;
and (6) arranging commercial real estate equity financing. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities on a nationwide
basis. 
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, without Board approval, engage in any activity
that the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined by order or regulation to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. 
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally provide services that are so operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity as to equip
them particularly well to engage in the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally
related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). 
Applicant states that the Board previously has determined by regulation that some of the proposed activities, when
conducted within limitations established by the Board, are closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8)
of the BHC Act. 

See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4) (providing investment and financial advice, including financial advice to Canadian federal,
provincial, and municipal governments); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(15) (providing securities brokerage service on a discount
and full-service basis); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16) (underwriting and dealing in bank-eligible securities); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(13)
(appraising real estate and tangible and intangible personal property, including securities); and 225.25(b)(14)
(arranging commercial real estate equity financing). 
Applicant also states that the Board has determined by order that the remaining proposed activity, when conducted
within limitations established by the Board in previous orders, is closely related to banking. 

See J.P. Morgan & Company Incorporated

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 26 (1990), and 

Bankers Trust New York Corporation

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 829 (1989) (acting as agent for issuers in the private placement of securities). In addition,
Applicant maintains that Harris Nesbitt may provide execution-only services solely to a single affiliate, Nesbitt
Burns Inc., Toronto, Canada, for the purchase and sale of certain exchange-traded futures contracts and options
on futures contracts, pursuant to section 4(c)(1)(C) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(1)(C)). 
Applicant maintains that it would conduct these previously approved activities in conformance with the conditions
and limitations established by the Board in prior cases. For this reason, Applicant contends that approval of the
application would not be barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), which prohibits the affiliation
of a state member bank with any company principally engaged in the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities.

In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities ``can reasonably be expected
to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that
outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Applicant states that the proposal
will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicant maintains that
the proposal will enhance competition and enable it to offer its customers a broader range of services. In addition,
Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of
resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. 
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act. 
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than December 12, 1994. Any request for a hearing on
this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. 
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

<DOCTITLE>Signet Banking Corporation, Richmond, VA; Application To Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


Signet Banking Corporation, Richmond, Virginia (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank
Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)),
through Signet Strategic Capital Corporation, Richmond, Virginia (Company), to engage 

de novo

 in providing investment advisory services with respect to futures and options on futures on nonfinancial commodities.
Applicant would engage in these activities on a worldwide basis. 
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. 
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). 
Applicant maintains that the Board previously has determined by order that providing investment advisory services
with respect to futures and options on futures on nonfinancial commodities is closely related to banking. 

See Swiss Bank Corporation

, 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 126 (1991); 

J.P. Morgan & Co., Incorporated

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994). Applicant states that Company only would provide advisory services with
respect to previously approved contracts. Applicant also states that Company would provide investment advisory
services in accordance with the limitations of   225.25(b)(19)(i) & (ii) of Regulation Y. 
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company
``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). Applicant
believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular,
Applicant maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Applicant to offer its customers a broader
range of products. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects
such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound
banking practices. 
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act. 
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than December 9, 1994. Any request for
a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)),
be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying
specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,
and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. 
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

<DOCTITLE>Revision of Fees for Sanitation Inspections of Cruise Ships </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Service, HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces revised fees for vessel sanitation inspections effective January 1, 1995. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Purpose and Background: 


The fee schedule for sanitation inspections of passenger cruise ships currently inspected under the Vessel Sanitation
Program (VSP) was first published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45019), and CDC began collecting fees on March 1, 1988. Since then, CDC has revised the fee
schedule annually. This notice announces fees effective January 1, 1995. 
The formula used to determine the fees is as follows: 












Average cost per inspection = Total Cost of VSP Weighted No. of Annual Inspections 
The average cost per inspection is multiplied by a size/cost factor to determine the fee for vessels in each size category.
The size/cost factor was established in the proposed fee schedule published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 17, 1987 (52 FR 27060), and revised in a schedule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 28, 1989 (54 FR 48942). The revised cost/factor is presented below in Appendix A. 


Fees 


The fee schedule is presented in Appendix A and will be effective January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995. However,
should there be a substantial increase in the cost of air transportation, it may be necessary to re-adjust the fees
prior to December 31, 1995, since travel constitutes a sizable portion of the costs of this program. If such a re-adjustment
in the fee schedule is necessary, a notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 30 days prior to the effective date. 


Applicability 


The fees will be applicable to all passenger cruise vessels for which sanitation inspections are conducted as part
of the Vessel Sanitation Program, CDC. 



Dated: November 17, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Agreement on Social Security Between the United States and Greece; Entry Into Force </DOCTITLE>



The Commissioner of Social Security gives notice that an agreement coordinating the United States (U.S.) and Greek
social security systems is effective beginning September 1, 1994. The agreement with Greece, which was signed on
June 22, 1993, is similar to U.S. social security agreements already in force with sixteen other countries_Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Agreements of this type are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security
Act. 

Like the other agreements, the U.S.-Greek agreement eliminates dual social security coverage_the situation that
occurs when a person from one country works in the other country and is required, along with his employer, to pay social
security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Under the U.S.-Greek agreement, a worker who is sent by an employer
in the United States to work in Greece for 5 years or less remains covered only by the U.S. system. The agreement includes
additional rules that eliminate dual U.S. and Greek coverage in other work situations. 

The agreement also helps eliminate situations where workers suffer a loss of benefit rights because they have divided
their careers between the two countries. Under the agreement, workers may qualify for partial U.S. or Greek benefits
based on combined (totalized) work credits from both countries. 
Individuals who wish to obtain copies of the agreement or want more information about its provisions may write to the
Social Security Administration, Office of International Policy, Post Office Box 17741, Baltimore, Maryland 21235.

Announcement of Funding Awards for 
Fair Housing Initiatives Program_Fiscal Year 1993 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement of Funding Awards.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, this
document notifies the public of FY 1993 funding awards made under the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP). The
purpose of this document is to announce the names and addresses of the award winners and the amount of the awards to be
used to strengthen the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and to further fair housing.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601-19 (The Fair Housing Act), charges the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development with responsibility to accept and investigate complaints alleging discrimination
based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin in the sale, rental, or financing
of most housing. In addition, the Fair Housing Act directs the Secretary to coordinate with State and local agencies
administering fair housing laws and to cooperate with and render technical assistance to public or private entities
carrying out programs to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing practices. 


Section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. 3616 note, established the FHIP to strengthen
the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and to further fair housing. This program assists projects and
activities designed to enhance compliance with the Fair Housing Act and substantially equivalent State and local
fair housing laws. Implementing regulations are found at 24 CFR Part 125. 
The FHIP has four funding categories: the Administrative Enforcement Initiative, the Education and Outreach Initiative,
the Private Enforcement Initiative, and the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative.

In a NOFA published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 68000), the Department announced the availability of $8.8 million in funds for FHIP. On
February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9235), HUD published a notice that made an additional $800,000 available, for a total of $9.6
million in FY 1993 funding. To ensure that sufficient time was available for full consideration to be given to applications
under the FY 1993 FHIP Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Reinvention Lab Project NOFA (June 16, 1994, 59 FR 31072),
the Department replaced the $1 million of FY 1993 Education and Outreach Initiative funds made available under that
NOFA with $1 million in FY 1994 Education and Outreach Initiative funds in a notice published on August 9, 1994 (59 FR
40599). The $1 million in FY 1993 Education and Outreach Initiative funds from the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing
Reinvention Lab Project NOFA were instead made available to fund additional eligible Education and Outreach Initiative
applicants under the FY 1993 FHIP NOFA, and to complete the funding of grantees under that NOFA who were only partially
funded. 
A notice published on July 14, 1994 (59 FR 35942) listed the bulk of the awards made under FY 1993 FHIP NOFA. This notice
announces the additional FY 1993 FHIP NOFA Education and Outreach Initiative applicants funded as a result of the
August 9, 1994 notice. In accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989), the Department is 
publishing details concerning the recipients of funding awards, as follows below.

Federal Property Suitable as Facilities To Assist the Homeless


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless v. Veterans Administration, 

No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).




Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD:
(1) Its intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless;
(2) Its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs; or
(3) A statement of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to
assist the homeless.
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to July Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available, or suitable/unavailable.
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to William
Molster at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.
For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e., 

acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: Dept. of Interior: Lola D. Knight, Property Management Specialist,

On May 10, 1994, the Department published a notice of funding availability (NOFA) that announced the availability

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background



On May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24255), the Department published a notice of funding availability (NOFA) that announced the
availability of approximately $545 million for applications for assistance designed to help communities move toward
continuum of care systems to assist homeless persons. The funds under the May 10, 1994 NOFA were made available under
three programs: (1) Supportive Housing; (2) Shelter Plus Care; and (3) Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for Single
Room Occupancy Dwellings for Homeless Individuals (Section 8 SRO program).

The May 10, 1994 NOFA provided for applications under the Shelter Plus Care and Section 8 SRO programs to be submitted
to Room 7262 at HUD Headquarters by 6:00 pm Eastern Time on July 5, 1994, and under the Supportive Housing Program to
be submitted to Room 7262 at HUD Headquarters by 6:00 pm Eastern Time on August 5, 1994.

The purpose of this notice is to clarify that HUD will review all applications that arrived at HUD Headquarters by 6:00
pm Eastern Time on the application due date (and not only those that arrived at Room 7262 by this time on the application
due date). Confirmation that the application arrived at HUD Headquarters by 6:00 pm application due date will be based
on the ``visitor sign-in sheets'' at the HUD security guard desks (these sign-in sheets are also applicable to persons
working for delivery and messenger services).

Privacy Act of 1974; Proposed Amendment to a System of Records



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of a proposed amendment to an existing system of records.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposes to amend its system of records entitled ``Accounting
Records, HUD/DEPT-2'' in its inventory of systems of records notices subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C.
552a), as amended. Notice of this system was last published at 55 FR 17676, April 26, 1990.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

HUD/DEPT-2 contains a variety of records relating to HUD's accounting functions. These records are maintained
for the purpose of supporting HUD's administrative management and collection of delinquent debts, including past
due loan payments, overpayments, fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real property, that
are owed to HUD or to other Federal agencies. Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, notice
is given that HUD proposes to add a new routine use disclosure to this system of records. Specifically, the Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC) will be added as a routine use disclosure. RTC will use the records obtained from this system
of records to prescreen potential contractors for bad debts prior to acquiring their services.




The amended portion of the system notice is set forth below. Previously, the system and a prefatory statement containing
the general routine uses applicable to all HUD systems of records was published in the ``Federal Register Privacy
Act Issuances, 1989 Compilation, Volume I.''

Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (4) and (11) provide that the public be afforded a 30-day period in which to comment on the new
record system.

The system report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), has been submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of
the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), pursuant to paragraph 4c of Appendix I to OMB Circular A-130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals'' dated June 25, 1993 (58 FR 36075, July 2, 1993).






Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 552a; 88 Stat. 1896; sec 7(d), Department of HUD Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).

Section 29, Lots 8, 9, 16, 18, 19, 23, and 25 Section 31, and Lots 2, 3, and 4 Section 32, T. 18 N., R. 18 E., P.M.M., Fergus
County, Montana. The private land is legally described as MS 6366, MS 6727, MS 6728, MS 8470, MS 8471, MS 8472, MS 8473,
and MS 8474, T. 18 N., R. 18 E., P.M.M., Fergus County, Montana. 



Disposal of the Federal lands was not analyzed in the Judith-Valley-Phillips Resource Management Plan (RMP) and
associated Environmental Impact Statement. Disposal of Federal land requires that the specific tract be identified
in the land use plan with the criteria to be met for exchange and discussion of how the criteria have been satisfied.
This will be part of the plan amendment and environmental assessment. The Judith Resource Area, Lewistown District,
Bureau of Land Management will prepare an environmental assessment to analyze the effects of disposal.

 


PUBLIC PARTICIPATION: 

Comments and recommendations on this notice to amend the Judith-Valley-Phillips RMP should be received on or before
30 days from the date of this notice.

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Stallworth Preserve Owners Association (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife
Service (Service), pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, (Act) as amended. The permit
would authorize the take of the endangered Choctawhatchee beach mouse 

Peromyscus poliontus allophrys,

 in Walton County, Florida for a period of 10 years. The proposed taking is incidental to a planned residential development
on an 7 acre tract of land owned by the Applicant. The tract is located just southwest of County Road 30A in south Walton
County. The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation
plan (HCP) for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional
Office address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that
issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
The Findings of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination
will be made no sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of
the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Choctawhatchee Beach Mouse (CBM), 

Peromyscus polionotus allophrys,

 is a subspecies of the common old field mouse 

Peromyscus polionotus

 and is restricted to the dune systems of the Gulf Coast of Florida. The known current range of CBM extends from Choctawhatchee
Bay to St. Andrew Bay. The sand dune systems inhabited by this species are not uniform; several habitat types are distinguishable.
The depth of the habitat from the beach inland varies depending on the configuration of the sand dune system and the
vegetation. Generally, these habitat zones are considered as primary dune (dunes immediately fronting the beach)
supporting sea oats and other widely scattered grasses, and interdune area consisting of other grasses, and sedges,
and a secondary dune zone supporting small trees and shrubs. The Applicant proposes to construct a planned unit development
on approximately 7 acres, a portion of which is CBM habitat. A portion of the Applicant's property is within 152.5 meters
(500 feet) inland from the mean high tide line of the Gulf of Mexico, designated critical habitat of the CBM (See 

Code of Federal Regulations

 Title 50,  17.95(a)). Initial construction of roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual
homesites may result in death of or injury to CBM incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities.
Habitat alternation associated with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and
nesting habitat.





The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
no action, or public purchase of the subject property.

Notice of public hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice sets forth the schedule and requirements for participation in an annual public hearing to be conducted
by the Board of Directors of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) on Department 19, 1994. This hearing
is required by the OPIC Amendments Act of 1985, and this notice is being published to facilitate public participation.
The notice also describes OPIC and the subject matter of the hearing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OPIC is a U.S. Government agency which provides, on a commercial basis, political risk insurance and financing in
friendly developing countries and emerging democracies for projects which confer positive developmental benefits
upon the project country while avoiding negative effects on the U.S. economy and the environment of the project country.
OPIC's Board of Directors is required by section 231A(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended ``the Act'')
to hold at lest one public hearing each year.

Among other issues, OPIC's annual public hearing has, in previous years, provided a forum for testimony concerning
section 231A(a) of the Act. This section provides that OPIC may operate its programs only in those countries that are
determined to be ``taking steps to adopt and implement laws that extend internationally recognized worker rights
to workers in that country (including any designated zone in that country).'' 

Based on consultations with Congress, OPIC complies with annual determinations made by the Executive Branch with
respect to worker rights for countries that are eligible for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Any country
for which GSP eligibility is revoked on account of its failure to take steps to adopt and implement internationally
recognized worker rights is subject concurrently to the suspension of OPIC programs until such time as a favorable
worker rights determination can be made. 

For non-GSP countries in which OPIC operates its programs, OPIC has agreed to provide a worker rights report to the
Congress for any country which is the subject of a formal challenge at its annual public hearing. To qualify as a formal
challenge, testimony must pertain directly to the worker rights requirements of the law as defined in OPIC's 1985
reauthorizing legislation (Pub. L. 99-204) with reference to the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and be supported
by factual information.

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has issued a general exclusion order in the above-captioned
investigation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 1337), and in section 210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.58).




Farallon Computing, Inc. (``Farallon'') filed a complaint on October 12, 1993, pursuant to section 337 of the Tariff
Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) alleging that 16 respondents had violated section 337 in the importation into the United
States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain devices for connecting
computers via telephone lines. Those 16 respondents were: (1) ABL Electronics Corp. (``ABL''), (2) Caltechnology
International Ltd. (``Caltechnology''), (3) CPU Products (``CPU''), (4) Enhance Cable Technology (``Enhance''),
(5) Focus Enhancements, Inc. (``Focus''), (6) Full Enterprises Corp. (``Full''), (7) Good Way Industrial Co., Ltd.
(``Good Way''), (8) MACProducts (USA) (now known as DGR Technologies, Inc.) (``DGR''), (9) MicroComputer Cable
Co., Inc. (``MCC''), (10) Ming Technology Corp. (``Ming''), (11) Pan International (USA) (``Pan''), (12) Shiunn
Yang Enterprises Co., Ltd. (``Shiunn Yang''), (13) Taiwan Techtron Corp. (``Techtron''), (14) Technology Works,
Inc. (``TechWorks''), (15) Total Technologies, Ltd. (``Total''), and (16) Tremon Enterprises Co., Ltd. (``Tremon'').
Complainant Farallon alleged infringement of certain claims of U.S. Letters Patent 5,003,579, which it owns. The
Commission published a notice of investigation in the 

Federal Register

 on November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60671). Two additional respondents were subsequently added to the investigation: Ji-Haw
Industrial Co., Ltd. (``Ji-Haw''), and Tri-Tech Instruments Co., Ltd. (``Tri-Tech''). See 59 FR 10164 (March 3,
1994). 
Of the 18 respondents named in this investigation, the Commission has approved terminations based on settlements
with respect to the following 16 respondents: ABL, Caltechnology, CPU, DGR, Enhance, Focus, Full, Good Way, Ji-Haw,
MCC, Ming, Pan, Shiunn Yang, Techtron, Total, and Tremon. Only respondents Tri-Tech and TechWorks have not settled
with complainant Farallon. 
On April 26, 1994, the ALJ granted Farallon's motion for a summary determination that a domestic industry exists in
accordance with subsections 337(a)(2) and (a)(3). The Commission published a notice of its decision not to review
that ID on May 24, 1994. See 59 FR 26811-12 (May 24, 1994). 

On April 28, 1994, Farallon filed a motion for summary determination of violation of section 337. The motion was unopposed
by any respondent and was supported by the Commission investigative attorney. On May 24, 1994, the presiding ALJ issued
an ID finding that there was a violation of section 337. The ALJ found that the '579 patent was valid and infringed, that
Tri-Tech imported the infringing product into the United States, and that after importation, TechWorks sold the
infringing product in the United States. No petitions for review of the ID or government agency comments were received
by the Commission. 

On June 28, 1994, the Commission determined not to review the ID, which thereby became the determination of the Commission.
The Commission also requested written submissions concerning the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding.


See

 59 FR 34862-63 (July 7, 1994) and 59 FR 48449 (Sept. 21, 1994). 

On November 17, 1994, the Commission made its determinations on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding.
The Commission determined that the appropriate form of relief is a general exclusion order prohibiting the entry
for consumption of infringing devices for connecting computers via telephone lines. Finally, the Commission determined
that the public interest factors enumerated in 19 U.S.C. 1337(d) do not preclude the issuance of the aforementioned
relief, and that the bond during the Presidential review period shall be in the amount of 346 percent of the entered
value of the infringing devices for connecting computers via telephone lines. 

Copies of the Commission order, the Commission opinion in support thereof, and all other nonconfidential documents
filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours
(8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington,
DC 20436, telephone 202-205-2000. Hearing-impaired persons are advised that information on the matter
can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on 202-205-1810.

Wisconsin Central Ltd._Exemption Acquisition and Operation_Certain Lines of Soo Line Railroad Company 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed modification of historic preservation condition and request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission proposes to remove a condition, imposed in 1987 in connection with a sale of rail lines, that prevents
the railroad from selling, destroying or modifying properties until completion of procedures under section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission is proposing to reopen this proceeding to remove a condition that was imposed seven years ago in this
rail line sale proceeding. The condition appears to be inconsistent with our current procedures and may no longer
be necessary. 



Wisconsin Central Ltd. (Wisconsin Central) purchased approximately 1,800 miles of rail line from Soo Line Railroad
Company (Soo) on October 11, 1987, pursuant to the class exemption for rail line sales, 49 CFR 1150.31 

et seq.

1

 We allowed the sale to proceed under the class exemption, but imposed an historic preservation condition. Because
this case was processed under the class exemption procedures, and we did not want to delay the public benefit of the
line sale in preserving rail service, we permitted the sale, but ordered the carrier not to take any steps that would
affect historic properties until after the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) process could be completed.






Section 106 of the NHPA, 16 U.S.C. 470f, requires that, when a federal agency approves a license, it must ``take into
account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or
eligible for inclusion in the National Register [of historic buildings and places].'' Under the NHPA, we consult
with the appropriate state historic preservation officer (SHPO) and, where appropriate, the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP) to identify historic properties, determine if they will be adversely affected, and
consider appropriate mitigation. 

The broad historic preservation condition we imposed in this case was worded as follows: 




The Commission will undertake a section 106 National Historic Preservation Act process in this matter. Pending completion
thereof, [Wisconsin Central] shall refrain from taking any action that may jeopardize the historic integrity of
sites and structures 50 years old or older. 




Because hundreds of properties were transferred, the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) attempted
to enter into some kind of ``programmatic agreement'' (36 CFR 800.13)

2

 or ``memorandum of agreement'' (36 CFR 800.5)

3

 with ACHP and the various SHPOs involved to facilitate the process by identifying the historic properties adversely
affected by the transfer, so that we could craft appropriate mitigation conditions for them. This effort has been
unsuccessful, however, and the process of determining appropriate historic preservation measures for each particular
property that Wisconsin Central has subsequently sought to sell or demolish has been inordinately slow, often taking
several years. 






We revised our historic preservation rules in 1991 so that now the historic preservation process is only required
in line sale cases where, at the time of the transfer, the applicant plans to dispose of or alter properties subject
to our jurisdiction that are 50 years or older.

4

 

Implementation of Environmental Laws

, 7 I.C.C.2d 807, 828 (1991). Our current rules do not require carriers to file an historic report, and historic preservation
conditions are not imposed, for rail line sales ``where further approval is required to abandon any service and there
are no plans to dispose of or alter properties subject to ICC jurisdiction that are 50 years old or older,'' 49 CFR 1105.8
(b)(1). Thus, under our new rules, if a condition were imposed in a line sale case such as this one, it would apply only
to properties subject to our jurisdiction (``used or useful'' in rail service, 

see

 49 CFR 1105.8) that the buyer has plans to dispose of or alter outside the context of a further abandonment or sale application.

5

 These rules have been applied in approximately 100 cases and have worked well in narrowing the focus of the historic
review process to rail properties that may actually be affected by a sale transaction.

In contrast, as noted previously, the broad condition imposed here has not worked well. Before Wisconsin Central
can dispose of any of the properties it obtained from Soo in 1987, it must complete the historic preservation process
for each particular property. This requirement usually results in a lengthy delay for each property. Moreover, as
things now stand, this situation would continue indefinitely; unless amended, the condition will continue to cover
all of Wisconsin Central's properties as long as it remains a railroad.

6

 





More than seven years have passed since Wisconsin Central acquired these properties. Accordingly, it seems to us
that from this point forward, Wisconsin Central's sale or demolition of properties should no longer be considered
to be the result of the original purchase from the Soo. Rather, because of the passage of time, these decisions more
appropriately should be considered the normal result of the carrier's continuing ownership and management of these
properties. It seems inappropriate to continue to impose a greater burden on Wisconsin Central than it would face
if its acquisition proceeding took place now. 

We may modify conditions we have imposed in our proceedings, and we preliminarily conclude that it is appropriate
to do so here. Accordingly, we are reopening this proceeding and proposing to modify the condition to require completion
of the historic review process only with regard to specific properties for which that process is already underway
or of which the carrier has informed SEA that it plans to dispose. The disposal of other properties would be presumed
to be outside the scope of the proceeding in which we authorized the rail line sale. 

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources. This proposal should not have any adverse impact on small entities. 




Decided: November 7, 1994. 




By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons, Morgan, and Owen. Vice
Chairman Phillips recused herself in this proceeding.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>





 Nasir Gore, T/A All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc.; Revocation of Registration



On August 31, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, then Director, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), directed an Order to Show Cause to Nasir Gore, T/A Family Pharmacy and All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc.
(Respondent), proposing to revoke the pharmacies' DEA Certificates of Registration, BF1426306 and BA2097562,
under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and to deny any pending applications under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged
that Family Pharmacy was not licensed in New Jersey, the state in which it is registered, and that the continued registration
of Respondent would be inconsistent with the public interest.

Respondent, by counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause. The matter was docketed
before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Newark, New
Jersey on April 12, 1994.

On July 19, 1994, Judge Tenney issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended ruling in which he recommended
that the registration of all Drugs Pharmacy, Inc., be revoked and any pending applications of Nasir Gore be denied.
No exceptions were filed and on August 19, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record of the proceedings
to the Deputy Administrator.

The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, enters his final
order in this matter, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.

The Administrative law judge found that detectives from the Kearny, New Jersey Police Department received information
from a confidential informant that Respondent was selling tablets of Ativan, a Schedule IV controlled substance,
to people off the street for one dollar per tablet. Subsequently, in September and October 1992, police officers conducted
three controlled purchases of Ativan at Family Pharmacy. Each time, Mr. Nasir Gore, owner and operating pharmacist,
provided a confidential informant with Ativan in exchange for cash. Mr. Gore testified at the proceeding that he had
given the informant ninety controlled substance tablets, but that the confidential informant had told him that he
had prescription which he would bring in later.

The administrative law judge found that on November 6, 1992, Nasir Gore entered into a Consent Order with the New Jersey
State Board of Pharmacy that he cease and desist from the practice of pharmacy in the State of New Jersey. On October
18, 1993, before the New Jersey Superior Court for Hudson County, Nasir Gore pled guilty to a single felony count of
distributing or dispensing controlled dangerous substances in violation of N.J. Revised Statute 2C:35-5A(1)
and 5b(3).

The administrative law judge also found that DEA conducted an accountability audit of Family Pharmacy based on records
seized by the Kearny Police Department. However, Judge Tenney found ``chain of custody'' problems with respect to
the records audited and determined that the evidence DEA provided was not persuasive to support allegations of inadequate
recordkeeping with respect to Ativan.

In October or November 1992, Family Pharmacy ceased operation as a Pharmacy. Therefore, the administrative law judge
found that the DEA registration of Family Pharmacy, BF1426306, terminated by operation of law prior to the initiation
of the proceeding. 21 CFR 1301.62.

The administrative law judge found that Nasir Gore was operating All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc. in November 1993, and that
he had been observed acting as the pharmacist-in-charge. Mr. Gore testified that he had sold the pharmacy to his brother-in-law,
Tariq Matin, on November 3, 1993, and he produced a copy of a contract and related documents. However, the pharmacy
was operating under a New York State pharmacy license issued to Mr. Gore, that indicated that Mr. Gore was the sole pharmacist
and owner of All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc. Judge Tenney found that there was not evidence of money or other consideration
exchanging hands, no evidence of inventory transfers, and no evidence that the DEA or the state was advised of the change
of ownership. In addition, Mr. Gore continued to work at the pharmacy and continued to write all checks for he pharmacy.
Judge Tenney concluded that there was no true sale. Mr. Gore also testified that the pharmacy had ceased operation
in March 1994 and that he had transferred all controlled substances for destruction. The administrative law judge
found no preponderating evidence to support a finding that the pharmacy is no longer in operation.

Under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4), and pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following
factors shall be considered:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''

It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,

 54 16422 (1989).

<DOCNO> FR941125-2-00141 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Of the stated factors, the administrative law judge found that factors (2), (3), (4), and (5) were relevant. As to factor
(2), Respondent admitted to dispensing Ativan without a prescription; as to factor (3) Mr. Gore was convicted under
New Jersey State law of a single felony of unlawfully distributing a controlled dangerous substance; as to factor
(4), Respondent dispensed controlled substances without a valid prescription in violation of the Federal Controlled
Substances Act and New Jersey State law; and as to factor (5), the administrative law judge found that Respondent's
conduct at Family Pharmacy in New Jersey, the action of the New Jersey State Board of Pharmacy taken against Mr. Gore,
and his subsequent conviction all were found to threaten the public health and safety.

The administrative law judge noted that Respondent's major defense was that he was no longer associated with All Drugs
Pharmacy, Inc. However, the administrative law judge determined that the evidence as a whole does not support that
the transfer was an arms-length transaction. Judge Tenney concluded that the continued registration of All Drugs
Pharmacy, Inc. would not be consistent with the public interest and that is registration should be revoked.

The Deputy Administrator adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling of the administrative
law judge in its entirety. Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's continued
registration would not be in the public interest.

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, BA2097562,
issued to All Drugs Pharmacy, Inc., be and it hereby is, revoked; and that any pending applications of Nasir Gore, be,
and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective December 27, 1994.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions





General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.



The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statues referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.



Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.



General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration

ACTION:

Ostrander Fixed Income Trust. 




RELEVANT ACT SECTION: 

Section 8(f). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant requests an order declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 



Applicant's Representation 



1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust, and its sole
portfolio series is Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund (the ``Fund''). On August 31, 1988, applicant registered
under the Act as an investment company, and applicant filed a registration statement to register its shares under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective on October 27, 1988, and the initial
public offering commenced on the same day. 

2. On February 5, 1990, the Fund's board of trustees adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the ``Plan'') for
the Fund. The Plan provided for (i) the sale of applicant's assets and subsequent distribution of the proceeds to its
shareholders; (ii) the payment of or provision for applicant's liabilities and obligations; (iii) the cessation
of applicant's business as an investment company under the Act; and (iv) applicant's dissolution. Applicant's shareholders
approved the Plan on March 30, 1990. 

3. On June 25, 1990, the Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund Shareholders' Liquidating Trust_Certificates (the ``Certificate
Reserve Trust'') was formed. The trustees of the Certificate Reserve Trust were Patricia Ostrander, Joseph L. Bower,
Richard E. Floor, Bernard J. Korman, Franco Modigliani, and Ernest E. Monrad. The Certificate Reserve Trust was formed
pursuant to the Plan, and its primary purpose was to hold assets transferred to it by the Fund on behalf of shareholders
of the Fund who, as of June 25, 1990, had neither surrendered their certificates representing shares in the Fund, nor
provided the Trustees with an indemnity bond, in the event of loss or destruction of a certificate. The Trust would
hold these assets until the shareholders furnished the certificates or an indemnity bond in accordance with the Plan.


4. On June 26, 1990, the Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund Shareholders' Liquidating Trust (the ``Liquidating Trust'')
was formed. The trustees were the same as those for the Certificate Reserve Trust. The Liquidating Trust was formed
pursuant to the Plan, and its purpose was to satisfy contingent liabilities of the Fund and the applicant, and the balance
would be distributed to shareholders. 

5. On or about June 29, 1990, the Fund distributed an aggregate of $1,811,899.29, representing substantially all
of its assets. The Fund distributed the money as follows: $724,645.42 to the Certificate Reserve Trust, $200,000
to the Liquidating Trust, and the remainder directly to the Fund's shareholders. 

6. On or prior to December 31, 1992, the Certificate Reserve Trust terminated upon the distribution to the last of the
shareholders who had missing certificates. 

7. In May 1993, Ms. Ostrander reimbursed $17,182 to the Liquidating Trust in connection with an agreement reached
with the SEC to reimburse monies to shareholders of the Fund who may have purchased shares of the Fund at incorrect prices.
Ms. Ostrander also made direct restitution to certain identified shareholders of the Fund in the amount of $21,103.
Applicant is not aware of any other amounts owed by Ms. Ostrander to applicant or the Fund. 

8. On May 26, 1993, applicant was named as a defendant in 

Continental Airlines, Inc. v. Ostrander High Income Reserve Fund, et. al,

 Civil Action No. 93-3164. Continental alleged that applicant had violated Massachusetts law in connection
with Continental's investments in the Fund. The parties settled the action pursuant to a release dated April 18, 1994.


9. All of the assets of the Liquidating Trust have been used to satisfy contingent liabilities of the Fund and the applicant
or distributed to or for the benefit of the Fund's shareholders. On August 5, 1994 the Liquidating Trust made a final
distribution of $70,462.17 to the Fund's shareholders.

Applicant has no remaining shareholders.

11. Neither applicant, the Liquidating Trust nor the Certificate Reserve Trust has any assets remaining. In addition,

12. Applicant will terminate its existence with Massachusetts authorities after receiving this order.

objectives and policies.

 In exchange for its assets, Applicant received and distributed to its shareholder 1,330,564,679 shares of the Portfolio,

Applicant's assets and the value of the assets and shares of the Portfolio were calculated as of the close of business
on the New York Stock Exchange on May 2, 1994. 





6. Northwestern Life paid all expenses incurred in connection with the Plan. These expenses totaled approximately
$407,185, and consisted primarily of printing and mailing costs and filing fees. No brokerage commissions were paid.


7. Applicant has retained no assets and has no security holders. Applicant does not have any debts or other liabilities
which remain outstanding and is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. 

8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries

<DOCTITLE></DOCTITLE>
Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change
To Adopt Functional Separation Procedures for Specialists and Affiliated Firms




November 16, 1994.




I. Introduction





On December 29, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt a set of procedures addressing specialist member organizations affiliated with an
upstairs firm. On May 25, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.










The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33751 (March 10, 1993),
59 FR 12631 (March 17, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal.




II. Description





The proposed rule change consists of Exchange guidelines that outline the minimum requirements that an Exchange
specialist firm affiliated with an upstairs firm
 will be expected to demonstrate to provide for a functional separation (``Information Barrier'')
 of its specialist activity from its retail and proprietary business.








In addition to requiring affiliated upstairs firms to establish a Information Barrier, the proposal also requires
that they establish, maintain and enforce written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material,
nonpublic information. Finally the proposal requires an affiliated upstairs firm to obtain prior written approval
of the Exchange that it has complied with the requirements to establish functional separation as appropriate to its
operation and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional
separation.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941125-2-00170 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-2-00117 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposal identifies certain minimum procedural and maintenance requirements. First the specialist's book
must be kept confidential. Second, the affiliated upstairs firm can have no influence on specific specialist trading
decisions. Third, material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the affiliated upstairs firm
from the issuer may not be made available to the specialist. Fourth, clearing and margin financing information regarding
the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing
operations of the affiliated upstairs firm and specialist entities. Fifth, the Exchange may from time to time request
that specialists file information and reports in a specialty security.

In addition, the proposal places limitations on the information which may pass between a broker associated with an
affiliated upstairs firm and the specialist, such that they are limited to that exchange of information which would
occur in the normal course of business with a comparable unaffiliated individual. Thus, the broker may make available
to the specialist only the market information he would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal
course of his trading and ``market probing'' activity. The specialist may divulge to the broker only the information
about market conditions in specialty stocks that he would make available in the normal course of his specialist duties
to any other broker, and in the same manner. The specialist, however, is further restricted in that he may provide market
information to the broker only upon request of that broker and not on his own initiative.

The proposal permits an affiliated upstairs firm to popularize
 a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the existence of possible conflicts of interest.





In addition, the proposal provides specific procedures that will apply if a specialist becomes privy to material
non-public information. In such a case, the specialist must promptly inform his firm's compliance officer, or other
designated official, of such communication and seek guidance from such officer or official as to what procedures
he should subsequently follow. Such officer or official must maintain appropriate records, including the action
taken and a summary of the information received by the specialist. If the specialist is required to give up the ``book,''
then such transfer must be done in a neutral fashion to ensure that the transfer itself does not disclose the information,
and the Exchange must be informed.






Finally, with respect to compliance, the Exchange will periodically examine the Information Barrier procedures
established hereunder and will conduct surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated upstairs firm
and its affiliated specialist or specialist firm. The Exchange will monitor specifically the trading activities
of affiliated upstairs firms and affiliated specialists in the specialist firm's specialty stock in order to monitor
the possible trading while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade
and comparison reports generated by the Exchange.



III. Discussion



The Commission recognizes that significant conflicts of interest can arise between an approved person and the affiliated
specialist unit which, if not addressed by appropriate Information Barrier procedures and the monitoring and surveillance
of the continuing adequacy of such procedures, could result in potential manipulative market activity and informational
advantages benefitting the affiliated upstairs firm, specialist unit, or the customers of either, all in contravention
of Section 6(b) of the Act.
 The Commission further believes that the procedures the Exchange intends to implement with respect to approving
and monitoring the Information Barrier address these concerns, and therefore are consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular,
the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange
be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and,
in general, to protect investors and the public, in that the procedures proposed by the PSE are designed to prevent
the misuse of material, non-public information by specialist units affiliated with an affiliated upstairs firm.
Further, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) Congressional finding
 in that it aids in assuring fair competition among brokers and dealers.






The Commission initially addressed the necessity and viability of Information Barriers in approving the amendments
to New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') Rules 98 and 193 respectively, which
created the present Information Barrier scheme in effect today on those exchanges.
 At that time, the Commission expressed its belief that it is also desirable for the regional exchanges to consider
requiring specialists affiliated with integrated firms to establish an adequate Information Barrier and generally
to review the efficacy of their surveillance and compliance procedures regarding those specialists. In this regard,
the Commission thus far has approved two filings submitted by regional exchanges to adopt such procedures.

Organizational separation between different departments of a broker-dealer is one of several means of preventing
the interdepartmental communication of material, non-public information.
 The NYSE/Amex Order noted that, for example, in view of the diverse functions performed by a multi-service firm and
the material, non-public information that may be obtained by any one department of the firm, the firm often may be required
to restrict access to information to the department receiving it, in order to avoid potential liability under Sections
10(b) and 14(e) of the Act
 and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder. Moreover, two years after approval of the Amex's and NYSE's Information
Barrier procedures, Congress enacted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''),
designed primarily to prevent, deter, and prosecute insider trading.
 Among other provisions, ITSFEA created a specific requirement for broker-dealers to maintain procedures designed
to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information.
 In response to the promulgation thereof, many firms redrafted their internal Information Barrier procedures to
ensure compliance.
 










The Commission notes that a number of firms with regional specialist operations have established Information Barrier
procedures between the specialist and its affiliated firm. Nevertheless, such procedures have not necessarily
been adopted by all specialist affiliates, have not been adopted pursuant to any specific regional exchange requirements,
and have not been subject to specific exchange surveillance and oversight.

The NYSE/Amex Order, in addressing the need for regional exchanges to participate in the regulation of affiliations
between specialist operations and diversified broker-dealer firms, took into account the fact that regional exchanges
differ from the primary exchanges in terms of order flow and market information. While noting that overall regional
exchange volume is small compared to primary market volume, and regional exchange pricing of orders is generally
derived from primary market quotations, the Commission expressed its concern that the diversion by a large retail
broker-dealer of all or a significant portion of order flow in specialty stocks to an affiliated regional specialist
could raise certain regulatory concerns similar to those raised by such affiliations on the primary exchanges. Moreover,
the Commission noted that even if regional exchange specialists continue to set their prices based on primary market
quotations, a regional specialist affiliated with an integrated retail firm could obtain significant access to
material, non-public information. 

The Commission continues to believe that Information Barriers, with effective controls, may be useful in restricting
information flow between the various departments of broker-dealers with affiliated specialists. The Commission
has monitored the NYSE and Amex Information Barrier rules since their inception, and generally believes they have
proven effective in the context of specialists and affiliated approved persons.

The Commission believes that the PSE proposal effectively addresses the potential for market abuses resulting from
the ongoing relationship between specialists and affiliated approved persons. The effectiveness of the procedures
set forth in the PSE guidelines is reinforced by the Exchange's existing surveillance of specialists and the marketplace
as well as the specialist's highly visible position in the marketplace. These factors, along with the specialist's
existing statutory duty to maintain a fair and orderly market, should help to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed
Information Barrier.

Finally, the Commission notes that the structural adequacy of the Information Barrier is only one part of evaluating
whether the procedures established by the Exchange will detect and deter potential improper activity by either the
approved person or the specialist. Appropriate surveillance procedures are critical to ensure that the Information
Barrier is maintained. To this end, the Exchange has submitted to the Commission proposed procedures for monitoring
the Information Barrier.
 The Commission also notes that the Exchange has represented that it believes that it has adequate staffing capacity
to monitor compliance and conduct independent reviews of member firms.
 







IV. Conclusion 



It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-93-36) is approved. 




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs; United States Man and the Biosphere Program:
Request for Proposals for the Biosphere Reserve Directorate



The Biosphere Reserve (BR) Directorate of the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program (U.S. MAB) announces a catalytic
grants program to support Biosphere Reserve workshops and partnership-building activities that promote cooperative
regional, ecosystem-based initiatives.


A total of $50,000 is available to support small grants in two distinct categories: (1) $20,000 in total for conferences,
workshops or forums; and (2) $30,000 in total for partnership projects. The projected maximum single grant award
is $10,000. Grants are expected to average between $4,000 and $8,000. Persons interested in applying for these grants
are encouraged to first obtain a copy of Strategic Plan for the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program, from the U.S. MAB Secretariat.



Funding Objectives



The purpose of the grants is to assist projects that produce short-term tangible results furthering the mission of
the United States Biosphere Reserve Program as defined in, Strategic Plan for the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program,
dated November 1994.

``
The mission of the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program is to establish and support a U.S. network of designated biosphere
reserves that are fully representative of the biogeographical areas of the United States. The program promotes a
sustainable balance among the conservation of biological diversity, compatible economic use, and cultural values,
through public and private partnerships, interdisciplinary research, education, and communication.'' 



Focal Issues 



Within the mission of the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program, the directorate seeks to support two to four conferences
in 1995. A wide range of conference and workshop topics are eligible. For example: A forum for Biosphere Reserves stakeholders
at a single Biosphere Reserves unit or cluster of units; a regional or local vision setting workshop; or a conference
for Biosphere Reserves stakeholders from throughout a region focusing on an issue or management approach of shared
interest. Other ideas for conferences and workshop topics promoting the mission of Biosphere Reserves are welcome.


The U.S. Biosphere Reserve Directorate also intends to support three to six partnership projects in 1995. Proposals
are sought which strengthen cooperative relationships for enhancing the functions of Biosphere Reserves. Innovative
and new approaches to conservation challenges will be given priority. Examples of eligible projects could include:
Assessing natural or cultural resources; building public support for conservation and sustainable development;
fostering demonstrations of cooperative ecosystem management or, developing local planning mechanisms. Other
ideas for partnership projects that promote the mission of Biosphere Reserves are welcome. Feasibility studies
of expanding the activities of existing Biosphere Reserves to more fully implement the regional, ecosystem-based
mission of the BR program also are encouraged. However, feasibility studies for designating new Biosphere Reserve
units are ineligible. 

Proposals may include a request for staff support only if the proposal and the staff position are related to expanding
the regional activities of a Biosphere Reserve or promoting a cooperative program involving multiple agencies and
nongovernmental partners. 



Proposal Content 



Each proposal should have a title page and a one page synopsis of the proposal activities. 

A maximum of three additional pages should describe: (1) The affected Biosphere Reserve or Biosphere Reserve Cluster;
(2) the applicant's relationship to the Biosphere Reserve; (3) the proposed conference or partnership project;
(4) how the proposed conference or project relates to past, current, and projected BR activities at the site; (5) how
the proposal complies generally and specifically with the evaluation criteria; and (6) how the results of the conference
or activity will be evaluated. 

All proposals must also include a one page itemized budget including personnel, travel, operation, equipment/supplies
with justification. The budget page should show the status of any matching funds to the proposed activity. 

A one-page map of the affected Biosphere Reserve, showing if possible, the BR zonation and if applicable, the site
of the proposed activities must be included. 

The last page of the proposal should be a one-page letter of endorsement from the Biosphere Reserve manager or managers.
If the proposed activity would involve or benefit more than one Biosphere Reserve, one page letters of endorsement
should indicate the support of the managers of the involved or affected Biosphere Reserves. Biosphere Reserve managers
should endorse no more than one single proposal in each funding category this year. 



Evaluation and Review Process 



A review panel of the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Directorate will evaluate proposals based upon the following criteria:



_Alignment of the proposal with the mission and goals of the United States Biosphere Reserve Program as defined in
the ``Strategic Plan for the U.S. Biosphere Reserve Program'' dated November 1994, available from the U.S. MAB Secretariat,
(address below); 
_Likelihood that the proposal will result in tangible progress within a year toward promoting cooperative regional,
ecosystem based initiatives that integrate conservation and sustainable development at Biosphere Reserve sites;

_Demonstrated local support for the project; 
_Innovation in implementing Biosphere Reserve functions;

_Potential to apply the concept or project at other BR site;

_Extent to which grant funds will be leveraged with matching funds or support from other private or public sources;

_Capacity of the applicant to implement the proposal;

_Endorsement from Biosphere Reserve Manager(s).



Limitations. Grants may not be used for: institution overhead academic research; acquisition of land, buildings,
or capital equipment; general support of agency functions; or political activities. All grants should produce tangible
results within one year. 

Deadlines. Proposals must be postmarked by January 31, 1995. Awards will be announced at the annual meeting of BR managers
