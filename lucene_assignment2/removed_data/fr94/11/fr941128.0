Pink Bollworm Regulated Areas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the pink bollworm regulations by adding
certain portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties in Tennessee to the list of suppressive areas for pink bollworm and
by adding Tennessee to the list of States quarantined because of pink bollworm. The interim rule imposed restrictions
on the interstate movement of regulated articles from those regulated areas in Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN,
and was necessary to prevent the interstate movement of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In an interim rule effective and published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 30, 1994 (59 FR 44607-44608, Docket No. 94-082-1), we amended the pink bollworm regulations
in 7 CFR 301.52 through 301.52-10 by adding certain portions of Dyer and Lauderdale Counties in Tennessee to
the list of suppressive areas for pink bollworm and by adding Tennessee to the list of States quarantined because of
pink bollworm. That action imposed restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from those regulated
areas in Dyer and Lauderdale Counties, TN, in order to prevent the interstate movement of pink bollworm into noninfested
areas. 
Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before October 31, 1994. We did not receive any comments.
The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. 
This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive
Order 12866. 


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 


Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation.




PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES 


Accordingly, we are adopting as a final rule, without change, the interim rule that amended 7 CFR 301.52 and 301.52-2a
and that was published at 59 FR 44607-44608 on August 30, 1994. 





Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 150bb, 150dd, 150ee, 150ff; 161, 162, and 164-167; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).

Policy and Procedure for Enforcement Actions; Policy Statement, Discrimination 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Policy statement; revision. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its General Statement of Policy and Procedure for Enforcement
Actions (Enforcement Policy) to address issues associated with discrimination. A change is also being made to address
Commission review of certain cases involving reports of the Office of Investigations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 6, 1993, the NRC's Executive Director for Operations established a review team to reassess the NRC's program
for protecting allegers against retaliation. The review team report, NUREG-1499,
 Reassessment of the NRC's Program for Protecting Allegers Against Retaliation, was published in January 1994. The
team report summarizes current processes, gives an overview of current problems, and gives recommendations for
each area that is discussed. The NRC is adding additional guidance in its Enforcement Policy to address Recommendations
II D.2, D.5., and D.6 of the report relating to enforcement actions for violations involving discrimination. 




The NRC Enforcement Policy is codified at 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C to provide widespread dissemination of the Commission's
Enforcement Policy. However, this is a policy statement and not a regulation.

Civil Penalty Adjustment for Corrective Action 


Corrective action is a significant factor in mitigation or escalation of base civil penalties for violations involving
discrimination. A paragraph is being added to B2(b) of Section VI of the Enforcement Policy to provide an explanation
of the corrective action adjustment factor as applied to discrimination cases. The NRC can require broad remedial
action to improve the workplace environment, but it cannot require a licensee to provide the individual with a personal
remedy. The Department of Labor (DOL) has the authority to require that a personal remedy be provided. A violation
involving discrimination is not completely corrected without the personal remedy, and the chilling effect may well
continue if a personal remedy is not provided. Thus the Commission does not believe that any proposed penalty should
be mitigated if a personal remedy is not provided. A civil penalty normally should be mitigated for corrective action
only if the licensee takes prompt, comprehensive corrective action which (1) addresses the broader environment
for raising concerns in the workplace; and (2) provides a remedy for the particular discrimination at issue. In the
determination of whether or not a remedy has been provided, the NRC considers whether a settlement has been reached
or if a remedy ordered by DOL has been implemented. Where a remedy has been accepted by DOL, NRC intends to defer to DOL
on the adequacy of the remedy. Cases where a licensee offers an employee a reasonable remedy, but the employee declines,
will be handled on a case by case basis. 
The promptness and scope of corrective action should also be considered in applying the corrective action factor.
If settlement occurs early in the administrative process, mitigation may be warranted based on corrective actions
as the chilling effect may have been minimized by the promptness of the remedy and remedial action. However, if settlement
occurs after the evidentiary record closes before the Administrative Law Judge, then any existing chilling effect
may have existed for a substantial time, and the complainant may have had to spend substantial resources to present
his or her case. Under such situations mitigation normally would not be warranted. If the licensee does not take broad
corrective action until after a Secretary of Labor's decision, and the Secretary's decision upholds an Administrative
Law Judge's finding of discrimination, corrective action may be untimely and escalation warranted. If the licensee
chooses to litigate and eventually prevails on the merits of the case, then enforcement action will not be taken and,
if already initiated, will be withdrawn. Assuming that evidence of discrimination exists, enforcement action that
emphasizes the value of promptly counteracting the potential chilling effect is warranted. 


Enforcement Discretion 


It is recognized that there are some cases of discrimination where enforcement action may not be warranted. Paragraph
B(7) is being added to Section VII to provide an explanation of the types of cases in which the NRC may refrain from taking
enforcement action and those in which the NRC normally would not exercise such discretion. A licensee who, without
the need for government intervention, identifies an issue of discrimination and takes corrective action to address
both the particular situation and the overall work environment is helping to establish a safety-conscious workplace.
Aggressive licensee follow-up also provides a message that retaliation is not acceptable within its workplace.
Assuming that these actions are reasonable and effective, NRC enforcement action may not be warranted. 
Another situation in which enforcement may not be warranted is where a complaint is filed with the DOL, but the licensee
settles the matter before the DOL Area Office makes a finding of discrimination. Alternatively, if a finding is made
against the licensee, the licensee may choose to settle before the evidentiary hearing begins. An NRC policy of not
normally citing violations in such cases might encourage licensee settlements, thereby reducing the potential
for chilling effect. Settlements also provide a more timely remedy for the complainant and may be used to demonstrate
the licensee's commitment to a retaliation-free environment. Therefore, the NRC may exercise its discretion not
to take enforcement action when the licensee has publicized (1) that a complaint of discrimination for engaging in
protected activity was made to the DOL; (2) that the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the employee (the terms
of the specific settlement agreement need not be posted); and (3) that if the DOL Area Office found discrimination,
the licensee has taken action to positively reemphasize that discrimination will not be tolerated. This information
might be publicized by posting a notice, a newsletter, a handout, or some other means, but the information should be
conveyed in a manner designed to minimize the chilling effect on others. A similar approach may be taken when a person
comes to the NRC without going to the DOL. 
Even if no formal enforcement action is taken, the NRC would issue a letter, as is normal practice in similar cases,
to emphasize the need for lasting remedial action. The licensee would also be informed that future violations may
result in enforcement action. In certain cases, the NRC may also consider entering into a consent order with the licensee,
as part of the settlement process, to address remedial action. 
Whether the exercise of discretion is appropriate will depend on the circumstances. For example, normally enforcement
discretion would not be appropriate for cases that involve: (1) Allegations of discrimination as a result of providing
information directly to the NRC; (2) allegations of discrimination caused by a manager above first-line supervisor
(consistent with the current Enforcement Policy classification of Severity Level I or II violations); (3) allegations
of discrimination where a history of findings of discrimination (by the DOL or the NRC) or settlements suggest a programmatic
rather than an isolated discrimination problem; (4) allegations of discrimination which appear particularly blatant
or egregious.

2

 In addition enforcement discretion normally would not be exercised for cases where the licensee does not appropriately
address the overall work environment (e.g. by using training, postings, revised policies or procedures, any necessary
disciplinary action, etc. to communicate corporate policy against discrimination).

Severity Levels 



The existing examples of harassment and intimidation in Supplement VII of the NRC Enforcement Policy focus on the
level of management involved in the discrimination. Additional examples are warranted to address other considerations
associated with discrimination. Example B(9) will be added as a Severity Level II example to address violations involving
a hostile work environment. Such a violation may be very significant because the failure by licensee's management
to correct a hostile work environment can have a potentially significant adverse impact on employees raising issues.
In such cases employees may not believe that they are free to raise concerns. 

Supplement VII does not currently address threats of discrimination or restrictive agreements, both of which are
violations under NRC regulations such as 10 CFR 50.7(f). Example C(10) is being added as a Severity Level III example
to address such violations. This type of violation is being categorized at a Severity Level III because the potential
impact on future protected activity may be of significant regulatory concern. 

Some discrimination cases may occur which, in themselves, do not warrant a Severity Level III categorization. Example
D(6) is being added as a Severity Level IV example to address these situations. An example of such a case might be a single
act of discrimination involving a first-line supervisor, in which the licensee promptly investigates the matter
on its own initiative, takes prompt, decisive corrective action to limit the potential chilling effect, and thereby
provides a clear message to other supervisors and employees that such conduct will not be tolerated. Another example
might involve a threat of adverse action against an employee for going around the supervisor to raise a concern; if
the licensee took prompt, aggressive corrective action before any adverse action was taken toward the employee,
such a case might be considered as having minimal potential for a widespread chilling effect. These cases would be
categorized at a Severity Level IV because they are of more than minor concern and, if left uncorrected, could lead
to a significant regulatory concern. Therefore, the Enforcement Policy is being changed to provide the flexibility
to classify less significant discrimination violations as Severity Level IV. Such cases would normally be considered
for exercising enforcement discretion if warranted under section VII B(7). However, citations would normally be
made if one of the four exceptions in that section were applicable. 



Miscellaneous 



The Enforcement Policy is also being changed to reflect current Commission practice on consultation concerning
proposed enforcement actions involving or relating to Office of Investigation (OI) reports. This change is being
made to Section III. 



Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



This final policy statement does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were aproved by the Office of Management and
Budget, approval number 3150-0136.

2. Civil Penalty Adjustment Factors 


* * * * * 


(b) Corrective action.

A civil penalty for violations involving discrimination should normally only be mitigated if the licensee takes
prompt, comprehensive corrective action that (1) addresses the broader environment for raising safety concerns
in the work place, and (2) provides a remedy for the particular discrimination at issue. 


* * * * * 


VII. Exercise of Discretion 


* * * * * 


B. Mitigation of Enforcement Sanction 


* * * * * 


(7) Enforcement discretion may be exercised for discrimination cases where a licensee who, without the need for government
intervention, identifies an issue of discrimination and takes prompt, comprehensive, and effective corrective
action to address both the particular situation and the overall work environment for raising safety concerns. Similarly,
enforcement may not be warranted where a complaint is filed with the Department of Labor (DOL) under Section 211 of
the Energy Reorganization Act of 1994, as amended, but the licensee settles the matter before the DOL makes an initial
finding of discrimination and addresses the overall work environment. Alternatively, if a finding of discrimination
is made, the licensee may choose to settle the case before the evidentiary hearing begins. In such cases, the NRC may
exercise its discretion not to take enforcement action when the licensee has addressed the overall work environment
for raising safety concerns and has publicized that a complaint of discrimination for engaging in protected activity
was made to the DOL, that the matter was settled to the satisfaction of the employee (the terms of the specific settlement
agreement need not be posted), and that, if the DOL Area Office found discrimination, the licensee has taken action
to positively reemphasize that discrimination will not be tolerated. Similarly, the NRC may refrain from taking
enforcement action if a licensee settles a matter promptly after a person comes to the NRC without going to the DOL.
Such discretion would normally not be exercised in cases in which the licensee does not appropriately address the
overall work environment (

e.g.

, by using training, postings, revised policies or procedures, any necessary disciplinary action, etc., to communicate
its policy against discrimination) or in cases that involve: allegations of discrimination as a result of providing
information directly to the NRC, allegations of discrimination caused by a manager above first-line supervisor
(consistent with current Enforcement Policy classification of Severity Level I or II violations), allegations
of discrimination where a history of findings of discrimination (by the DOL or the NRC) or settlements suggests a programmatic
rather than an isolated discrimination problem, or allegations of discrimination which appear particularly blatant
or egregious.

EAP's staff is aware that an individual's condition may adversely affect safety related activities; or

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>








Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks; Change in Discount Rate 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors has amended its Regulation A on Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks to reflect its
approval of an increase in the basic discount rate at each Federal Reserve Bank. The Board acted on requests submitted
by the Boards of Directors of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the authority of sections 10(b), 13, 14, 19, et al., of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board has amended its
Regulation A (12 CFR part 201) to incorporate changes in discount rates on Federal Reserve Bank extensions of credit.
The discount rates are the interest rates charged to depository institutions when they borrow from their district
Reserve Banks. 



The ``basic discount rate'' is a fixed rate charged by Reserve Banks for adjustment credit and, at the Reserve Bank's
discretion, for extended credit. In increasing the basic discount rate, the Board acted on requests submitted by
the Boards of Directors of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. The new rates were effective on the dates specified below.
The increase was implemented to keep inflationary pressures contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic
growth.

The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice and public participation were not followed in connection with
the adoption of this amendment because the Board for ``good cause'' finds that delaying the change in the basic discount
rate in order to allow notice and public comment on the change is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public
interest in keeping inflation contained, and thereby fostering sustainable economic growth.
 





The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d) that prescribe 30 days' prior notice of the effective date of a rule have not been followed
because section 553(d) provides that such prior notice is not necessary whenever there is good cause for finding that
such notice is contrary to the public interest. As previously stated, the Board determined that delaying the changes
in the basic discount rate is contrary to the public interest. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Board certifies that the
change in the basic discount rate will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. Although the change increases the rate of interest charged to borrowers from Reserve Banks, the Board believes
that the higher cost of funds is outweighed by the salutary effect on the economy. 



List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 201 



Banks, banking, Credit, Federal Reserve System.




For the reasons outlined in the preamble, the Board of Governors amends 12 CFR part 201 as follows:

For extended credit to depository institutions under  201.3(c), for credit outstanding for more than 30 days,
a flexible rate will be charged that takes into account rates on market sources of funds, but in no case will the rate
charged be less than the rate for adjustment credit, as set out in  201.51, plus one-half percentage point. At
the discretion of the Federal Reserve Bank, the 30-day time period may be shortened.

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to increase the amount of transaction
accounts subject to a reserve requirement ratio of three percent, as required by section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Federal
Reserve Act, from $51.9 million to $54.0 million of net transaction accounts. This adjustment is known as the low reserve
tranche adjustment. The Board has increased from $4.0 million to $4.2 million the amount of reservable liabilities
of each depository institution that is subject to a reserve requirement of zero percent. This action is required by
section 19(b)(11)(B) of the Federal Reserve Act, and the adjustment is known as the reservable liabilities exemption
adjustment. The Board is also increasing the deposit cutoff levels that are used in conjunction with the reservable
liabilities exemption to determine the frequency of deposit reporting from $55.0 million to $55.4 million for nonexempt
depository institutions and from $44.8 million to $45.1 million for exempt institutions. (Nonexempt institutions
are those with total reservable liabilities exceeding $4.2 million while exempt institutions are those with total
reservable liabilities not exceeding $4.2 million.) Thus nonexempt institutions with total deposits of $55.4 million
or more will be required to report weekly while nonexempt institutions with total deposits less than $55.4 million
may report quarterly. Similarly, exempt institutions with total deposits of $45.1 million or more will be required
to report quarterly while exempt institutions with total deposits less than $45.1 million may report annually. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 19(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(2)) requires each depository institution to maintain
reserves against its transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits, as prescribed by Board regulations. The
initial reserve requirements imposed under section 19(b)(2) were set at three percent for net transaction accounts
of $25 million or less and at 12 percent on net transaction accounts above $25 million for each depository institution.
Effective April 2, 1992, the Board lowered the required reserve ratio applicable to transaction account balances
exceeding the low reserve tranche from 12 percent to 10 percent. Section 19(b)(2) also provides that, before December
31 of each year, the Board shall issue a regulation adjusting for the next calendar year the total dollar amount of the
transaction account tranche against which reserves must be maintained at a ratio of three percent. The adjustment
in the tranche is to be 80 percent of the percentage change in net transaction accounts at all depository institutions
over the one-year period that ends on the June 30 prior to the adjustment. 



Currently, the low reserve tranche on net transaction accounts is $51.9 million. The increase in the net transaction
accounts of all depository institutions from June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, was 5.0 percent (from $788.5 billion
to $828.3 billion). In accordance with section 19(b)(2), the Board is amending Regulation D (12 CFR Part 204) to increase
the low reserve tranche for transaction accounts for 1995 by $2.1 million to $54.0 million.

Section 19(b)(11)(A) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461 (b)(11)(B)) provides that $2 million of reservable
liabilities

1

 of each depository institution shall be subject to a zero percent reserve requirement. Section 19(b)(11)(A) permits
each depository institution, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Board, to designate the reservable
liabilities to which this reserve requirement exemption is to apply. However, if net transaction accounts are designated,
only those that would otherwise be subject to a three percent reserve requirement (i.e., net transaction accounts
within the low reserve requirement tranche) may be so designated.
 




Section 19(b)(11)(B) of the Federal Reserve Act provides that, before December 31 of each year, the Board shall issue
a regulation adjusting for the next calendar year the dollar amount of reservable liabilities exempt from reserve
requirements. Unlike the adjustment for the low reserve tranche on net transaction accounts, which adjustment can
result in a decrease as well as an increase, the change in the exemption amount is to be made only if the total reservable
liabilities held at all depository institutions increases from one year to the next. The percentage increase in the
exemption is to be 80 percent of the increase in total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions as of
the year ending June 30. Total reservable liabilities of all depository institutions from June 30, 1993, to June 30,
1994, increased by 5.0 percent (from $1,496.9 billion to $1,571.5 billion). Consequently, the reservable liabilities
exemption amount for 1995 under section 19(b)(11)(B) will be increased by $0.2 million to $4.2 million.

The effect of the application of section 19(b) of the Federal Reserve Act to the change in the total net transaction
accounts and the change in the total reservable liabilities from June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, is to increase the
low reserve tranche to $54.0 million, to apply a zero percent reserve requirement on the first $4.2 million of transaction
accounts, and to apply a three percent reserve requirement on the remainder of the low reserve tranche. 

The tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment for weekly reporting institutions
will be effective on the reserve computation period beginning Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the corresponding
reserve maintenance period beginning Thursday, December 22, 1994. For institutions that report quarterly, the
tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment will be effective on the computation period
beginning Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the reserve maintenance period beginning Thursday, January 19, 1995.
In addition, all institutions currently submitting Form FR 2900 must continue to submit reports to the Federal Reserve
under current reporting procedures. 

In order to reduce the reporting burden for small institutions, the Board has established a deposit reporting cutoff
level to determine deposit reporting frequency. Institutions are screened during the second quarter of each year
to determine reporting frequency beginning the following September. In July of 1988 the Board set the cutoff level
at $40 million plus an amount equal to 80 percent of the annual rate of increase of total deposits.

3

 In August of 1994, the Board replaced the single deposit cutoff level that had applied to both nonexempt and exempt
institutions with separate cutoff levels. The cutoff level for nonexempt institutions, which determines whether
they report (on FR 2900) quarterly or weekly, was raised from the indexed level of $44.8 million to $55.0 million. The
deposit cutoff level for exempt institutions, which determines whether they report annually (on FR 2910a) or quarterly
(on FR 2910q), remained at the indexed level of $44.8 million. 





From June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, total deposits increased 0.9 percent, from $3,793.3 billion to $3,828.9 billion.
Accordingly, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level will increase by $0.4 million to $55.4 million and the exempt deposit
cutoff level will increase by $0.3 million to $45.1 million. Based on the indexation of the reservable liabilities
exemption, the cutoff level for total deposits above which reports of deposits must be filed will rise from $4.0 million
to $4.2 million. Institutions with total deposits below $4.2 million are excused from reporting if their deposits
can be estimated from other data sources. The $55.4 million cutoff level for weekly versus quarterly FR 2900 reporting
for nonexempt institutions, the $45.1 million cutoff level for quarterly FR 2910q versus annual FR 2910a reporting
for exempt institutions, and the $4.2 million level threshold for reporting will be used in the second quarter 1995
deposits report screening process, and the adjustments will be made when the new deposit reporting panels are implemented
in September 1995. 

All U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks and all Edge and agreement corporations, regardless of size, are required
to file weekly the Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash (FR 2900). All other institutions
that have reservable liabilities in excess of the exemption level of $4.2 million prescribed by section 19(b)(11)
of the Federal Reserve Act (known as ``nonexempt institutions'') and total deposits at least equal to the nonexempt
deposit cutoff level ($55.4 million) are also required to file weekly the Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits
and Vault Cash (FR 2900). However, nonexempt institutions with total deposits less than the nonexempt deposit cutoff
level ($55.4 million), may file the FR 2900 quarterly for the twelve-month period starting September 1995. Institutions
that obtain funds from non-U.S. sources or that have foreign branches or international banking facilities are required
to file the Report of Certain Eurocurrency Transactions (FR 2950/2951) at the same frequency as they file the FR 2900.


Institutions with reservable liabilities at or below the exemption level ($4.2 million) (known as exempt institutions)
must file the Quarterly Report of Selected Deposits, Vault Cash, and Reservable Liabilities (FR 2910q) if their total
deposits equal or exceed the exempt deposit cutoff level ($45.1 million). Exempt institutions with total deposits
less than the exempt deposit cutoff level ($45.1 million) but at least equal to the exemption amount ($4.2 million)
must file the Annual Report of Total Deposits and Reservable Liabilities (FR 2910a). Institutions that have total
deposits less than the exemption amount ($4.2 million) are not required to file deposit reports if their deposits
can be estimated from other data sources. 

Finally, the Board may require a depository institution to report on a weekly basis, regardless of the cutoff level,
if the institution manipulates its total deposits and other reservable liabilities in order to qualify for quarterly
reporting. Similarly, any depository institution that reports quarterly may be required to report weekly and to
maintain appropriate reserve balances with its Reserve Bank if, during its computation period, it understates its
usual reservable liabilities or it overstates the deductions allowed in computing required reserve balances.

Notice and Public Participation




The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice and public participation have not been followed in connection
with the adoption of these amendments because the amendments involve adjustments prescribed by statute and by an
interpretative statement reaffirming the Board's policy concerning reporting practices. The amendments also
reduce regulatory burdens on depository institutions. Accordingly, the Board finds good cause for determining,
and so determines, that notice and public participation are unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 
The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(d) relating to notice of the effective date of a rule have not been followed in connection
with the adoption of these amendments because the amendments relieve a restriction on depository institutions,
and for this reason there is good cause to determine, and the Board so determines, that such notice is not necessary.





Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis




Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Board certifies that the proposed amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The proposed amendments reduce certain regulatory burdens for all depository institutions,
reduce certain burdens for small depository institutions, and have no particular effect on other small entities.

ACTION:

 Final rule. 

 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FDIC is amending its regulations concerning the permissible activities of state-licensed insured branches
of foreign banks. Section 202 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (Improvement
Act) provides that after December 19, 1992, a state-licensed insured branch of a foreign bank may not engage in any
activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank unless the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (Board) has determined that the activity is consistent with sound banking practice, and the FDIC has
determined that the activity would pose no significant risk to the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF). The amendments cover
application procedures and divestiture or cessation plans. Foreign banks are required to seek both the FDIC's and
the Board's approval for an insured state branch to engage in or continue to engage in an activity which is not permissible
for a federal branch of a foreign bank. In the event such an application is denied or the foreign bank elects not to continue
the activity, a plan of divestiture or cessation must be submitted and such divestiture or cessation must be completed
within one year, or sooner if the FDIC so directs.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


 Paperwork Reduction Act 


 

The collection of information contained in this final rule has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under control no. 3064-0114 pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

). Comments on the accuracy of the burden estimate, and suggestions for reducing the burden, should be directed to
the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3064-0114), Washington, D.C., 20503, with
copies of such comments to Steven F. Hanft, Office of the Executive Secretary, Room F-453, Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, 550 17th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20429. The collections of information in this regulation are
found in   346.101(a), (d), (e) and (f) and take the form of a requirement that foreign banks (1) file an
application with the FDIC requesting permission for an insured state branch to engage in or to continue engaging in
any activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank and (2) submit a plan of divestiture or cessation
in the event that the application is not approved, the foreign bank elects not to apply to the FDIC for permission to
continue the activity, or a permissible activity becomes impermissible due to a subsequent change in statute, regulation
or formal order or interpretation. The information contained in the application will allow the FDIC to properly discharge
its responsibilities under section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3101 

et seq.

) (IBA), as amended by section 202 of the Improvement Act. The information in the application will be used by the FDIC
as part of the process of determining whether conduct of the activity in question by the applicant will pose a significant
risk to the Bank Insurance Fund. The information in the divestiture or cessation plan will be used by the FDIC to make
judgments concerning the reasonableness of the institution's actions to discontinue activities deemed to pose
significant risk to the insurance fund. 


 The estimated annual reporting burden for the collection of information from foreign banks in this proposed amendment
is summarized as follows:

Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), it is certified that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Discussion 


Section 202 of the Improvement Act (Pub. L. 102-242, 12 U.S.C. 3105) amended section 7 of the IBA by adding new
subsection (h) which provides that after December 19, 1992 a state branch or state agency of a foreign bank may not engage
in any type of activity that is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank unless the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System has determined that such activity is consistent with sound banking practice; and in the
case of an insured branch, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has determined that the activity would pose
no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. 12 U.S.C. 3105(h)(1). 
On March 2, 1993, the FDIC proposed an amendment to part 346 of its regulations (12 CFR part 346), ``Foreign Banks'',
in order to implement this new statutory provision. This proposal was published for a sixty-day comment period in
the 

Federal Register

. (58 FR 11992, March 2, 1993).

1

 The proposal sought to amend subpart A,  346.1, to include a definition of ``significant risk to the deposit
insurance fund'' and to add a new subpart D, ``Applications Seeking Approval for Insured State Branches to Conduct
Activities Not Permissible for Federal Branches''.

2

 





The proposed new subpart provided that a foreign bank operating an insured state branch which desires to engage in
or continue an activity that is not permissible for a federal branch, pursuant to statute, regulation, official bulletin
or circular, or any order or interpretation issued in writing by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),
shall file with the FDIC a prior written application for permission to conduct or continue such activity. (Proposed
 346.101(a)). The proposal went on to provide that the application shall be filed with the FDIC Regional Director
of the Division of Supervision for the region in which the insured state branch is located. (Proposed  346.101(c)).
Since section 202(a) of the Improvement Act became effective December 19, 1992, the FDIC proposed to allow existing
insured state branches of foreign banks to continue activities (at existing levels) which may not be permissible
for a federal branch until the regulation is promulgated in final form and the FDIC acts on their application. The proposal
provided that the FDIC would expect all foreign banks engaged in an impermissible activity to file the required application
no later than 60 days after the effective date of the final rule. (58 FR 11993, column three). 
Section 346.101(b) of the proposed regulation provided that the application shall be in letter form and shall contain
certain information, including a description of the activity in which the branch desires to engage or in which it is
already engaged, the foreign bank's financial condition, the branch's assets and liabilities, the projected effect
of the proposed activity on the financial condition of the foreign bank and the branch, and a statement of why the proposed
activity will pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund. 


Comment Letters 


The FDIC received two comment letters concerning the proposed amendments. Both comment letters were supportive
of the FDIC's efforts to coordinate its application procedures with the Board and to minimize the administrative
burden on state-licensed insured branches which apply for permission to conduct or continue to conduct an activity
which is not permissible for a federal branch. 
The commenters raised four primary concerns with the Corporation's proposed regulation. First, the comments urged
the FDIC to approve activities on an ``activity by activity'' basis, in addition to its approval of individual applications
by specific banks requesting permission to conduct a particular activity. One commenter noted that such ``activity''
applications could be submitted by trade groups and state bank supervisors. Second, both commenters requested that
the FDIC publish a list of ``pre-approved'' activities for state-licensed insured branches which the FDIC determines
pose no significant risk to the BIF. They envision that once an activity is on this list, an insured state branch could
engage in it without the necessity of applying to the FDIC. Third, it was suggested that the scope of the information
required to be included in a branch's application (Proposed  346.101(b)) be reduced in order to decrease even
further the administrative burden on applicants. Fourth, the commenters urged the FDIC not to carry over quantitative
restrictions which the OCC places on federal branches to activities permitted to state-licensed insured branches
which pose no significant risk of loss to the BIF. These points are discussed below. 


Approval of Activities Versus Applicants 


Both commenters urged the FDIC to approve generic activities, in addition to individual applications. One commenter
expanded on this recommendation by suggesting that the FDIC accept applications from industry trade groups and state
bank supervisors requesting approval of a certain activity or activities on behalf of state-licensed insured branches.
That same commenter also argued that the intent of Congress in enacting the statute was not to require the FDIC, as a
general rule, to review and approve applications from particular institutions to engage in specific activities.
Rather, the commenter argued that Congress intended the FDIC to approve generic activities on an activity by activity
basis as being permissible for all state-licensed insured branches.

The Corporation is of the opinion that the regulatory scheme represented in the final regulation is consistent with
the views expressed by the commenters as described immediately above. In its proposal, the FDIC explicitly requested
interested parties to describe activities which, even though they are not permissible for federal branches, clearly
pose no significant risk to the BIF when conducted by an insured state branch. (58 FR 11994, column two). The FDIC went
on to request that commenters discuss the proposed application process as it related to such activities and whether
a more limited notice procedure might be more appropriate in such cases. 

Id.

 After carefully considering the comments and referring to its recently enacted regulation concerning ``Activities
and Investments of Insured State Banks'', 12 CFR part 362 (58 FR 64462, December 8, 1993), the FDIC has concluded that
there are certain activities which, even though they may not be permissible for a federal branch, clearly pose no significant
risk to the BIF when conducted by an insured state branch. Thus, in the event that an insured state-licensed branch
is conducting or desires to conduct such an activity, no application or notice to the FDIC will be required. The precise
nature of these activities is discussed below. 



Joint Application Procedure 



The FDIC is sensitive to the administrative burden on applicants of gathering the requested information and preparing
an application. Since section 202 of the Improvement Act requires all state branches and state agencies that desire
to engage in, or to continue to engage in, any activity which is not permissible for a federal branch to secure the approval
of the Board, the FDIC will permit insured state branches to submit a copy of their application to the Board to the FDIC
instead of preparing a completely separate submission. The FDIC and the Board will review such applications simultaneously.


The commenters urged the FDIC to reduce the scope of the information required to be submitted in a foreign bank's application
in view of the fact that some of this information may already be available to the FDIC through the general examination
and supervisory process. After careful consideration, the FDIC has decided to accept this recommendation. Therefore,
 346.101(b) of the proposed regulation has been revised to delete paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4) and (b)(5). Applicants
will not be required to submit a current statement of the applicant's assets, liabilities and capital, a current statement
of the branch's assets and liabilities or a copy of the applicant's most recent audited financial statements. (Final
 346.101(d)). 



Permissible Activities 



Section 346.101(a) of the final regulation is identical to  346.101(a) of the proposed regulation. It provides
that a state-licensed insured branch which desires to engage in or continue to engage in certain activities not permissible
for a federal branch must obtain the FDIC's permission. More specifically, it refers to ``any type of activity that
is not permissible for a federal branch, pursuant to the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 21 

et seq

.) or any other federal statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, or order or interpretation issued in
writing by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.* * *'' Written staff opinions will be considered
to evidence the position of the Comptroller so long as the opinion is still considered valid, i.e., it has not been overruled
by the OCC or found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

This section of the final regulation is substantially similar to  362.2(b) of the Corporation's regulation
concerning the activities of state chartered banks. (12 CFR 362.2(b)). The FDIC is of the opinion that  346.101(a)
of the final regulation should parallel  362.2(b) concerning the activities of state banks with regard to the
determination of permissible activities and the commenters agreed.

The commenters suggested that the FDIC should approve activities which, though not permissible for federal branches,
pose no significant risk to the BIF and thus would be permissible for state-licensed insured branches assuming that
the Board determines that such activities are consistent with sound banking practice and that state law as well as
any other applicable federal law or regulation permits the branch to engage in such activities. In its preamble to
the proposed regulation, the Corporation specifically requested commenters to describe such activities. (58 FR
11994, column two). Only one commenter put forth a specific recommendation in this regard. That comment letter urged
the FDIC to issue a blanket approval for agency activities and any activity approved as an exception pursuant to  362.4(c)(3)
of the Corporation's regulations governing the activities of state banks. 12 CFR 362.4(c)(3). With regard to activities
approved as exceptions pursuant to  362.4(c)(3) of the Corporation's regulations, the Corporation agrees
with the position set forth by the commenter that activities approved as exceptions for state-chartered domestic
banks on the basis that they pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance funds should also be permissible for
state-licensed insured branches of foreign banks, without the necessity of filing an application or notice pursuant
to this part, provided the activity in question is also permissible for a state licensed branch of a foreign bank under
state law and any other applicable federal law or regulation. 

See

 Final  346.101(b). 



Engaging in an Activity as Agent 



Section 202(a) of the Improvement Act does not distinguish between activities which a foreign branch conducts as
principal versus those conducted as agent, nor does it distinguish between activities which a foreign branch conducts
directly versus those it conducts indirectly. The FDIC is of the opinion that the absence of such distinctions in section
202 is significant especially in light of the inclusion of such distinctions in other sections of the Improvement
Act. For example, section 303 of the Improvement Act, which added section 24 to the FDI Act, provides that an insured
state bank may not engage as principal in any type of activity that is not permissible for a national bank. 12 U.S.C.
1831a(a). Similarly, section 24(c) of the FDI Act, which was also added by section 303 of the Improvement Act, provides
that an insured state bank may not, directly or indirectly, acquire or retain any equity investment of a type that is
not permissible for a national bank. 12 U.S.C. 1831a(c). Part 362 of the Corporation's regulations, 12 CFR part 362,
reflects the clear statutory intent of FDI Act section 24. The prohibition on foreign branches contained in section
7(h) of the IBA is broader than the similar prohibitions contained in sections 24(a) and (c) of the FDI Act. Thus, the
FDIC interprets section 7(h) of the IBA to apply to any activity in which an insured state branch desires to engage which
is not permissible for a federal branch regardless of the capacity or manner in which the branch seeks to conduct the
activity. 

However, the Corporation's determination that agency activities are covered by section 202 of the Improvement Act
does not mean that some or all agency activities cannot be found to be permissible, provided the Board determines that
the activity is consistent with sound banking practice and the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant
risk to the BIF. After careful consideration, the FDIC is of the opinion that a state-licensed insured branch may engage
in an activity as agent provided that such agency activity is permissible for a state-chartered bank headquartered
in the state in which the insured branch of the foreign bank is located and is also a permissible activity for a state-licensed
branch of a foreign bank. Thus, state-licensed insured branches which desire to engage in such agency activities
will not be required to file an application or notice with the FDIC pursuant to the final regulation. Of course, the
activity in question must also be permissible pursuant to any other applicable federal law or regulation. 

See 

Final  346.101(c). 



Substantive Limitations on Permissible Activities 



In the preamble to the proposed regulation, the FDIC noted that it would ``generally expect any conditions or restrictions
set out in the OCC's regulations, bulletins, circulars, orders and interpretations to be met if the activity is to
be considered permissible when conducted by an insured branch''. (58 FR 11994, column two). The commenters expressed
some confusion as to the precise meaning and scope of this standard. They also contrasted the FDIC's position with
the Board's apparent position on this issue as briefly discussed in its proposed amendments to Regulation K. (58 FR
513, January 6, 1993). 

After careful consideration, the FDIC has decided to adopt a position consistent with that of the Board. That is, an
application under this section will not normally be required where an activity is permissible for a federal branch,
but the OCC imposes a quantitative restriction on the conduct of such an activity. The FDIC is of the opinion that appropriate
quantitative restrictions can be addressed on a case-by-case basis as part of the ongoing supervisory process.

Significant Risk to the Fund 


In approving an application to conduct or to continue to conduct an activity which is not permissible for a federal
branch, the FDIC must determine that the activity in question ``would pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance
fund''. The phrase ``significant risk to the deposit insurance fund'' is defined in  346.1(r) of the final regulation.
Significant risk to the deposit insurance fund shall be understood to be present whenever there is a high probability
that the BIF may suffer a loss. It is not necessary that engaging in the activity in question will result in the insolvency
or threatened insolvency of the insured state branch before a significant risk of loss to the BIF is considered to be
present. This definition is substantially similar to the definition that is used in  362.2(m) of the FDIC's
regulation governing the activities of state banks and the FDIC is of the opinion that the definition in the final regulation
should parallel the part 362 definition. None of the commenters addressed this issue. Thus, the definition contained
in the proposed regulation is being adopted without change. 


Divestiture or Cessation 



In the event that an insured state branch is required to cease conducting an activity,  346.101(d) of the proposed
regulation set forth the guidelines that must be followed to divest or cease the impermissible activity. Generally,
this section provides that the insured state branch shall submit a written plan of divestiture or cessation within
60 days of (1) being notified by the FDIC or the Board that an application to continue to conduct the activity has been
denied, (2) the effective date of the regulation in the event that the foreign bank elects not to apply for permission
to continue to conduct the activity, and (3) any change in statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, order
or interpretation issued in writing by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction that renders the activity impermissible. Divestiture or cessation shall be completed within one year,
or sooner if the FDIC so directs. ( 346.101(f)(1)). The commenters did not address this issue. Therefore, this
section of the proposed regulation is being adopted without substantive change. 

 


Delegation of Authority 



Section 346.101(g) of the final regulation delegates authority to review and approve divestiture and cessation
plans to the Executive Director, Compliance, Resolutions and Supervision, and the Director of the Division of Supervision,
and where confirmed in writing by the Director, to an associate director, or to the appropriate regional director
or deputy regional director. The FDIC received no comment on this section of the proposed regulation and, thus, it
has been adopted unchanged. 



Effective Date 



Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-325, provides
that amendments to regulations which impose additional reporting or other new requirements on insured depository
institutions shall take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter which begins on or after the date on which the regulation
is published in final form, with certain exception which are not applicable in this case. Thus, this final amendment
to Part 346 shall become effective on January 1, 1995.

Applications. 



(a) 

Scope. 

A foreign bank operating an insured state branch which desires to engage in or continue to engage in any type of activity
that is not permissible for a federal branch, pursuant to the National Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 21 

et seq.

) or any other federal statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, or order or interpretation issued in writing
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or which is rendered impermissible due to a subsequent change in statute,
regulation, official bulletin or circular, written order or interpretation, or decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction (each an impermissible activity), shall file a written application for permission to conduct such
activity with the FDIC pursuant to this section. An applicant may submit to the FDIC a copy of its application to the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), provided that such application contains the
information described in paragraph (d) of this section. 

(b) 

Exceptions. 

A foreign bank operating an insured state branch which would otherwise be required to submit an application pursuant

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369D, E, F,
and FF Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems
and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters. This action requires an initial inspection
of the pitch control assembly lockwasher (lockwasher) for dents at the inner tang inside radius, application of a
torque stripe on the tail rotor swashplate and locknut, and repetitive inspections of the torque stripe to detect
any locknut slippage. This amendment is prompted by a report that a lockwasher failed in service and allowed a locknut
to loosen. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the inner tang of the lockwasher, loss
of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch control assembly, loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control
of the helicopter.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems
(MDHS) and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. (Hughes) Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters. MDHS received a report that
indicated a pitch control assembly lockwasher (lockwasher), part number (P/N) MS172209, had failed in service.
A subsequent investigation revealed that some lockwashers appear to have dents at the inner tang inside radius. The
FAA has reviewed the reports and determined that failure of this tang could allow the locknut to loosen and eventually
allow the pitch control assembly to disengage from the tail rotor assembly. Should these two tail rotor components
separate, the rotorcraft crew would lose the capability of making necessary anti-torque corrections through the
tail rotor to maintain adequate control of the helicopter. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure
of the inner tang of the lockwasher, loss of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch control assembly, loss of tail
rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 


The FAA has reviewed McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Systems Service Information Notice (SIN) No. DN-185, EN-78,
and FN-64, dated September 23, 1994, which describes procedures for an inspection of the lockwasher, P/N MS172209,
application of a torque stripe on the tail rotor swashplate and locknut, and repetitive inspections of the pitch control
assembly to detect slippage of the locknut. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other McDonnell Douglas Helicopter
Systems and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369D, E, F, and FF series helicopters of the same type design, this AD is
being issued to prevent failure of the inner tang of the lockwasher, loss of the locknut, disengagement of the pitch
control assembly, loss of tail rotor control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires an
initial inspection of the lockwasher for dents in the inner tang inside radius, application of a torque stripe on the
tail rotor swashplate and locknut, and repetitive inspections of the torque stripe to detect slippage of the locknut.
Due to the critical need to ensure the integrity of the lockwasher and the short time-in-service before the initial
inspection is required, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in the affected helicopters.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the SIN described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption


ADDRESSES.

 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-SW-13-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Conditional Approval and Promulgation of 
Section 182(f) Exemption to the Nitrogen Oxides (NO

X

) Control 
Requirements for the Dallas-Fort Worth and El Paso 
Ozone Nonattainment Areas; Texas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, the EPA is conditionally approving two petitions from the State of Texas requesting that the 
Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and El Paso ozone nonattainment areas be exempted from NO

X

 control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The State of Texas bases its request
for DFW upon a demonstration that the DFW nonattainment area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f). Similarly, the State bases its exemption request for El Paso on a demonstration
that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the ozone NAAQS by the CAA mandated deadline without implementing
the additional NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f), but for emissions emanating from Mexico. These exemptions are being requested
under authority similarly granted under section 182(f) of the CAA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


NO

X

 are precursors to ground level (tropospheric) ozone, or urban ``smog.'' When released into the atmosphere, NO

X

 will react with volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. Tropospheric ozone is
an important factor in the nation's urban air pollution problem. 


The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas
that do not meet the ozone NAAQS. Subparts 1 and 2 of part D, title I of the CAA as amended in 1990 contain the air quality
planning requirements for ozone nonattainment areas. Title I includes new requirements to control NO

X

 emissions in certain ozone nonattainment areas and ozone transport regions. Section 182(f) requires States to apply
the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO

X

 as are applied to major stationary sources of VOC. The new NO

X

 requirements are reasonably available control technology (RACT) and new source review (NSR). These provisions
are explained more fully in the EPA's NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble published in the 


Federal Register

 (FR) on November 25, 1992 (see 57 FR 55620). In addition, the general and transportation conformity rules (conformity)
required by section 176(c) contain new NO

X

 requirements (see 58 FR 63214 and 58 FR 62188), and the vehicle inspection and maintenance rules required by section
182(c)(3) also contain new NO

X

 requirements (see 57 FR 52989). 
El Paso, Texas was designated nonattainment for ozone and classified as serious pursuant to sections 107(d)(4) and
181(a) of the CAA. The El Paso nonattainment area consists of El Paso County and shares a common airshed with Juarez,
Mexico. Under section 181(a), serious areas must attain the ozone NAAQS by 1999. DFW was classified as moderate with
an attainment deadline of 1996. The DFW nonattainment area consists of Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, and Collin Counties.
Please reference 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991, codified for Texas at title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations in
 81.344). 


II. Applicable EPA Guidance 




The CAA specifies in section 182(f) that if one of the conditions listed below is met, the new NO

X

 requirements would not apply: 
1. In any area, the net air quality benefits are greater without NO

X

 reductions from the sources concerned; 
2. In a non-transport region, additional NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to ozone attainment in the nonattainment area; or 
3. In a transport region, additional NO

X

 reductions would not produce net ozone benefits in the transport region. 


In addition, section 182(f)(2) states that the application of the new NO

X

 requirements may be limited to the extent that any portion of those reductions are demonstrated to result in ``excess
reductions'' of NOx. The NO

X

 provisions of the conformity requirements would also not apply in an area that is granted a section 182(f) exemption
(see 58 FR 63214 and 58 FR 62188). In addition, certain NO

X

 provisions of the vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements would not apply in an area that is granted a section
182(f) exemption (57 FR 52989). 


The EPA's 

Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxides Requirements under Section 182(f) 

(December 1993) describes how the EPA intends to interpret the NO

X

 exemption provisions of section 182(f). In addition, a memorandum signed by John S. Seitz, Director of the EPA Office
of Air Quality Planning and Standards, dated May 27, 1994, describes certain revisions to the process the EPA currently
intends to follow for granting exemptions from NO

X

 control requirements. 
As described more fully in the Seitz memorandum, petitions submitted under section 182(f)(3) are not required to
be submitted as State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions. Consequently, the State is not required under the CAA
to hold a public hearing in order to petition for an areawide NO

X

 exemption determination. Similarly, it is not necessary to have the Governor submit the petition. 




III. International Border Area 




Section 818 of the 1990 CAAA incorporates a new section 179B into the CAA which contains special provisions for nonattainment
areas that are affected by emissions emanating from outside the United States. The section 818 provisions are hereinafter
referred to as section 179B. Because the El Paso nonattainment area shares a common airshed with Juarez, Mexico, the

section 179B provisions apply to El Paso. 


Under section 179B, the EPA will approve a SIP if the area meets all other CAA requirements and establishes that implementation
of the plan would achieve attainment of the ozone standard by the CAA statutory deadline ``but for emissions emanating
from outside the United States.'' Customarily, an area must demonstrate, using EPA guideline models, that it would
attain the relevant NAAQS. Since El Paso and Juarez, Mexico share an airshed and data are not available for a Juarez
emission inventory, modeling of the entire airshed is not possible at this time. Current EPA policy allows an area
subject to section 179B, such as El Paso, to perform modeling using only U.S. air emission data. Such modeling may form
an acceptable basis for demonstrating attainment for analysis purposes required under section 179B. For areas on
an international border that demonstrate attainment, ``but for emissions emanating from a foreign country,'' the
provisions of section 179B will keep such areas from being subject to the ``bump up'' provisions of section 181(b)(2),
which require reclassification to the next higher ozone nonattainment classification if the area fails to attain
the relevant NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. See 57 FR 13498, 13569-13570 (April 16, 1992). 


The State of Texas performed Urban Airshed Modeling (UAM) using only El Paso emissions data, and demonstrated that

El Paso would attain the ozone standard by 1996 ``but for emissions emanating from Mexico.'' The El Paso UAM ozone modeling
analysis will be referred to in this notice as the ``attainment demonstration'' for El Paso. 


Although the EPA allows an area such as El Paso to demonstrate attainment on a basis of U.S.-only modeling, it is understood
that ultimately basin-wide modeling must occur in order to develop a control strategy in El Paso that will achieve
the NAAQS. The United States entered into the Agreement for Environmental Cooperation along the U.S.-Mexico Border,
referred to as the La Paz Agreement, with Mexico in 1983 to address environmental concerns along the border between
the two countries. Annex V of the Agreement, negotiated in 1989, calls for basin-wide modeling to be accomplished
for the El Paso/Juarez airshed. The EPA has been working with Mexico and with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) to accomplish the basin-wide modeling. Since the statutory attainment date for serious ozone
nonattainment areas such as El Paso is 1999, concerned agencies intend to complete such modeling by 1999. 





IV. State Submittal 




On June 17, 1994, the TNRCC submitted to the EPA two petitions pursuant to section 182(f), requesting that the DFW and
El Paso nonattainment areas be exempted by the EPA from the NO

X

 control requirements of section 182(f) of the CAA.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941128-0-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The State bases its petitions on a demonstration that NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment in either area, as allowed for under the test (2) listed above, because
such NO

X

 reductions would be in excess of the reductions necessary for attainment. Consistent with the EPA's December 1993

section 182(f) guidance, the State's excess emissions reductions demonstration is tied to the attainment demonstration
SIP required under section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA. 
The State's submission for each petition includes: (1) A letter from Anthony C. Grigsby, Executive Director of the
TNRCC, to Jane N. Saginaw, Regional Administrator of the EPA Region 6, transmitting the NO

X

 exemption petition; (2) the petition from the TNRCC summarizing the State's UAM attainment demonstration results;
and (3) technical reports documenting the State's base case UAM inputs. The State has also previously submitted to
the EPA the 15 percent Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) SIPs for the DFW and El Paso areas, as required by 
section 182(b)(1) of the CAA. The 15 percent RFP SIPs contain regulations that are estimated to reduce VOC emissions
in each area by 15 percent from 1990 levels, net of any growth that may occur. The State of Texas supplemented its petitions
by submitting to the EPA in July 1994, two additional technical reports on the UAM for each area, which contained the
following: base case performance evaluation, attainment year emissions report, and attainment year modeling report.
These additional technical reports provided supplemental detail and documentation on the modeling information
already provided to the EPA in the State's petitions. 
On August 29, 1994, the EPA proposed to conditionally approve the section 182(f) petitions for the DFW and El Paso areas
(see 59 FR 44386). The proposed rulemaking notice provides a detailed discussion of the EPA's rationale for proposing
conditional approval of the State's petitions and should be referred to. In that notice, the EPA explained that although
the State had completed its attainment demonstration SIPs for both areas, the SIPs had not yet been adopted by the State,
nor submitted to the EPA. The EPA further explained that the EPA would not take final action to conditionally approve
the petitions for each area unless and until the State submitted the attainment demonstration SIPs to the EPA in accordance
with section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA. 
The TNRCC adopted the attainment demonstration SIP for the DFW area on September 21, 1994, and submitted it to the EPA
on October 3, 1994, in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA. Similarly, the TNRCC adopted the attainment
demonstration SIP for the El Paso area on September 14, 1994, and submitted it to the EPA on October 3, 1994. The EPA is
therefore proceeding to take final action on the section 182(f) petitions submitted by the TNRCC for the DFW and El
Paso areas. 


V. Response to Comments 


The EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposed action to conditionally approve the section 182(f)
petitions for the DFW and El Paso areas. The EPA received 27 letters of support from the utility, transportation authority,
metropolitan planning organization and local governments in the DFW area. The EPA received three letters of support
from the City of El Paso, a local utility, and a metropolitan planning organization in the El Paso area. 

Three adverse comment letters were received from environmental groups, one of which applied only to DFW, while two
of which applied to both DFW and El Paso. One of the letters was submitted by three environmental groups and contained
generic comments objecting to the EPA's general policy on section 182(f) exemptions. The three environmental groups
who submitted the generic letter requested that it be included in each EPA rulemaking action for each section 182(f)
petition. 


Comment: 

One group objected to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) as a fuel additive in reformulated gasoline. The
TNRCC included the use of reformulated gasoline in its 15 percent RFP SIP for DFW as a control strategy to reduce VOC
emissions. 


Response: 

This comment applies to the State's reformulated gasoline program, and its 15 percent RFP SIP for the DFW area that
had previously been adopted by the State and submitted to the EPA. The EPA does not believe that this comment is relevant
to the rulemaking action on the State's petition for a section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption, since in this action, the EPA is not taking action on the State's reformulated gasoline program nor its
15 percent RFP plan. The EPA will rule on those control programs in a separate rulemaking action. 


Comment: 

One group felt that the UAM model for DFW was flawed from a scientific perspective so as to be inadequate to make sound
predictions of attainment. They cited the fact that only three of the four episodes initially analyzed by the State
had acceptable performance. In addition, they felt that the emissions inventories were significantly inaccurate
so as to discredit the modeling results. 


Response: 

The EPA disagrees with this comment that the UAM modeling demonstration for DFW is flawed. Due to the large number of
factors that influence ozone formation, the EPA agrees that the UAM model cannot precisely predict the exact relationship
between VOC, NO

X

, and ozone. However, if the model performs within certain bounds of accuracy, the EPA believes that the model can and
should be used to develop the attainment strategy since Congress clearly intended that photochemical grid modeling
be used to form the basis of a control strategy plan. The EPA has established general criteria to evaluate the relative
accuracy of a given modeling demonstration, and believes that models that meet those criteria are accurate enough
to form the basis of the attainment strategy. 
The EPA's ``Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model'' generally requires that three episodes
with acceptable model performance be used in the attainment demonstration. Because Texas had three episodes which
exhibited acceptable performance, Texas' attainment modeling is fully consistent with the EPA's requirements.
In addition, the EPA's model performance criteria apply to each individual episode rather than across episodes.
Therefore, it is inaccurate to conclude that the model was 75 percent accurate because only three of the four episodes
exhibited acceptable model performance. 
The EPA disagrees with the comment that the emissions inventories were too inaccurate to produce acceptable modeling
results. The EPA evaluated the State's 1990 base year emissions inventories and a final approval was published in
the FR on November 8, 1994.

Comment: 

One group stated that NO

X

 controls should be required because NO

X

 emissions cause other adverse health and environmental effects besides contributing to ozone formation. 


Response: 

The EPA agrees that high NO

X

 emissions can contribute to air pollution problems independent of their role in ozone formation; however, the EPA
disagrees that the NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f) of the CAA should be implemented in the DFW area regardless of their impact
on ozone. Because ambient air monitoring shows that the DFW area is in attainment for the nitrogen dioxide NAAQS standard,
the EPA does not believe that the current level of NO

X

 emissions pose a public health or environmental risk in the DFW area. In addition, section 182(f)(2)(B)(i) specifically
provides for an exemption in cases where NO

X

 emission reductions would not contribute to the attainment of the NAAQS for ozone in the area. The TNRCC has demonstrated
that the NO

X

 reductions required by section 182(f) would be in excess of the emission reductions necessary for attaining the ozone
NAAQS. Finally, for the purposes of reducing acid rain deposition, certain NO

X

 sources will still be required to reduce NO

X

 emissions under Title IV of the CAA. For these reasons, the EPA does not believe that the NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f) of the CAA should be implemented in the DFW area regardless of their impact
on ozone. 


Comment: 

One group questioned whether the current ozone standard of 120 parts per billion provides sufficient protection
of public health. 


Response: 

The EPA does not believe that this comment is relevant to this rulemaking action on the section 182(f) petitions for
DFW and El Paso. The EPA is currently reviewing the ozone primary and secondary standards and will address concerns
over the current ozone standard through a separate rulemaking process. If the standard is revised, the EPA will determine
at that time what action is appropriate for attainment SIPs and NO

X

 exemption petitions that had previously been approved. 


Comment: 

One group felt that EPA's action to propose conditional approval of the State's exemption petitions without the attainment
SIPs was premature and denied adequate public input on the issue. They commented that EPA should wait until the State
actually submits the attainment SIPs before making any determination as to the feasibility of the two areas actually
achieving the NAAQS for ozone. 


Response: 

The EPA disagrees with this comment for several reasons. The EPA does not believe its action proposing approval of
the petitions was premature. As explained in the FR notice which proposed approval of the petitions (see 59 FR 44386),
the attainment demonstrations rely on VOC regulations contained in the 15 percent RFP SIPs which had previously gone
through public comment, State adoption, and submission to the EPA. For this reason, the EPA did not anticipate that
the substance of the final attainment demonstration SIPs would differ from what had already been submitted to the
EPA by the TNRCC in the section 182(f) exemption petitions. In addition, the EPA further explained that the EPA would
not take final action to conditionally approve the petitions for each area unless and until the State had submitted
the attainment demonstration SIPs to the EPA in accordance with section 182(c)(2)(A) of the CAA. Therefore, the EPA
has waited until the State submitted its attainment SIPs before making any final determination. 
The EPA believes the public has had adequate opportunity for public comment. The control strategies contained in
the attainment SIPs had previously gone through public comment and State adoption as part of the 15 percent RFP SIP.
In addition, the State proposed the attainment SIPs on July 27, 1994. The State's public comment period on the attainment
SIPs closed September 2, 1994, while the comment period on the EPA's proposed action to conditionally approve the
petitions closed on September 28, 1994. The proposed attainment SIPs were therefore available for public review
for two months prior to and during the EPA's public comment period on the proposed action on the petitions. 
Finally, the EPA's action to approve the petitions is conditioned upon the EPA finally approving the modeling portion
of the attainment SIPs, which will provide another opportunity for comment on the adequacy of the attainment SIPs
as a basis for the section 182(f) exemptions. 


Comment: 

Three groups provided a generic comment arguing that NO

X

 exemptions are provided for in two separate parts of the CAA, section 182(b)(1) and section 182(f). Because the NO

X

 exemption tests in subsections 182(b)(1) and 182(f)(1) include language indicating that action on such requests
should take place ``when [EPA] approves a plan or plan revision,'' these commenters conclude that all NO

X

 exemption determinations by the EPA, including exemption actions taken under the petition process established
by subsection 182(f)(3), must occur during consideration of an approvable attainment or maintenance plan, unless
the area has been redesignated as attainment. These commenters also argue that even if the petition procedures of
subsection 182(f)(3) may be used to relieve areas of certain NO

X

 requirements, exemptions from the NO

X

 conformity requirements must follow the process provided in subsection 182(b)(1), since this is the only provision
explicitly referenced by section 176(c), the CAA's conformity provisions. 


Response: 

The EPA disagrees with the commenters regarding the process for considering exemption requests under section 182(f),
and instead believes that subsections 182(f)(1) and 182(f)(3) provide independent procedures by which the EPA may
act on NO

X

 exemption requests. The language in subsection 182(f)(1), which indicates that the EPA should act on NO

X

 exemptions in conjunction with action on a plan or plan revision, does not appear in subsection 182(f)(3). And, while
subsection 182(f)(3) references subsection 182(f)(1), the EPA believes that this reference encompasses only the
substantive tests in paragraph (1) (and, by extension, paragraph (2)), not the procedural requirement that the EPA
act on exemptions only when acting on SIPs. Additionally, paragraph (3) provides that ``person[s]'' (which section
302(e) of the CAA defines to include States) may petition for NO

X

 exemptions ``at any time,'' and requires the EPA to make its determination within six months of the petition's submission.
These key differences lead the EPA to believe that Congress intended the exemption petition process of paragraph
(3) to be distinct and more expeditious than the longer plan revision process intended under paragraph (1).

The CAA requires conformity with regard to federally-supported NO

X

-generating activities in relevant nonattainment and maintenance areas. However, EPA's conformity rules explicitly
provide that these NO

X

 requirements would not apply if the EPA grants an exemption under section 182(f). In response to the comment that section
182(b)(1) should be the appropriate vehicle for dealing with exemptions from the NO

X

 requirements of the conformity rule, the EPA notes that this issue has previously been raised in a formal petition
for reconsideration of the EPA's final transportation conformity rule and in litigation pending before the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on the substance of both the transportation and general conformity
rules. The issue, thus, is under consideration within the EPA, but at this time remains unresolved. Additionally,
subsection 182(f)(3) requires that NO

X

 exemption petition determinations be made by the EPA within six months. The EPA has stated in previous guidance that
it intends to meet this statutory deadline as long as doing so is consistent with the public notice requirements of
the Administrative Procedures Act. Absent the EPA action now, this deadline, as it applies with respect to the DFW
and El Paso exemption requests, which were submitted in June 1994, would not be met. The EPA, therefore, believes that
until a resolution of this issue is achieved, the applicable rules governing this issue are those that appear in the
EPA's final conformity regulations, and the EPA remains bound by their existing terms. 


Comment: 

Three groups provided a generic comment on all section 182(f) actions that the modeling required by EPA is insufficient
to establish that NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment since only one level of NO

X

 control, i.e., ``substantial'' reductions, is required to be analyzed. They further explained that an area must
submit an approvable attainment plan before EPA can know whether NO

X

 reductions will aid or undermine attainment.



Response: 

The EPA does not believe that this comment is applicable to the DFW or El Paso actions because attainment plans have
been submitted for both areas in conjunction with the section 182(f) petitions. The TNRCC based its petitions for
DFW and El Paso on a demonstration that the NO

X

 reductions would be in excess of the reductions necessary for attainment. In contrast, the above comment refers to
section 182(f) petitions that are based on a demonstration that NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment. Such a demonstration requires that various emission reduction scenarios
be modeled which include substantial reductions of NO

X

.

As described in Chapter 6 of the EPA's December 1993 section 182(f) guidance, the excess reductions demonstration
used by the TNRCC for DFW and El Paso must be tied to the areas' attainment demonstration SIPs. This test must show that
the excess reductions are reductions in excess of those specified in the attainment demonstration required by section
182, and either contained in the approved SIP or as adopted by the State to meet the section 182 attainment demonstration
requirement, and submitted to the EPA for approval. The EPA believes that the more precise modeling analysis contained
in the State's attainment demonstration SIP is required for the excess reduction test because the demonstration
must show that a specific portion of the total area-wide NO

X

 emissions is not beneficial under one of the three tests listed above. The tie to the attainment demonstration assures
that an excess reductions petition would not arbitrarily be based on small emissions and would not undermine the State's
control strategy.
In addition, the EPA's guidance specifies that photochemical grid modeling is generally needed to document cases
where NO

X

 reductions do not contribute to attainment or include excess reductions. The UAM is an acceptable model for these
purposes. The EPA guidance also states that application of UAM should be consistent with techniques specified in
the EPA ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised).'' Further, application of UAM should also be consistent with
procedures contained in the EPA ``Guidelines for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model'' (July 1991).


Comment: 

Three groups provided a generic comment on all section 182(f) actions that three years of ``clean'' data fail to demonstrate
that NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment.


Response: 

The EPA does not believe that this comment is applicable to the DFW and El Paso actions because neither area has based
its section 182(f) petition on ``clean'' air monitoring data.


Comment: 

Three groups provided a generic comment on all section 182(f) actions that a waiver of NO

X

 controls is unlawful if such waiver will impede attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard in separate downwind
areas.


Response: 

The EPA believes that, while this generic comment may be applicable to proposed NO

X

 exemption actions for other areas, it is not applicable to the DFW and El Paso exemption actions because the EPA is unaware
of, and the comment itself does not specify, any downwind area for which NO

X

 transport is of concern. This is unlike the case regarding comments received by the EPA for certain areas for which
NO

X

 exemptions are pending such as in Ohio, for example, where the downwind areas of concern are clearly identified as
areas in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. It should also be noted that neither DFW nor El Paso is located near or
within an ozone transport region.

Comment:

 Three groups provided a generic comment on all actions exempting areas from the NO

X

 requirements of the conformity rules that such exemptions waive only the requirements of section 182(b)(1) to contribute
to specific annual reductions, not the requirement that conformity SIPs contain information showing the maximum
amount of motor vehicle NO

X

 emissions allowed under the transportation conformity rules and, similarly, the maximum allowable amounts of any
such NO

X

 emissions under the general conformity rules. The commenters admit that, in prior guidance, the EPA has acknowledged
the need to amend a drafting error in the existing transportation conformity rules to ensure consistency with motor
vehicle emissions budgets for NO

X

. The commenters, however, want the EPA to explicitly affirm this obligation in FR actions on NO

X

 exemptions and to avoid granting waivers until a budget controlling future NO

X

 increases is in place. 


Response:

 In its ``Conformity; General Preamble for Exemption From Nitrogen Oxides Provisions,'' 59 FR 31238, 31241 (June
17, 1994), the EPA reiterated its view that in order to conform, nonattainment and maintenance areas must demonstrate
that their transportation plans and transportation improvement plans are consistent with the motor vehicle emissions
budget for NO

X

 even where a conformity NO

X

 waiver has been granted. Due to a drafting error, that view is not reflected in the current transportation conformity
rules. As the commenters correctly note, the EPA states in its June 17 notice that it intends to remedy the problem by
amending the conformity rule. Although that notice specifically mentions only requiring consistency with the approved
maintenance plan's NO

X

 motor vehicle emissions budget, the EPA also intends to require consistency with the attainment demonstration's
NO

X

 motor vehicle emissions budget. The DFW and El Paso exemptions, however, were submitted pursuant to section 182(f)(3),
and the EPA does not believe it is appropriate to delay the statutory deadline for acting on these petitions until the
conformity rule is amended. As noted earlier in response to a previous issue raised by these commenters, this issue
has also been raised in a formal petition for reconsideration of the EPA's final transportation conformity rule and
in litigation pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on the substance of both
the transportation and general conformity rules. This issue, thus, is under consideration within the EPA, but at
this time remains unresolved. The EPA, therefore, believes that until a resolution of this issue is achieved, the
applicable rules governing this issue are those that appear in the EPA's final conformity regulations, and the EPA
remains bound by their existing terms. 


Comment:

 Three groups provided a generic comment on all section 182(f) actions that the CAA does not authorize delaying implementation
of NO

X

 controls if modeling is not complete. 


Response:

 The EPA does not believe that this comment is applicable to the DFW or El Paso actions because complete attainment modeling
has been submitted for both areas, as part of the attainment SIPs, in conjunction with the section 182(f) petitions.



VI. Effective Date 


This rulemaking is effective as of November 21, 1994. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1),
permits the effective date of a substantive rule to be less than thirty days after publication of the rule if the rule
``relieves a restriction.'' Since the approval of the section 182(f) exemptions for the DFW and El Paso areas, is a
substantive rule that relieves the restrictions associated with the CAA title I requirements to control NO

X

 emissions, the NO

X

 exemption approval may be made effective upon signature by the EPA Administrator. 


VII. Final Action 


In this action, the EPA is conditionally approving

1

 the 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petitions submitted by the State of Texas for the DFW and El Paso ozone nonattainment areas, conditioned
upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the attainment demonstration SIPs. If the EPA proposes to disapprove
the modeling portion of the SIPs, the EPA will also propose disapproval of the section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petitions, based on the fact that the technical basis for the exemption is no longer valid. Upon final disapproval
of the modeling portion of the attainment SIPs, the EPA will issue a final disapproval of the section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petitions as well. 




There are several consequences if the EPA disapproves the section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petitions based on the conclusion that the attainment SIPs were not approved by the EPA. The State would
be required to submit NO

X

 RACT rules and implement the relevant NO

X

 conformity, NSR, and vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements for the DFW and El Paso areas. The EPA would
issue a finding of nonsubmittal of the NO

X

 RACT rules. As provided under section 179(a) of the CAA, if the State did not make a complete submittal within 18 months
after the finding of failure to submit, the EPA would be required to impose the requirement to provide two-to-one NSR
offsets. If the State had not corrected its deficiency within six months after imposing the offset sanction, the EPA
would impose a second sanction, on highway funding. Any sanction the EPA imposes must remain in place until the EPA
determines that the State has corrected the deficiency. In addition, the finding of failure to submit would trigger
the 24-month clock for the EPA to impose a Federal Implementation Plan as required by section 110(c)(1) of the CAA.

The EPA believes that all section 182(f) exemptions that are approved, should be approved only on a contingent basis.
As described in the EPA's NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble (57 FR 55628, November 25, 1992), the EPA would rescind a NO

X

 exemption in cases where NO

X

 reductions were later found to be beneficial in the area's attainment plan. That is, a modeling based exemption would
last for only as long as the area's modeling continued to demonstrate attainment without the additional NO

X

 reductions required by section 182(f).

<DOCNO> FR941128-0-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the EPA later determines that NO

X

 reductions are beneficial based on new photochemical grid modeling in an area initially exempted, the area would
be removed from exempt status and would be required to adopt the NO

X

 RACT and NSR rules, except to the extent that modeling shows NO

X

 reductions to be ``excess reductions.'' In the rulemaking action which removes the exempt status, the EPA would specify
a schedule for States to adopt the NO

X

 RACT and NSR rules and for sources to comply with the NO

X

 RACT emission limits. 
The subsequent modeling analyses mentioned above need not be limited to the purpose of demonstrating attainment
in the 1994 SIP revisions without the need for NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f). For example, future modeling might also be initiated to resolve issues related
to transport of ozone and ozone precursors into downwind nonattainment areas. An area might want to consider a strategy
that phases-in NO

X

 reductions only after certain VOC reductions are implemented. As improved emission inventories and ambient data
become available, areas may choose to remodel. In addition, alternative control strategy scenarios might be considered
in subsequent modeling analyses in order to improve the cost-effectiveness of the attainment plan. 
In summary, the EPA is conditionally approving the section 182(f) exemptions for the DFW and El Paso areas, conditioned
upon EPA's approval of the modeling portion of the attainment demonstrations for these areas. These exemptions will
remain effective for only as long as modeling in each nonattainment area continues to show that NO

X

 control activities would not be beneficial in the DFW or El Paso nonattainment areas. 
In addition, the State of Texas and EPA have committed to data-gathering and modeling throughout the El Paso-Juarez
air basin in accordance with Annex V of the La Paz Agreement for Environmental Cooperation on the U.S.-Mexico Border.
Once the data are collected and basin-wide modeling is concluded, the EPA, the State of Texas, and the Republic of Mexico
can develop a binational control strategy that will result in improved air quality throughout the airshed. If EPA
review of modeling and air quality data confirms that NO

X

 control requirements on local U.S. sources would not be beneficial, the exemption would be sustained. In contrast,
if the EPA determines that NO

X

 control requirements would be beneficial, the exemption would be rescinded. 


Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
Approvals of NO

X

 exemption petitions under section 182(f) of the CAA do not create any new requirements. Therefore, because the Federal
approval of the petitions does not impose any new requirements, the EPA certifies that it does not have a significant
impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State
action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (

Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A.,

 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2)). 
If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval based on the State's failure to meet the condition upon which
the approval is granted, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal
disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, the EPA's disapproval of
the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, the EPA certifies that this disapproval action
would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because such disapproval would not remove
existing State requirements, nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the appropriate circuit by January 27, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this
final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within
which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action.
This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'', and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms
of Executive Order 12866, and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

(a) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting
that the Dallas ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NO

X

 control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The Dallas nonattainment area
consists of Dallas, Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid
modeling which shows that the Dallas nonattainment area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the additional NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f). On November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption request,
conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the Dallas attainment demonstration SIP. 

(b) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the El Paso ozone nonattainment area
be exempted from the NO

X

 control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The El Paso nonattainment area
consists of El Paso county, and shares a common airshed with Juarez, Mexico. The exemption request was based on a photochemical
grid modeling which shows that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the NAAQS for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline
without the implementation of the additional NO

X

 controls required under section 182(f), but for emissions emanating from Mexico. On November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally
approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the El Paso attainment
demonstration SIP.

Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable Oxygenate Requirements for Reformulated Gasoline 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of judicial stay



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act (the Act), Congress required that the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) promulgate regulations requiring the sale of reformulated gasoline (RFG) in certain ozone nonattainment
areas and restricting the sale of non-reformulated, or conventional, gasoline. EPA issued a final rule for reformulated
and conventional gasoline on December 15, 1993. On June 30, 1994, EPA revised these regulations to require that a certain
minimum amount of the oxygenates used in reformulated gasoline be from renewable sources. 





A petition to review the renewable oxygenate requirements was filed with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, and petitioners sought a stay of the renewable oxygenate requirements pending judicial review. On September
13, 1994, the court granted petitioners' request and stayed these requirements pending review. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 30, 1994, EPA issued a final rule revising the regulations for the reformulated gasoline program.

1

 That final rule establishes a performance standard for each refiner and importer of reformulated gasoline, requiring
that a specified percentage of the oxygen content of their reformulated gasoline be from renewable oxygenates. The
renewable oxygenate requirement is to be phased-in such that 15 percent of the oxygen content of the reformulated
gasoline would have to be from renewable oxygenates in 1995, increasing to 30 percent in 1996. The requirement was
set as an annual average requirement, with provisions for credit generation and transfer between refiners and importers.

On July 13, 1994 the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the National Petroleum Refiners Association (NPRA) filed
a petition for review of these requirements in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, under
section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act. 

API and NPRA 

v. 

EPA, 

No. 94-1502. Petitioners subsequently filed a motion for a stay pending judicial review, and a motion for summary
reversal or in the alternative for expedited consideration of the petition for review. 

On September 13, 1994 the court granted petitioners' motion for a stay pending judicial review. At the same time, the
court denied petitioners' motion for summary reversal and expedited the schedule for judicial review. The court
set a briefing schedule requiring completion of all briefing by January 12, 1995, and directed that the clerk set oral
argument on the first available time after that date. 

Given the expedited schedule for judicial review, EPA believes that the court might issue a decision as early as the
spring of 1995, although it could be later. In light of this schedule, and the upcoming beginning of the reformulated
gasoline program, EPA believes it would be useful to provide certain basic information for all interested parties.


First, it is important to note that the judicial stay only affects that part of the reformulated gasoline program relating
to the required use of renewable oxygenates. It does not affect any other aspect of either the reformulated gasoline
or conventional gasoline programs. The reformulated gasoline regulations will go into effect December 1, 1994,
and the conventional gasoline regulations on January 1, 1995. The judicial stay only affects the regulations issued
on June 30, 1994_all other regulations for reformulated and conventional gasoline will go into effect as previously
announced. 

Second, if EPA's renewable oxygenate regulations are upheld on judicial review, EPA would expect to implement the
renewable oxygenate program as expeditiously as practical. EPA would try to implement the program in a way that maximizes
its benefits, taking into consideration various factors such as the benefits that would have been achieved absent
a stay, the amount of renewable oxygenates voluntarily used in reformulated gasoline during the pendency of the stay,
and other issues relevant to implementation of the program. 

EPA cannot, at this time, decide exactly how it will implement the renewable oxygenate program if it prevails on judicial
review. The limits on EPA's discretion and the implementation options reasonably available will depend in large
part on the facts and circumstances then in existence, as well as the timing and actual terms of the court's decision,
to the extent it addresses implementation issues. However, to the extent feasible, EPA will at that time evaluate
various options and will seriously consider providing credits to refiners and importers who voluntarily use renewable
oxygenates during the term of the judicial stay.

Preliminary Assessment Information and Health and Safety Data Reporting; Addition of Chemicals 



Agency:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) in its 34th Report to EPA revised the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
Section 4(e) Priority List by recommending for health effects testing ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) (CAS No. 637-92-3)
and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) (CAS No. 994-05-8). The ITC recommendations must be given priority
consideration by EPA in promulgating test rules. EPA is adding these two chemical substances to two model information-gathering
rules: the TSCA Section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule (PAIR) and the TSCA Section 8(d) Health and
Safety Data Reporting Rule. These model rules will require: Manufacturers and importers of the substances identified
herein to report certain production, use, and exposure-related information, and manufacturers, importers, and
processors of the listed substances to report unpublished health and safety data to EPA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule adds ETBE and TAME to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. Manufacturers,
importers, and processors of these chemicals will be required to report unpublished health and safety data, and manufacturers
and importers will be required to report end use, exposure, and production volume data to EPA. Because the ITC has expressed
no need for ecological effects information for the substances being added to the section 8(d) rule via this action,
EPA is not requiring the reporting of these data for the subject substances under the section 8(d) rule.


I. Background


Section 4(e) of TSCA established the ITC and authorized it to recommend to EPA chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals)
to be given priority consideration in proposing test rules under section 4. For some of these chemicals, the ITC may
designate that EPA must respond to its recommendations within 12 months. In this time, EPA must either initiate a rulemaking
to test the chemical or publish in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not doing so.
On May 17, 1994, EPA announced the receipt of the 34th Report of the ITC, and it was then published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35720). The 34th Report revises the Committee's priority list of chemicals by recommending
ETBE and TAME to the section 4(e) priority list. 
This rule adds ETBE and TAME to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. These two rules are
model information gathering rules which assist the ITC in making testing recommendations and aid EPA in responding
to the ITC recommendations.
EPA issued the PAIR under section 8(a) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2607(a)), and it is codified at 40 CFR part 712. This model section
8(a) rule establishes standard reporting requirements for manufacturers and importers of the chemicals listed
in the rule at 40 CFR 712.30. These manufacturers and importers are required to submit a one-time report on general
volume, end use, and exposure-related information using the Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's
Report (EPA Form 7710-35). 
EPA uses this model section 8(a) rule to gather current information on chemicals of concern quickly. EPA issued the
model Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule under section 8(d) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2607(d)), and it is codified at 40
CFR part 716. The section 8(d) model rule requires past, current, and prospective manufacturers, importers, and
processors of listed chemicals to submit to EPA copies and lists of unpublished health and safety studies on the listed
chemicals that they manufacture, import, or process. These studies provide EPA with useful information and have
provided significant support for EPA's decisionmaking under TSCA sections 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
These model rules provide for the automatic addition of ITC priority list chemicals. Whenever EPA announces the receipt
of an ITC report, EPA may, at the same time without further notice and comment, amend the two model information-gathering
rules by adding the recommended chemicals. The amendment adding these chemicals to the PAIR and the Health and Safety
Data Reporting Rule becomes effective 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 
The reporting of ecological effects data will not be required for ETBE and TAME under the section 8(d) rule. Because
no member of the ITC has expressed a need for these data, EPA believes there is no need to collect this information at
this time. 


II. Chemicals To Be Added 


In its 34th Report to EPA, the ITC recommended ETBE and TAME for health effects testing. EPA is adding these two chemical
substances to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. The use of ETBE and TAME to augment
or substitute for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (CAS No. 1634-04-4) as fuel oxygenates and the need for
health effects data for ETBE and TAME are of concern to EPA and the ITC. For these reasons, EPA is adding ETBE and TAME
to the section 8(d) rule to obtain data to support EPA's ongoing assessments of the potential hazards/risks posed
by these two substances.
Manufacturers, importers, and processors of the two substances being listed on the 8(d) rule by this action will not
be required to report ecological effects data under the 8(d) rule for those substances. 


III. Reporting Requirements 


A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule



All persons who manufactured or imported the chemical substances named in this rule during their latest complete
corporate fiscal year must submit a Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form No. 7710-35)
for each manufacturing or importing site at which they manufactured or imported a named substance. A separate form
must be completed for each substance and submitted to the Agency no later than February 27, 1995. Persons who have previously
and voluntarily submitted a Manufacturer's Report to the ITC or EPA may be able to submit a copy of the original Report
to EPA or to notify EPA by letter of their desire to have this voluntary submission accepted in lieu of a current data
submission. See  712.30(a)(3).

Details of the reporting requirements, the basis for exemptions, and a facsimile of the reporting form, are provided
in 40 CFR part 712. Copies of the form are available from the TSCA Environmental Assistance Division at the address
listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 


B. Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule 


Listed below are the general reporting requirements of the section 8(d) model rule.

1. Persons who, in the 10 years preceding the date a substance is listed, either have proposed to manufacture, import,
or process, or have manufactured, imported, or processed, the listed substance must submit to EPA: A copy of each health
and safety study which is in their possession at the time the substance is listed.

2. Persons who, at the time the substance is listed, propose to manufacture, import, or process; or are manufacturing,
importing, or processing the listed substance must submit to EPA:

a. A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time the substance is listed.

b. A list of health and safety studies known to them but not in their possession at the time the substance is listed.

c. A list of health and safety studies that are ongoing at the time the substance is listed and are being conducted by
or for them.

d. A list of each health and safety study that is initiated after the date the substance is listed and is conducted by
or for them.

e. A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now
complete_regardless of completion date.

3. Persons who, after the time the substance is listed, propose to manufacture, import, or process the listed substance
must submit to EPA:

a. A copy of each health and safety study which is in their possession at the time they propose to manufacture, import,
or process the listed substance.

b. A list of health and safety studies known to them but not in their possession at the time they propose to manufacture,
import, or process the listed substance.

c. A list of health and safety studies that are ongoing at the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process the
listed substance, and are being conducted by or for them.

d. A list of each health and safety study that is initiated after the time they propose to manufacture, import, or process
the listed substance, and is conducted by or for them.

e. A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now
complete_regardless of the completion date.

The bulk of reporting is required at the time the substance is listed. Persons described in categories 1 and 2 do all
or most of their health and safety data reporting at the start of the reporting period. The remaining reporting requirements,
specifically categories 2(d), 2(e), and 3, continue prospectively.

Detailed guidance for reporting unpublished health and safety data is provided in the 

Federal Register

 of September 15, 1986 (51 FR 32720). Also found there are explanations of the reporting exemptions.



C. Submission of PAIR Reports and Section 8(d) Studies



PAIR reports and section 8(d) health and safety studies must be sent to:
TSCA Document Processing Center (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, ATTN: (insert either PAIR or 8(d) Reporting). 


D. Removal of Chemical Substances from the Rules



Any person who believes that section 8(a) or 8(d) reporting required by this rule is unwarranted, should promptly
submit to EPA in detail the reasons for that belief. EPA, in its discretion, may remove the substance from this rule
for good cause (40 CFR 712.30 and 716.105). When withdrawing a substance from the rule, EPA will issue a rule amendment
for publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


IV. Release of Aggregate Data



EPA will follow procedures for the release of aggregate statistics as prescribed in the 

Federal Register

 notice of June 13, 1983 (48 FR 27041). Included in the notice are procedures for requesting exemptions from the release
of aggregate data. Exemption requests concerning the release of aggregate data on any chemical substance must be
received by EPA no later than February 27, 1995.


V. Economic Analysis 


A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule 


EPA estimates the PAIR reporting cost of this rule is $14,072. To calculate this figure, EPA used information from
a variety of published sources as well as information from OPPTS's Risk Management 1 (RM1) reports on similar chemicals
to generate a list of five firms that manufacture and/or import the two chemicals at a total of eight sites. The published
sources used include: SRI International's 

Directory of Chemical Producers, Chemical Economics Handbook

, and 

Specialty Chemicals

; other multi-client studies; the U.S. International Trade Commission's 

Synthetic Organic Chemicals

; and company product literature. An unknown number of the businesses affected by the addition of the chemicals to
the Priority List may qualify as a small business as defined in 40 CFR 712.25(c). However, for this analysis it is assumed
that all firms identified will report. Therefore, EPA expects five firms to generate a total of eight reports (some
sites produce both of the chemicals). 



        

Reporting Costs (dollars)

 


(a) 8 reports estimated at $924 per report = $7,392 
(b) 8 sites at $835 per site = $6,680 
Total Cost = $14,072 
Mean cost per site = $14,072/8 sites = $1,759 
Mean cost per firm = $14,072/5 firms = $2,814 
Mean cost per report = $14,072/8 reports = $1,759 



        

Reporting Burden (hours)

 


(a) Rule familiarization: 18 hours/site x 8 sites = 144 
(b) Reporting: 16 hours/report x 8 reports = 128 
Total burden hours = 272 
Average burden per site = 272 hours/8 sites = 34 
Average burden per firm = 272 hours/5 firms = 55
Average burden per firm = 272 hours/8 reports = 34 



        

EPA Costs (dollars)

 


Processing cost = 8 reports x $95/report = $760 



B. Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule 


EPA estimates the total reporting costs for establishing section 8(d) reporting requirements for the two chemicals
will be $10,353. This cost estimate is high because the Agency is uncertain about the likely number of respondents
to the rule. Although EPA has used the best available data to make its economic projections, much of the information
is based upon the 1986 TSCA Inventory Update and secondary information from industry sources. Therefore, EPA tends
to overestimate rather than underestimate reporting burden. 
The estimated reporting costs are broken down as follows: 





      

Reporting Burden (hours)

 


(a) Initial review: 2 hours/firm x 15 firms = 30 hrs 
(b) Reporting: 10.26 hours/firm x 15 firms = 154 hrs 
Total reporting burden hours = 184 hrs 



VI. Rulemaking Record



The following documents constitute the record for this rule (docket control number OPPTS-82044). All of these
documents are available to the public in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), formerly the TSCA Public
Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The NCIC is located at EPA Headquarters,
Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

VII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 

 


A. Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order l2866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments of communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.



B. Paperwork Reduction Act



The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2070-0054 for PAIR reporting and 2070-0004 for TSCA section
8(d) reporting.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 34 hours for PAIR per response
and 8.2 hours for section 8(d), including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2131, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and
Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because
of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year)
flood elevations for new buildings and their contents. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the
address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation determinations
are available for inspection is provided. 


Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 
The modifications are made pursuant to Section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 

et seq

., and with 44 CFR Part 65. 
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.

The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. 
The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4. 


National Environmental Policy Act


This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared. 


Regulatory Classification


This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735.

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule will change the minimum inspection frequency for surface coal mining and reclamation operation that have
been abandoned without completion of reclamation or abatement of violations. The change enables regulatory authorities
to eliminate ineffective inspections to redirect resources to minesites where inspection and enforcement will
achieve intended results. Before an abandoned site can qualify for a change in inspection frequency under this rule,
the regulatory authority must make a written finding that a site is abandoned and that the change in inspection frequency
is appropriate based on specified environmental and public health and safety criteria.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background
II. Discussion of Rule and Response to Public Comments 
III. Procedural Matters


I. Background


Section 517(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the Act) states that the regulatory authority
shall inspect on an irregular basis averaging not less than one partial inspection per month and one complete inspection
per quarter each surface coal mining and reclamation operation covered by a permit. To implement this requirement,
OSM first promulgated rules at 30 CFR 840.11 for State regulatory authorities and at 30 CFR 842.11 for OSM where it is
the regulatory authority authority in a State. 44 FR 15455 (March 13, 1979). These rules essentially mirrored the
inspection frequency requirements of the Act. 
These rules were revised on August 16, 1982 (47 FR 35620). Among other things, the 1982 rules carved out for inspection
frequency purposes a distinct category of surface coal mining and reclamation operations where reclamation was
in the advanced stages. While retaining the quarterly requirement for complete inspections, these rules allowed
regulatory authorities to reduce the number of partial inspections required at these ``inactive'' operations from
an average of one per month to a frequency ``as necessary to ensure effective enforcement of the regulatory program.''
Since abandoned sites are incompletely reclaimed surface coal mining and reclamation operations where the operators
will not or cannot return to the minesite to complete reclamation or correct violations, they remain in an ``active''
status, and, therefore, must continue to be inspected at the full mandated frequency of twelve times per year. 
To address the issue of inspection frequency at abandoned sites, the rules were again revised in 1988. (53 FR 24872,
June 30, 1988). This time the rules defined an ``abandoned site'' as a distinct category at surface coal mining and
reclamation operations and enabled regulatory authorities to reduce the inspection frequency at these sites and
to refrain from issuing additional enforcement actions at abandoned sites under certain conditions. The definition
of ``abandoned site'' specifies that, before a site can be considered abandoned, it must first meet certain criteria
which ensure that the regulatory authority has taken or is in the process of taking all enforcement action available
to it under the applicable regulatory program to compel abatement of violations and completion of reclamation. Sites
meeting the definition could then, instead of twelve times per year, be inspected ``as necessary to monitor for changes
of environmental conditions or operational status at the site.''

The 1988 final rule was subsequently challenged in Federal District Court. On August 30, 1990, the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia issued an order in the case of 

National Wildlife Federation, et al.,

 v. 

Manuel Lujan, Jr., et al.,

 31 Env't Rep. Cas. (BNR) 2034, 2042 (D.D.C. 1990) (

NWF

 v. 

Lujan

). The district court remanded the rule to the Secretary to be withdrawn or revised on the basis that the Secretary's
arguments supporting the rule were inconsistent with the inspection frequency requirements of Section 517(c) of
the Act. However, the district court conceded that the rule was practical, that it comported with common sense, and
that it is not wise to spend a lot of time and effort inspecting abandoned sites every month when nothing changes. To
implement the court's order, OSM suspended those parts of the 1988 rule that related to inspection frequency at abandoned
sites. The definition of ``abandoned site'' at 30 CFR 840.11(g) and 842.11(e) and the provision at 30 CFR 843.22 allowing
regulatory authorities to refrain from issuing additional enforcement actions at abandoned sites were unaffected
by the court order and remain intact today (56 FR 25036, June 3, 1991). 

In appealing the district court decision, the Secretary asked the United States Court of Appeals to vacate the district
court's remand in order to allow him to promulgate a new regulation redefining ``abandoned sites'' to include only
those sites where a permit has expired or been revoked. Under this approach, Section 517(c) of the Act would not apply
to abandoned sites because the inspection frequency requirements of that section speak only to surface coal mining
and reclamation operations covered by a permit and a permit that is expired or revoked is no longer considered to be
in existence. Without expressing any view about whether the Secretary's proposed reading of Section 517(c) of the
Act was permissible, the court of appeals pointed out that the district court remanded the 1988 rule to the Secretary
``to be withdrawn or revised'' and, in light of this statement, the district court's decision does not stand in the
way of the Secretary proceeding with an alternative rulemaking on the subject of inspection frequently at abandoned
sites. See 

NWF

 v. 

Lujan,

 Civ. Action Nos. 890136, 88-3345 & 88-2416, U.S. App. Ct. (DC Circ., December 10, 1991) mem. op. at
10. Accordingly, on December 18, 1992, OSM proposed for public comment an alternative abandoned sites rule upon which
today's final rule is based (57 FR 60410). 

The Secretary is required under section 201(c)(2) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1211(c)(2), to publish necessary implementing
rules. Since regular inspections of abandoned sites are a counterproductive use of limited resources, and since
fewer inspections are not likely to result in increased environmental harm, the rule being promulgated today is necessary
and is consistent with the district court's opinion in 

NWF

 v. 

Lujan,

 which struck down the previous 1988 abandoned sites rule. 

In promulgating the 1988 rule on abandoned sites, OSM concluded that repeated inspections of abandoned sites at the
frequency required under the existing rules are ineffective expenditures of resources and that fewer inspections
would not result in increased harm to the environment or reduce the likelihood of ultimate compliance at abandoned
sites. The time inspectors spend at abandoned sites detracts from the time they can spend at other active or inactive
sites working with viable operators to abate present violations and prevent future violations. Thus, reducing the
frequency of abandoned sites improves the overall quality and effectiveness of inspection programs under the Act.

Enforcement actions issued as a result of inspections at abandoned sites have proven to be ineffective at compelling
abatement of violations or achieving reclamation. Moreover, inspectors normally have cited all violations prior
to or shortly after a site becomes abandoned. The persons responsible for abating these violations typically are
financially insolvent or cannot be located. In such instances, even when diligent efforts are made to enforce the
Act, no one is available to abate violations or to perform or pay for the needed reclamation. Continuing regular partial
and complete inspection of these sites serves no useful purpose and wastes finite inspection resources. To illustrate
the extent of this waste, OSM has in the past conducted approximately 2,900 inspections each year on an average of 236
abandoned sites in Tennessee. This effort comprises approximately 32 percent of the inspections in that State; however,
few, if any, of these inspections have resulted in abatement of violations or completion of reclamation.

OSM experience has shown that environmental conditions at most abandoned sites do not significantly degrade what
has been observed during prior inspections and that violations of substantive performance standards do not necessarily
deteriorate to imminent danger or harm situations. While these sites do not comply with the Act, many, due to their
age or because they were partially reclaimed prior to abandonment, become reasonably well stabilized through natural
settlement and revegetation occurring over time.

While the stated goal of section 517 of the Act is to ``enforce the requirements of and carry out the purposes of [the]
Act,'' inspecting abandoned sites as frequently as other sites covered by a permit frustrates rather than furthers
this goal. Among the mechanisms provided by the Act to achieve the stated goals of section 517(c) are civil penalties
under section 518, performance bonds under section 509 and 519, citizen suits under section 520, and enforcement
under section 521. Each of these mechanisms has as its underlying premise the existence of a person against whom an
action can be taken, or of a bond that can provide the funds to abate violations and secure reclamation. If no such person
can be found, or if the regulatory authority is taking other appropriate legal actions to ensure reclamation or abatement,
and any permit has been revoked and any bond is being forfeited, issuing multiple violation notices and cessation
orders and assessing uncollectible penalties as a result of the fixed inspection frequency requirement are not productive
tools to enforce the Act. The waste of resources also extends beyond the inspector level as other units within the regulatory
authority must assess and attempt to collect civil penalties. Under the foregoing circumstances, inspections of
abandoned sites performed at a minimum frequency less than that for other sites based on the particular characteristics
of the site are a far more reasonable and realistic alternative. Moreover, the conservation of resources that will
flow from this rule promotes the principles embodied in OSM's mission and vision statement by creating fair and more
efficient and effective processes for achieving the objectives of the Act.



II. Discussion of Final Rule and Response to Public Comments



Section 840.10



Section 840.10 is being revised to include an estimate of the average public reporting burden for the collections
of information under all of Part 840 as such part is revised by this final rule. The section also lists the addresses
for OSM and the Office of Management and Budget where comments on the information collection requirements may be sent.



Combined Section-by-Section Analysis



Since the revisions adopted for State regulatory authorities at 840.11 are identical to those adopted at 842.11 where
OSM is the regulatory authority, they will be combined for ease of discussion.

Section 840.11(g)(4)(i)/842.11(e)(i).


These sections are being adopted as proposed. They require that before a site could meet the definition of ``abandoned
site,'' the permit covering the surface coal mining and reclamation operation must be either revoked or expired.
The existing rules allow a site to be classified as abandoned on the basis that permit revocation proceedings have
only been initiated and are being pursued diligently.
The final provision will have two effects. First, a person who has not or will not respond to enforcement action issued
by the regulatory authority and who cannot or will not meet his/her obligations to abate violations or complete reclamation
will not be entitled to resume coal production under a valid permit. Second, the constraints of section 517(c) of the
Act would be lifted for abandoned sites since the fixed inspection frequency requirements of that section apply only
to surface coal mining and reclamation operations covered by each permit. The preamble to OSM's final rule at 30 CFR
773.11, Requirements to obtain permits, articulated and codified the concept that a surface coal mining permit is
required only where surface coal mining operations defined under section 701(28) of the Act are occurring and that
if this authorization to extract coal expires or is revoked, it amounts to the absence or the non-existence of the permit
that once was in force (i.e. the minesite is no longer considered to be covered by a permit). Of course, this does not
affect the permittee's legal obligation to reclaim a site that has been abandoned, since, in accordance with 30 CFR
733.11, that obligation continues until all reclamation is completed, regardless of whether the authorization
to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired or has been revoked. See 54 FR 13814 (April 5, 1989).
The National Wildlife Federation and the Kentucky Resources Council, Inc. (hereafter NWF) concurred with this change
to the definition of abandoned site to the extent that the plain language of the term ``abandoned site'' suggests that
there should not be an existing permit that is renewable or revisable by the operator.
The Joint National Coal Association and American Mining Congress on Surface Mining Regulations (NCA/AMC), the National
Coal Association (NCA) and the Kentucky Coal Association supported this revision saying that the proposed rule differs
significantly from the abandoned sites rule remanded in 1990 because the proposed rule defines ``abandoned sites''
to include only those sites whose permits have either expired or been revoked. Because the Act's inspection requirements
only apply to operations under permit, they believe that the revised definition can no longer be considered inconsistent
with section 517(c) of the Act and consequently, the district court's earlier criticism of OSM's statutory interpretation
is no longer valid. They added that neither the language nor legislative history of the statute indicates any intent
that the regulatory authority continue to expend its resources to inspect an abandoned site where no activities listed
in section 701(28) of the Act are currently conducted and enforcement action has proven futile in compelling the correction
of prior violations. Finally, they believed that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia gave tacit
approval for OSM's revised reading of the ``covered by each permit'' language of section 517(c) because the court
clearly would have rejected OSM's announced efforts before the court to undertake a curative rulemaking using this
revised reading if it perceived such a reading as inconsistent with the Act.
OSM agrees with the commenters, except for the proposition that the U.S. Court of Appeals decision concerning the
remanded 1988 abandoned sites rule amounts to tacit approval of the Secretary's ``covered by each permit'' reading
of Section 517(c). The Secretary requested the appeals court to vacate the district court's opinion remanding the
1988 abandoned sites rule because he believed that step was necessary before engaging in a new rulemaking based on
the interpretation that abandoned sites for which the permits have expired or been revoked are not subject to section
517(c) of the Act. In declining the Secretary's request to vacate, the appeals court stated ``We express no view about
the validity of the Secretary's proposed reading. The significant point on this appeal is that the district court's
decision does not stand in the way of the Secretary adopting it in a new rulemaking.'' Whether or not the revised reading
set forth as a basis for this rule would be sustained by the appeals court will only be known if this rule becomes ripe
for a decision before that judicial body.
A State regulatory authority (SRA) said it would make more sense to require the permit to be revoked/expired ``or''
actually be forfeited. This could be accomplished by replacing the word ``and'' by the word ``or'' and deleting the
phrase ``has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture of'' in subparagraph (ii). The commenter explained
that bond forfeiture proceedings may not always be accomplished concurrently with permit expiration, that if a permit
expires there may not be a reason to immediately forfeit the bond and by requiring both expiration and forfeiture to
occur simultaneously could be a waste of manpower and funds. This comment is not being adopted. As discussed above,
allowing a reduction from the inspection requirements of section 517(c) of the Act under this rule is based on the premise
that revocation or expiration of a permit is a necessary prerequisite in order for an abandoned site not to be considered
``covered by a permit.'' If, as the commenter suggests, bond forfeiture is an alternative to revocation or expiration,
an abandoned site could not escape the constraints of section 517(c) of the Act since bond forfeiture does not necessarily
require permit revocation. In view of the often prolonged process of bond forfeiture, this final section of the rule
does not require that bond forfeiture be completed, but rather that it be initiated and diligently pursued and thus,
the rule will have more immediate applicability.


Section 840.11(g)(4)(ii)/842.11(e)(4)(ii).


To qualify under the definition of ``abandoned site,'' the existing rules require that the regulatory authority
has initiated and is diligently pursuing forfeiture of, or has forfeited, the performance bond. These sections are
being revised by adding the phrase ``any available'' before the phrase ``performance bond.'' This change is minor
and is intended to recognize that there is a relatively small number of sites that are or were permitted, but for which
a performance bond was never required or no longer exists. The absence of a performance bond has no bearing on whether
a site should be classified as abandoned for inspection purposes.

NWF supported the addition of the phrase ``any available'' agreeing that the absence of a performance bond has no bearing
on whether a site should be classified and abandoned for inspection purposes. One SRA, noting the time lag between
initiation of bond forfeiture and actual collection, supported the proposal to allow reduction of inspections while
the regulatory authority is diligently pursuing bond forfeiture. This commenter believed that inspection resources
would be used much more efficiently by this change. Another SRA commented that this provision should include those
sites where no reclamation bond is available due to insolvency of surety companies. These sections are being adopted
as proposed. To address the latter SRA's concern, if no performance bond exists because of the insolvency of a surety
company, then under this rule a performance bond would not be considered available.



Sections 840.11(h) introductory text/842.11(f) introductory text



These sections as proposed provided that the regulatory authority shall inspect each abandoned site at a rate of no
less than one complete inspection per calendar year. This minimum inspection frequency is being retained under this
final rule. However, the language has been revised to provide that the regulatory authority shall inspect each abandoned
site on a set frequency commensurate with the public health and safety and environmental considerations present
at each specific site, but in no case shall the inspection frequency be set at less than one complete inspection per
calendar year. This revised language emphasizes the requirement that the regulatory authority must tailor an appropriate
frequency to the site-specific conditions that exist at each mine. That frequency could vary from one to twelve or
more per calendar year.

Most commenters supported a reduced inspection frequency for abandoned sites and commended OSM for taking the initiative
on this rulemaking. Eight SRAs voiced strong support for the rule. One SRA stated that, based on its long history of
regulating coal mining operations, it supported OSM's conclusions that fewer inspections of certain abandoned
sites would not harm the environment; the States' finite resources could be used more effectively; all significant
violations are cited prior to abandonment; and that abandoned sites often remain stable over the course of several
years. Another SRA stated that its inspection staff is being required to inspect abandoned sites regularly under
circumstances that serve absolutely no purpose other than to meet an arbitrary inspection mandate and that eliminating
or curtailing redundant inspections will greatly improve the efficiency of its inspection staff. A third SRA said
that in these days of increasingly restrictive State and Federal budgets, it is imperative that our resources are
effectively allocated to further the purposes of the Act and that the time spent inspecting abandoned sites detracts
from the time that can be spent to ensure compliance at non-abandoned sites. Finally, a fourth SRA maintained that
the States continue to be best suited and capable of deciding the appropriate frequency for inspection of abandoned
sites where all other enforcement measures have failed to force compliance.

The Interstate Mining Compact Commission (IMCC), which represents the natural resource interests of its 17 member
States, strongly supported the rule agreeing with OSM's analysis and conclusions in the preamble to the proposed
rule and noting that the States would not support a situation where environmentally sensitive sites are left unattended,
unabated, or without meaningful followup in the way of alternative enforcement proceedings such as those required
in the proposed rule.

The NCA and the Kentucky Coal Association fully supported the proposed rule, characterizing it as a proper exercise
of OSM's discretion to provide regulatory authorities the necessary flexibility to deploy limited resources in
an efficient manner. The NCA/AMC also supported the rule pointing out that along with the rules practical benefits,
the regulatory history of the Act shows that there is precedent for the selective inspection of mines that pose no threat
to the environment as exemplified by the 1982 revised Federal rules that allowed a reduction in the partial inspection
frequency for ``inactive'' operations.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that it is not unreasonable for OSM to conduct complete
inspections twice a year at a minimum on sites causing or likely to cause water pollution or other nonpoint source problems.
However, the EPA recommended that the rule include criteria upon which the frequency of inspections would be based,
including the potential for the site to become further degraded. As discussed later in this preamble, the final rule
will incorporate criteria, including a criterion similar to that suggested by EPA, that must be taken into consideration
and documented before regulatory authorities can reduce inspection frequencies at abandoned sites.

One commenter said that OSM'S statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that reducing inspections at abandoned
sites ``would allow the regulatory authorities to redirect those inspection resources to operations where inspection
and enforcement would achieve the intended results'' points to the failure of regulatory authorities to achieve
the intended results in the first place by preventing non-compliance through inspection and enforcement during
the mining and reclamation phases. The commenter questioned why OSM is not concerning itself with how to prevent abandonment
rather than a way to assist operators through reduced inspections. The commenter added that since existing regulations
require adequate bond be in place, abandonment becomes irrelevant if those regulations are properly implemented.

OSM concurs with the commenter's view that not enough has been done in the past to prevent abandonment and will place
greater emphasis on prevention. Prevention of environmental problems and inadequate performance bonds often associated
with abandoned sites are priorities to OSM and the agency will work with the States to improve efforts in these key areas.
This rule promotes a policy of prevention because it frees resources that can focus on existing or potential problems
at high risk sites that would result in long term adverse effects or reclamation difficulties in the event of abandonment.

The NWF opposed the proposed reduction in the minimum inspection frequency for abandoned sites because it allegedly
fails to provide adequately for the protection of public health and safety and the environment from the adverse impacts
of improperly conducted coal mining and operations, and therefore contravenes the underlying purpose of the Act.
They maintained that the dramatic reduction in frequency or even elimination of inspections altogether at abandoned
sites as proposed would unquestionably heighten the risk that site conditions may worsen to create an imminent harm
and trigger violations of on-or-off site performance standards in addition to those violations already cited by
a regulatory authority. NWF stated that abandoned sites need to be monitored to avert deterioration of site conditions
into imminent harms, to ensure no uncited violations exist, to provide early warning to the public in the event of imminent
harm and to determine or prioritize sites that are eligible for abandoned mine lands funding. They urged that OSM withdraw
this proposal, or at a minimum, that a more carefully designed, comprehensive clear and precise rule, explained in
greater detail, be substituted.

NWF asserts that the proposed rule is deficient because: (1) It is excessively permissive in delegating decision
making to the regulatory authority without a meaningful check based on specified criteria or site characteristics
guiding reductions in frequency; (2) there is an absence of binding criteria for ``tailoring'' inspection schedules
for sites requiring more than the minimum one inspection per year, but less than currently required 12 per year; and
(3) while OSM indicates in the preamble that regulatory authorities may subsequently readjust a reduced frequency
as new information about the conditions at a site become available, there are no criteria for what would trigger such
a readjustment. 

NWF agrees, however, for some abandoned sites, rigid adherence to the inspection requirements under Section 517(c)
of the Act may be a poor expenditure of limited inspection resources and to the extent that the change to the definition
of ``abandoned site'' enables regulatory authorities to make limited reductions in inspection frequencies without
offending the language of Section 517(c), the rule is a sensible one. However, they state that any change to the definition
of ``abandoned site'' in order to allow reductions in inspection frequencies must be accompanied by a comprehensive
regulatory program such as that they outline below. They assert that failure of OSM to promulgate abandoned site inspection
rules fitting this description would offend the purpose of the Act as a whole, even where the ``covered by each permit''
definitional change of ``abandoned site'' has rendered Section 517(c) no longer at issue. 

NWF asserts that, as part of their suggested program, any attempt to reduce inspection frequencies must begin by creating
a categorical exclusion for which there can be no reduction from the existing requirements of 12 inspections per year.
This exclusion should at a minimum include sites with potentially unstable structures, such as impoundments or hollow
or valley fills, and sites with existing on-or-off site impacts, such as acid mine drainage. Moreover, NWF urged that,
where abandoned sites are not categorically excluded from any reduction in inspection frequency, they should remain
subject to an absolute minimum frequency of one complete inspection per year and not have their inspection frequencies
eliminated altogether as the rule would allow. 

The comprehensive detailed inspection program suggested by NWF would also need to include the following: (1) Quantitative
inspection requirements like the existing rule including an absolute minimum (e.g. one complete inspection per
year); (2) a standardized or regionalized protocol so that criteria are applied consistently across different inspectors
and different regulatory authority jurisdictions or regions; (3) specific written findings for all relevant on-and-off
site performance standard parameters and public health and safety concerns; (4) based on quantitative inspection
data charted over time, a published table for which the regulatory authority could proceed to the appropriate coordinates
to determine the appropriate inspection frequency and trigger any necessary subsequent adjustments; and (5) traceable
written documentation relating to inspection frequencies at abandoned sites amenable to administrative review.


Finally, NWF's suggested comprehensive program also would include opportunities for structured public participation
in the decision making process. NWF contends that OSM's regulation should begin with a rebuttable presumption that
inspection frequencies should not be reduced from currently required levels unless that presumption can be overcome
by an affirmative showing of reasonableness and general public notice, specific personal notice to identifiable
parties that might be adversely affected by on-or-off site impacts, and public comment periods for all proposed changes
in frequency. Also, if the regulatory authority demonstrates that a reduced frequency is appropriate, NWF asserts
that there should be a general provision granting reasonable citizen access, when requested in writing, to inspect
any areas of the site that would otherwise be inaccessible except to the regulatory authority. 

NWF charges that the absence of any discussion of why OSM has not developed a more comprehensive and structured abandoned
sites inspection program is offensive to established principles of administrative law. Citing 

National Wildlife Federation 

v. 

Hodel, 

839 F.2d 694 (1988), NWF points out that the court condemned precisely the type of conclusory rulemaking OSM has undertaken
with its current proposal, ``The Secretary * * * if he determines that there is no need to `flesh out'
the statute, must `flesh out' his explanations so that we can review the rationality of his decision.'' In light of
this clear directive, NWF asserts OSM must at a minimum, repropose this rule and explain to the public why it is declining
to establish a detailed regulatory program. 

OSM set forth an adequate explanation of its rationale underlying the proposed rule that has been greatly supplemented
with the preamble discussion and response to comments in this final rule. OSM appreciates NWF's views and has decided
to adopt most of the elements of NWF's program in this final rule. OSM will include in the final rule NWF's recommendation
for an absolute minimum inspection frequency of not less than one complete inspection per calendar year, criteria
for ``tailoring'' inspection schedules for sites requiring more than one inspection per year, and a requirement
for specific and traceable written findings by the regulatory authority based on relevant environmental and public
health and safety concerns and newspaper advertisement providing the opportunity for public comment on any proposed
reduction in inspections of abandoned sites. These adopted provisions are discussed below and under the discussion
of final   840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1). OSM considered, but is not adopting, NWF's request for quantitative
fixed inspection frequencies in the form of categorical exclusions, standardized or regionalized protocols, published
``matrix'' tables, or public access to abandoned sites for inspection purposes in light of the opportunities already
available under existing regulations. 

Under this final rule the responsibility for selection of the appropriate inspection frequency necessary to comply
with this rule rests with the expertise and judgment of each regulatory authority, guided by specific written findings
required in the final rule. With site-specific historical knowledge at hand and through their experience with local
conditions and informal consultations with affected residents, the regulatory authorities are well qualified
to identify sites with the potential for harm and to carefully tailor an appropriate inspection frequency for individual
abandoned sites, each of which is unique, both in terms of its physical environment and the problems it presents. This
rule will maintain the regulatory authority's responsibility for administering its regulatory program consistent
with congressional intent to have primary regulatory authority rest with the States.

OSM is not adopting categorical exclusions or other fixed inspection frequencies for abandoned sites beyond the
minimum one per year because to do so would merely substitute one inflexible frequency for another and thus fail to
achieve fully the goal of eliminating counterproductive inspections. An arbitrary fixed inspection frequency
cannot account for the unique physical environment at each abandoned site nor the variation of problems that each
abandoned site may pose. A fixed predetermined frequency is just as likely to yield too many inspections, or too few
inspections, as it is to yield a suitable number. Categorical exclusions or inclusions also would almost certainly
result in inappropriate applications of the rule in many cases. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals explicitly acknowledged
the legal defensibility of OSM's ``flexible'' implementation of statutes that allow regulatory authorities to
consider the myriad site specific situations that cannot be fully anticipated in writing a Federal regulation. 

NWF 

v. 

Hodel, 

839 F.2d 694, 745 (D.C. Cir. 1988). However, nothing in this rule would preclude regulatory authorities from establishing
for administrative convenience categories of sites with similar characteristics and evaluating and documenting
the necessary inspection frequency for each category as a whole.

As previously discussed, the reason inspections of abandoned sites at the frequency imposed under section 517(c)
of the Act are counterproductive and a waste of resources is that enforcement actions at the inspector level are no
longer effective. Alternative enforcement that must be initiated beyond the level of inspectors is generally the
only viable means to compel abatement of violations or completion of reclamation at abandoned sites, even if conditions
deteriorate. Where the regulatory authority is taking all appropriate enforcement action available to it as required
under the definition of ``abandoned site,'' nothing more can be done through repeated inspections to reclaim a site
or abate violations than is already occurring. Thus, while a fixed inspection frequency like that for active sites
under the existing rules might cause the regulatory authority to be informed of a problem at an abandoned site more
quickly, it will not provide any new remedy to compel compliance. Accordingly, OSM believes that the inspection frequency
program under this rule strikes a sound balance between the fixed inspection frequency required for active and inactive
sites and the need to periodically, but not less than once per year, inspect abandoned sites to monitor environmental
conditions or other changes in the status of a site and to ensure bond forfeiture reclamation priorities are adjusted
as necessary.

Since OSM is accepting NWF's suggestion to set an absolute minimum inspection frequency of not less than one complete
inspection per year,   840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1) will not be adopted as proposed. Those proposed sections
would have enabled the regulatory authority to further reduce the minimum inspection frequency required under paragraphs
(h) introductory text and (f) introductory text, possibly to zero, if, based on no less than three consecutive complete
annual inspections conducted during a three-year period before or after the effective date of this rule, the regulatory
authority would have found in writing that an abandoned site satisfies two criteria. The first criterion would have
been that no conditions or structures existed at the site that could have created an imminent danger to the health or
safety of the public or an imminent harm to the environment. The second criterion would have been that the site had become
reasonably stable through natural settlement or revegetation processes.

Eight SRAs, the NCA/AMC, the NCA and the Kentucky Coal Association supported these proposed provisions without providing
substantive comments. The NWF was strongly opposed. It commented that under this proposal, inspections at some abandoned
sites could be discontinued altogether even where serious deterioration of conditions occurred subsequent to the
decision to suspend inspections indefinitely. They said that no State or Federal regulatory authority would have
the duty to revisit the abandoned site and would have every administrative and budgetary incentive not to.

OSM acknowledges NWF's concern over the potential for misapplication of these proposed sections. While some abandoned
sites may be so stable and so operationally defunct as to make further inspections completely unnecessary, OSM believes
that deletion of these provisions will act as a safeguard against premature termination of inspections at what could
be a large number of abandoned sites where conditions do not justify ending inspections altogether. OSM believes
that monitoring each abandoned site at least once per year to evaluate the environmental conditions, operational
status, and the bond forfeiture reclamation priority is reasonable public policy that would not excessively strain
the resources of Federal or State regulatory authorities, especially since many abandoned sites are located near
active and inactive sites requiring frequent inspections. Moreover, there must be some minimum in place to ensure
that each abandoned site continues to be inspected at a frequency commensurate with public safety and environmental
considerations present at each specific site as required under the final rule. Also, if there were no minimum frequency,
the regulatory authority might not become aware, other than from information provided by citizens, that conditions
had worsened to the point that a higher alternative frequency would need to be set in order for the frequency to be commensurate
with the deteriorating conditions.

Turning to NWF's recommendation that the rule contain enhanced opportunities for public participation in the abandoned
sites inspection process, OSM is including a public notice provision that provides the general public with the opportunity
to submit written comments to the regulatory authority when concerns are raised as to a particular inspection frequency
adjustment. This enhancement coupled with opportunities for private citizen involvement in the inspection process
already provided under other regulations and discussed below will provide ample public participation in the inspection
of abandoned sites. 30 CFR 842.14 provides that any person who is or may be adversely affected by a surface coal mining
and reclamation operation may notify the Director in writing of any alleged failure on the part of OSM to make adequate
and complete periodic inspections and the Director must respond with a determination including any actions to be
taken to remedy any noncompliance. When a person provides OSM with reason to believe that there exists any violation
at an abandoned site, that person may request a Federal inspection and has the right to accompany the inspector during
the inspection. To the extent a person is not satisfied with a Federal inspector's decision not to inspect or enforce,
the person is entitled to informal review of that decision by the Director of OSM, and can subsequently appeal to the
Office of Hearings and Appeals within DOI. Finally, 30 CFR 840.15 provides that each State program shall provide for
public participation in the enforcement of the State program consistent with the Federal provisions cited above.
OSM encourages States to work with potentially affected citizens where a concern arises for a particular minesite.
The ability and willingness of State regulatory authorities to work closely with citizens is clearly recognized
in OSM's mission and vision statement and is a key part of making the Act work successfully. As part of its oversight
duties, OSM will monitor the willingness of States to be responsive to the concerns of citizens and to allow them full
access to information needed to evaluate the effect of mining on their health, safety, general welfare and property.


Final Sections 840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1)


As discussed above, sections 840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1) are not being adopted as proposed, but instead are being
revised. Under the final rule, before proceeding to reduce the inspection frequency at any abandoned site as authorized
under 840.11(h) introductory text/842.11(f) introductory text, the regulatory authority must first conduct a
complete inspection of the site. On that basis and on the basis of comments received during the public notice period
required under this paragraph, the regulatory authority shall prepare and maintain for public review and Federal
oversight purposes a written finding justifying the alternative inspection frequency selected. The prerequisite
complete inspection is an on-site status review of all applicable performance standards conducted with an eye towards
the long term effects of reducing the inspection frequency. Regulatory authorities shall make the written finding
immediately available to OSM and the public in the area of mining in accordance with 30 CFR 840.14, 

Availability of records.

 To assist the public and OSM in reviewing written findings in a meaningful and expeditious manner, regulatory authorities
are expected under this provision to maintain or be able to generate within a reasonable time a current compilation
or index of all abandoned sites for which an inspection frequency adjustment has been made under this rule. Each written
finding shall justify a reduced inspection frequency by affirmatively addressing in detail all of the following
criteria.


(h)(1)(i)/(f)(1)(i)


As a prerequisite to any reduction in inspection frequency, the regulatory authority must explain how the site meets
each of the criteria under the definition of an abandoned site under 30 CFR 840.11(g)/842.11(e). Meeting these criteria
demonstrates that the regulatory authority has taken, and continues to be in the process of taking, all available
enforcement within its reach under its regulatory program to secure abatement of violations and completion of reclamation
at an abandoned site.


(h)(1)(ii)/(f)(1)(ii)


The regulatory authority must document whether there exist impoundments, earthen structures or other conditions
such as acid mine drainage that pose, or reasonably may be expected to progress into, imminent dangers to the health
and safety of the public or significant environmental harms to land, air, or water resources as defined under 30 CFR
701.5. Depending on the circumstances, this criterion alone may be sufficient to warrant no reduction in inspection
frequency or at least selection of a frequency in the high range. Even though there may be no remedy immediately available
to abate any such dangers or harms, frequent monitoring can serve to give advance warning to the public or appropriate
government agencies and serve as a basis to expedite reclamation or abatement of dangers or harms through the bond
forfeiture process.


(h)(1)(iii)/(f)(1)(iii)


The regulatory authority must document the extent to which existing impoundments or earthen structures were constructed
and certified in accordance with prudent engineering practices and designs approved in the permit. This could be
beneficial in support of a reduced frequency since structures such as ponds, head of hollow and valley fills, coal
waste refuse piles, backfills or impoundments pose less risk of failure when constructed as designed and certified
than structures that were not.

(h)(1)(iv)/(f)(1)(iv)



This criterion addresses the degree to which erosion and sediment control are present and functioning. Monitoring
for damage caused by off-site sedimentation may need to be more frequent where there are extensive or critically located
areas of loose soils that are not controlled by any or by non-functioning sediment controls. 



(h)(1)(v)(f)(1)(v)

 



Another factor to be considered by the regulatory authority is the proximity of the abandoned site to urbanized areas,
communities, occupied dwellings, schools, and other public or commercial buildings and facilities. This criterion
will become either more or less important depending on the regulatory authority's findings under the other criteria.




(h)(1)(vi)/(f)(1)(vi)

 



This criterion concerns the extent of reclamation conducted prior to abandonment and the degree of stability of unreclaimed
areas. Abandoned sites vary widely in this respect, ranging from no reclamation at all to various combinations of
backfilling, grading, revegetation, and bond release. 



(h)(1)(vii)/(f)(1)(vii)

 



This last criterion requires the regulatory authority to document the rate at which adverse environmental or public
health and safety conditions have and can be expected to progressively deteriorate based on the record of complete
and partial inspection reports during the last two consecutive years of inspections of the site. This snapshot through
time can be useful in predicting whether adverse conditions can be expected in the future and their rate of acceleration,
which may have an important bearing on justifying any reduction in inspection frequency. 



Final Sections 840.11(h)(2)/842.11(f)(2) 

 



In response to public comment, this section is being added to require the regulatory authority to advertise each proposed
frequency reduction in the newspaper with the broadest circulation in the locality of the abandoned site. The public
will be provided a 30 day period in which to submit written comments. Paragraph (h)(2)(ii)/(f)(2)(ii) specifies
the nature of the information that at a minimum must be contained in the public notice. Nothing in this section precludes
the regulatory authority from consolidating more than one permit into the same advertisement as long as all the information
required reflects site-specific differences in the permits included. It is expected that the regulatory authority
will give careful consideration to the comments it receives and work with the public to arrive at an inspection frequency
acceptable to all parties with an interest.
