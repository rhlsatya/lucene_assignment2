SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION





Small Business Development Centers


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Small Business Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Small Business Administration (SBA) is proposing regulations governing the Small Business Development Center
(SBDC) Program. Since the enactment of Pub. L. 96-302 and the establishment of the program in 1980, the program
has been operating under direct statutory authority, without regulations. The SBA is proposing these regulations
to establish a framework for effective and efficient operation of the program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The SBDC Program, originally established in 1980, is administered pursuant to Section 21 of the Small Business Act,
15 U.S.C. 648. The SBDC program creates a partnership between the SBA and organizations operating the SBDC networks.
Together they provide business development and technical assistance to small businesses in order to promote growth,
expansion, innovation, increased productivity, and management improvement. The SBDC program has been operating
under direct statutory authority without regulations. The SBA is proposing these regulations to establish a framework
for effective and efficient operation of the program. Many of the provisions set forth in this proposed rule have arisen
from legislation. Others codify current procedures utilized since the inception of the program.


Section-by-Section Analysis


Proposed  130.100 would serve as the introduction, establishing the overall objective of the SBDC program
to create a broader-based system of assistance for the small business community, and defining the relationship between
the SBA and the organizations operating the SBDC networks, known as recipient organizations. The program operates
under the general management and oversight of the SBA, with recognition that a partnership exists between the SBA
and the recipient organization for the provision of assistance to the small business community. That assistance
is delivered to the small business community pursuant to a Cooperative Agreement negotiated between the SBA and the
organization operating the SBDC network.
Proposed  130.110 would provide definitions of terms relevant to the SBDC program.
Proposed  130.200 would set forth those entities which, by statute, are eligible to enter into a Cooperative
Agreement with the SBA for the purpose of establishing or continuing the operation of an SBDC network.
Proposed  130.310 would provide that the area of service for any SBDC network is the state or portion of a state
in which it is located. When more than one SBDC network is to be located in a given state, the AA/SBDCs shall determine
the general geographic areas to be served by each SBDC network in that state.
Proposed  130.320 would discuss the location of participants in the SBDC network, and proposed  130.330
would set forth the operating requirements for the SBDC network.
Proposed  130.340 would provide for the establishment of State and National Advisory Boards to advise, counsel,
and confer with SBDC directors and the AA/SBDCs on matters pertaining to the operation of SBDC networks and the national
SBDC program.
Proposed  130.350 would describe the services to be provided by SBDC networks to ensure convenient access and
effective service to small businesses, including specialized services such as international trade assistance,
rural development, procurement assistance, capital formation and technical assistance. It would also place certain
restrictions on SBDC assistance. SBDCs would be prohibited from making loans, servicing loans or making credit decisions.
SBDCs would also be prohibited from making credit recommendations, unless authorized to do so by the Administrator,
or his or her designee.

Proposed  130.360 would set forth policy development responsibilities of the SBA and performance implementation
responsibilities of the SBDC Director.

Proposed  130.400 would describe the application process for both new and continuing applicants. Pursuant
to  130.410, a new applicant organization would be required to submit an original and two copies of its application
to the SBA District Office covering the geographic area in which the applicant organization proposes to provide services.

Additionally, in order to insure consistency with the current state plan approved by SBA, an application for initial
funding would be required to include a letter from the Governor, or his or her designee, of the State in which the applicant
organization will operate, or other evidence that it is not inconsistent with such plan. No such requirement would
be imposed on subsequent applications from current operating SBDC organizations.

The section would further set forth the information to be contained in the application.

Proposed  130.420 would set forth annual application procedures for applicants continuing in the program.
These would be set forth in the annual Program Announcement, along with the due date for submission of continuing applications.

Section 130.430 would set forth the three possible decisions in the application process, approval, conditional
approval or rejection. The section would further describe the right of the SBA, in the event of a conditional approval,
to conditionally fund a recipient organization for one or more specified periods not exceeding one Budget period.

Proposed  130.440 would set forth the manner by which the maximum amount of a grant is determined, as well as the
significant factors to be considered in the allocation of national SBDC funds.

Proposed  130.450 would delineate the requirements concerning Matching Funds. This section would explain
that a recipient organization must provide total Matching Funds equal to the total amount of the SBDC grant and all
amendments or modifications thereto. The section would further detail responsibilities for identification of
all sources of Matching Funds, including cash and cash accounts, and set forth types of sources which may not be used
as sources of Matching Funds. The section would finally describe the ways that overmatched amounts (Matching Funds
which exceed the required equal match) may be utilized by the SBDC.

Proposed  130.460 would delineate the information to be included in the proposal and in the budget justification
portion of an application. The section would include descriptions of important concepts and principles required
to be addressed by the applicant in the proposed budget, including the percentage of federal dollars which must be
allocated to Direct costs of program delivery, the inclusion of separate budgets and Indirect cost base and rate agreements
for the Lead Center and all SBDC service providers, principles for determining allowable costs and expenses, limitations
on the use of federal dollars for lobbying activities, salary guidelines for SBDC Directors, subcenter Directors
and staff members and guidelines for transportation and travel expenses. With respect to Indirect cost base rates,
the section would provide that the service provider's predetermined rate from prior federal activity would be used,
and, in the event a service provider does not already have a predetermined rate as a result of dealings with another
federal agency, the manner in which the rate shall be negotiated.

Proposed  130.470 would describe the activities and services for which an SBDC may charge a fee.

Proposed  130.480 would provide that program income must be utilized to accomplish program objectives and
would include directions concerning reporting requirements and limitations on the use of program income for Matching
Funds contributions.

Section 130.500 would provide that federal dollars are transferred to the SBDC through the SBA internal ``Letter
of Credit Replacement System'', and would set forth the standard forms to be utilized to draw down funds and to report
drawdowns and cash transactions to the SBA.

Proposed  130.600 would describe the Cooperative Agreement entered into between the recipient organization
and the SBA, as well as the procedures established to resolve Disputes and Conflicts.

Section 130.610 would describe the general terms to be included in the Cooperative Agreement.

Section 130.620 would provide the procedure for amending or revising a Cooperative Agreement due to changes in the
scope, work or funding of an SBDC during the budget year, and would set forth those changes which require an amendment.
The section would further set forth those revisions or changes which do not require an amendment to the Cooperative
Agreement, such as budget revisions or reallocations of funds in accordance with applicable OMB circulars.

Proposed   130.630, 130.640 and 130.650 would respectively set forth Dispute resolution procedures,
Conflict resolution procedures and the non-renewal procedure to be utilized by SBA in the event of non-performance
or poor performance on the part of an SBDC.

Proposed  130.700 would explain the grounds and procedures for suspending or terminating a recipient organization.
After the SBA has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with a recipient organization, the SBA would not suspend or
terminate any such agreement unless the SBA provides the recipient organization with written notification setting
forth the reasons for the proposed action and affording the recipient organization an opportunity for a hearing,
appeal, or other administrative proceeding under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553


et seq.

The general procedures that would be applicable are contained in 13 CFR 143.43 and 143.44, Enforcement and Termination
for Convenience, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local
Governments, and in OMB Circular A-110, Attachment L, Suspension and Termination Procedures for Grants and
Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Nonprofit Organizations, Uniform Administrative
Requirements.

Proposed  130.800 would explain that the SBA would have the authority to review and oversee the Cooperative
Agreement and ongoing operations of the SBDC network. In addition, the SBA would have the authority to make programmatic
and financial review visits to Lead Centers and SBDC service providers to analyze and assess training, counseling
and any other SBDC related activities. Furthermore, an on-site evaluation of an SBDC network would be conducted by
the SBA, with SBDC participation, as required by law.

Additionally, this section would provide that the recordkeeping requirements of the SBDC network shall be as set
forth in OMB Circulars A-128 and A-133.

Proposed  130.830 would also state that all audits are to be conducted in accordance with provisions governing
audits contained in applicable OMB Circulars.



Compliance With Executive Orders 12612, 12778 and 12866; Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.; and the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 35



The SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final, would not be considered a significant rule within
the meaning of Executive Order 12866 because it would not have an annual economic effect in excess of $100 million,
result in a major increase in costs for individuals or governments, or have a significant adverse effect on competition.
The SBA has made this determination based upon the fact that this proposed rule would establish regulations which
conform to the existing parameters under which the program is already functioning. Further, pursuant to Public Law
103-121, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and the Related Agencies Appropriations
Act of 1994, the total amount of funds designated for the SBDC Program is $71,266,000.

For purposes of Executive Order 12612, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule would have federalism implications.
As such, the SBA offers the following Federalism Assessment.

This proposed rule would implement Section 21 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 648, and is designed to allow the
States participating in the SBDC Program maximum policymaking and administrative discretion within the requirements
of the law and sound program management. In formulating and implementing the policies governing the SBDC Program
set forth in this proposed rule, the SBA has encouraged the State participants to develop their own methods of achieving
program objectives and has refrained, to the maximum extent practicable, from establishing uniform national requirements
for the program.

For purposes of Executive Order 12778, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule is drafted, to the extent practicable,
in accordance with the standards set forth in section 2 of that Order.

For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final,
would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities for the same reason that it is
not a significant rule.

For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final, would
impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements. This proposed rule does, however, codify, at   130.800
through 130.830, paperwork requirements previously cleared by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control
numbers 3245-0075 (SBA Form 20, National Training Participant Evaluation Questionnaire); 3245-0090
(SBA Project Officer's Checklist utilized in monitoring the SBDC); 3245-0091 (SBA Form 641, Request for Counselling
Services); 3245-0108 (SBA Form 1062, Management Assistance Control Record utilized by the counsellor for
each client as a running record of counselling activity); 3245-0123 (SBA Form 888, Management Training Form
completed as a summary of a training event); 3245-0169 (Standard Forms 269 and 272, financial reporting forms
completed by the SBDC); 3245-0183 (SBA Form 1419, counselling evaluation form completed by the client); and
3245-0221 (SBA Form 1496, utilized in the SBDC on-site review process).

 130.100

Introduction.


(a) 

Objectives. 

(1) The overall objective of the SBDC program is to create a broad-based system of assistance for the small business
community. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources of the Federal, State and local governments with
the resources of the educational community and the private sector to meet the specialized and complex needs of the
small business community.
(2) SBDCs are intended to be responsive to local needs in providing assistance to the small business community as mutually
identified by the SBA Project Officer and the SBDC Director.
(b) 

Overview. 

The SBDC program shall be under the general management and oversight of the SBA. However, in keeping with the legislative
authority for the SBDC program, the SBA recognizes that a partnership exists between the SBA and the recipient organization
for the delivery of assistance to the small business community. Services shall be provided pursuant to a Cooperative
Agreement. The SBA shall also consult with SBDC Directors and recognized organizations representing SBDCs in the
formulation of the annual Program Announcement and the development of other program guidelines.
(c) 

Incorporation of amended references. 

All references in these regulations to OMB Circulars, Standard Operating Procedures, other SBA regulations, and
other sources of SBA policy guidance are intended to incorporate all ensuing changes or amendments to such sources.

Conflict: 

For purposes of this part, Conflict means all programmatic disagreements, whether pre or post award, between an applicant
or recipient organization and the SBA.
(f) 

Cooperative agreement: 

The legal instrument pursuant to the terms of which the SBA awards Federal funds to recipient organizations and recipient
organizations provide services to the small business community. Cooperative agreements are used because there

to shorten all response times as necessary to attain final resolution of the Dispute before the date on which a new Cooperative
Agreement would be due to be issued. At any time during the appeal process within 120 days of the end of the Budget period,
the recipient organization may submit a written request to use an expedited process. 


 130.640 

Conflict resolution procedures. 


(a) Any Conflict that is not resolved at the SBA district office level within 15 calendar days shall be referred by the
SBA Project Officer to the next SBA administrative level having authority to review such Conflict. The SBA Project
Officer shall make the referral in writing and shall include the comments of the SBDC Director. 
(b) If such Conflict is not resolved at any intermediate SBA administrative level within 15 calendar days, it shall
be forwarded, in writing, to the AA/SBDCs for final resolution. All comments of the SBDC Director must be included
in any package forwarded to the AA/SBDCs.
(c) The AA/SBDCs shall transmit a final decision in writing to the recipient organization, the SBDC Director, the
SBA Project Officer and other appropriate SBA field office personnel within 30 calendar days of receipt of such documentation,
unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and the AA/SBDCs.


 130.650 

Non-renewal procedure for non-performance. 


(a) In situations where the SBS District Director believes there is sufficient evidence of an SBDC's nonperformance
or poor performance under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement or these regulations, and subject to the provisions
of  130.700(a), the SBA District Director shall notify the SBDC Director any other appropriate official of
the recipient organization of an intention not to renew the SBDC. 
(b) This notification can be forwarded to the recipient organization at any time during the budget year, but normally
should be sent no later than 3 months prior to the deadline for receipt of an application by the SBA Project Officer.
When there is sufficient evidence of an SBDC's violation of these regulations, or of any other causes which may lead
to the initiation of suspension or termination procedures as set forth in  130.700 of this part, the SBA District
Director may waive the notification period with the concurrence of the AA/SBDCs. 
(c) This notification shall specifically cite the reasons for the intention not to renew the SBDC. It shall allow the
recipient organization a 60-day period within which to change and adjust its operations in order to correct any problems
cited in the notice, and to report to the SBA district office, in writing on the results of such changes or adjustments.

(d) If the recipient organization is unwilling or unable to resolve the specific problem areas to the satisfaction
of the SBA district office within the 60-day period, the SBA Project Officer shall have ten (10) calendar days after
expiration of such period to submit to the AA/SBDCs, through appropriate SBA channels, a written description of any
unresolved issues, a summary of the positions of the District office on the issues, and any supportive documentation.

(e) The AA/SBDCs shall transmit a final decision in writing to the recipient organization, the SBDC Director, the
SBA Project Officer and other appropriate SBA field office personnel within 30 calendar days of receipt of such documentation,
unless an extension of time is mutually agreed upon by the recipient organization and the AA/SBDCs. 
(f) To reach a final decision, the AA/SBDCs shall consider written documentation of the issues to be resolved, including
all relevant correspondence between the Project Officer, District Director and any other SBS personnel and the affected
recipient organization. At a minimum, such documentation shall commence with the first written notice of issues
resulting in the invocation of the non-renewal procedure. In addition to the written documentation, the AA/SBDCs
shall also communicate in person, in writing or by E-Mail with both the recipient organization and appropriate SBA
personnel. 
(g) If the AA/SBDCs determines that the evidence submitted establishes nonperformance, ineffective performance
or an unwillingness to implement suggested changes to improve performance, the AA/SBDCs shall have full discretion
to order termination of the SBDC. The SBA district officer shall then pursue proposals from other organizations interested
in applying for SBDC designation. The incumbent SBDC shall have 60 days to conclude operations and to submit close-out
documents to the appropriate SBA district office. Close-out procedures shall be in conformance with OMB Circular
A-133.

(h) The Agency may employ an abbreviated process for refusing to provide continued funding to an SBDC for actions other
than an SBDC's poor performance. If a District Director has reason to believe an SBDC or its key personnel is engaged
in any of the conduct referred to in  130.700(b) (1) through (9) or any other serious and flagrant violation of
these regulations or the terms and conditions of a prior agreement, the AA/SBDCs, upon approval from the General Counsel,
may shorten response times in the best interests of the Agency and the public.
(i) Effect of action on subcenter. If competing applications are being accepted, nothing shall preclude a subcenter
of the previously funded recipient organization from applying for designation as the recipient organization, as
long as the subcenter is not involved in the conduct leading to non-renewal of the former recipient organization.


 130.700

 Suspension and Termination Causes and Procedures.


(a) 

General.

 After the SBA has entered into a Cooperative Agreement with a recipient organization, it shall not suspend, terminate
or fail to renew any such agreement unless the SBA provides the recipient organization with written notification
setting forth the reasons therefor and affording the recipient organization an opportunity for a hearing, appeal
or other administrative proceeding under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 

et seq.

 Subject to this requirement, and except as provided in this paragraph and the provisions of   130.630,
130.640 and 130.650 regarding Dispute resolution, Conflict resolution and non-renewal procedures, the applicable
general procedures for suspension and termination are contained in 13 CFR 143.43 and 143.44, Enforcement and Termination
for Convenience, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local
Governments and in OMB Circular A-110, Attachment L, Suspension and Termination Procedures for Grants and
Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Nonprofit Organizations, Uniform Administrative
Requirements.
(b) 

Causes.

 Causes which may lead to the initiation of suspension, termination, or failure to renew procedures include disregard
or material violation of these regulations, or any of the following reasons:

 130.800

 Oversight of the SBDC Program. [Reserved]


 130.810

 SBA review authority.


(a) The SBA shall monitor and oversee the Cooperative Agreement and ongoing operations of the SBDC network to ensure
the effective and efficient use of SBA funds for the benefit of the small business community.
(b) Required on-site reviews. A periodic on-site evaluation of the SBDC network shall be conducted by the SBA with
SBDC participation, as required by law. This evaluation will include a thorough analysis of the records, procedures,
organizational structure, management, and services of the SBDC. The evaluation shall be both qualitative and quantitative,
shall measure the effectiveness of the program and shall include an assessment of the benefits accruing to the areas
served. The resulting on-site report by the SBA will review the strengths and weaknesses of the SBDC network and contain
recommendations for improving the management and operation of the SBDC. SBDC Directors shall work with their SBA
Project Officer and other appropriate SBA personnel to develop responses in writing within 30 working days to the
recommendations contained in the On-site Review Report, with timeliness for any remedial action to be taken.
(c) Site visits. The AA/SBDCs, or a representative, is authorized to make programmatic and financial review visits
to Lead Centers and SBDC service providers to inspect SBDC records and client files, and to analyze and assess training,
counseling and any other SBDC related activities. These visits shall be coordinated, in advance, with the SBDC Director.
(d) SBA examiners reviews. (1) From time to time, SBA examiners shall perform limited scope reviews of SBDC operations.
Reviews may be financially related, programmatically related or a combination of both, and shall consider ways to
improve the efficiency of the program as well as to monitor compliance with laws, regulations and other general guidance,
and shall be conducted according to published guidelines.
(2) The reviews by the SBA examiners shall not substitute for audits required of Federal grantees under the Single
Audit Act of 1984 or Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110, A-128 or A-133. Nor shall
such internal review substitute for audits to be conducted by the SBA Office of Inspector General under authority
of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.


 130.820

 Recordkeeping requirements.


(a) In order to comply with OMB circulars which require recordkeeping, as well as to monitor the SBDC Program properly,
the SBDC network shall keep records, as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, and shall submit quarterly, semiannual
and annual performance and financial reports as outlined in this section. Those reports and the clients' evaluations
of services provided shall be reviewed by SBA to:
(1) Determine the quality of services provided by the SBDC network;
(2) Determine the completeness and accuracy of SBDC records; and
(3) Compare the actual SBDC network accomplishments with the SBDC network performance objectives, such as the Planned
Milestone Accomplishment Chart submitted with the proposal for initial or subsequent funding which is listed in
the Cooperative Agreement.
(b) Client control records. The recipient organization shall maintain control records, as necessary, for a thorough
Lead Center audit and shall provide required SBA reports. SBDC service providers and Lead Centers which provide services
to small business shall maintain detailed, complete and accurate client activity files, specifying counseling,
training and other assistance provided.
(c) Performance reports. For those recipient organizations in the SBDC program for more than three years, interim
reports shall be due 30 days after completion of six months of operation; for those recipient organizations in the
program three years or less, reports shall be due 30 days after completion of each of the first three quarters. The annual
report shall include the second semiannual or the fourth quarter report and shall be due 90 days after the applicable
period (December 30 for Fiscal Year and March 30 for Calendar Year SBDCs). These reports shall reflect accurately
the activities, accomplishments and deficiencies of the SBDC network.
(d) Financial reports. The recipient organization shall provide three quarterly and one annual financial report
to the appropriate SBA Project Officer. The required financial reports will be set forth in the Program Announcement
and the Cooperative Agreement, in compliance with the OMB Circulars governing such reports.
(e) Availability of records. As required by OMB Circular A-133, all Lead Center and subcenter records shall
be made available to the SBA for review upon request.

Permit Required Confined Spaces 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 

U.S. Department of Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 OSHA issued a general industry standard on Permit-Required Confined Spaces (permit spaces) on January 14, 1993 (58
FR 4462). The standard became effective on April 15, 1993. 



On March 15, 1993 the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO/CLC (USWA) petitioned the United States Court
of Appeals for the 11th Circuit for judicial review of the final permit space standard under section 6(f) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act. In particular, the USWA contended that  1910.146(k)(2), which addresses the rescue
of permit space entrants by outside (off-site) rescue services, was vague and ineffective. The USWA also noted that
the permit space standard lacks a provision which would provide employees or their designated representative the
opportunity to observe any monitoring or testing required by the standard. 

The language of  1910.146(k)(3)(i), which specifies the point of attachment of a retrieval line to a permit
space entrant, may be unnecessarily restrictive. The ADS Environmental Services Company, a contractor which performs
work in sewers, has petitioned OSHA for a variance to paragraph (k)(3)(i). ADS has demonstrated that, for their operations,
a point of attachment in front of the entrant at about mid-shoulder level is adequate to meet OSHA's objective that
an entrant present the smallest possible profile during removal. 

Based upon these concerns, OSHA is now proposing to revise paragraph (k) of  1910.146, to state more clearly
the employer's duty to ensure effective rescue capability for employees who enter permit spaces and to allow more
flexibility in the point of attachment of a retrieval line to an entrant. OSHA is also raising the issue of whether to
add provisions to  1910.146 to provide affected employees, or their designated representatives, with the
opportunity to observe the evaluation of confined spaces, including atmospheric testing or monitoring, and to have
access to the results of such evaluations and monitoring.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Many employees enter and work in spaces which, because of their configuration, difficulty of entry or other factors,
pose increased risk of exposure to serious hazards. In January, 1993, OSHA promulgated a standard ( 1910.146,
58 FR 4462, January 14, 1993) that requires employers to protect employees assigned to enter Permit-Required Confined
Spaces (permit spaces) from these hazards. On June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34844), OSHA published a notice which corrected
typographical errors in the regulatory text and clarified several provisions of the permit space final rule and appendices.
On May 19, 1994 (59 FR 26114), OSHA published a technical amendment to  1910.146 which added a metric equivalent
to paragraph (k)(3)(ii) and further revised the ``Atmospheric Monitoring'' section of non-mandatory Appendix
E, ``Sewer System Entry.'' 

The permit space standard provides a comprehensive regulatory framework within which employers can effectively
protect employees who enter permit spaces. The standard provides for the establishment of written permit space programs,
authorization of entry through written permits, and the implementation of measures (e.g., testing and monitoring
of spaces, control of hazards, stationing of an attendant to monitor entry, employee training, and availability
of rescue and emergency medical personnel) necessary for safe entry operations.
On March 15, 1993 the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) filed a petition for judicial review of the final PRCS standard
in the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. On June 22, 1993, the USWA sent OSHA a letter (Ex. 1), which
detailed their objections to the final PRCS standard. The USWA objections dealt, in part, with the provisions of existing
 1910.146(k)(2), regarding the use of off-site personnel to perform permit space rescues. These concerns
are discussed more fully below. 



II. Events and Considerations Leading to This Proposed Rule 



A. Rescue and Emergency Services 



While compliance with the permit space standard will generally enable authorized entrants to enter and exit permit
spaces safely, OSHA recognizes that there may be circumstances where hazards arise so quickly or unexpectedly that
entrants need assistance in exiting a permit space. Paragraphs (d)(9) and (k) of the standard set requirements for
the rescue and emergency services needed in such circumstances. Also, paragraph (h)(5) of the standard requires
authorized entrants to initiate self-rescue where appropriate, and paragraphs (i)(6), (i)(7) and (i)(9) require
attendants, where appropriate, to order evacuation of the permit space, to summon rescue and emergency services
and to perform non-entry rescue. In promulgating the final rule (58 FR 4524), OSHA anticipated that compliance with
these provisions would maximize the likelihood that authorized permit space entrants would be protected from death
or serious injury should an emergency arise during entry operations. 

OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have documented (58 FR 4465) that a majority of
permit space fatalities have been would-be rescuers who entered permit spaces without the necessary training or
equipment. The Agency believes that this information demonstrates the need for employers to implement rescue measures
which protect rescuers from death or serious injury (58 FR 4526). OSHA concluded, based on its review of the rulemaking
record of the permit-space standard, that non-entry rescue involves the least danger for rescuers and that a retrieval
system (body harness attached to a lifeline extending outside the permit space) will generally be the appropriate
form of non-entry rescue. 


</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941128-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, the Agency required, in paragraph (k)(3) of the permit space standard, that each authorized entrant
wear a body harness with attached lifeline and that the lifeline be attached to a secure anchorage point outside the
permit space, except where the employer can establish that the use of a retrieval system would increase the overall
risk of entry or would not contribute to the rescue of the entrant. OSHA anticipated that the retrieval system, where
used, would enable a rescuer (either the permit space attendant or personnel summoned by the attendant) to extricate
an entrant without being exposed to permit space hazards. 

OSHA recognized that the use of a retrieval system will be infeasible in some instances. Accordingly,  1910.146
also contains requirements pertaining to rescuers who enter permit spaces to perform rescues, in paragraphs (k)(1)
and (k)(2) of the final rule. These requirements were included to ensure that designated rescuers were adequately
trained and equipped to safely (for both authorized entrants and the rescuers themselves) perform effective rescues.


Paragraph (k)(1) applies to employers, such as fire departments and contract rescue services, whose employees will
perform rescue at other employers' workplaces, as well as to employers who have their own employees perform rescues.
OSHA recognizes that many employees who perform rescue are not employees of the host employer. In addition, fire department
and other public sector rescue service employees are only covered by OSHA standards in State Plan States. Section
3(5) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652) provides that the term ``employer'' does not include the United States or any State
or political subdivision of a State. For States which administer approved OSHA state plans, section 18(c)(6) of the
OSH Act provides that State and local government employees in State Plan States are covered by the State OSHA standard
equivalents to the Federal OSHA standards. OSHA believes, based on the number of informal inquiries received, that
many State and local governmental entities whose employees provide rescue services for permit spaces are already
voluntarily complying with the provisions of  1910.146(k)(1) even where there is no legal requirement to do
so. 

The ability of rescue and emergency services to provide timely and effective assistance to authorized entrants is
a critical element of compliance with paragraphs (d)(9) and (k) of the standard. Under the permit space standard,
affected employers can set up their own employee-staffed rescue services or arrange to have persons other than their
own employees provide rescue services. As discussed in the preamble to the final rule (58 FR 4524), OSHA anticipates
that a rescue and emergency service composed of an employer's own employees will usually have a faster response to
a rescue summons than a rescue service composed of persons other than the employer's own employees because the employer's
own rescuers are far more likely to be ``on-site.'' Accordingly, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to use
a rescue service composed of persons other than on-site employees only when there is reasonable assurance that the
designated rescuers can effectively respond to a rescue summons in a timely fashion. 

OSHA notes that it also may be feasible for an employer to select a mix of on-site and off-site (or a mix of employee and
non-employee) rescue capabilities for that employer's particular circumstances. The provisions of existing  1910.146(k)
do not preclude such arrangements. The standard requires simply that employers plan ahead for rescue and ensure that
an adequate rescue capability is in place for permit space entries. 

Paragraph (k)(2) of the standard applies to employers who arrange to have persons other than their own employees provide
permit space rescue and emergency services. Paragraph (k)(2) requires affected employers to inform the rescue service
of the hazards they may confront when called upon to perform rescue at the host employer's facility and to provide the
rescue service with access, for planning and practice rescue purposes, to all permit spaces from which rescue may
be necessary. 

Paragraph (d)(9) of the standard requires employers to ``Develop and implement procedures for summoning rescue
and emergency services, 

for rescuing entrants from permit spaces 

(emphasis added), for providing necessary emergency services to rescued employees, and for preventing unauthorized
personnel from attempting a rescue.'' OSHA believes that the requirements of paragraph (d)(9), in conjunction with
the requirements of paragraph (k), place a responsibility on employers to take whatever actions are necessary to
provide for the effective rescue of authorized entrants from permit spaces. Further, OSHA believes that any host
employer who fails to consider such factors as the response time, equipment and state of training of rescue services
not composed of the host employer's own employees, when an employer chooses to arrange for such services, is not complying
with paragraphs (d)(9) and (k). 

In their June 22, 1993 letter to OSHA, the USWA contended that existing  1910.146(k)(2) does not specifically
address the timeliness with which a rescue service must respond to a rescue summons. The USWA believes that such an
omission permits the host employer to arrange for the use of a rescue service without any consideration of the rescue
service's capability to respond in a timely manner. According to the USWA, this situation would very likely result
in the death or serious injury of authorized entrants, because there would be no assurance that the rescue service
could arrive in time to perform an effective rescue. 

In addition, the USWA stated that the standard fails to include any meaningful provisions dealing with accountability
for the adequacy of a non-host employer rescue service. Thus, they believe, an employer could avoid responsibility
for the adequacy (e.g., the equipping and training) of rescue and emergency services. Further, the USWA contends
that existing  1910.146(k)(2) discourages employers from providing an employee-staffed on-site rescue
service and encourages the disbanding of any such existing rescue services.

<DOCNO> FR941128-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The USWA concluded, based upon the above stated concerns, that the permit space standard should require that all host
employers establish and use rescue services composed only of their own employees. 

As has been discussed, OSHA believes that the final rule does address the need for the host employer to consider timeliness
of rescue and accountability in its selection of outside rescue services. However, the Agency recognizes that these
areas of the standard may not have been set forth with sufficient clarity or specificity in the regulatory text. Therefore,
OSHA is proposing to revise paragraph (k)(2) so that the standard more clearly states what an employer must do when
it arranges to have persons other than its own employees provide permit space rescue and emergency services. (See
Section III., Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Revision.) 



B. Retrieval Systems 



Paragraph (k)(3)(i) of the final standard contains a provision requiring that retrieval systems employ a retrieval
line which is attached at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level or above the entrant's head. In the final
standard's preamble (58 FR 4531) the reason given for specifying the attachment point for the retrieval line is ``so
that the entrant will present the smallest possible profile during removal, in case a rescue becomes necessary.''
It has come to OSHA's attention that the language of paragraph (k)(3)(i) may be unnecessarily restrictive. The ADS
Environmental Services Company, a contractor which provides flow monitoring services in sewers, has requested
that OSHA grant a variance (Ex. 2) from the requirement that the point of attachment either be centered near the entrant's
back near shoulder level or overhead. For operational purposes, the ADS Company attaches the retrieval line in front
of the entrant at about mid-shoulder level. ADS has satisfactorily demonstrated that their method of retrieval line
attachment is equally as effective as the two methods specified in the existing OSHA standard in meeting the stated
objective of presenting the smallest possible entrant profile during removal. Accordingly, and in keeping with
the Agency's goal of stating standards in performance-oriented language to the extent reasonable, OSHA believes
it is appropriate to amend  1910.146(k)(3)(i) to permit any point of attachment of a retrieval line to a chest
or full body harness which meets the goal of presenting the smallest possible entrant profile during removal from
a permit space. 



C. Employee Participation in Exposure Monitoring 



In addition to suggesting changes to the rescue provisions, the USWA also stated, in its June 22, 1993 letter, (Ex.
1) that the Permit Space standard should contain a provision which requires that affected employees, or their designated
representatives, be permitted to observe any exposure monitoring required by the standard. The USWA contends that
the inclusion of such a provision is required by section 8(c)(3) of the Act, and that such a provision is routinely placed
in all of OSHA's chemical-specific standards. 

In response to a comment from the United Auto Workers (UAW) (Ex. 19-38), Issue 3 of the Hearing Notice (54 FR 41462)
requested input regarding worker participation in the design and implementation of a Permit Space program. As discussed
in the final rule (58 FR 4484-85) most of the comments and testimony received expressed general support for the
concept of employee participation, but did not provide specific suggestions as to how that participation should
be implemented. In responding to Issue 3, the UAW testimony at the public hearings repeated their NPRM recommendation
that the permit space standard require active employee participation in the design and implementation of permit
space programs, while adding a suggestion that employers provide employees with an opportunity to observe the monitoring
of permit spaces (Chicago Tr. 347). In its post hearing brief (Ex. 142), the UAW repeated the suggestion for observation
of monitoring without elaboration. 

OSHA did not include specific requirements for employee participation in the final rule because the Agency believed
it would be very difficult to mandate labor-management collaboration and to determine how disagreements would be
resolved. In addition, OSHA stated that employees would have input to the Permit Space program through   1910.146(d)(13)
(review of permit space program) and (g)(2)(iv) (retraining when there are deviations from the permit space procedures).


In response to the submission by the USWA, the Agency has agreed to raise an issue for comment regarding employee observation
of monitoring. OSHA does not believe that section 8(c)(3) of the Act mandates the inclusion of a requirement for employee
observation of monitoring in safety standards. However, the Agency is considering whether such a provision should
be added to the permit space standard based on the concerns expressed and on the record developed as a result of this
notice. 

Accordingly, OSHA requests comment from interested parties as to whether the Agency should revise  1910.146
by adding a requirement that affected employees, or their designated representatives, be permitted to observe the
evaluation of confined space conditions, including any testing or monitoring conducted under the permit space standard.
The Agency requests that commenters provide the reasons for their views, and requests the submission of any data or
information which would be useful to OSHA in making an informed decision regarding this issue. 

The USWA also believes that the Permit Space standard should contain a provision which requires that the results of
any evaluation of a permit space, including the results of any atmospheric monitoring conducted, be made available
to employees or their designated representative. OSHA agrees that it is important that this information be made available
to permit space entrants and believes that the existing permit space standard already includes provisions to assure
that this objective is achieved. Existing  1910.146(f)(10) requires that the results of initial and periodic
tests performed under existing  1910.146(d)(5) be entered on the entry permit, and existing  1910.146(e)(3)
requires that the permit be made available to all authorized entrants at the time of entry. 

Accordingly, OSHA solicits comments regarding the issue of whether the existing standard provides adequate employee
access to the results of testing and monitoring in permit spaces. The Agency also encourages interested parties who
believe that the existing provisions are inadequate to provide suggestions regarding how OSHA can correct any such
inadequacies. OSHA may decide, based upon the comments received concerning this issue, to add a provision or provisions
to the permit space rule replacing or strengthening the current provisions. 



III. Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Revision 



OSHA proposes to make several changes to paragraph (k)(2) of  1910.146 so that the standard will more clearly
state the duties and responsibilities of employers (host employers) who arrange for persons other than their own
employees to perform permit space rescue in their workplace. OSHA believes that the proposed changes will make it
clearer that such employers must select rescue services which are capable of responding in a timely manner and which
are properly trained, equipped and capable of functioning appropriately to perform permit space rescues at the host
employer's facility.

First, OSHA proposes to add the parenthetical ``(outside rescuers)'' between ``employees'' and ``perform'' in
the introductory text of paragraph (k)(2), and to add the words ``ensure that'' to the end of the introductory text
to paragraph (k)(2). That introductory text would then read:



When an employer (host employer) arranges to have persons other than the host employer's employees (outside rescuers)
perform permit space rescue, the host employer shall ensure that:



The parenthetical ``(outside rescuers)'' is proposed to be added to clarify and simplify what is meant by the phrase
``persons other than the host employer's employees''. The words ``ensure that'' at the end of the introductory text
are proposed to be added to clarify and strengthen the requirements in paragraph (k)(2).


Second, OSHA proposes to add new paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii). Proposed new paragraph (k)(2)(i) specifically
requires host employers to ensure that arranged-for rescue services can effectively respond in a timely manner to
a rescue summons. The proposed paragraph clearly indicates that a host employer must take into account a rescue service's
capability in terms of response time and may only select a rescue service which satisfies the pertinent criteria.

Proposed new paragraph (k)(2)(ii) specifically requires host employers to ensure that arranged-for rescue services
are equipped, trained and capable of functioning appropriately to perform permit space rescues at the host employer's
facility. The proposed provision clearly indicates that host employers must evaluate a prospective rescue service's
capabilities and verify that the needed capabilities are present before selecting that rescue service to perform
permit space rescues. The host employer would be clearly prohibited from selecting any rescue service which does
not meet the criteria of proposed (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii). 
Third, OSHA proposes to redesignate existing paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) as paragraphs (k)(2)(iii) and
(k)(2)(iv), respectively. The language of these two provisions has been modified slightly to fit the revised introductory
text of paragraph (k)(2), but no changes to the existing requirements have been made. 
OSHA emphasizes that the intent of proposed paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) is to clarify the existing requirements
in paragraphs (d)(9) and (k)(2) of  1910.146, as these requirements have been interpreted by the Agency. As
discussed earlier, OSHA believes that, even under the current rule, an employer must take timeliness and accountability
into account if that employer is to have a truly effective rescue capability. The Agency acknowledges, as discussed
in the preamble to the permit space standard (58 FR 4527), that the rescue provisions of the standard will not ensure
that all incapacitated entrants will be successfully rescued from permit spaces. The fact that a host employer has
done all that it can, before any arrangements for using an outside rescue service are finalized, to ensure that a rescue
service is fully capable of performing a timely rescue at its workplace does not guarantee that an actual rescue attempt
by that rescue service will be successful. Thus, OSHA's measurement of a host employer's compliance with proposed
paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (k)(2)(ii) will not be based solely upon a rescue service's actual performance during any
single instance, but instead upon the host employer's total effort prior to arranging for an outside rescue service
to ensure that the prospective rescue service is indeed capable, in terms of overall timeliness, training and equipment,
of performing an effective rescue at the host employer's workplace. 
OSHA is also proposing to amend paragraph (k)(3)(i) so that the provision dealing with the point of attachment of a
retrieval line becomes more performance-oriented. The existing provision requires that the point of attachment
be either at the center of the entrant's back near shoulder level or above the entrant's head. OSHA specified those
points of attachment because the Agency believed that their use would enable the entrant to present the smallest possible
profile during retrieval. However, OSHA acknowledges that there may be circumstances under which alternate body
harness attachment points may be at least as safe and effective as either of the specified locations. Accordingly,
The Agency proposes to allow any other point of attachment which enables the entrant's body to present the smallest
possible profile during retrieval. As amended, the first sentence of paragraph (k)(3)(i) would read as follows:



Each authorized entrant shall use a chest or full body harness, with a retrieval line attached at the center of the entrant's
back near shoulder level, above the entrant's head or other point which assures that the entrant will present the smallest
possible profile during retrieval.

IV. Regulatory Impact Assessment 


As explained elsewhere, the Agency considers the new language a clarification of the existing standard, and not a
new burden on employers. Therefore, the Agency believes no new costs are implied by this modification. 


V. Federalism 


This proposed amendment has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 31685, October 30, 1987)
regarding Federalism. This order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy
options and consult with States prior to taking any action. Agencies may act only when there is clear constitutional
authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The order provides for preemption of State law only if there
is a clear congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible.

Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State laws
relating to issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSHA
Act, a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of
such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must,
among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as
Federal Standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate commerce,
they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions (See Section 18(c)(2) of
the OSHA Act). 
This proposed rule is drafted so that employees in every State will be protected by general, performance-oriented
standards. To the extent that there are State or regional peculiarities caused by the terrain, the climate or other
factors, States would be able, under the OSHA Act, to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems.
And, under the Act, if a State develops an approved State program, it could make additional requirements in its standards.
Moreover, the performance nature of this standard, of and by itself, allows for flexibility by States and employers
to provide as much safety as possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each State. 
In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health concerning entry into permit-required
confined spaces. Those States which elect to participate under the statute would not be preempted by this regulation
and would be able to address special, local conditions within the framework provided by this performance-oriented
standard.

Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is issuing this proposal to augment the final rule that was published on July 20, 1993. Today's notice proposes
to make several additions and changes as supplement C to the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised)''. Supplement
C does the following: incorporates improved algorithms for treatment of area sources and dry deposition in the Industrial
Source Complex (ISC2) model, adopts a solar radiation/delta-T (SRDT) method for estimating atmospheric stability
categories, adopts a new screening approach for assessing annual NO

2 

impacts, and adds SLAB and HGSYSTEM as alternative models. The Guideline sets forth air quality models and guidance
for estimating the air quality impacts of sources and for specifying emission limits for them. The purpose of the proposed
changes is to enhance the guidance in response to a substantial number of public comments urging the Agency to do so.
For the purposes of this document, EPA is soliciting public comments only on the four proposed changes associated
with supplement C and will not respond to any comments that are outside the scope of this document. This limiting of
EPA's responses to comments within the scope of this document allows the Agency to focus on the issues, data, and information
relevant to this rulemaking.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background



The purpose of the Guideline
 is to promote consistency in the use of modeling within the air management process. The Guideline provides model users
with a common basis for estimating pollution concentrations, assessing control strategies and specifying emission
limits; these activities are regulated at 40 CFR 51.46, 51.63, 51.112, 51.117, 51.150, 51,160, 51.166, and 51.21.
The Guideline was originally published in April 1978. It was incorporated by reference in the regulations for the
Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality in June 1978 (43 FR 26380). The Guideline was subsequently
revised in 1986 (51 FR 32176), and later updated with the addition of supplement A in 1987 (53 FR 393). The last such revision
was supplement B, issued on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38816). The revisions in supplement B included techniques and guidance
for situations where specific procedures had not previously been available, and also improved several previously
adopted techniques.

During the public comment period for supplement B, EPA received requests to consider several additional new modeling
techniques and suggestions for enhanced technical guidance.
 However, because there was not sufficient time for the public to review the new techniques and technical guidance
before promulgation of supplement B, the new models and enhanced technical guidance could not be included in the supplement
B rulemaking. Thus, in this subsequent regulatory proposal, EPA is proposing to revise the Guideline and is seeking
public comment on the four items described below. Once promulgated, these four items will be included in supplement
C to the Guideline. A copy of supplement C (draft) is available for public review (Docket Item III-B-1).





Proposed Action 


Appendix W of 40 CFR part 51 will be appropriately amended to effect the following revisions, proposed as supplement
C to the Guideline. EPA solicits comment on each of the following revisions. 


1. Enhancements
 to the Industrial Source Complex Model (ISC2) 




A. Area Source Algorithm 


Today's action proposes to replace the area source algorithm in the Industrial Source Complex model (ISC2) with a
new one based on a double integration of the Gaussian plume kernel for area sources. 
(1) 

Short-term algorithm: ISCST2. 

A previous EPA study
 indicated that the currently implemented ISCST2 area source algorithm, based on a finite line segment approximation,
estimates concentration distributions with limited accuracy, especially for receptors located close to the area
source. An independent but later evaluation confirmed these findings.

6,7

 These studies suggested that the integrated line source algorithm for modeling impacts from area sources provides
a better treatment of near-source geometry than that currently recommended in ISCST2, and a reasonable far-field
behavior. Based on these performance evaluations and limited field data, the integrated line source algorithm is
a candidate to substitute for the current ISCST2 area source algorithm. Responding to public comments received at
the time supplement B was proposed, steps were taken to develop and test this algorithm. In the new algorithm,
 the ground-level concentration at a receptor downwind of all or a portion of the area source is given by a double integral
in the upwind and crosswind directions. The integral in the lateral direction is solved analytically. The integral
in the longitudinal direction (i.e., the summation of the contributions from the line sources in the upwind direction)
is approximated with a Romberg integration technique.
 The new algorithm, essentially equivalent to PAL
 and the convergent mode of the FDM
 integrated line source algorithm, has been shown to perform very well in terms of efficiency and of the reasonableness
of the results.












Existing field studies of impacts within and nearby area sources being scarce and limited in scope, EPA compared model
predictions to measured results using a wind tunnel simulation at the Fluid Modeling Facility, Atmospheric Research
and Exposure Assessment Laboratory.
 Both qualitative physical and quantitative statistical analyses were performed. The analysis results12 show that
the new algorithm predicts the concentration distribution with relatively good accuracy (i.e., 

# ~$

10%), especially for the ground-level receptors located near the downwind edge of the area source, a situation of
concern to regulatory modeling applications. For receptors near ground level and within or near the area 

# 

source, the normalized modeled concentrations generally matched the wind tunnel measured concentrations to within


# 

20%. EPA considers this to be an acceptable correspondence. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941128-1-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To examine the sensitivity of the design concentrations across a range of source characteristics, scenarios considering
source size, elevation, and downwind distance were simulated.
 For each scenario, the high-second high (HSH) 1-hour, 3-hour, 24-hour averages and high annual averages were determined
using a full year of meteorological data; both rural and urban mode dispersion options were used. Generally, the concentration
ratio
 averaged ~

$

1.2 (1-hour) to ~

$

1.0 (annual). However, for receptors located within and nearby the area source, the ratio averaged ~

$

2 (1-hour) to ~

$

3 (annual). Thus, for receptors inside the area source, the ratio is higher than for receptors outside the source,
where the effect is a function of averaging time and proximity to the source in question. 





The proposed algorithm is equivalent to that in PAL and FDM and is more efficient than either of these algorithms. Based
on comparisons with wind tunnel data, the proposed algorithm provides a more realistic characterization of the magnitude
of impacts at receptors located within and nearby the area than that currently in ISC2, and gives comparable results
to the FDM convergent algorithm when modeled based on the same assumptions for release height, mixing height, and
dispersion parameters. Furthermore, these findings confirm that the currently used area source algorithm in ISC2
is an approximation that routinely under-estimates (and underrepresents) the actual ambient impact, especially
for receptor locations within and near an area source. 
(2) Long-term algorithm: ISCLT2. The studies previously cited in footnotes 5, 6, and 7 have also indicated the deficiencies
of the virtual point source algorithm used in ISCLT2. While it is computationally efficient, the virtual point source
algorithm used in the original ISCLT2 yields estimates of limited accuracy for receptors located near the edges and
corners of the area, a problem also seen with the original ISCST2. The algorithm cannot predict the area source impact
for receptors located inside the source itself, and does not adequately handle effects of complex source-receptor
geometry. 
Thus, a new area source algorithm for the ISCLT2, based on the numerical integration algorithm described above, was
developed and evaluated.
 Detailed performance tests, statistical analyses and sensitivity analyses were completed to assure the reliability
and reasonableness of the modeling results. Using idealized meteorological conditions, the new algorithm yields
very good comparison results when compared with the newly developed ISCST2 area source algorithm. For realistic
meteorological data, the differences between ground level concentration values simulated with the new ISCLT2 algorithm
and with the new ISCST2 counterpart are within about 10% for a typical source. The differences between the long-term
and short-term algorithms using actual meteorological data are because ISCLT2 uses a meteorological frequency
distribution to represent the meteorological conditions, and does not contain precise hour-to-hour information
on specific combinations of wind speed, wind direction, stability class and mixing height that typically control
the design values for the short-term model. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses show that the current ISCLT2 area
source algorithm, based on the virtual source approach, routinely underestimates (and underrepresents) the actual
maximum concentration impacts by a factor of 2 to 4, especially when the receptors are located inside or near the source.





B. Dry Deposition Algorithm 


Deposition phenomena can be conceptualized in a two by two matrix, with a wet/dry dichotomy on one side and a particle/gas
dichotomy on the other. Each of the four cells can then be further subdivided into simple and complex terrain components.
Today's action proposes to replace the plume depletion and dry deposition algorithm
 in the Industrial Source Complex model (ISC2) with a new algorithm that estimates the amount of material depleted
from the plume as a combination of processes involving atmospheric turbulence and gravitational settling. This
proposal embodies the simple terrain component of one cell in the conceptual matrix: dry deposition applied to particles.
It is proposed that the new algorithm be implemented to treat dry deposition in rolling terrain, which is not possible
in the current versions of ISC2. Future efforts may be directed at better characterizing gaseous and wet deposition
in simple and complex. 




The dry deposition algorithm currently used in ISC2 is applicable to large particles (i.e., those with diameters
greater than ~

$

20 u m) for which deposition is dominated by gravitational settling. In 1993, EPA initiated a study to evaluate
the performance of alternative deposition algorithms. A review of the technical literature identified four core
algorithms and six variants suitable for testing, producing a field of ten algorithm candidates. Estimates based
on these algorithms were compared with observations from several data bases. Objective statistical procedures
 were used to measure model performance. The main feature of this approach is to compute normalized statistical measures
of the fractional bias between observed and predicted values. 




Based on the evaluation,
 the performance among the three top-ranked dry deposition algorithms was statistically indistinguishable. The
three top-ranked models were UAM 2, CARB 3 and ADOM 1. The UAM 2 and CARB 3 algorithms represent a hybrid variant of their
respective core algorithms with an added Leaf Area Index (LAI)
 adjustment. ADOM 1, currently employed in the Acid Deposition and Oxidant Model, is a core algorithm (does not include
a LAI adjustment). The results of the evaluation suggest that the reflection coefficient method used in ISC2 does
not perform well for particle sizes less than 20 u m in diameter.

The technical applicability of a LAI adjustment, as 
implemented for particle deposition velocity, has not been 
extensively studied. Thus, the robustness of using a LAI in 
routine model applications is uncertain. Excluding algorithms 
with LAI adjustments, the ADOM 1 scheme produces the best 
composite fractional bias measure (CPM) and was significantly 
better than other models tested at the 95% confidence level. ADOM 1 
slightly underestimates observed deposition velocities, a trait 
that is shared by all the algorithm candidates. Considering all 
of these factors, ADOM 1 is recommended for estimating dry 
deposition velocity in the ISC2 model. 

The ADOM 1 dry deposition algorithm has been tested within the 
framework of the ISC2 model and comparisons of deposition 
estimates using the old and new deposition algorithms have been 
made for a range of source types and particulate emission 
scenarios. Similar comparisons have been made of particulate 
concentration estimates as affected by the old and new deposition 
algorithms. A report
 documenting these analyses and assessing 
the potential consequences of replacing the current deposition 
algorithm in ISC2 with the proposed algorithm has been prepared. 





The results of the comparative analyses of the proposed dry 
deposition algorithm vary with release type, particle size, and 
averaging period. Consequently, care should be exercised in 
interpreting the generalizations that follow regarding deposition 
and concentration estimates. 

The effects on the actual deposition predicted by ADOM 1 were 
examined. For surface releases, the new algorithm gives higher 
annual and 24-hour deposition estimates for all particle sizes. 
For 1-hour and 3-hour estimates for surface releases the results 
were mixed. For elevated releases, deposition estimates given by 
the new algorithm are higher for 0.1

m

m and 1

m

m particles, lower 
for 10 and 20

m

m particles, and higher for 80

m

m and 100

m

m 
particles. The results for elevated releases of 50

m

m particles 
depend on release height. 

The effects on ambient concentrations predicted by ISC2 were 
also examined. For both surface and elevated releases of small 
and intermediate particle sizes (i.e., 0.1, 1.0, 10 and 20

m

m), the 
differences in concentration estimates between the old and new 
algorithms are less than 10 percent. These differences are 
considered insignificant. Results for the large particle sizes 
(i.e., 50, 80, and 100

m

m) depend on release height. For surface 
releases, the concentration estimates using the new algorithm are 
diminished. For elevated releases, concentration estimates using 
the new algorithm are increased. 

EPA is also soliciting public comment on whether it would be 
appropriate to require the proposed dry deposition algorithm to be 
used for all ISC2 analyses involving particulate matter in any of 
the programs for which Guideline usage is required under 40 CFR 
parts 51 and 52 (see 

Summary

). Heretofore, use of the deposition 
algorithm has been optional, depending on the relevance of 
particle deposition to a particular application. However, with 
the more accurate deposition algorithm proposed herein, its use 
may result in the systematic prediction of more accurate ambient 
concentrations. Therefore, EPA is soliciting comment on whether 
it would be appropriate to revise Guideline section 8.2.7 
(Gravitational Settling and Deposition) to require use of the 
deposition algorithm, and if so, whether the implementation 
guidance provided in the User's Instructions17 is sufficient. 



2. Enhancements to On-site Stability Classification 



EPA is proposing to revise the on-site stability classification with the adoption of a new technique, adapted from
Bowen 
et al.
 and herein referred to as the solar radiation/delta-T 
(SRDT) method. This method uses total solar radiation during 
daytime and temperature difference, delta-T (

D

T), at night and is 
a replacement for the one originally proposed (56 FR 5900). As 
proposed in supplement C, the hierarchy of stability 
classification schemes in the Guideline will be changed to reflect 
a preference for SRDT-derived stability categories. Operation of 
the method is fully described in section 6.4.4.2 of ``On-Site 
Meteorological Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling 
Applications'' (EPA-450/4-87-013), hereafter, ``on-site guidance''. 





The new method has been completely reconfigured in terms of 
its classification criteria, in response to the public comments 
provided at the Fifth Conference on Air Quality Modeling (March 
1991) regarding the original proposal. The comments (Docket 
A-88-04, Category IV-D; see footnote 

#

4) were generally favorable 
to the concept of a SRDT method for determining stability 
category. However, there were some substantial criticisms of 
specific SRDT components. Most significant were comments on: 

(1) Accuracy of measurements associated with a 2-10m 

D

T; 

(2) Limitations on temperature measurements made at 2m; 

(3) Use of a 10-60m 

D

T in lieu of one measured from 2-10m; 

(4) Lack of evaluation data bases; 

(5) Use of net radiation measurements in 
lieu of solar radiation; and 

(6) Merits of 

s

 measurements for stability determination. 

Regarding the use of net radiation, it is not apparent that 
there is sufficient experience with routine use of such 
measurements to justify requiring their use, whereas there has 
been extensive experience with 

D

T systems. Regarding the use of 

s

 
measurements, experience has been that, unless such systems are 
tuned for site-specific regimes, the 

s

-based methods do not 
represent Pasquill-Gifford (P-G) stability classification well. 
Evaluation results,
 based on on-site measurements from three 
widely separated locations, indicate that the SRDT method seems to 
be less sensitive to local measurement configurations and is 
expected to be geographically robust. Furthermore, the new SRDT 
method has been configured so that the system accuracy will not be 
limiting. Thus, the method will be less sensitive to random 
temperature differences. The claim (commenter IV-D-27 in Docket 
Item V-C-1; see footnote 

#

3) that accurate measurement of the 2m 
temperature may be adversely affected by surface conditions under 
the tower has merit in certain circumstances. The new SRDT method 
does not mandate that the location of the lower temperature sensor 
be at 2m. EPA believes that proper siting of temperature probes 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of the on-site guidance, coupled with 
sound judgment, should obviate any such problem. Use of a 10-60m 


D

T, an interval specified in the meteorological monitoring 
protocol used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is 
accommodated by the new SRDT method. Finally, substantial effort 
was made in acquiring suitable on-site data bases with which to 
evaluate the new SRDT method; the new SRDT method has been more 
extensively evaluated.

To make the stability classification comparisons for the SRDT 
evaluation, a surrogate for the preferred Turner classification 
scheme
 was devised. This surrogate method utilized ``off-site'' 
National Weather Service (NWS) observations in lieu of those 
otherwise made ``on-site''. To ensure the integrity of this 
surrogate method, it was necessary that candidate sites be 
sufficiently near a representative NWS station from which cloud 
cover and ceiling height observations could be obtained. Of ten 
on-site data bases considered for supporting the evaluation, three 
were ultimately selected because they had the requisite 
attributes. The data bases thus selected were: Kincaid, IL (21 
weeks in 1980), Longview, WA (CY 1991), and a site near 
Bloomington, IN (7/91-7/92). Proximity of these sites to NWS 
stations ranged from 17 to 45 miles. 





For theoretical reasons, as well as for consistency with the 
approach originally proposed, the SRDT method was initially 
evaluated using 

D

T data from 2-10m; such data were available for 
all three sites. At two of the sites, 

D

T data from 10-50m were 
also available. These data were of interest in trying to 
accommodate 

D

T measurements from alternative height intervals. 

As substantial site-to-site variability was seen in initial 
analyses using the 2-10m 

D

T data, it was decided to pool the data 
from all three sites and then determine optimum SRDT ``cutpoints'' 
(i.e., meteorological criteria for discriminating stability 
category). Thus, optimum cutpoints were derived in an empirical, 
iterative fashion from a data base of 19,540 valid hours. Use of 
these optimum cutpoints resulted in a SRDT system that estimated 
the same P-G stability as the preferred Turner scheme for 62% of 
the hours; the categories were within one class for 89% of the 
hours. A randomization procedure in which the composite data were 
split into two complementary sets was done to ascertain robustness 
(insensitivity to random variations in the data) of the method. 
The optimum cutpoints from the composite data were then applied to 
the three sites individually to document site-specific residuals. 

For the two sites with 10-50m 

D

T data, the SRDT system using 
the optimum (for pooled data) cutpoints was applied in the same 
way as with the 2-10m 

D

T data, with reasonably accurate and 
consistent results. Stability categories were duplicated by the 
SRDT method at least 56% of the hours, and were within one class 
for about 90% of the hours. Overall, the analyses show that the 
SRDT system works adequately for either 

D

T interval: the system 
does not appear to be unduly sensitive to the actual 

D

T height 
interval. Based on these analyses, EPA does not feel it should be 
overly prescriptive regarding the use of particular 

D

T intervals. 
Rather, in guidance for implementation of the method, actual 
placement of temperature probes is related to fundamental site-
specific phenomena, e.g., surface roughness. While the method was 
evaluated using only 2-10m and 10-50m 

D

T data, it is considered to 
be robust enough to accommodate other 

D

T height intervals as well, 
so long as section 6.4.4.2 of the on-site guidance cited above is 
followed. 

Finally, consequence analyses were performed using a Gaussian 
dispersion model (i.e., ISC2) to document the effect of the SRDT 
method on design concentration ratios.
 These analyses were 
performed for the 2-10m 

D

T comparisons at all three sites and for 
the 10-50m 

D

T comparisons at two sites. For all such analyses, 
scenarios included single 35m, 100m and 200m stacks and 180 
receptors configured radially in 5 concentric rings. Averaging 
times included 1-hour, 3-hour, 24-hour, and period. Modeled 
concentrations of interest were the high, and high 2nd high value. 
Using stability categories derived from the 2-10m 

D

T data for the 
three sites, the concentration ratios averaged 1.06-1.24 across 
three source types, four averaging times and two concentration 
types. Likewise, using those categories derived from the 10-50m 


D

T data, the same concentration ratios also averaged 1.06-1.24. 





In the supplement B revisions to the Guideline, EPA referenced 
``On-Site Meteorological Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling 
Applications'' in section 9.3.3. This document continues to serve 
as the primary source of supplementary technical guidance on the 
collection and use of on-site meteorological data. EPA is 
proposing an addendum
 to accommodate the technical details of 
the SRDT system. Once finalized, the hierarchy of stability 
classification schemes in that document will also be changed to 
reflect the preference for those derived via SRDT. The use of 
other techniques prior to a year following promulgation will be 
exempt from this provision, after which they will not be 
considered the primary method for estimating stability. Finally, 
the module designed to implement the SRDT system in Version 1.3 of 
the Meteorological Processor for Regulatory Models (MPRM), 
EPA-600/3-88-043, will be activated and configured with the 
optimum cutpoints derived in the evaluation. 





3. Screening Approaches for Assessing Annual NO

2

 Impact 



EPA is proposing a revision to simplify the screening 
approaches for assessing annual NO

2

 concentration impact in 
Guideline section 6.2.3. 

These revisions respond to public comments contending that the 
initial screening level (which assumed total conversion of NO to 
NO

2

) was overly conservative, and that the ozone limiting approach 
described in the second and third screening levels was sometimes 
inapplicable or impracticable. Thus, a second level screening 
approach that embodies use of an empirically derived NO

2

/NO

X

 
ratio is proposed. This method replaces the multi-tiered ozone 
limiting method now recommended in the Guideline. As described in 
Chu and Meyer (1991),
 the new approach reflects a review of 10 
years of ambient NO

2

 and NO

X

 concentration data collected at a 
variety of monitoring sites throughout the United States. 





The underlying basis for the ambient ratio method (ARM) is 
that, for a well mixed plume, the photochemical conversion of NO 
to NO

2

 is essentially controlled by the characteristics of the 
ambient air. This, in turn, is reflected in the annual NO

2

/NO

X

 
ratio monitored downwind. Since the photochemistry involved in 
converting NO to NO

2

 is implicitly accounted for by the annual 
NO

2

/NO

X

 ratio monitored downwind, no long-term complex 
photochemical calculation is needed. Thus, it makes the modeling 
exercise much simpler, yet still provides results consistent with 
available plume observational studies. 

The method is conservative since, in many cases, maximum 
estimated ground level NO

X

 concentration may occur prior to 
thorough mixing of the plume. A second, less important, source of 
conservatism is that the existing NO

2

 and NO

X

 data may overestimate 
the actual NO

2

 and NO

X

 concentrations due to interference of PAN 
and nitric acid in the measurement. However, since the same 
amount is added to both the numerator and denominator of the NO

2


NO

X

 ratio, it only makes the conversion ratio slightly more 
conservative. As shown by Chu and Meyer (1991), the ARM, while 
likely to be conservative, is somewhat less so than existing 
screening methods (such as the total conversion and the ozone 
limiting method) for estimating annual NO

2

 concentrations and PSD 
NO

2

 increments for NO

X

 sources. Serving as a second level 
screening method, ARM has the quality of simplicity, is easy to 
apply and is likely to be somewhat conservative. It relies only 
on the standard regulatory Gaussian models and data from 
nationwide NO

X

 monitoring networks. EPA has therefore selected 
this method to propose as a revision to the Guideline in 
supplement C.

In response to a request made by the American Petroleum Institute (see footnote 3), two new models for treating toxic
air pollutant releases are being proposed for addition to appendix B of the Guideline. These models, SLAB and HGSYSTEM,
will then accompany DEGADIS, another appendix B model for treating dense gas releases for use on a case-by-case basis.
(See footnote 2.)


Administrative Requirements


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)], the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may:



(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs of the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Order.



It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of E.O. 12866 and is
therefore not subject to OMB review.


B. Paperwork Reduction Act


This final rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to review by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.


C. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

) requires EPA to consider potential impacts of regulations on small ``entities''. The action here proposed is a supplement
to the notice of final rulemaking that was published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38816). As described earlier in this preamble,
the revisions here proposed as supplement C to the Guideline encompass the use of new model algorithms and techniques
for using those models. This rule merely updates existing technical requirements for air quality modeling analyses
mandated by various Clean Air Act programs (e.g., prevention of significant deterioration, new source review, SIP
revisions) and imposes no new regulatory burdens. As such, there will be no additional impact on small entities regarding
reporting, recordkeeping, compliance requirements, as stated in the notice of final rulemaking (

op. cit.

). Furthermore, this proposed rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other federal rules. Thus, pursuant
to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA hereby certifies that the attached proposed rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of such entities.

6.2.3 Models for Nitrogen Dioxide (Annual Average)


a. A tiered screening approach is recommended to obtain annual average estimates of NO

2

 from point sources for New Source Review analysis, including PSD, and for SIP planning purposes. This multi-tiered
approach is conceptually shown in Figure 6-1 below: 





Figure 6-1_

Multi-tiered Screening Approach for Estimating Annual NO

2

 Concentrations From Point Sources












b. For Tier 1 (the initial screen), use an appropriate Gaussian model from appendix A to estimate the maximum annual
average concentration and assume a total conversion of NO to NO

2

. If the concentration exceeds the NAAQS and/or PSD increments for NO

2

, proceed to the 2nd level screen.
c. For Tier 2 (2nd level) screening analysis, multiply the Tier 1 estimate(s) by an empirically derived NO

2

/NO

X

 value of 0.75 (annual national default).36 An annual NO

2

/NO

X

 ratio differing from 0.75 may be used if it can be shown that such a ratio is based on data likely to be representative
of the location(s) where maximum annual impact from the individual source under review occurs. In the case where several
sources contribute to consumption of a PSD increment, a locally derived annual NO

2

/NO

X

 ratio should also be shown to be representative of the location where the maximum collective impact from the new plus
existing sources occurs.
d. In urban areas, a proportional model may be used as a preliminary assessment to evaluate control strategies to meet
the NAAQS for multiple minor sources, i.e. minor point, area and mobile sources of NO

X

; concentrations resulting from major point sources should be estimated separately as discussed above, then added
to the impact of the minor sources. An acceptable screening technique for urban complexes is to assume that all NO

X

 is emitted in the form of NO

2

 and to use a model from appendix A for nonreactive pollutants to estimate NO

2

 concentrations. A more accurate estimate can be obtained by: (1) calculating the annual average concentrations
of NO

X

 with an urban model, and (2) converting these estimates to NO

2

 concentrations using an empirically derived annual NO

2

/NO

X

 ratio. A value of 0.75 is recommended for this ratio. However, a spatially averaged annual NO

2

/NO

X

 ratio may be determined from an existing air quality monitoring network and used in lieu of the 0.75 value if it is determined
to be representative of prevailing ratios in the urban area by the reviewing agency. To ensure use of appropriate locally
derived annual NO

2

/NO

X

 ratios, monitoring data under consideration should be limited to those collected at monitors meeting siting criteria
defined in 40 CFR 58, appendix D as representative of ``neighborhood'', ``urban'', or ``regional'' scales. Furthermore,
the highest annual spatially averaged NO

2

/NO

X

 ratio from the most recent 3 years of complete data should be used to foster conservatism in estimated impacts.





e. To demonstrate compliance with NO

2

 PSD increments in urban areas, emissions from major and minor sources should be included in the modeling analysis.
Point and area source emissions should be modeled as discussed above. If mobile source emissions do not contribute
to localized areas of high ambient NO

2

 concentrations, they should be modeled as area sources. When modeled as area sources, mobile source emissions should
be assumed uniform over the entire highway link and allocated to each area source grid square based on the portion of
highway link within each grid square. If localized areas of high concentrations are likely, then mobile sources should
be modeled as line sources with the preferred model ISCLT2.




f. More refined techniques to handle special circumstances may be considered on a case-by-case basis and agreement
with the reviewing authority should be obtained. Such techniques should consider individual quantities of NO and
NO

2

 emissions, atmospheric transport and dispersion, and atmospheric transformation of NO to NO

2

. Where they are available, site-specific data on the conversion of NO to NO

2

 may be used. Photochemical dispersion models, if used for other pollutants in the area, may also be applied to the NO

X

 problem.

9.3.3.2 

Recommendations_Site-specific Data Collection.




a. The document ``On-Site Meteorological Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications''66 provides
recommendations on the collection and use of on-site meteorological data. Recommendations on characteristics,
siting, and exposure of meteorological instruments and on data recording, processing, completeness requirements,
reporting, and archiving are also included. This publication should be used as a supplement to the limited guidance
on these subjects now found in the ``Ambient Monitoring Guidelines for Prevention of Significant Deterioration''.63
Detailed information on quality assurance is provided in the ``Quality Assurance Handbook for Air Pollution Measurement
Systems: Volume IV''.67 As a minimum, site-specific measurements of ambient air temperature, transport wind speed
and direction, and the parameters to determine Pasquill-Gifford (P-G) stability categories should be available
in meteorological data sets to be used in modeling. Care should be taken to ensure that meteorological instruments
are located to provide representative characterization of pollutant transport between sources and receptors of
interest. The Regional Office will determine the appropriateness of the measurement locations.




b. All site-specific data should be reduced to hourly averages. Table 9-3 lists the wind related parameters
and the averaging time requirements.




c. Solar Radiation Measurements.

 Total solar radiation should be measured with a reliable pyranometer, sited and operated in accordance with established
on-site meteorological guidance.66




d. 

Temperature Measurements.

 Temperature measurements should be made at standard shelter height (2m) in accordance with established on-site
meteorological guidance.66




e. 

Temperature Difference Measurements.

 Temperature difference (

DT

) measurements for use in estimating P-G stability categories using the SRDT methodology (see Stability Categories)
should be obtained using two matched thermometers or a reliable thermocouple system to achieve adequate accuracy.




f. Siting, probe placement, and operation of 

D

T systems should be based on guidance found in Chapter 3 of reference 66, and such guidance should be followed when obtaining
vertical temperature gradient data for use in plume rise estimates or in determining the critical dividing streamline
height.
g. 

Wind Measurements.

 The wind speed for determining plume rise using the methods of Briggs

56,57

 should be measured at stack top. For refined modeling applications in simple terrain situations, if a source has a
stack below 100m, select the stack top height as the wind measurement height for characterization of plume dilution
and transport. In some cases, collection of stack top wind speed may be impractical. For sources with stacks extending
above 100m, a 100m tower is suggested unless the stack top is significantly above 100m (i.e., "200m). In cases with
stack tops "200m, the Regional Office should determine the appropriate measurement height on a case-by-case basis.
Remote sensing may be a feasible alternative.

h. For refined modeling applications in complex terrain, multiple level (typically three or more) measurements
of wind speed and direction, temperature and turbulence (wind fluctuation statistics) are required. Such measurements
should be obtained up to the representative plume height(s) of interest (i.e., the plume height(s) under those conditions
important to the determination of the design concentration). The representative plume height(s) of interest should
be determined using an appropriate complex terrain screening procedure (e.g., CTSCREEN) and should be documented
in the monitoring/modeling protocol. The necessary meteorological measurements should be obtained from an appropriately
sited meteorological tower augmented by SODAR if the representative plume height(s) of interest exceed 100m. The
meteorological tower need not exceed the lesser of the representative plume height of interest (the highest plume
height if there is more than one plume height of interest) or 100m. 





i. Specifications for wind measuring instruments and systems are contained in the ``On-Site Meteorological Program
Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications''.66 

j. 

Stability Categories. 

The (P-G) stability categories, as originally defined, couple near-surface measurements of wind speed with
subjectively determined insolation assessments based on hourly cloud cover and ceiling height observations. The
wind speed measurements are made at or near 10m. The insolation rate is typically assessed using observations of cloud
cover and ceiling height based on criteria outlined by Turner.50 In the absence of site specific observations of cloud
cover and ceiling height, it is recommended that the P-G stability category be estimated using the solar radiation/delta-T
(SRDT) method described in section 6.4.4.2 of reference 66. This method requires measurements of total solar radiation
during the daytime and temperature difference (

D

) at night (see Temperature Difference Measurements), coupled with average wind speed at 10m above ground level.
This technique is modified slightly from that published by Bowen et al. (1983),136 has been evaluated with three on-site
data bases,137 and allows practical and reasonable implementation of the preferred Turner method.55

k. Two methods of stability classification which use wind fluctuation statistics, the 

s

A

 and 

s

E

 methods, are also described in detail in reference 66 (note applicable tables in Chapter 6). As a primary method, these
two techniques may only be used for processing data collected within 1 year following the promulgation date of Supplement
C, and then only when data are unavailable to implement either the preferred Turner method55 or the SRDT method. After
promulgation of Supplement C, these turbulence methods should only be used to provide back-up stability category
estimates for missing hours in the record according to an established data substitution protocol

g

 and after valid data retrieval requirements have been met. 







l. In the case of the 

s

A

 method it should be noted that wind meander may occasionally bias the determination of 

s

A

 and thus lead to an erroneous determination of the P-G stability category. To minimize wind direction meander contributions,


s

A

 may be determined for each of four 15-minute periods in an hour. However, 360 samples are needed during each 15-minute
period. If the 

s

A

 method is being used for stability determinations in these situations, take the square root of one-quarter of the
sum of the squares of the four 15 minute 

s

A

's, as illustrated in the footnote to Table 9-3. While this approach is an acceptable alternative for determining
stability, as qualified above, 

s

A

's calculated in this manner are not likely to be suitable for input to models that are designed to accept on-site hourly


s

's based on 60-minute periods, e.g., CTDMPLUS. For additional information on stability classification using wind
fluctuation statistics, see references 68-72. 



m. In summary, when on-site data are being used, P-G stability categories should be determined by (1) Turner's method55
using site specific data which include cloud cover, ceiling height and surface (~




10m) wind speeds, or (2) the radiation-based technique (SRDT) described in reference 66. 







n. The following techniques may only be applied to on-site data bases collected within 1 year following the promulgation
date of Supplement C, and then only when data are unavailable to implement the preferred Turner55 or SRDT method; or
to provide back-up stability category estimates for missing hours in the record according to an established data
substitution protocol

g

 and after valid data retrieval requirements have been met (choice is based on data availability and site suitability):






(1) 

s

E

 from site-specific measurements in accordance with guidance;66 







(2) 

s

A

 from site-specific measurements in accordance with guidance;66 







(3) Turner's method55 using site-specific wind speed with cloud cover and ceiling height from a nearby NWS site.






o. 

Meteorological Data Processors. 

The following meteorological preprocessors are recommended by EPA: RAMMET, PCRAMMET, STAR, PCSTAR, MPRM,135 and
METPRO.24 RAMMET is the recommended meteorological preprocessor for use in applications employing hourly NWS data.

Abstract 



HGSYSTEM is a software package consisting of mathematical models for simulating one or more of the consecutive phases
between spillage and far-field dispersion of a non-reactive ideal gas or hydrogen fluoride (HF). The individual
models can be described as follows: (1) HFSPILL calculates the time-dependent spill rate of HF liquid or HF vapor from
a pressurized vessel; (2) EVAP calculates the spreading and evaporation of a boiling liquid pool on water or non-boiling
liquid pool on land; (3) HFPLUME calculates the depressurization to ambient pressure, the jet release and the near-field
dispersion from a pressurized release of HF; (4) PLUME calculates the depressurization to ambient pressure, the
jet release and the near-field dispersion from a pressurized release of non-reactive, ideal gases; (5) HEGADAS calculates
the steady-state or time-dependent ground-level heavy-gas dispersion resulting from either a ground-level pool
or a source in a vertical plane; and (6) PGPLUME simulates passive-gas dispersion downwind of a transition point based
on a simple Pasquill/Gifford similarity model. The models assume flat, unobstructed terrain. HGSYSTEM can be used
to model steady-state, finite-duration and time-dependent releases. The models can be run in either the interactive
or batch mode. 



a. Recommendations for Regulatory Use 



HGSYSTEM can be used as a refined model to estimate short-term ambient concentrations. For toxic chemical releases
(non-reactive chemicals or hydrogen fluoride; 1-hour or less averaging times) the expected area of exposure to concentrations
above specified threshold values can be determined. For flammable non-reactive gases it can be used to determine
the area in which the cloud may ignite. 



b. Input Requirements 



1. HFSPILL input data: reservoir data (temperature, pressure, volume, HF mass, mass-fraction water), pipe-exit
diameter and ambient pressure. 

2. EVAP input data: spill rate, liquid properties, and evaporation rate (boiling pool) or ambient data (non-boiling
pool). 

3. HFPLUME and PLUME input data: reservoir characteristics, pollutant parameters, pipe/release data, ambient
conditions, surface roughness and stability class. 

4. HEGADAS input data: ambient conditions, pollutant parameters, pool data or data at transition point, surface
roughness, stability class and averaging time. 

5. PGPLUME input data: link data provided by HFPLUME and the averaging time. 



c. Output 



1. The HGSYSTEM models contain three post-processor programs which can be used to extract modeling results for graphical
display by external software packages. GET2COL can be used to extract data from the model output files. HSPOST can
be used to develop isopleths, extract any 2 parameters for plotting and correct for finite release duration. HTPOST
can be used to produce time history plots. 

2. HFSPILL output data: reservoir mass, spill rate, and other reservoir variables as a function of time. For HF liquid,
HFSPILL generates link data to HFPLUME for the initial phase of choked liquid flow (flashing jet), and link data to
EVAP for the subsequent phase of unchoked liquid flow (evaporating liquid pool). 

3. EVAP output data: pool dimensions, pool evaporation rate, pool mass and other pool variables for steady state conditions
or as a function of time. EVAP generates link data to the dispersion model HEGADAS (pool dimensions and pool evaporation
rate). 

4. HFPLUME and PLUME output data: plume variables (concentration, width, centroid height, temperature, velocity,
etc.) as a function of downwind distance. 

5. HEGADAS output data: concentration variables and temperature as a function of downwind distance and (for transient
case) time. 

6. PGPLUME output data: concentration as a function of downwind distance, cross-wind distance and height. 



d. Type of Model 



HGSYSTEM is made up of four types of dispersion models. HFPLUME and PLUME simulate the near-field dispersion and PGPLUME
simulates the passive-gas dispersion downwind of a transition point. HEGADAS simulates the ground-level heavy-gas
dispersion. 



e. Pollutant Types 



HGSYSTEM may be used to model non-reactive chemicals or hydrogen fluoride.

f. Source-Receptor Relationships 



HGSYSTEM estimates the expected area of exposure to concentrations above user-specified threshold values. By imposing
conservation of mass, momentum and energy the concentration, density, speed and temperature are evaluated as a function
of downwind distance. 



g. Plume Behavior 



1. HFPLUME and PLUME: (1) are steady-state models assuming a top-hat profile with cross-section averaged plume variables;
and (2) the momentum equation is taken into account for horizontal ambient shear, gravity, ground collision, gravity-slumping
pressure forces and ground-surface drag. 

2. HEGADAS: assumes the heavy cloud to move with the ambient wind speed, and adopts a power-law fit of the ambient wind
speed for the velocity profile. 

3. PGPLUME: simulates the passive-gas dispersion downwind of a transition point from HFPLUME or PLUME for steady-state
and finite duration releases. 



h. Horizontal Winds 



A power law fit of the ambient wind speed is used. 



i. Vertical Wind Speed 



Not treated. 



j. Horizontal Dispersion 



1. HFPLUME and PLUME: Plume dilution is caused by air entrainment resulting from high plume speeds, trailing vortices
in wake of falling plume (before touchdown), ambient turbulence and density stratification. Plume dispersion is
assumed to be steady and momentum-dominated, and effects of downwind diffusion and wind meander (averaging time)
are not taken into account. 

2. HEGADAS: This model adopts a concentration similarity profile expressed in terms of an unknown center-line ground-level
concentration and unknown vertical/cross-wind dispersion parameters. These quantities are determined from a
number of basic equations describing gas-mass conservation, air entrainment (empirical law describing vertical
top-entrainment in terms of global Richardson number), cross-wind gravity spreading (initial gravity spreading
followed by gravity-current collapse) and cross-wind diffusion (Briggs formula). 

3. PGPLUME: It assumes a Gaussian concentration profile in which the cross-wind and vertical dispersion coefficients
are determined by empirical expressions. All unknown parameters in this profile are determined by imposing appropriate
matching criteria at the transition point. 



k. Vertical Dispersion 



See description above. 



l. Chemical Transformation 



Not treated. 



m. Physical Removal 



Not treated. 



n. Evaluation Studies 



1. PLUME has been validated against field data for releases of liquified propane, and wind tunnel data for buoyant
and vertically-released dense plumes. HFPLUME and PLUME have been validated against field data for releases of HF
(Goldfish experiments) and propane releases. In addition, the plume rise algorithms have been tested against Hoot,
Meroney, and Peterka, Ooms and Petersen databases. HEGADAS has been validated against steady and transient releases
of liquid propane and LNG over water (Maplin Sands field data), steady and finite-duration pressurized releases
of HF (Goldfish experiments; linked with HFPLUME), instantaneous release of Freon (Thorney Island field data; linked
with the box model HEGABOX) and wind tunnel data for steady, isothermal dispersion.

Abstract 



The SLAB model is a computer model, PC-based, that simulates the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.
The types of releases treated by the model include a ground-level evaporating pool, an elevated horizontal jet, a
stack or elevated vertical jet and an instantaneous volume source. All sources except the evaporating pool may be
characterized as aerosols. Only one type of release can be processed in any individual simulation. Also, the model
simulates only one set of meteorological conditions; therefore direct application of the model over time periods
longer than one or two hours is not recommended. 



a. Recommendations for Use 



The SLAB model should be used as a refined model to estimate spatial and temporal distribution of short-term ambient
concentration (e.g., 1-hour or less averaging times) and the expected area of exposure to concentrations above specified
threshold values for toxic chemical releases where the release is suspected to be denser than the ambient air. 



b. Input Requirements 



1. The SLAB model is executed in the batch mode. Data are input directly from an external input file. There are 29 input
parameters required to run each simulation. These parameters are divided into 5 categories by the user's guide: source
type, source properties, spill properties, field properties, and meteorological parameters. The model is not designed
to accept real-time meteorological data or convert units of input values. Chemical property data are not available
within the model and must be input by the user. Some chemical and physical property data are available in the user's
guide. 

2. Source type is chosen as one of the following: evaporating pool release, horizontal jet release, vertical jet or
stack release, or instantaneous or short duration evaporating pool release. 

3. Source property data requirements are physical and chemical properties (molecular weight, vapor heat capacity
at constant pressure; boiling point; latent heat of vaporization; liquid heat capacity; liquid density; saturation
pressure constants), and initial liquid mass fraction in the release. 

4. Spill properties include: source temperature, emission rate, source dimensions, instantaneous source mass,
release duration, and elevation above ground level. 

5. Required field properties are: desired concentration averaging time, maximum downwind distance (to stop the
calculation), and four separate heights at which the concentration calculations are to be made. 

6. Meteorological parameter requirements are: ambient measurement height, ambient wind speed at designated ambient
measurement height, ambient temperature, surface roughness, relative humidity, atmospheric stability class,
and inverse Monin-Obukhov length (optional, only used as an input parameter when stability class is unknown). 



c. Output 



No graphical output is generated by the current version of this program. The output print file is automatically saved
and must be sent to the appropriate printer by the user after program execution. Printed output includes in tabular
form: 

1. Listing of model input data; 

2. Instantaneous spatially-averaged cloud parameters_time, downwind distance, magnitude of peak concentration,
cloud dimensions (including length for puff-type simulations), volume (or mole) and mass fractions, downwind velocity,
vapor mass fraction, density, temperature, cloud velocity, vapor fraction, water content, gravity flow velocities,
and entrainment velocities;

3. Time-averaged cloud parameters_parameters which may be used externally to calculate time-averaged concentrations
at any location within the simulation domain (tabulated as functions of downwind distance); 

4. Time-averaged concentration values at plume centerline and at five off-centerline distances (off-centerline
distances are multiples of the effective cloud half-width, which varies as a function of downwind distance) at four
user-specified heights and at the height of the plume centerline. 



d. Type of Model 



As described by Ermak (1989), transport and dispersion are calculated by solving the conservation equations for
mass, species, energy, and momentum, with the cloud being modeled as either a steady-state plume, a transient puff,
or a combination of both, depending on the duration of the release. In the steady-state plume mode, the crosswind-averaged
conservation equations are solved and all variables depend only on the downwind distance. In the transient puff mode,
the volume-averaged conservation equations are solved, and all variables depend only on the downwind travel time
of the puff center of mass. Time is related to downwind distance by the height-averaged ambient wind speed. The basic
conservation equations are solved via a numerical integration scheme in space and time. 



e. Pollutant Types 



Pollutants are assumed to be non-reactive and non-depositing dense gases or liquid-vapor mixtures (aerosols).
Surface heat transfer and water vapor flux are also included in the model.

f. Source-Receptor Relationships 



1. Only one source can be modeled at a time. 

2. There is no limitation to the number of receptors; the downwind receptor distances are internally calculated by
the model. The SLAB calculation is carried out up to the user-specified maximum downwind distance. 

3. The model contains submodels for the source characterization of evaporating pools, elevated vertical or horizontal
jets, and instantaneous volume sources. 



g. Plume Behavior 



Plume trajectory and dispersion is based on crosswind-averaged mass, species, energy, and momentum balance equations.
Surrounding terrain is assumed to be flat and of uniform surface roughness. No obstacle or building effects are taken
into account. 



h. Horizontal Winds 



A power law approximation of the logarithmic velocity profile which accounts for stability and surface roughness
is used. 



i. Vertical Wind Speed 



Not treated. 



j. Vertical Dispersion 



The crosswind dispersion parameters are calculated from formulas reported by Morgan et al. (1983), which are based
on experimental data from several sources. The formulas account for entrainment due to atmospheric turbulence,
surface friction, thermal convection due to ground heating, differential motion between the air and the cloud, and
damping due to stable density stratification within the cloud. 



k. Horizontal Dispersion 



The horizontal dispersion parameters are calculated from formulas similar to those described for vertical dispersion,
also from the work of Morgan, et al. (1983). 



l. Chemical Transformation 



The thermodynamics of the mixing of the dense gas or aerosol with ambient air (including water vapor) are treated.
The relationship between the vapor and liquid fractions within the cloud is treated using the local thermodynamic
equilibrium approximation. Reactions of released chemicals with water or ambient air are not treated. 



m. Physical Removal 



Not treated.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. These revisions
concern the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) from boilers, steam generators, and process heaters. The intended effect of proposing approval of this rule is to
regulate emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on
this notice of proposed rulemaking will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated
this rule and is proposing to approve it under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals, SIPs for
national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Applicability



The rule being proposed for approval into the California SIP is Ventura County Air Pollution Control District's (VCAPCD)
Rule 74.15.1, ``Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters.'' This rule was submitted by the California Air
Resources Board (ARB) to EPA on November 18, 1993.



Background



On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. Public Law 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO

X

 emissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November
25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM entitled, ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General
Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO

X

 Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred
to for further information on the NO

X

 requirements and is incorporated into this proposal by reference.

Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO

X

 (``major'' as defined in section 302 and section 182(c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas. The Ventura County Area is classified
as severe;

1

 therefore this area was subject to the RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2), cited above, and the November 15, 1992
deadline.





Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by
a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15,
1992. There were no NO

X

 CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO

X

 sources since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO

X

 sources and submitted as SIP revisions, are expected to require final installation of the actual NO

X

 controls by May 31, 1995, for those sources where installation by that date is practicable.

The State of California submitted the rule being acted on in this document on November 18, 1993. This document addresses
EPA's proposed action for VCAPCD's Rule 74.15.1, ``Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters.'' VCAPCD adopted
Rule 74.15.1 on May 11, 1993. The submitted rule was found to be complete on December 23, 1993, pursuant of EPA's completeness
criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V,

2

 and is being proposed for approval into the SIP.





NO

X

 emissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rule was adopted as part of VCAPCD's efforts
to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to the CAA requirements cited
above. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for this rule.

EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action



In determining the approvability of a NO

X

 rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section
110, and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation
Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for this action, appears in various EPA
policy guidance documents.

3

 Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO

X

 rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

 emissions.





For the purposes of assisting state and local agencies in developing NO

X

 RACT rules, EPA prepared the NO

X

 supplement to the General Preamble, cited above (57 FR 55620). In the NO

X

 supplement, EPA provides guidance on how RACT will be determined for stationary sources of NO

X

 emissions. While most of the guidance issued by EPA on what constitutes RACT for stationary sources has been directed
towards application for VOC sources, much of the guidance is also applicable to RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

 (see section 4.5 of the NO

X

 Supplement). In addition, pursuant to section 183(c), EPA is issuing alternative control technique documents (ACTs),
that identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of NO

X

. The ACT documents will provide information on control technology for stationary sources that emit or have the potential
to emit 25 tons per year or more of NO

. However, the ACTs will not establish a presumptive norm for what is considered RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

. In general, the guidance documents cited above, as well as other relevant and applicable guidance documents, have
been set forth to ensure that submitted NO

 RACT rules meet federal RACT requirements and are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.

Rule 74.15.1 limits the discharge of NO

X

 from boilers, steam generators, and process heaters (ICIs) to 30 parts per million volume (ppmv) or 0.036 pounds per
million Btu (lb/MMBtu). Rule 74.15.1 effectively increases the stringency of California RACT for ICIs by lowering
the 

de minimis

 from 5 MMBtu/hr to 1 MMBtu/hr and decreasing the emission standard from 70 ppmv to 30 ppmv. The rule's compliance date
of May 31, 1995, satisfies the CAA's NO

X

 RACT implementation date requirement of May 31, 1995 (section 182(b)(2)). The District expects this rule to provide
a 71% reduction in NO

X

 emissions from the units subject to this rule. This reduction corresponds to 0.189 tons per day based on the District's
inventory. A more detailed discussion of the sources controlled, the controls required, and the justification for
why these controls represent RACT can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD), dated March 3, 1994.

EPA has evaluated the submitted rule and has determined that it is consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and EPA
policy. Therefore, VCAPCD's Rule 74.15.1, ``Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters,'' is being proposed
for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a), section 182(b)(2),
section 182(f) and the NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.



Regulatory Flexibility



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.,

 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to
the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; reopening of public comment period.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA is extending the public comment period for the proposed standards of performance for wastewater sources in
the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI). As initially published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 12, 1994 (59 FR 46780), written comments on the proposed rule were to be submitted to the EPA on or before
November 14, 1994 (a 60-day comment period). The public comment period is being extended and will end on January 13,
1995. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Several persons who intend to submit comments concerning the proposed standards of performance for wastewater sources
at SOCMI facilities have requested additional time to prepare their comments, beyond the 60 days originally provided.
In consideration of these requests, the EPA is extending the comment period to give all interested persons the opportunity
to comment fully. This extension of the public comment period is necessary to ensure that interested parties have
adequate time to provide the EPA with written comments on the proposed rule.

Proposed Flood Elevation Determinations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Technical information or comments are requested on the proposed base (100-year) flood elevations and proposed base
(100-year) flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations
and modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Emergency Management Agency proposes to make determinations of base flood elevations and modified base
flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with Section 110 of the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 



These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State,
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the NFIP.
No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.



Regulatory Classification 



This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987. 



Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 



This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

National Defense Executive Reserve Guidance 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would add a new part 337 to title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, National Defense Executive Reserve
Guidance. This part would provide guidance to Federal departments and agencies that sponsor reserve units and recruit
and train unit members under the National Defense Executive Reserve.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 New part 337 responds to Executive Order 12919 of June 8, 1994, 59 FR 29525, which delegates to the Director of FEMA the
responsibility to provide for the appropriate guidance for the recruitment, training, and activation of National
Defense Executive Reserve Units. This part would provide guidance for those Federal departments and agencies delegated
authority under Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994 (59 FR 29525, June 7, 1994) to sponsor reserve units under the
National Defense Executive Reserve and guidance for the recruitment and training of unit members.



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review



This proposed rule would not be a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, as defined
in  3(f) of that Executive Order. To the greatest extent practicable, FEMA would adhere to the principles of
regulation set forth in  1(b) of the Executive Order. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule would not be expected (1) to affect adversely
the availability of Federal benefits to small entities, (2) to have significant secondary or incidental effects
on a substantial number of small entities, and (3) to create any additional burden on small entities. As a result, a
regulatory flexibility analysis would not be prepared. 



Paper Work Reduction Act



The information collection contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C 3501 et seq. and assigned OMB control number 3067-0001.
Public reporting burden for the information collection, FEMA Form 85-3, National Defense Executive Reserve
Personal Qualifications Statement, is estimated to average 30 minutes per response. This includes the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the form. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any aspect of the form, including suggestions for reducing
the burden, to Information Collections Management, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20472; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3067-1001), Washington,

PART 337_NATIONAL DEFENSE EXECUTIVE RESERVE GUIDANCE


 337.1 

Introduction.


Section 710(e) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2160(e)) authorizes the President
to establish and train a nucleus Executive Reserve. The President by Executive Order 10660 of February 15, 1956 established
the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER). The Executive Order authorized the heads of departments or agencies
designated by the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization (predecessor to the Director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA)) to establish units of the Executive Reserve. Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994, superseded
Executive Order 11179 which superseded Executive Order 10660 but continued the NDER program. The NDER is part of the
national security emergency preparedness program and provides for a standby reserve of highly qualified individuals
who are trained as volunteers until they are activated by the President, or the head of a department or agency during
periods of emergency. The program facilitates the employment of Reservists in executive positions in government
during an emergency requiring such activation. In addition, the Executive Reserve may be used for emergency preparedness
activities as defined under Title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. 


 337.2 

Policy. 


(a) lt is the policy of the President that there shall be in the Executive Branch of the Government an NDER composed of
persons of recognized expertise from various segments of the private sector and from government (other than fulltime
Federal employees) to be trained for employment in the Federal Government in the event of an emergency that requires
such employment. 
(b) As part of the President's national security emergency preparedness policy under Executive Order 12656, Federal
departments and agencies shall develop plans and programs to mobilize personnel (including reservist programs)
as appropriate within their assigned areas of responsibility and to assess essential emergency requirements and
plan for possible use of such resources to meet essential demands during and following national emergencies. 


 337.3 

Purpose. 


This part establishes policy and program guidance to assist those Federal departments and agencies authorized to
establish Executive Reserve units in the NDER. This guidance is to aid in the establishment and administration of
such reserve units and in the recruitment and training of its members. The purpose of this part is to improve the ability
of departments and agencies to mobilize its manpower requirements in times of emergencies. The NDER is a mechanism
that allows the Federal Government to enlist the best and most talented personnel in the private sector to fill both
defense and essential civilian needs in time of emergencies. 


 337.4 

Applicability and scope.


This part is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies that sponsor or that may wish to sponsor a reserve unit
under the NDER program. It provides the standards and procedural guidance for establishing and administering reserve
units and for the recruitment and training of its members. 


 337.5 

Definitions.




National Defense Executive Reserve

 is a program that provides for standby Executive Reserve units sponsored by Federal departments and agencies that
are composed of individuals of recognized expertise from various segments of the private sector and from government
(except full-time Federal employees) who are trained to serve in executive positions in the Federal Government in
time of an emergency that requires such employment. 


 337.6 

Implementation.


(a) 

General. 

The Director of FEMA is responsible for the development of appropriate guidance for the NDER and for the coordination
of the program activities of the departments and agencies in establishing units of the Executive Reserve. The Director
is responsible for providing appropriate standards and procedural guidance for recruitment, training and activation
of the reserve unit members. The Director shall issue necessary rules and guidance in connection with the program
and may request the services of participating departments and agencies and private sector organizations, institutions,
and enterprises in the development of training programs and materials and in keeping of a centralized roster of Executive
Reserve members. 
(b) 

Interagency NDER Committee. 

An Interagency NDER Committee, composed of representatives of the departments and agencies sponsoring Executive
Reserve units and chaired by a representative from FEMA, will advise the Director of FEMA on matters concerning the
NDER program. 
(c) 

Federal departments and agencies. 

The head of any department and agency, subject to the guidance of the Director of FEMA may establish a unit of the Executive
Reserve in that department or agency. It is the responsibility of each department and agency that establishes a unit
to obtain the necessary funding for the unit, to recruit their own members, to set their own qualifications for membership
in addition to the requirements set forth in this part, to obtain the necessary security clearances and to conduct
training and annual exercises for such members. FEMA will assist the departments and agencies in their recruitment
efforts through referrals. 


 337.7 

Criteria. 


(a) The following criteria shall be used in establishing and maintaining a unit of the Executive Reserve: 
(1) The purpose of establishing a reserve unit shall be to augment the department's or agency's requirements for trained
highly-qualified executive personnel as determined by that department or agency, for use in time of emergencies.

(2) The functional assignments of members of the reserve unit shall be described in an organization chart for use in
time of an emergency, accompanied by position descriptions and staffing patterns related to the organization chart
and augmentation plans. These plans must be approved by the head of the department or agency, and a copy of such plans
is to be provided to the Director, FEMA. A reservist shall not be assigned to a position that is already filled by a regular
government employee. 
(3) Each reserve unit shall be directed by an agency official designated by the head thereof. The name of the official
designated shall be furnished to the Director, FEMA. 
(b) The administration and maintenance of a reserve unit is the responsibility of the sponsoring agency. Recruitment,
security clearances, training, travel, pay, personnel records, and other administrative matters shall be accomplished
in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in this part, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, and 5 CFR part
2635, Executive Order 12674, and in the Federal Personnel Manual to the extent such matters are covered, otherwise,
the sponsoring department or agency is responsible for implementing its own standards and procedures for that purpose.

(c) Funding the training, travel, and administrative support of the reserve members shall be the responsibility
of the sponsoring department or agency. 
(d) The disestablishment of a reserve unit by the head of a department or agency shall be reported to the Director, FEMA.

(e) All documents and communications directed to FEMA shall be addressed to Associate Director, Preparedness, Training
and Exercises Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, Attn: NDER
Program.
