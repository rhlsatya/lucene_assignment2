Availability of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has prepared an environmental assessment
and finding of no significant impact for the shipment of an unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing.
A risk analysis, which forms the basis for the environmental assessment, has led us to conclude that shipment of the
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing will not have a significant impact on the quality of the
human environment. Based on our finding of no significant impact, we have determined that an environmental impact
statement need not be prepared. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A veterinary biological product regulated under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (21 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) must be shown to
be pure, safe, potent, and efficacious before a veterinary biological product license may be issued. A field test
is generally necessary to satisfy prelicensing requirements for veterinary biological products. In order to ship
an unlicensed product for the purpose of conducting a proposed field test, a person must receive authorization from
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 



In determining whether to authorize shipment for field testing of the unlicensed veterinary biological product
referenced in this notice, APHIS conducted a risk analysis to assess the product's potential effects on the safety
of animals, public health, and the environment. Based on that risk analysis, APHIS has prepared an environmental
assessment. APHIS has concluded that shipment of the unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing
will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Based on this finding of no significant impact,
we have determined that there is no need to prepare an environmental impact statement. 

An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for the shipment of the following
unlicensed veterinary biological product for field testing: 







The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA 
(40 CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 





Done in Washington, DC, this 18th day of November 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Emigrant Wilderness Management Direction, Stanislaus National Forest, Tuolumne County, California</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare environmental impact statement (EIS).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an EIS for a proposal to revise current management direction for the 113,000-acre
Emigrant Wilderness on the Summit Ranger District, Stanislaus National Forest, Tuolumne County, California



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This EIS will evaluate alternatives, including standards and guidelines to assure an enduring resource of Wilderness
as described in the 1964 Wilderness Act (U.S.C. 16 1131-1136). The resulting decision will be utilized to amend
the 1991 Stanislaus National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) for Management Area 1, Wilderness.
This EIS will include all areas within the Emigrant Wilderness boundary and will not consider Wilderness additions.



Preliminary scoping, which was initiated with notification in the Stanislaus National Forest quarterly NEPA summary
in spring of 1993, press releases and direct mailings during August of 1993 and a public meeting October 2 of 1993, has
resulted in the identification of nine key issues: Ecosystems, Heritage Resources, Fisheries, Economic and Regional
Considerations, Social, Range, Wilderness Opportunities, Recreation, and Access.

The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies
and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. Project mailing
list participants from the preliminary scoping efforts receive periodic updates on the planning process along with
notifications of public meetings.

Glenn Gottschall, acting Stanislaus National Forest Supervisor, is the responsible official, 19777 Greenley Road,
Sonora, CA, 95370, (209) 532-3671.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by October of 1995.

The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's Notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register.

 It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most helpful,
comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy
of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).

In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553
(1978). Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after
completion of the final environmental impact statement. City of Angoon v. Hodel, (9th Circuit, 1986) and Wisconsin
Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive
comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and
respond to them in the final.

<DOCTITLE>Foss-Perkins Timber Sale and Vegetation Management Project, Ochoco National Forest, Harney County, Oregon</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for a timber
sale and vegetation management actions in the Foss-Perkins analysis area. The Foss-Perkins analysis area is about
36 air miles northwest of the Burns/Hines area. Drainages include Delintment, Dodson, and Short Creeks. This proposal
is tentatively planned for fiscal years 1995-96.



The Proposed Action for the analysis area includes; timber harvest, road construction, tree thinning, prescribed
burning, slash treatment, and watershed improvement projects. The purpose and need for these actions is to improve
ecosystem health, reduce fire hazard, maintain and improve water quality, and provide timber to the economy. The
Proposed Action will incorporate the direction in the Ochoco National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan as
amended by the Regional Forester's Eastside Forest Plans Amendment No. 1, May 20, 1994. The Forest Plan provides the
overall guidance for management of the area and the proposed projects.

The Ochoco National Forest invites further written comments and suggestions in addition to the comments already
received on the scope of the analysis. The agency will also give notice of the full environmental analysis and decision-making
process so that interested and affected people have an opportunity to participate and contribute to the final decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Forest Service Proposed Action is to treat 1500 acres of forested vegetation using group and individual tree selection
and commercial and precommercial thinning, harvest 7 to 9 million board feet of timber, construct 2 miles of road,
reconstruct roads, treat activity and natural fuels on 500 to 1000 acres, and implement riparian, wildlife, and range
improvement projects. The Proposed Action is designed:





_To treat the most insect and disease infested stands in the analysis area, to reduce the susceptibility of high risk
timber stands to insect and disease attack, and to prevent further infestation and accelerated mortality rates.

_To provide timber to the economy.

_To meet the desired residue profiles for vegetation types in the analysis area.

_To maintain and improve water quality to bring the area closer to the desired future condition.

_To maintain and improve ecosystem health.




The Responsible Official must decide: how much timber to harvest, if any, and where and how the harvest activities
would take place; how many miles of roads to construct and reconstruct, if any; how many acres of fuels (activity and
natural) to treat, if any, and where and how the fuels treatment should take place; and what riparian, wildlife and
range improvement projects to implement, if any.

The proposed Action is intended to implement the Chief of the Forest Service's direction to implement ecosystem management
and to provide recovery from the insects, disease, and fuel buildup within the Foss-Perkins analysis area.

The Foss-Perkins project area borders the Silver Creek Roadless Area. The project area is approximately 9000 acres
in size. There is no designated roadless area within the project area, however there is a portion of the Silver Creek
Research Natural Area within the project boundary. Silver Creek is located 1/4 to 1/2 mile west of the project area
and was recently studied for determination of suitability for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic River System. It was
determined that Silver Creek is not suitable for Wild and Scenic designation due to poor riparian condition.

Alternatives will include a no action alternative, which involves no harvest or road construction, and additional
alternatives to respond to issues generated during the scoping process. Some of these additional alternatives will
incorporate the 

Viable Ecosystem Management Guide

 developed by the Ochoco National Forest which addresses the historic range of variability of timber stands in this
region. The area also needs to be assessed for its roadless area suitability and semi-primitive management potential.
However, a decision to amend the Forest Plan and designate any portions of the area as roadless is outside the scope
of this project.

Initial scoping for this project began in July of 1989. Issues raised by the public during scoping will be used to develop
alternatives to the proposed action. Public participation will be especially important at several points during
the analysis. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, local
agencies, tribes, and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed actions.
This information will be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:



1. Identifying potential issues.

2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth.

3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental process.

4. Exploring additional alternatives.

5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect,
and cumulative effects and connected actions).

6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. 
The District has identified the following issues. These are internal issues the District has identified and would
now like the public to review them and add anymore they feel worthy of note.




Soil Compaction_

Past activities have caused soil compaction. The Proposed Action could cause additional soil compaction.



Roadless Area_

The Proposed Action could impact roadless area attributes.



Old-Growth Fragmentation_

The Proposed Action could increase timber stand fragmentation.



Forest Health_

Timber stand health is declining due to fire exclusion and drought. This has resulted in overstocked conditions,
increased insect and disease infestations, heavy forest fuel levels, and an increase in dead and dying timber.



Water Quality_

Vegetation treatment and grazing in and adjacent to riparian zones may effect stream channel stability and water
quality. Habitat for red band trout and Malheur mottled sculpin may be affected by vegetation treatment in and adjacent
to riparian zones.




Big Game Cover_

Timber harvest could adversely affect big game habitat and populations in the analysis area.



Socioeconomic_

Timber harvesting could enhance local and regional economies by providing revenues and jobs.





Livestock Grazing_

The Proposed Action could have an effect on the number of livestock and the timing and location of where livestock graze.


The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by May 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies, organizations,
and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in
the 

Fedeal Register. 

The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register.



The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS's must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the
reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not
raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon v. Hodel, 

803 f. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the Proposed Action, comments
on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.13 in addressing
these points).

The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by January 1996. In the final EIS, The Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding this
proposal. Thomas A. Schmidt, Forest Supervisor, Ochoco National Forest, is the Responsible Official. As the responsible
official he will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Board of Decision. That decision will be
subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 215.

<DOCTITLE>Patent Licenses; Biological Treatment for Controlling Wood Deteriorating Fungi</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) has developed and patented an environmentally friendly microbiocide,
Actinomycete mutant, which protects wood and wood products against wood-attaching fungi and is seeking to license
it and to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for its further development.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Patent No. 5,536,624, ``Biological Treatment for Controlling Wood Deteriorating Fungi'', has been granted to the
FPL. The environmentally benign technology contained therein protects wood against discoloration by sapstain
(blue-stain) and mold fungi and degradation by wood-rotting fungi. It involves the treatment of wood and wood products
with the microbiocide in the form of (1) living cells, (2) metabolites, and (3) metabolites with low concentration
of cobiocides. This technology is an alternative to treating wood with synthetic chemical preservatives which can
pose a serious threat to the environment. The current market worldwide for antisapstain chemicals alone is about
eighty million dollars annually. The value of treated wood shipments for the United States of America is about two
billion, five hundred million dollars annually.



It is anticipated that the entity entering into a CRADA will be granted a right of first refusal to license any new patents
resulting form the research under the CRADA.

This notice is issued under the authority of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 3710a).

Based on our analysis of the petition and subsequent amendments, we have made certain adjustments to the petitioner's
FMV calculation as follows: 

(1) We disallowed all factors valued using the petitioner's own costs; 
(2) We recalculated factory overhead and SG&A expenses to account for certain energy and inventory expenses
excluded from the petitioner's calculation of COM; 
(3) We disallowed an amount included by the petitioner for scrap loss because this cost was already included in the
cost of steel. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, the petitioner's alleged dumping margin, as revised by the Department, is 55.69
percent. 



Initiation of Investigation 



Pursuant to section 732(c) of the Act, the Department must determine, within 20 days after a petition is filed, whether
a petition sets forth an allegation necessary for the initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether
the petition contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegation. 

We have examined the petition for drawer slides from the PRC, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements
of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether
imports of drawer slides from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.
If this 
investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by April 9, 1995. 



International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification 



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action and we have done so. 



Preliminary Determinations by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by December 15, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of drawer slides
from the PRC are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)
of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

The primary application of ASTM A-106 pressure pipes and triple certified pipes is in pressure piping systems
by refineries, petrochemical plants, and chemical plants. Other applications are in power generation plants (electrical-fossil
fuel or nuclear), and in some oil field uses (on shore and off shore) such as for separator lines, gathering lines, and
metering runs. A minor application of this product is for use as oil and gas distribution line for commercial applications.
These applications constitute the majority of the market for the subject seamless pipes. However, A-106 pipes
may be used in some boiler applications. 

The scope of this investigation includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters
described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered
specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of this investigation.
Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A-106, A-53,
or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A-106, A-335, A-53, or API 5L application. 

For example, there are certain other ASTM specifications of pipe which, because of overlapping characteristics,
could potentially be used in A-106 applications. These specifications include A-162, A-192, A-210,
A-333, and A-524. When such pipes are used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application, such products
are covered by the scope of this investigation. 

Specifically excluded from this investigation are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing, and oil country tubular goods
except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application. Also excluded from this investigation are redraw
hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube. 

Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. This scope description is currently under review and may be altered
in the preliminary determination of the companion antidumping duty investigation of seamless pipe from Italy. 



Injury Test 



Because Italy is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the U.S. International
Trade Commission (``ITC'') is required to determine whether imports of seamless pipe from Italy materially injure,
or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. On August 3, 1994, the ITC preliminarily determined that there is
a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured or threatened with material
injury by reason of imports from Italy of the subject merchandise (59 FR 42286, August 17, 1994). 



Petitioner 



The petition in this investigation was filed by Gulf States Tubes, a division of Quanex Corporation. 



Corporate History of Respondent Dalmine 



Prior to its liquidation in 1988, Finsider S.p.A. (``Finsider'') was the holding company for all state-owned steel
companies in Italy. Dalmine was an operating company wholly owned by Finsider. After Finsider's liquidation, a new
government-owned holding company, ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), was created. ILVA took over the former Finsider companies,
among them Dalmine, which became a subsidiary of ILVA in 1989, when Finsider's shareholding in Dalmine was transferred
to ILVA. 

Between 1990 and 1993, Dalmine itself was restructured. Dalmine became a financial holding company, with industrial,
trading, and service shareholdings. As part of its restructuring, Dalmine made several asset purchases, sold two
of its subsidiaries to private parties, and closed several manufacturing facilities. As of December 31, 1993, the
Dalmine Group consisted of a holding company (Dalmine S.p.A.), four wholly-owned, and one majority-owned, manufacturing
companies, and a number of sales and service subsidiaries. 

During the POI, ILVA was owned by the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (``IRI''), a holding company which
was wholly-owned by the GOI. 



Spin-offs 



In its questionnaire response, Dalmine reported that between 1990 and 1991, as part of its overall restructuring
process, the company sold two ``productive units'' to private buyers. According to Dalmine, these sales involved
assets that do not produce the subject merchandise. Based on our analysis of Dalmine's response with respect to the
productive units sold, we preliminarily determine that the amount of potentially spun-off benefits is insignificant.
Therefore, we have not evaluated whether these benefits are attributable to sales of the subject merchandise for
purposes of this preliminary determination. (

 Final Concurrence Memorandum dated November 18, 1994.)

Equityworthiness 



Petitioner has alleged that Dalmine was unequityworthy in 1989, the year it received an indirect equity infusion
from the GOI, through ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), and that the equity infusion was, therefore, inconsistent with commercial
considerations. 

In its questionnaire response, Dalmine has provided evidence that private investors, unrelated to Dalmine or the
GOI, purchased a significant percentage of the 1989 equity offering, on the same terms as ILVA. Therefore, the Department
preliminarily determines that ILVA's purchase of Dalmine's shares was consistent with commercial considerations.
(

See

 section 355.44(e)(1)(i) of the 

Proposed Regulations

.) 



Creditworthiness 



Petitioner has alleged that Dalmine was uncreditworthy in every year between 1979 and 1993. In accordance with section
355.44 of the 

Proposed Regulations

, we examined Dalmine's current, quick, times interest earned, and debt-to-equity ratios, in addition to its profit
margin. Based on this analysis, we preliminarily determine that Dalmine was creditworthy from 1979 through 1993.
(

See

 Creditworthy Memorandum, November 18, 1994). Specifically, although a number of the financial indicators are weak
for certain years, none of the indicators are weak over the medium or long term, and when examined together on a yearly
basis, the indicators support the determination that Dalmine was creditworthy in every year examined. In addition,
Dalmine received comparable long-term, commercial loans from private lenders in several of the years examined.
While we have based our preliminary creditworthiness determination on the company's financial indicators, the
fact that Dalmine received a number of long-term commercial loans during this period supports our finding. 



Benchmarks and Discount Rates 



Dalmine did not take out any long-term fixed rate lira denominated loans or other debt obligations in any of the years
of the government loans under investigation. Therefore, in accordance with section 355.44(b)(4) of the 

Proposed Regulations,

 we used, as the benchmark interest rate, the Bank of Italy reference rate. We have determined that this rate constitutes
the best approximation of the cost of long-term borrowing in Italy and the only long-term fixed interest rate commonly
available in Italy. (

See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from Italy

 (``

Certain Steel from Italy

''), 58 FR, 37327 (July 9, 1993).) 

We have also used this rate as the discount rate for allocating over time the benefit from non-recurring grants for
the same reasons as explained in 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Spain

, 58 FR 37374, 37376 (July 9, 1993). 

For long-term loans denominated in other currencies, we used, as the benchmark interest rate, the average long-term
fixed interest rate denominated in the same currency. (See section E_Article 54 Loans below.) 



Calculation Methodology 



For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which we are measuring subsidies (the POI) is calendar
year 1993. In determining the benefits received under the various programs described below, we used the following
calculation methodology. We first calculated the benefit attributable to the POI for each countervailable program,
using the methodologies described in each program section below. For each program, we then divided the benefit attributable
to Dalmine in the POI by Dalmine's total sales revenue, as none of the programs was limited to either certain subsidiaries
or products of Dalmine. Next, we added the benefits for all programs, including the benefits for programs which were
not allocated over time, to arrive at Dalmine's total subsidy rate. Because Dalmine is the only respondent company
in this investigation, this rate is also the country-wide rate. 

Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a response to an allegation denies the existence
of a program, receipt of benefits under a program, or eligibility of a company or industry under a program, and the Department
has no persuasive evidence showing that the response is incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary
determination. All such responses, however, are subject to verification. If the response cannot be supported at
verification, and the program is otherwise countervailable, the program will be considered a subsidy in the final
determination.

Based upon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaires, we preliminarily determine the following:




I. Programs Preliminarily Determined to be Countervailable 



A. Benefits Provided Under Law 675/77 



Law 675/77 was enacted in 1977 to bring about restructuring and reconversion in the following industrial sectors:
(1) electronic technology; (2) the manufacturing industry; (3) the agro-food industry; (4) the chemical industry;
(5) the steel industry; (6) the pulp and paper industry; (7) the fashion sector; and (8) the automobile and aviation
sectors. Law 675/77 also sought to promote optimal exploitation of energy resources, and ecological and environmental
recovery. 

A primary goal of this legislation was to bring all government industrial assistance programs under a single law.
Other goals were (1) to reorganize and develop the industrial sector as a whole; (2) to increase employment in the South;
and (3) to maintain employment in depressed areas. Among other measures taken, the Interministerial Committee for
the Coordination of Industrial Policy (``CIPI'') was created as a result of Law 675/77. CIPI approves individual
projects in each of the industrial sectors listed above. 

Six main programs were provided under Law 675/77: (1) interest contributions on bank loans; (2) mortgage loans provided
by the Ministry of Industry at subsidized interest rates; (3) interest contributions on funds raised by bond issues;
(4) capital grants for projects in the South; (5) personnel retraining grants; and (6) VAT reductions on purchases
of capital goods by companies in the South. Dalmine reported that it received benefits under items (1), (2), and (5)
above. 

In its response, the GOI asserts that the steel and automobile industries did not receive a ``disproportionate''
share of benefits associated with interest contributions when the extent of government investment in those industries
is compared to the extent of investment in other industries. However, in keeping with past practice, we did not consider
the level of investment in the individual industries receiving benefits under Law 675/77. Instead, we followed the
analysis outlined in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel

 and 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Brazil

, 58 FR 37295, 37295 (July 9, 1993), of comparing the share of benefits received by the steel industry to the collective
share of benefits provided to other users of the programs. 

According to the information provided by the GOI, the two dominant users of the interest contribution program were
(1) the Italian steel industry which accounted for 33 percent of the benefits, and (2) the auto industry which accounted
for 34 percent of the benefits. Likewise, with respect to the mortgage loans, the two dominant users were the auto and
steel industries which received 45 percent and 31 percent of the benefits, respectively. 

In light of the above evidence, we preliminarily determine that the steel industry was a dominant user of both the interest
contribution and the mortgage loan programs under Law 675/77 because the steel industry has been a dominant user of
these programs. (

See

 section 355.43(b)(2)(iii) of the 

Proposed Regulations

.) Therefore, we preliminarily determine that benefits received by Dalmine under these programs are being provided
to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. On this basis, we preliminarily find Law
675/77 financing to be countervailable. 

Under the interest contribution program, Italian commercial banks provided loans to industries designated under
Law 675/77. According to the responses of the GOI and Dalmine, the interest owed by the recipient companies was partially
offset by interest contributions from the GOI. Dalmine received bank loans with interest contributions under Law
675/77 which were outstanding in the POI.

<DOCNO> FR941128-2-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-2-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Because Dalmine knew that it would receive the GOI interest contributions over the life of the loan when it obtained
the loans, we consider the contributions to constitute reductions in the interest rates charged rather than grants
(

see Certain Steel from Italy 

at 37335). 
Under the mortgage loan program, the GOI provides long-term loans at subsidized interest rates. Dalmine received
financing under this program which was outstanding in the POI. 
To determine whether these programs conferred a benefit, we compared the effective interest rate paid by Dalmine
to the benchmark interest rate, discussed above. Based on this comparison, we preliminarily determine that the financing
provided under these programs is inconsistent with commercial considerations, 

i.e.

, on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing. 


To calulcate the benefit from these programs, we used our standard long-term loan methodology as described in section
355.49(c)(1) of the 

Proposed Regulations. 

We then divided the benefit allocated to the POI for each program by Dalmine's total sales in 1993. On this basis, we
determine the net subsidy from these programs to be 0.47 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.
With respect to retraining grants provided to Dalmine under Law 675/77, it is the Department's practice to treat training
benefits as recurring grants. (

See Certain Steel General Issues Appendix 

at 37226). Since the only grant reported under this program was received by Dalmine in 1986, any benefit to Dalmine
as a result of this grant cannot be attributed to the POI. Therefore, we determine that retraining benefits provided
under Law 675/77 conferred no benefit to Dalmine during the POI.



B. Grants Under Law 193/84



According to the GOI, Articles 2, 3, and 4 of Law 193/84 provide for subsidies to close steel plants. As stated in Art.
20 of Law N. 46 of 17/2/1982, steel enterprises, including enterprises producing seamless pipes, welded pipes, conduits
and welded pipes for water and gas, are the recipients of these subsidies. As benefits under this program are limited
to the steel industry, we preliminary determine that Law 193/84 is 

de jure 

specific and, therefore, countervailable. In this investigation, information provided by Dalmine indicates that
the company received grants under Law 193/84.

To calculate the benefit during the POI, we used our standard grant methodology (

see 

section 355.49(b) of the 

Proposed Regulations

). We then divided the benefits attributable to Dalmine under Law 193/84 in the POI by Dalmine's total sales. On this
basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.75 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 




C. Exchange Rate Guarantee Program 




This program, which was enacted by Law 796/76, provides exchange rate guarantees on foreign currency loans from the
European Coal and Steel Community (``ECSC'') and 

The Council of European Resettlement Fund (``CER''). 

Under the program, repayment amounts are calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect at the time the loan
is agreed upon. The program sets a ceiling and a floor on repayment to limit the effect on the borrower of exchange rate
changes over time. For example, if the lire depreciates five percent against the DM (the currency in which the loan
is taken out), borrowers would normally find that they would have to repay five percent more (in lire terms). However,
under the Exchange Rate Guarantee Program, the ceiling would act to limit the increased repayment amount to two percent.
There is also a floor in the program which would apply if the lire appreciated against the DM. The floor would limit any
windfall to the borrower. 


In 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, 

the Department found this program to be not countervailable because of incomplete information regarding the specificity
of the program. The Department stated that, because the determination was reached while lacking certain important
information, the finding of non-countervailability would not carry over to future investigations. 


In this investigation, information provided by the GOI shows that the steel industry received 25% of the benefits
under the program. Based on this information, the Department preliminarily determines that the steel industry was
a dominant user of exchange rate guarantees under Law 796/76 and, thus, that benefits received by Dalmine under this
law are being provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. (

See 

section 355.43(b)(2)(iii) of the 

Proposed Regulations

.) Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the exchange rate guarantees offered under the program are countervailable
to the extent they are provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. 


Dalmine provided information that it could have purchased an exchange rate guarantee from commercial sources. However,
Dalmine's information pertained to 1993, not to the period when the government-provided guarantees were taken out.
The GOI's response indicates that commercial exchange rate guarantees were not available in 1986, the year in which
the loan and the guarantee were received. Therefore, we preliminarily determine the benefit to Dalmine to be the total
amount of GOI payments on these loans made during the POI by the GOI. (Because the amount the government will pay in any
given year will not be known until that year, benefits can only be calculated on a year-by-year basis.) We divided the
GOI's payments in 1993 by Dalmine's 1993 total sales. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy from this
program to be 0.20 percent ad valorem for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.





II. Programs Preliminarily Determined to be Not Countervailable




A. 1988/89 Equity Infusion 




In November 1989, Dalmine completed an equity rights offering which allowed existing shareholders to purchase 7
new shares for every 10 shares they already owned. The new shares were offered at a price of LIT 300 per share. At that
time, ILVA owned 81.7 percent of Dalmine's equity, with the remaining 18.3 percent owned by private investors. Pursuant
to the rights offering, ILVA subscribed to its full allotment of the new shares. The remainder of the new shares were
purchased by private shareholders. All shares were purchased at LIT 300 per share. 


Petitioner argues that although Dalmine's shares were nominally publicly traded, the vast majority of Dalmine shares
were indirectly owned by the GOI and, therefore, shares were not purchased in adequate volume by private investors
to establish a valid benchmark. Specifically, petitioner contends that in 1991 ILVA owned 99.9 percent of Dalmine
and, therefore, Dalmine's shares were in fact not publicly traded. Consequently, because essentially no private
purchases were being made, the market price at the time of the equity infusion cannot serve as a valid benchmark. Furthermore,
petitioner asserts that it is highly likely that the remaining shares not purchased by ILVA were purchased indirectly
by the GOI through other holding companies. 


In response to our questionnaire, Dalmine provided a list of all purchasers of shares in the 1989 offering. There is
no evidence to indicate that the shares not purchased by ILVA were purchased by other government controlled or owned
entities, as petitioner suggests. Moreover, the extent of ILVA's ownership in 1991 is not relevant to the choice of
a benchmark for the equity investment in 1989. 


We have preliminarily determined that, because 18.3 percent of the equity infusion was purchased by private shareholders,
the sale of these shares provides the market-determined price for Dalmine's equity. Furthermore, in accordance
with section 355.44 (e)(1) of the Department's Proposed Regulations, we preliminarily determine that the equity
infusion is not countervailable because the market-determined price for Dalmine's shares is not less than the price
paid by ILVA for those shares.

B. European Social Fund (``ESF'') Grants 


The ESF was established by the 1957 European Economic Community Treaty to increase employment and help raise worker
living standards. 
As described in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel,

 the ESF receives its funds from the EC's general budget whose main revenue sources are customs duties, agricultural
levies, value-added taxes collected by the member states, and other member state contributions. 
The member states are responsible for selecting the projects to be funded by the EC. The EC then disburses the grants
to the member states which manage the funds and implement the projects. According to the EC, ESF grants are available
to (1) people over 25 who have been unemployed for more than 12 months; (2) people under 25 who have reached the minimum
school-leaving age and who are seeking a job; and (3) certain workers in rural areas and regions characterized by industrial
decline or lagging development. 
The GOI has stated that the ESF grants received by Italy have been used for vocational training. Certain regions in
the South are also eligible for private sector re-entry and retraining schemes. Since 1990, the vocational training
grants have been available to unemployed youths and long-term unemployed adults all over Italy, according to the
GOI. Before 1990, however, the GOI gave preference to certain regions in Italy. 
In 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, 

we determined that this program was not regionally specific and not otherwise limited to a specific enterprise or
industry, or group of enterprises or industries. Furthermore, we noted that to the extent there is a regional preference
(

i.e.,

 southern Italy) in the distribution of ESF benefits, it has not resulted in a countervailable benefit to the production
of the subject merchandise, which is produced in northern Italy. 
The GOI's response in this investigation is consistent with the information provided in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel.

 Therefore, we preliminarily determine that this program is not limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group
of enterprises or industries and, therefore, is not countervailable. 


C. ECSC Article 54 Loans 


Under Article 54 of the 1951 ECSC Treaty, the European Commission provides loans directly to iron and steel companies
for modernization and the purchase of new equipment. The loans finance up to 50 percent of an investment project. The
remaining financing needs must be met from other sources. The Article 54 loan program is financed by loans taken by
the Commission, which are then re-lent to iron and steel companies in the member states at a slightly higher interest
rate than that at which the Commission obtained them. 
Consistent with the Department's finding in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel,

 we preliminarily determine that this program is limited to the iron and steel industry. As a result, loans under this
program are specific. 
Of the Article 54 loans Dalmine had outstanding during the POI, some were denominated in U.S. dollars and others were
in Dutch guilders (``NLG''). To determine whether the loans were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial
considerations, we used benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the loans were denominated. That is,
for the U.S. dollar loans we used the average interest rate on long-term fixed-rate U.S. dollar loans obtained in the
United States, as reported by the Federal Reserve. For the NLG denominated loan, we used the average long-term bond
rate for private borrowers in the Netherlands, as reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(``OECD''). 
Because the interest rates paid on Dalmine's Article 54 loans are higher than the benchmark interest rates, the Department
preliminarily determines that loans provided under this program are not preferential and, therefore, not countervailable.



D. 1989 Provisional Payment in Connection With 1989 Equity Infusion 


In March 1989, ILVA made a payment to Dalmine in anticipation of purchasing new shares in Dalmine. The payment was provisional
in nature because EC authorization of the capital increase was necessary, and if authorization was not granted, the
money would have been repaid to ILVA. The capital increase was not finalized until November 1989, due to delays in EC
approval. At that time, the payment became equity capital. 
Consistent with the Department's position in 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from Italy (Grain-Oriented
Electrical Steel),

 59 FR 18357 (April 18, 1994), we preliminarily determine that the funds provided by ILVA to Dalmine are countervailable.

During the period March-November 1989, Dalmine had use of the money and paid no interest on it. Therefore, we have treated
the funds provided by ILVA to Dalmine as an interest-free short-term loan from March 1989 to November 1989. 
Because any benefit from this interest-free loan would be allocable entirely to 1989, no benefit is attributable
to the POI. 


III. Programs Preliminarily Determined to be Not Used


Based on the information provided in the responses, we preliminarily determine that the following programs were
not used. This determination is subject to verification.



1. 

Preferential IMI Export Financing Under Law 227/77 
2. Preferential Insurance Under Law 227/77 
3. Retraining Grants under Law 181/89

 (59 FR 49062) that a request for a scientific research permit to harass Atlantic bottlenose dolphins during photo-identification
and observational activities had been submitted by the above-named organization.


NMFS published an Interim Final Rule (50 CFR parts 215 and 216, General Authorization for Scientific Research, 59
FR 50372, October 3, 1994, establishing a General Authorization for scientific research activities that involve
only Level B harassment of marine mammals. Level B harassment is defined as ``any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance
which has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral
patterns, including, but not limited to migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering but which
does not have the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild.'' Research activities that
are likely to involve only Level B harassment are identified as photo-identification, behavioral observations,
and vessel and aerial surveys. NMFS has confirmed that the General Authorization applies to the proposed scientific
research as described in the application.

<DOCTITLE>Procurement List Addition </DOCTITLE>

AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the Procurement List.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be 
furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or 
have other severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On August 19, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who 
Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 F.R. 42820) 
of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
Comments were received from the current contractor for the 
janitorial service, four other disadvantaged businesses in 
Utah, the Utah office of the Small Business Administration 
(SBA), and a legal defense fund representing disadvantaged 
businesses. All the commenters opposed the proposal to add the 
service to the Procurement List. 


The current contractor indicated that its contract for the 
service represented a sizeable part of its sales for the last 
quarter, and noted that not being allowed to perform the 
remaining option year of its contract could affect its survival. 
The contractor cited its quality performance on the contract, as 
evidenced by an award it had received. The legal defense fund 
seconded the contractor's comments. 
The four other Utah disadvantaged businesses noted that the 
service had long been in the Federal disadvantaged business 
(8(a)) program. Its removal from the program, along with 
closures of two other military bases in Utah, would, they 
claimed, eliminate about a fifth of the 8(a) contracting 
business in Utah, requiring disadvantaged businesses to go 
outside of the State to do Federal work in the program. 
Accordingly, they indicated that addition of this contract to 
the Procurement List would negatively impact them. 
The SBA district office also indicated that this service has 
been in the 8(a) program for many years. The office indicated 
that the service is a substantial part of the program in Utah, 
representing at least ten percent of program dollars and nearly 
fifty percent of program dollars in janitorial services. The 
office also seconded the current contractor's comments 
concerning its option and its performance on the contract. 
Additions to the Procurement List do not affect contracts in 
being before the effective date of the addition, or options 
exercised under those contracts. The decision to exercise an 
option is solely at the discretion of the Government 
contracting activity. Consequently, if an option is not 
exercised, any resulting impact on a contractor is because of 
the contracting activity's decision and not the Committee's 
action in adding an item to the Procurement List. In this 
particular case, the option in question has already been 
exercised, so the contractor will retain the work for the 
coming year. 
A comparison of the comments by the SBA district office and the 
four Utah businesses with information available from Hill Air 
Force Base contracting staff indicates that the commenters have 
exaggerated the impact on the 8(a) program of adding this 
service to the Procurement List. Based on FY 1994 data, this 
contract represents only six percent of all 8(a) contracts at 
Hill Air Force Base. Since there are other 8(a) contracts in 
Utah, such as a General Services Administration contract for 
janitorial services at the Federal building in Salt Lake City, 
this contract clearly represents an extremely small percentage 
of all the 8(a) contracts in Utah. 
With respect to 8(a) janitorial contracts in Utah, the 
Committee recognizes that there are a limited number of 
opportunities to clean Federal facilities. However, it also 
knows that many 8(a) janitorial contracts are competed among 
8(a) contractors on a regional or national basis. Consequently, the Federal business opportunities for 8(a) 
janitorial firms in Utah are not limited to contracts for 
facilities within Utah. Moreover, adding this service to the 
Procurement List is not taking business away from the current 
contractor or the other 8(a) contractors which commented, but 
only removing the opportunity for 8(a) firms other than the 
current contractor to obtain the work in the future. 
Taking into account all these factors, the Committee does not 
believe that addition of this service to the Procurement List 
will have a severe impact on the 8(a) program and its Utah 
contractors. The Committee's action will also create a very 
large number of jobs for people with severe disabilities, well 
beyond the average for a Procurement List addition. 
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, 
fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or 
most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the 
service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the service 
to the Government. 


'2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46 - 48c) in connection with the service proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: Janitorial/Custodial 
(Remaining buildings not on Procurement List) 
Hill Air Force Base, Utah. 
This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) for the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of availability.





sumamry: 

The BMDO has finished and is now making available the Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Final Programmatic Environmental
Impact Statement (FPEIS). The purpose of the BMD Program is to develop the capabilities to protect both the United
States, and those areas of vital interest to the United States (e.g., U.S. troops, allies, and friends) from ballistic
missile attack. The BMD FPEIS analyzes the potential environmental impacts associated with the Preferred Action
and three alternatives.



The BMD Program consists of two segments, Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile Defense (NMD). TMD,
though part of the BMD Program, has independent utility and is evaluated in its own PEIS. Under all alternatives in
the BMD FPEIS, the acquisition of TMD system capabilities will continue as described in the TMD Record of Decision
published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 11, 1994. Additional details about the TMD program may be found in the Final Theater Missile Defense Programmatic
Life-Cycle Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command.

The Preferred Action in the BMD FPEIS is to continue a focused approach to long-lead time technology development in
the form of the NMD Technology Readiness Program. The Preferred Action is also the No Action Alternative as it is a continuation
of current BMDO policy. The NMD Technology Readiness Program involves the development of existing and new technologies
and test systems for ground- and space-based elements (excluding Space-Based interceptors). Research is to be focused
to ensure the capability to deploy a limited NMD system in the next decade. Basic technology efforts will continue
to infuse new advances as the program proceeds. Contingency planning and options development will also continue
to be conducted to meet unexpected threats.

The FPEIS also analyzes three System Acquisition Alternatives for the continued research and development of a BMD
system capability by the Department of Defense (DoD). The environmental impacts of later life-cycle phases beyond
research, development, and testing for these alternatives are discussed in the FPEIS to enhance future decision-making
on whether and how the DoD could proceed with a BMD system. Alternatives to the Preferred Action analyzed in the FPEIS
include:

 

Ground-and Space-Based Sensors and Ground and Space-Based Interceptors System Acquisition Alternative. 

Under this alternative, BMDO would proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Preferred
Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would also allow for the acquisition of a Ground-and
Space-Based NMD system to proceed to the development of a system capability.

 

All Ground-Based System Acquisition Alternative

. Under this alternative, BMDO would also proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to
the Preferred Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would allow for the acquisition of an All
Ground-Based NMD system to proceed to the development of a system capability.

 

Ground-and Space-Based Sensors and Ground-Based Interceptors System Acquisition Alternative

. Under this alternative, BMDO would proceed with research, development, and testing activities similar to the Proposed
Action but at a more intense level of effort. This alternative would allow for the acquisition of a Ground-and Space-Based
NMD system (without Space-Based Interceptors) to proceed to the development of a system capability.

A Record of Decision on the BMD PEIS' alternatives will be made available no earlier than 30 days after this Notice of
Availability (of the FPEIS) is published in the 

Federal Register

.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability Record of Decision (ROD); KC-135 Combat Crew Training School (CCTS) Relocation </DOCTITLE>



The Air Force has prepared a classified environmental impact statement (EIS) assessing the potential cumulative
environmental effects of a Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (Commission) 1993 recommendation to
relocate specified KC-135 CCTS units to Altus AFB, OK. The EIS also analyzed classified C-17 actions that
will take place at Altus. Consideration of cumulative impacts, when associated with the Commission recommendations,
required portions of the EIS to be classified. A ROD was prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (NEPA) and summarizes the decision of the Air Force on the proposals. 

Commission actions in 1991 recommended the closure of Castle AFB and the relocation to Fairchild AFB, Washington,
of the 398 OG, which is the Air Force's KC-135 CCTS. In 1993, Commission recommendations redirected the relocation
of the 398 OG from Fairchild AFB to Altus AFB. 

The President accepted, and the Congress did not reject, the recommendations of the Commission; therefore Public
Law 101-510 requires the Secretary of Defense, as a matter of law, to implement the realignment. The movement
of the specified units to Altus AFB is by law, a final decision, therefore, no other beddown alternative locations
were assessed. 

The CCTS conducts formal flying training in the KC-135 aircraft for pilots, navigators, and boom operators.
The CCTS also provides instructor training in each of these aircrew positions. Locating the CCTS at Altus AFB will
increase the number of KC-135s at the base by two for a total of 24 primary assigned aircraft (PAA). The Air Mobility
Command's 457 OG, an Altus Tenant that currently operates KC-135 aircraft, will inactivate before the CCTS
starts training. 

Tulsa, Clinton-Sherman, and Will Rogers World (Oklahoma City) Airports, all in Oklahoma, as well as the Midland International
Airport, Texas, may be used as auxiliary training airfields for some CCTS flying training missions. 

Requests for copies of the ROD or other information regarding this action should be directed to: Mr. Jack C. Bush, Headquarters
Air Force, Environmental Planning Division, 1260 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1260, (703) 695-1236.

Corps of Engineers and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the study sponsor, to investigate coastal
processes on a regional basis to recommend modifications for existing shore protection and navigation projects.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

1. The Coast of Florida Erosion and Storm Effects Study was authorized on 16 July 1984, by Section 104 of the 1985 Appropriations
Act (Public Law 98-360). The study area includes most of the Atlantic and Gulf coast of Florida and has been divided
into five coastal regions. The region currently being studied, and is the focus of the DEIS, is Region III which consists
of 92 miles of Atlantic Ocean coastline within Palm beach, Broward, and Dade counties. Several alternatives are being
considered in the study and will be addressed in the DEIS. These include: 


a. Continued renourishment of existing projects,
b. Design modifications to existing projects where needed,
c. Sand bypassing at inlets using sand transfer plants and/or conventional dredging,
d. Nearshore placement of suitable maintenance dredged material to feed adjacent beaches,
5. Use of suitable maintenance dredged material as beach fill,
6. Construction of groins and/or offshore breakwaters,
7. Dune construction,
8. Construction of sand traps at inlets to aid in sand bypassing,
9. Sand tightening existing jetties where the need has been identified. Sources of sand that have been identified
include offshore borrow areas, upland sand sources, suitable material from maintenance dredging and the possible
use of Bahamian aragonite.
2. Scoping: The scoping process will involve Federal, State, county and municipal agencies, and other interested
persons and organizations. A scoping letter (November 8, 1994) has been sent to interested Federal, State, county
and municipal agencies requesting their comments and concerns. Any persons and organizations wishing to participate
in the scoping process should contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the above address. Significant issues that
are anticipated include concern for offshore hard bottom communities, fisheries, water quality, sea turtles and
cultural resources.
3. Coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service will be accomplished
in compliance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Coordination required by applicable Federal and State
laws and policies will be conducted. Since the project will require the discharge of material into waters of the United
States, the discharge will comply with the provisions of section 404 of the Clean Water Act as amended.
4. DEIS Preparation: It is estimated that the DEIS will be available to the public during May of 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Availability for Exclusive, Partially Exclusive, or Nonexclusive Licensing of a U.S. Patent Concerning a Shaping
Apparatus for an Explosive Charge</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i), announcement is made of the availability of U.S. Patent 5,323,681 for licensing.
This patent has been assigned to the United States of America as represented by the Secretary of the Army, Washington,
D.C.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The invention provides a shaping apparatus for an explosive charge to be used with an Explosively Formed Penetrator
(EFP). The shaping apparatus comprises a nonmetal mold in the form of a frustrum of a cone with a latch and hinge attached
thereto. The mold is hand packed with a plastic bonded explosive to form an explosive charge. Current EFPs are limited
in performance due to poor projectile formation partially caused by nonuniform application of the explosive into
the rear portion of the EFP. This invention discloses a design of an explosive shaping apparatus which provides uniform
application of the explosive on to the EFP, resulting in improved EFP slug formation and flight characteristics.
The EFP standoff range is increased by as much as 400%. Standoff munitions, like the EFP, have wide potential application
for military use, including demolition of bridges and bunkers and off-road mine use. Additionally, the EFP could
be used by the mining industry to clear rock jams.




Under the authority of section 11(a)(2) of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-502) and section
207 of title 35, U.S. Code, the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Waterways Experiment Station wishes to
license the above United States Patent in an exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive manner to any party
interested in using the technology described in the above mentioned patent. Any interested party is requested to
submit a proposal for an exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive license. The proposals for using this
technology will be evaluated using the following criteria: technical capability, size of business, and developmental
plan.

Bangor-Hydro Electric Co.; Intent to Hold a Public Meeting in Bangor, Maine, to Discuss the Draft Environmental Impact
Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed Basin Mills Project and Existing Stillwater and Milford Projects



November 21, 1994.



On November 10, 1994, the Commission staff mailed the Lower Penobscot River Basin DEIS to the Environmental Protection
Agency, resource and land management agencies, and interested organizations and individuals. This document evaluates
the environmental consequences of: (1) Constructing and operating the license applicant's proposed Basin Mills
project which consists of a new 38 mega-watt (MW) Basin Mills hydroelectric development, expansion of the existing
Veazie hydroelectric development from 8.4 to 16.4 MW and decommissioning of the existing 2.3 MW Orono development;
(2) continuing operation of the applicant's existing 1.95 MW Stillwater project; (3) expanding the applicant's
existing Milford project from 6.4 MW to 8 MW; and (4) alternatives to the applicant's proposals.

The DEIS evaluates five alternatives for the Basin Mills proposal: No action (deny Basin Mills license, continue
existing operation of Veazie and Orono); BHE's proposal; BHE's proposal with additional staff-recommended mitigation;
not constructing Basin Mills but relicensing Veazie, with or without increased capacity, in combination with decommissioning
or refurbishing Orono; and not constructing Basin Mills, decommissioning and removing Veazie dam, and refurbishing
Orono.

Alternatives for the Stillwater and Milford projects include: No action; applicant's proposal; and applicant's
proposal with staff-recommended mitigation.

The public meeting, which will be recorded by an official stenographer, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, December
13, 1994, at the Ramada Inn, 357 Odlin Road (Exit 45B off I-95), in Bangor, Maine.

At the meeting, resource agency personnel and other interested persons will have the opportunity to provide oral
and written comments and recommendations regarding the DEIS for the Commission's public record.

Application To Export Electricity; Citizens Utilities Company


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Fossil Energy, DOE.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Citizens Utilities Company (Citizens) has requested authorization to export electric energy to Canada.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Exports of electricity from the United States to a foreign country are regulated and require authorization under
section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act.


On October 12, 1994, Citizens filed an application with the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy
(DOE) for authorization to export electric energy to Canada pursuant to section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. Citizens
has requested authority to export up to 50,000 megawatt-hours (MWH) per year of electric energy to Hydro-Quebec at
a maximum rate of transmission of 50 megawatts (MW). Citizens proposes to use the existing 120,000-volt transmission
facilities at Derby Line, Vermont, to affect the export. The construction, connection, operation, and maintenance
of these facilities were authorized by Presidential Permit PP-66, issued by the DOE on June 21, 1979.
Citizens and Hydro-Quebec have had an interconnection agreement since January 25, 1988, which among other things,
provides for mutual assistance during emergencies. On March 31, 1993, in Order DOE/FE EA-66, and again on May
28, 1993, in Order DOE/FE EA-66-A, FE granted Citizens temporary authority to export to Hydro-Quebec
in order to supply electric service to Canadian customers during a maintenance outage of Hydro-Quebec's Stanstead
substation. Citizens now seeks permanent authority to export to Hydro-Quebec under circumstances similar to those
authorized in Orders EA-66 and EA-66-A or because of emergency conditions.


Procedural Matters 


Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a petition to intervene or protest at the
address provided above in accordance with   385.211 or 385.214 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure
(18 CFR 385.211, 385.214).
Any such petitions and protests should be filed with the DOE on or before the date listed above. Additional copies of
such petitions to intervene or protests also should be filed directly with: Craig A. Marks, Senior Counsel, Citizens
Utilities Company, 1233 West Bank Expressway, Harvey, La. 70059, (504) 367-7000, ext. 235; Kimberly M. Kiener,

Harvey, La. 70059, (504) 367-7000, ext. 210.
Pursuant to 18 CFR 385.211, protests and comments will be considered by the DOE in determining the appropriate action
to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must
file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state,
to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail
to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or
represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as
a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation
is in the public interest.
A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will
not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination
in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act.
Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting
the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
Copies of this application will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copying at the address
provided above.

Acid Rain Program; Notice of Final Permits 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of permits.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving 5-year sulfur dioxide compliance plans, according
to the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72), for the following 15 utility plants: Collins, Crawford, Fisk,
Joliet 9, Joliet 29, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County in Illinois; Petersburg and State Line in Indiana; Allen S
King, Black Dog in Minnesota, High Bridge, Riverside, and Sherburne County in Minnesota; and Poston in Ohio. 


These final permits were initially issued as direct final actions and were subsequently withdrawn and re-proposed
as draft permits because of the submission of significant, adverse comments objecting to the issuance of the direct
final permits. EPA's responses to the original objections and to all comments submitted during the comment periods
for these permits can be found in the public dockets for each permit. Contact the Regional staff listed below for more
information. 
The final permits set forth in this notice are based on and are consistent with the Partial Settlement Agreement in


Environmental Defense Fund 

v. 

Carol M. Browner

, No. 93-1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993), which the Administrator determined to be a reasonable resolution of certain
litigation issues concerning the Acid Rain regulations and which was signed on behalf of the Administrator on May
4, 1994. Further, the final permit for Petersburg is also 
consistent with provisions in  72.42 of the Acid Rain regulations that have been challenged in a petition for
review. Pursuant to the delegation of authority from the Administrator, it has been found, under section 307(b)(1)
of the Clean Air Act, that each of these permits is based on a determination of nationwide scope and effect. Consequently,
under section 307(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of final agency action in these proceedings must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 60 days after the date that a notice
of the final agency action is published in the 

Federal Register

. Filing a petition for reconsideration of the Administrator of the final agency action does not affect the finality
of the action for the purposes of judicial review, extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be
filed, or postpone the effectiveness of the action. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, the final agency action may
not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.

or by FAX at (919) 541-0237. Written comments on the draft staff paper will be accepted through January 15, 1995.
Comments should be sent to Mrs. Chebryll C. Edwards at the previously stated address. 
2_Discuss EPA plans for development of the document Air Quality Criteria for Airborne Particulate Matter. That document
is being prepared by EPA as part of the process to meet Clean Air Act statutory requirements for the periodic review
and revision, as appropriate, of criteria and National Ambient Air Quality Standard for Particulate Matter. The
process for developing the subject criteria document is described in a draft document entitled Program Work Plan
for Preparation of Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter, which will be summarized and discussed at the meeting.
Single copies of the draft Work Plan can be obtained from Ms. Diane Ray, Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office
(MD-52), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Ms. Ray can also be reached by phone at 919-541-3637

particulate matter staff paper. Questions concerning the Staff Paper Development Plan should be addressed to Mr.
Eric Smith, Air Quality Strategies and Standards Division (MD-15), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.
Mr. Smith can also be reached by phone at 919-541-5135 or by FAX at 919-541-0237. 
3_Finally, a summary of the EPA's Particulate Matter (PM) Research Strategy for Health Exposure Issues will also
be presented to the Committee. A strategy document has been prepared which briefly describes the problem of concern,
the research mission, the research program goals and objectives, presents a research planning framework, lists
criteria for ranking research and identifies research priorities. The strategy articulated in the document will
be used: (a) To focus EPA's PM research efforts on issues surrounding recent mortality and morbidity observations
associated with PM; (b) to structure and guide EPA's research activities over the next five years; and (c) to communicate
and coordinate with other public and private research organizations and, thereby, help shape a national PM research
agenda. Copies of the strategy document can be obtained from Ms. Diane Ray, Environmental Criteria and Assessment
Office (MD-52), U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Ms. Ray can also be reached by phone at 919-541-3637

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of a Notification to Conduct Small-Scale Field Testing of a Genetically-Engineered Microbial Pesticide
</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received from American Cyanamid Company of New Jersey a notification (241-NMP-E) of intent to
conduct small-scale field testing involving a baculovirus 

Autographa californica

 Multiple Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (ACMNPV) which has been genetically engineered to contain an insect-specific
protein toxin from the venom of the scorpion 

Androctonus australis

. American Cyanamid intends to test this microbial pesticide on lettuce, cabbage and leafy vegetables in the states
of Florida and Texas. Target pests for these field trials include the cabbage looper and the tobacco budworm. The Agency
has determined that the application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore, in accordance with
40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. 




Dates:

 Written comments must be received on or before December 28, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to EPA's Statement of Policy entitled, ``Microbial
Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act,''
published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), was received on September 29, 1994, from American Cyanamid Company of New Jersey (NMP
No. 241-NMP-E). The proposed small-scale field trial involves the introduction of a genetically-engineered
isolate of the baculovirus 

Autographa californica

 Multiple Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (AcMNPV). The strain to be tested (VEGTDEL-AaIT) has been genetically modified
with approximately 1 kilobase internal deletion in the ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase gene and an inserted
gene which encodes an insect specific toxin protein from the venom of the scorpion 

Androctonus australis

. 



The purpose of the proposed testing will be to evaluate the efficacy of this genetically-altered AcMNPV (relative
to the gene-deleted construct and a commercial 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 insecticide) against certain lepidopteran species (

Trichoplusia ni

 (cabbage looper and 

Heliothis virescens

 (tobacco budworm)) on lettuce, cabbage, and leafy vegetables. 

The proposed program consists of two field trials to be conducted late 1994 or early 1995 (depending upon pest infestation
levels) in Florida and Texas. Both sites will be located on secured research farmland. The test will consist of a maximum
of four treatments with four plots per treatment and a maximum of six applications per treatment. The maximum size
of a given treatment plot in each test will be 0.018 acres (4 rows wide x 60 ft. long). The total acreage treated with the
genetically modified construct will consist of 0.44 acres. Treatments will be applied to plots in the test area using
ground equipment: small tractor sprayers or CO

2

 driven back pack sprayers. 

Soil monitoring will take place both during the test and approximately 1 month after the crops are destroyed. Baculovirus
present in the soil (if any) will be detected via bioassay and identified genetically using Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) technique. Upon completion of the trial, crops will undergo crop destruction at the test site and adjacent buffer
zones. Wild-type ACMNPV will be oversprayed if the genetic construct is detected in the area 100 feet from the site
of application. Following the review of American Cyanamid Company's application and any comments received in response
to this notice, EPA will decide whether or not an experimental use permit is required.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>


November 16, 1994.


The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418-0214. Persons wishing
to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10214
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.






OMB Number:

 3060-0029.




Title:

 Application for TV Broadcast Station License.


Form Number:

 FCC Form 302-TV.


Action:

 Revision of a currently approved collection.


Respondents:

 Non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 54 responses, 20.25 hours average burden per response, 1,094 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 On 7/16/92, the OMB approved for use a new FCC Form 302-FM (3060-0506) to be used by licensees and permittees
to apply for a new or modified FM license. The FCC Form 302-FM was created through the Total Quality Management
(TQM) process. At the time of approval, the current FCC 302 was to be used only for the AM and TV services. At this time,
the Commission is separating the AM and TV services into separate forms. The FCC Form 302-TV will use the current
OMB control number (3060-0029). Licensees and permittees of TV broadcast stations are required to file FCC
Form 302-TV to obtain a new or modified station license, and/or to notify the Commission of certain changes in
the licensed facilities of these stations. The data is used by FCC staff to confirm that the station has been built to
terms specified in the outstanding construction permit, and to update FCC station files. Data is then extracted from
the FCC Form 302-TV for inclusion in the subsequent license to operate the station. The FCC Form 302-AM
will be submitted to OMB as a new collection and will require a new OMB control number. 




OMB Number:

 3060-0484.




Title:

 Amendment of Part 63 of the Commission's Rules to Provide for Notification by Common Carriers of Service Disruptions
(Section 63.100).


Action:

 Revision of a currently approved collection.


Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit.


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement and Other: Initial report due 120 minutes or three days after incident depending
on the number of potentially affected customers and type of disruption. Final report due 30 days after initial report.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 208 responses; 5 hours average burden per response; hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 Section 63.100 previously required that ``any local exchange or interexchange common carrier that operates transmission
or switching facilities and provides access service or interstate or international telecommunications service
that experiences an outage which potentially affects 50,000 or more of its customers on any facilities which it owns
or operates must notify the Commission if such service outage continues for 30 or more minutes. Satellite carriers
and cellular carriers were exempt from this reporting requirement.'' An initial and a final report is required for
each outage. In addition to those changes made in Section 63.100 in the Memorandum Opinion and Order (MO&O) and
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) adopted by the Commission on 11/5/93, pursuant to the present Order
and previously approved by OMB, the amendments to this rule requires carriers to report 911 outages when more than
25% of the lines serving a PSAP are affected; to indicate, when specifying the types of services affected by any reportable
outage and 911 is one of those services, whether more than 25% of the lines to any PSAP were disrupted; to provide 911
managers, when more than 25% of the lines to a 911 PSAP are affected, with any available information that will help those
managers mitigate the effects of the outage on 911 callers; and to report all fire-related incidents affecting 1,000
or more lines. In the NPRM, it was proposed that carriers report fire-related incidents affecting 100 or more lines,
911 outages were to be reported under different criteria, carriers were not specifically asked to include information
as to the percentage of affected lines serving a PSAP in their reports (though ``all available information'' was required),
the carriers were not asked to give PSAP management available information that would help mitigate the affects of
an outage. See Appendix A for the rules and requirements.

 

These changes will eliminate confusion in the proposed 911 reporting requirements that resulted in unnecessary
and even false 911 outage reports, eliminate unnecessary reports of small unavoidable fires not related to any carrier
activity, provide the Commission with information as to the severity of the 911 effects of large outages that are reported
under numerical thresholds rather than as special facilities outages. As a whole, the amendments to Section 63.100
will enable the Commission to become aware of significant outages at the earliest possible time so that we may monitor
developments; to serve as a source of information for the public; to encourage and, where appropriate, to assist in
dissemination of information to those affected; to take immediate steps, as needed, and after analyzing the information
submitted, to determine what, if any, other action is required. After extensive study, the additional reporting
requirements will increase the monitoring capacity of the FCC to include all 

tandems

 that form the major interexchange carrier networks and 41% of the total access lines of the twelve major local exchange
carriers. In addition, the reporting of outages affecting ``special'' facilities will add another 9.5 million lines
to the FCC's monitoring capacity. This will allow the FCC to monitor through the required reports outages affecting
approximately half of the total access lines of the twelve major local exchange carriers, almost a tripling of present
coverage. With the additional coverage, the FCC will be able to perform the functions mentioned above far more efficiently.
The reports for fire-related incidents will allow the Commission to monitor the efficiency of network fire prevention
and control systems in the absence of major fire-caused outages. This is necessary because fire-caused outages are
especially rare but especially extensive. The extent and gravity of outages over the last few years shows the depth
of the need for FCC monitoring of outages to maintain a reliable telecommunications network.

<DOCTITLE>Fee for Services To Support FEMA's Offsite Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with FEMA's interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35770), FEMA has established a fiscal year (FY) 1994 hourly rate of $120.79 for assessing and collecting
fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees for services provided by FEMA personnel for FEMA's REP Program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As authorized by Public Law 103-124 (107 Stat. 1297), an hourly user fee rate of $120.79 will be charged to NRC
licensees of commercial nuclear power plants for all site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA personnel
for FEMA's REP Program under the interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35770). All funds collected under this rule will be deposited in the U.S. Department of the Treasury
to offset appropriated funds obligated by FEMA for its REP Program.



The hourly rate is established on the basis of the methodology set forth in the referenced FEMA interim rule at 44 CFR
354.4(a), ``Determination of costs for FEMA personnel,'' and will be used to assess and collect fees for site-specific
and generic services rendered by FEMA personnel. For FY 1994, the total Salaries and Expenses funds obligated for
FY 1994 was $5,941,306.82 and the total number of site-specific hours expended was 49,186. Applying the formula set
forth in the interim rule, the FY 1994 hourly rate is $120.79.

The establishment of this hourly rate is intended only to address charges to NRC licensees for services provided by
FEMA personnel, not FEMA charges for services provided by FEMA contractors, which will be charged under the interim
rule at 44 CFR 354.4 (b) and (c) for the recovery of appropriated funds obligated for the Emergency Management Planning
and Assistance (EMPA) portion of FEMA's REP Program budget.

On May 19, 1994, FEMA published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26350) a notice continuing the FY 1993 methodology to establish the fee for services to support FEMA's offsite
REP activities. This notice stated that FEMA would be doing a mid-year user fee billing for FY 1994 using the FY 1993
hourly user fee rate of $122.88 and that any billing adjustments necessary after calculating the actual FY 1994 hourly
rate would be made after the end of FY 1994. The hourly rate of $120.79 is the final hourly rate for FY 1994 and adjustments
will be made using this rate.

On July 27, 1994, FEMA published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 38306) a proposed final user fee rule that revised the methodology contained in the interim rule. The final rule
will be published when FEMA has completed its analysis of public comments received in response to the proposed rule.

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board has approved a private sector adjustment 
factor (PSAF) for 1995 of $94.7 million, as well as 1995 fee 
schedules for Federal Reserve priced services. These actions 
were taken in accordance with the requirements of the Monetary 
Control Act of 1980, which requires that, over the long run, fees 
for Federal Reserve priced services be established on the basis 
of all direct and indirect costs, including the PSAF.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Private Sector Adjustment Factor 



The Board has approved a 1995 PSAF for Federal Reserve 
Bank priced services of $94.7 million. This amount represents a 
decrease of $8.9 million or 8.6 percent from the PSAF of $103.6 
million targeted for 1994. 

As required by the Monetary Control Act (MCA) (12 
U.S.C. 248a), the Federal Reserve's fee schedule for priced 
services includes ``taxes that would have been paid and the return 
on capital that would have been provided had the services been 
furnished by a private business firm.'' These imputed costs are 
based on data developed in part from a model comprised of the 
nation's 50 largest (in asset size) bank holding companies 
(BHCs). 

The methodology first entails determining the value of 
Federal Reserve assets that will be used in producing priced 
services during the coming year. Short-term assets are assumed 
to be financed by short-term liabilities; long-term assets are 
assumed to be financed by a combination of long-term debt and 
equity derived from the BHC model. The mix of long-term debt and 
equity was modified slightly to ensure an imputed equity to asset 
ratio of 4 percent as required for adequately capitalized 
institutions under provisions of Regulation F (12 CFR 206). 

Imputed capital costs are determined by applying 
related interest rates and rates of return on equity (ROE) 
derived from the bank holding company model. The rates drawn 
from the BHC model are based on consolidated financial data for 
the 50 largest BHCs in each of the last five years. Because 
short-term debt, by definition, matures within one year, only 
data for the most recent year are used for computing the short-
term debt rate. 

The PSAF comprises capital costs, imputed sales taxes, 
expenses of the Board of Governors related to priced services, 
and an imputed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) 
insurance assessment on clearing balances held with the Federal 
Reserve to settle transactions. 



Asset Base



The estimated value of Federal Reserve 
assets to be used in providing priced services in 1995 is 
reflected in Attachment Table A-1. Table A-2 shows that the 
assets assumed to be financed through debt and equity are 
projected to total $622.9 million. As shown in Table A-3, this 
represents a net decrease of $28.6 million or 4.4 percent from 
1994. This decrease results primarily from lower priced asset 
base levels at the Reserve Banks and Federal Reserve Automation 
Services (FRAS).

Cost of Capital, Taxes, and Other Imputed Costs



Table A-3 shows the financing and tax rates, as well as the other 
required PSAF recoveries proposed for 1995, and compares the 1995 
rates with the rates used for developing the PSAF for 1994. The 
pre-tax return on equity rate decreased from 12.7 percent in 1994 
to 12.1 percent for 1995. The decrease is a result of 1993 BHC 
financial performance included in the 1995 BHC model, relative to 
the stronger 1988 BHC financial performance in the 1994 BHC 
model. 

The decrease in the FDIC insurance assessment from 
$19.8 million in 1994 to $19.0 million in 1995, shown in Table 
A-3, is attributable to lower adjusted gross cash items in 
process of collection (CIPC) and lower clearing balances. The 
FDIC rate of $0.26 for every $100 in clearing balances remains 
unchanged from the rate used in the 1994 final PSAF. 

Net income on clearing balances for 1995 is projected 
to be $21.3 million, down from $25.4 million estimated for 1994. 
This decrease of $4.1 million is due to the decrease in excess 
clearing balance levels, partially offset by a wider spread 
between income, which is earned at the 90-day Treasury bill rate, 
and expense or interest, which is paid at the federal funds rate. 



Capital Adequacy



As shown in Table A-4, the amount 
of capital imputed for the proposed 1995 PSAF totals 35.9 percent 
of risk-weighted assets, well in excess of the 8 percent capital 
guideline for state member banks and BHCs. 



1995 Fee Schedules 



Overview



Based on the Reserve Banks' estimates of 
costs, volumes, and revenues, the proposed 1995 fees for priced 
services are expected to yield net income of $36.0 million for 
the year, compared with a targeted ROE of $31.5 million. Thus, 
the Reserve Banks project that 100.6 percent of total expenses, 
including targeted ROE, will be recovered. In addition, during 
1995, approximately $19.1 million of automation consolidation 
special project costs, including about $0.8 million that were 
deferred in prior years, will be recovered. Additional finance 
charges for 1995 on accumulated deferred special project balances 
will be $2.5 million, resulting in accumulated special project 
costs to be recovered in the future of $36.7 million.






For the most part, 1995 fees approved by the Board do 
not include significant changes in the level or structure of fees 
for priced services. For the electronic payment services_funds 
transfer, book-entry securities, and the automated clearing house 
(ACH)_all operating costs and imputed expenses, including 
targeted ROE, are expected to be recovered. Some electronic 
connection fees will be raised to reflect the higher costs 
associated with the higher service levels available through the 
Fednet

 

 communications network. The Board, however, has approved 
a modest reduction in the funds transfer fee. 

The check service also is expected to achieve full cost 
recovery, including targeted ROE, in 1995. Although continued 
volume losses are anticipated due to depository institutions' 
growing use of direct presentments under the same-day settlement 
rule and continued consolidation of the banking industry, the 
Reserve Banks expect the decline in volume to be more moderate 
than it was in 1994. The Board was able to approve modest 
increases in fees because the Reserve Banks are taking aggressive 
steps to reduce costs. For example, the Reserve Banks are 
reducing staff and making greater use of automation to improve 
operating efficiency. In addition, the Reserve Banks are 
improving deposit deadlines, promoting electronic presentment and 
deposit products, and developing products using image technology. 

The noncash collection service has faced rapidly 
declining volume levels since the Tax Equity and Fiscal 
Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) was enacted. Due to 
significant volume losses, the Reserve Banks incurred an 
operating loss in 1993 and project operating losses in 1994 and 
1995. The service should realize lower and more stable costs 
once all operations are consolidated at two sites in 1995. 

In November 1993, when the Board considered the 1994 
fee schedules, volume-based fees were approved for selected check 
products and the noncash collection service. The Board also has 
requested the staff to develop criteria for the use of volume-
based fees.
 Econometric studies of the cost structure of 
Federal Reserve payment services are being conducted to determine 
if criteria based on scale efficiency are relevant. Preliminary 
results indicate that the use of volume-based fees is not 
appropriate for paper-based check services. A similar study of 
the cost structure of the noncash collection service was deemed 
impractical because of the rapidly declining volume levels. 
Analysis of the cost structure of electronic payment products is 
in progress. The Board has approved:





(1) Eliminating the volume-based fees for paper check products, which were introduced by the Minneapolis Reserve
Bank in 1994;

(2) Permitting the Richmond and Minneapolis Reserve Banks to retain the volume-based fees for the selected electronic
check products that were approved by the Board until scale efficiency studies of electronic payment 
products are completed; and

(3) Retaining the present volume-based fees for the noncash collection service because they are enabling the Federal
Reserve to maintain a stabilizing presence in the noncash collection market.




The Board expects the results of its econometric studies to be available during 1995. 



Although the Reserve Banks acknowledge that their cost, 
volume, and revenue projections are somewhat uncertain due to the 
continuing changes in the interbank check collection market and 
the implementation of FRAS, as well as Fednet

 

, the Board 
believes that the Reserve Banks' proposed 1995 fee schedules are 
reasonable.

Discussion



The 1994 fees approved by the Board were expected to recover 98.2 percent of the costs of providing priced services,
including imputed expenses, automation consolidation special project costs budgeted for recovery, and targeted
ROE. Through September 1994, the System recovered 97.1 percent of total priced services expenses, including targeted
ROE. The Reserve Banks now estimate that priced services revenues will yield net income of $2.5 million for the year,
compared with a targeted ROE of $34.6 million. The recovery rate after targeted ROE is expected to be 96.0 percent.
Approximately $8.8 million in automation consolidation special project costs will be recovered in 1994 and an additional
$20.5 million will be financed and recovered later.

Although the Reserve Banks' current estimate of 1994 performance appears conservative, two significant factors
contribute to the expected shortfall compared to the original plan. First, credits arising from accounting for pensions
under FASB Statement 87 were revised downward by $21.3 million, pre-tax, from the estimate used to set fees. Final
actuarial data became available following the adoption of 1994 fees that reflected (1) a lower discount rate used
to value pension plan assets and (2) the costs of early retirement plans offered by the Reserve Banks during 1993 and
1994. If the actual pension credit had not changed from the estimate, the Reserve Banks' estimated full-year cost
recovery would have been 97.8 percent, or 1.8 percentage points higher than now forecast. Estimated net income would
have been $17.3 million, compared with the $20.2 million originally budgeted.

Second, the check service's volume loss due to the implementation of the same-day settlement regulation in January
1994 and the continuing consolidation of the banking industry has been greater than anticipated. The lower check
volume levels account for most of the Reserve Banks' $12 million shortfall in revenues compared to the original projections.

In 1995, priced services expenses before special project costs are projected to decrease 5.7 percent compared with
estimated 1994 levels. Approximately $18.3 million of current automation consolidation special project costs
and $0.8 million of costs that were deferred and financed in prior years will be recovered, leaving $36.7 million of
accumulated special project costs to be recovered in the future.

Total revenues in 1995 are projected to increase by 0.2 percent compared with 1994 revenues.
 Based on the Reserve Banks' estimates of costs, volumes, and revenues, the proposed 1995 fees will yield net income
of $36.0 million for the year, compared with a targeted return on equity of $31.5 million. These estimates result in
a 100.6 percent recovery rate, including targeted ROE.

1993 Performance



Revenues from the check service recovered 101.2 percent of total expenses in 1993, including image and automation
consolidation special project costs and targeted ROE. The volume of checks collected decreased 0.1 percent from
1992 levels and return item volume decreased 1.3 percent.



1994 Performance



Through September 1994, the check service recovered 96.4 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE but excluding
automation consolidation special projects costs. The volume of checks collected decreased 12 percent from 1993
levels, reflecting a 4 percent decrease in processed volume and a 33 percent decrease in fine sort volume.

The Reserve Banks now project an operating loss of $0.9 million, compared with the $14.8 million return on equity budgeted
for 1994. Although the Board believes that the Reserve Banks' current estimate of 1994 performance is conservative,
several significant factors are contributing to the variation. First, the check service's share of the pre-tax reduction
in pension credits increased expenses by $16.8 million, compared with the original budget estimate. Without this
unexpected increase in expenses, the Reserve Banks would have been able to achieve the budgeted return on equity for
the check service. Second, the Reserve Banks' volume losses due to the implementation of the same-day settlement
regulation on January 3 and the continuing consolidation of the banking industry have been greater than anticipated.
In particular, the Reserve Banks now project that total check volume for 1994 will decline by about 11 percent (processed
check volume by 4 percent and fine sort volume by 31 percent) and that return item volume will decline by 5 percent. Originally,
the Reserve Banks projected that total volume would decline 10 percent (2 percent for processed check volume and 33
percent for fine sort volume) and that return item volume would decline 2 percent. Third, severe weather during early
1994 contributed to higher than budgeted float costs.



1995 Issues



The changes occurring in the check environment that will continue to challenge the Reserve Banks include additional
volume losses due to increasing direct presentments of checks by depository institutions, expansions of private
check clearing arrangements, and further consolidation of the banking industry. Despite these changes, the Reserve
Banks are committed to providing efficient, fairly priced check services to the nation's depository institutions.

To accomplish this objective, Reserve Banks are continuing to (1) reduce staff, (2) contain other costs, (3) control
increases in fees, (4) improve deposit deadlines, and (5) emphasize the use of electronic presentment and deposit
products, which increase the efficiency of the check collection process and can reduce its total costs. In addition,
the Reserve Banks are beginning to use image technology in their commercial check operations. Image technology has
the potential to increase the acceptance of check truncation and, over the long run, reduce the cost of clearing paper
checks.

Total check service operating costs plus imputed expenses are projected to be about 5.1 percent below estimated 1994
expenses. The decline in total check collection volume is expected to moderate somewhat in 1995. Based on the Reserve
Banks' projections, a decrease in total volume of 2.4 percent is anticipated, reflecting no change in processed volume,
an 11.5 percent decrease in fine sort volume, and a 1.0 percent decrease in return item volume.



1995 Fees



Overall, the 1995 check fees approved by the Board will increase 1.2 percent on a weighted average basis, compared
with 1994. For 1995, the Reserve Banks are continuing to adjust fees to reflect more accurately the fixed and variable
costs of providing check services. Thus, cash-letter fees and fine sort package fees will increase 5.7 percent and
1.6 percent, respectively. Forward processed item fees will decrease 0.4 percent, on average, while fine sort item
fees will increase 2.0 percent, on average. Of the 2,180 forward collection and fine sort fees, almost 68 percent will
remain unchanged, 19 percent will increase, and 7 percent will decrease. Additionally, 2.6 percent of all fees represent
new products, while 3.7 percent of the fees have been discontinued, due to the elimination of the last remaining blended
fees associated with tiered pricing and the elimination of some deadlines.

Fees for return items are increasing 6.2 percent overall, reflecting increases in return cash-letter and package
fees. Of the 1,494 return fees, 59 percent are unchanged, 36 percent increased, and 2 percent decreased. The fees for
the Interdistrict Transportation System (ITS) are unchanged.

Table 3 highlights selected 1994 and 1995 check collection fees.

In 1994, the Minneapolis Office introduced ``option'' 
prices for its Other Fed and city fine sort products.
 The 
Minneapolis and Richmond Reserve Banks also adopted option pricing 
for some electronic payor bank services. The Board has determined 
that there is no empirical justification to support the use of 
option pricing for paper check products. As a result, the 
Minneapolis Office will eliminate its option prices for Other Fed 
and city fine sort products. Further analysis of the cost 
structure for electronic products is in progress. At this time, 
the Board will permit the Richmond and Minneapolis Banks to 
continue using the option prices adopted for electronic check 
products in 1994. 




Payor bank service revenue is estimated to have grown 
approximately 16 percent in 1994 and is expected to expand at the 
same pace in 1995. In 1995, Reserve Banks will continue to 
encourage the use of basic electronic check presentment products by 
setting fees for those products at lower levels than fees for 
electronic information products. In addition, several Federal 
Reserve offices will be offering electronic cash-letter (ECL) 
deposit products, which reduce Reserve Bank processing costs by 
reducing the number of rejects, adjustments, and other exceptions. 
To encourage the use of ECL deposit products, Federal Reserve 
offices will offer either lower per-item fees or later deposit 
deadlines to depositors than they offer for deposits that are not 
accompanied by electronic data.

The Reserve Banks project that 1995 revenues will recover 
100.0 percent of expenses, including targeted ROE and $5.0 million 
in automation consolidation special project costs. Approximately 
$0.2 million of automation consolidation special project costs that 
were deferred and financed in prior years will be recovered, 
leaving $12.0 million of accumulated special project costs to be 
recovered in the future. 


Automated Clearing House (ACH) 


Table 4 presents the actual 1993, estimated 1994, and projected 1995 cost recovery performance for the commercial
ACH service. 






1993 Performance


Revenues from the ACH service recovered 92.9 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE, during 1993. The
principal factors contributing to the revenue shortfall were (1) higher than planned costs for the development of
new ACH processing software to operate in the consolidated automation environment and (2) lower than expected non-automated
revenues. Overall, commercial volume increased by 16.4 percent over the 1992 volume level. 


1994 Performance


Through September 1994, revenues from 
the ACH service recovered 97.4 percent of total expenses, including 
targeted ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 96.9 
percent for the year. Due to the planned underrecovery, all $7.6 
million of automation consolidation special project costs are being 
deferred and financed. Year-to-date commercial volume increased 
16.9 percent, compared to the same period in 1993. 
For 1994, the Reserve Banks now forecast that revenues 
will recover 94.0 percent of commercial ACH costs, based on 
estimated volume growth of 14.5 percent for the year. While the 
Reserve Banks' current estimate may be conservative, the following 
factors contribute to the Reserve Banks' projected variation from 
plan:
(1) The ACH service's $1.9 million share of the pre-tax reduction in pension credits;
(2) Faster-than-planned conversion of paper returns and notifications of change (NOCs) to electronic alternatives;
and
(3) Lower revenues due to shifting commercial volume from the premium exchange to an earlier exchange, which was made
possible by the addition of two ACH processing cycles 
beginning October 1, 1993. 


1995 Issues


The slower, 12.9 percent, rate of increase 
in commercial ACH transaction volume projected for 1995 reflects 
anticipated, increased competition from private-sector ACH 
operators and continued consolidation in the banking industry, 
which creates more ``on-us'' transfers. While the volume of 
commercial ACH transactions has been growing at a decreasing rate, 
dropping from 24 percent in 1990 to 17 percent for the first nine 
months of 1994, it is likely that the Reserve Banks' forecast for 
1995 understates the potential growth rate. 

The Reserve Banks' cost control programs are expected to 
result in a 3 percent reduction in operating expenses. During 
1995, the Reserve Banks will test the new ACH application software 
developed over the last several years and begin to implement it. 
Although all Reserve Banks expect to make the transition to the new 
processing software by year-end 1995, the precise schedule of that 
transition remains uncertain. Delays in the implementation 
schedule may cause costs to vary significantly from budget. 


1995 Fees


The Board has approved only one change to 
the current ACH fees for 1995, an increase in the fee for 
processing government paper NOCs from $5.00 to $10.00, the current 
fee for commercial paper NOCs.
 The higher fee better reflects the 
cost of providing this manual service and would provide an 
additional incentive for depository institutions to migrate to a 
more fully electronic ACH processing environment. 




Based on the approved fee schedule, the Reserve Banks 
forecast that the commercial ACH service will recover 100.0 percent 
of costs, including targeted ROE and $3.4 million of the current 
year's automation consolidation special project costs. The 
remaining $0.6 million of current year automation consolidation 
special project costs and the charges that were incurred and 
deferred in prior years will continue to be deferred for recovery 
in future years. 



Funds Transfer and Net Settlement 


Table 5 presents the actual 1993, estimated 1994, and budgeted 1995 cost recovery performance for the funds transfer
and net settlement service. 






1993 Performance


Revenues from the funds transfer service recovered 102.2 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE. Funds
transfer volume increased 2.0 percent over 1992 levels. 


1994 Performance


Through September 1994, revenues from the funds transfer service recovered 101.8 percent of total expenses, including
targeted ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 100.0 percent for the year. During the same period, funds transfer
volume increased 4.6 percent over the 1993 volume level.

The Reserve Banks estimate that, in 1994, the funds transfer and net settlement service will recover 101.1 percent
after targeted ROE and automation consolidation special project costs that the service had planned to recover, based
on estimated transaction volume growth of 4.8 percent for the year. Revenue is 6.5 percent higher than budgeted, primarily
because anticipated volume reductions as a result of daylight overdraft pricing did not materialize. Total costs
are estimated to be 6.1 percent over budget, due to (1) higher-than-anticipated data processing costs, offset partially
by lower data communications costs and (2) the funds transfer services' $2.0 million share of the pre-tax reduction
in pension credits. 



1995 Issues



The Reserve Banks estimate that funds transfer origination volume will increase 2.8 percent over 1994 levels. Without
price changes, the Reserve Banks project that revenues would recover 109.4 percent of expenses, including all current
year and deferred automation consolidation special project costs. 



1995 Fees



The Board reduced the funds transfer fee to $0.50 from the current $0.53. After this reduction, the service is expected
to recover 105.8 percent of its costs, after paying all current year and deferred charges for the automation consolidation
special project. Uncertainties remain in the cost projections for 1995, however, because of the continued implementation
of the centralized funds transfer application software. 



Book-entry Securities 




Table 6 presents the actual 1993, estimated 1994, and budgeted 1995 cost recovery performance for the book-entry
securities service. 







1993 Performance



Revenues from the book-entry securities service recovered 100.0 percent of total expenses, including targeted
ROE in 1993. The volume of government agency securities transfers increased 10.4 percent over the 1992 volume level.




1994 Performance



Through September 1994, revenues from the book-entry securities service recovered 99.1 percent of total expenses
plus targeted ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 100.3 percent for the year. During the same period, book-entry
securities transfer volume increased 5.9 percent compared with the 1993 level. 

The Reserve Banks' staff now expects the book-entry securities service to recover 95.5 percent of total expenses
after targeted ROE, based on approximately the same transaction volume as in 1993. The estimated recovery rate is
lower than originally projected due to two factors. First, securities transfer volume declined unexpectedly. The
increase in mortgage interest rates during 1994 has resulted in less refinancing activity and, as a result, fewer
mortgages are available to issue additional mortgage-backed security. Higher interest rates have caused securities
firms to reconsider investments in existing mortgage-backed securities, resulting in less trading activity. Second,
expenses are higher than planned, due to the reduction in pension credits and higher-than-anticipated data processing
costs. 



1995 Issues



The Reserve Banks believe that mortgage-backed securities volume will stabilize by year-end 1994 and increase modestly
in 1995 from the reduced 1994 volume level. This conservative volume increase is reflected in the 3.1 percent volume
growth rate forecast for 1995. 



1995 Fees



The Board has approved retaining the current fees for the book-entry security service, based on the Reserve Banks'
forecast that they will produce sufficient revenue to recover 100.1 percent of costs, including targeted ROE and
$1.0 million in automation consolidation special project costs. The remaining $1.0 million of current year automation
consolidation special project costs and the charges that were incurred and deferred in prior years will continue
to be deferred for recovery in future years.

Electronic Connections 



The Federal Reserve charges fees for electronic 
connections to depository institutions for accessing priced 
services. The costs and revenues associated with electronic access 
are allocated to the various priced services based on the relative 
number of endpoints that access each service. 


Electronic connection fees have not increased since 1989, 
with the exception of the 1991 $100 increase in the monthly 
dedicated leased-line fee. In light of the increasing costs due to 
the implementation of Fednet#

, the Board has approved increased 
fees for three types of electronic connections in 1995. The fees 
for four other types of connections would remain unchanged. 
Specifically, the Board raised the following fees: 1) receive and 
send dial connections from $65 to $75; 2) multi-drop leased-line 
connections from $300 to $450; and 3) dedicated leased-line 
connections from $700 to $750. Monthly electronic connection fees 
for receive-only dial, high-speed dial, high-speed 19.2 kbps 
leased-line, and high-speed 56 kbps leased-line will remain at $30, 
$350, $850, and $1,000, respectively. 


In 1994, the Federal Reserve Board established standard 
fees for dedicated high-speed 56 kbps and 19.2 kbps connections and 
high-speed dial 56 kbps connections. In response to requests from 
several depository institutions that Reserve Banks support 
connections at speeds higher than 56 kbps for transmission of large 
data files, the Board has approved standard connection fees for two 
new categories of high-speed connections: $1,800 and $2,000 per 
month for high-speed leased connections of 128 kbps and 256 kbps, 
respectively. These new high-speed connection categories require 
more expensive signalling, encryption, and circuit components than 
the 56 kbps and 19.2 kbps connections. 


Finally, the Board has approved two new standard 
connection options to support contingency testing by depository 
institutions that use dedicated leased-line connections for their 
production traffic. A dedicated dial test connection will provide 
additional dial connection equipment to address the needs of those 
institutions that conduct their contingency testing simultaneously 
with their production work. A shared dial test connection will 
address the needs of institutions that test only during off-hours 
and will provide a necessary subset of dial connection components. 
These new contingency connection options will be lower cost 
alternatives to depository institutions than a second dedicated 
leased-line connection. For these test options, a usage guideline 
of 120 hours per year will be established. Institutions that 
exceed this guideline will be asked to establish a dedicated 
leased-line connection for testing purposes and pay the standard 
connection fee. The monthly fees for the dedicated and shared 
contingency testing options are $250 and $150, respectively. 





Noncash Collection

service.

1993 Performance


Revenues from the noncash collection service recovered 84.4 percent of total expenses, including targeted ROE,
in 1993. The principal factor contributing to the revenue shortfall was a 38 percent decline in transaction volume
caused, in part, by increased called bond activity. 



1994 Performance


Through September 1994, the noncash collection service recovered 85.4 percent of total expenses including targeted
ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 85.5 percent for the year. During the same period, noncash collection
volume decreased 40.1 percent, compared with the 1993 level. 

The three Reserve Banks providing noncash collection services now project a recovery rate of 79.1 percent. Although
anticipated volume losses are expected to be more moderate, 37.8 percent, through the end of the year due to gaining
a new customer, the costs associated with consolidating operations and the $0.2 million reduction in the noncash
service's share of the pension credits are expected to reduce the service's recovery rate compared with year-to-date
performance. 



1995 Issues


Since the mid 1980s, the noncash collection service has faced rapidly declining volume levels. Following enactment
of TEFRA, many bearer municipal securities were ``immobilized,'' or converted to book-entry form, thus eliminating
interest coupons. To improve the System's ability to recover costs in a declining market, the Reserve Banks reduced
the number of noncash processing sites from four to three in 1994 and will complete the planned consolidation to two
sites in 1995. Because of remaining transition costs in New York and the consolidation of Chicago's noncash operation
during 1995, the Reserve Banks do not expect to recover costs fully during 1995. 

In 1994, the Reserve Banks implemented a new volume-based fee structure with fixed cash-letter and per-envelope
fees. The levels of cash-letter and per-envelope fees were based on the number of coupon envelopes contained in the
cash letters.
 The use of a fee structure that includes fixed and variable fees more accurately reflects the structure of costs the
Reserve Banks incur in providing noncash collection services than the fee structure that was in place before 1994,
which relied solely on variable fees. A detailed study of the cost structure of the noncash collection services, which
would be needed to justify the use of volume-based fees, was deemed impractical because of the rapidly declining volume
levels. Volume-based fees, however, have been well received by depositors. In addition, they provide incentives
for larger institutions to increase the size of their deposits and moderate the impact of the fixed costs of the service
for smaller institutions. As a result, the use of volume-based fees permits the Federal Reserve to maintain a presence
in the noncash collection business and adds a measure of stability as other service providers continue to withdraw.






1995 Fees


For 1995, the Board has approved a reduction in the return item fees to $15.00 from $20.00 in Cleveland and from $25.00
in Jacksonville and Chicago. The proposed national fee more accurately reflects the costs of return processing at
the regional processing sites and is consistent with fees charged by other service providers. All other fees were
retained for 1995. 
The Reserve Banks forecast the number of noncash coupon envelopes processed to increase 21.5 percent, primarily
as a result of new deposits attracted by the lower and uniform return item fee. The proposed 1995 fee schedule is expected
to enable the noncash collection service to recover 91.6 percent of its costs, including targeted ROE. Once the consolidation
of noncash services is completed, the Reserve Banks' staff believes that the service will be able to reverse the continuing
operating losses and to achieve low and stable operating costs. 



Cash Services 


Cash services that are priced by the Federal Reserve Banks include cash transportation, coin wrapping, nonstandard
packaging of currency orders and deposits, and nonstandard frequency of access to cash services. 
Data on priced cash services are being included to provide a complete view of Reserve Bank priced service performance.
Cash transportation fee changes do not require Board approval. The Board, however, is notified when changes occur.
The fees for the other priced cash services have been approved by the Director of the Division of Reserve Bank Operations
and Payment Systems under delegated authority. 

Table 8 presents actual 1993, estimated 1994, and projected 1995 cost recovery performance for the priced cash services.







The Reserve Banks expect that revenues will recover all costs for cash services, including targeted ROE. Projected
revenue for 1995 is less than for 1994 because the number of Reserve Banks that provide priced armored carrier transportation
services has declined.

The 1995 fees for wrapped coin, nonstandard packaging, and nonstandard access are shown in Attachment VIII. Fees
for other cash transportation services and registered mail fees can be obtained by contacting the individual Federal
Reserve offices. 



Competitive Impact Analysis 



All operational and legal changes considered by the Board that have a substantial effect on payment system participants
are subject to the competitive impact analysis described in the March 1990 policy statement ``The Federal Reserve
in the Payments System.'' In this analysis, the Board assesses whether the proposed change would have a direct and
material adverse effect on the ability of other service providers to compete effectively with the Federal Reserve
in providing similar service due to differing legal powers or constraints or due to a dominant market position of the
Federal Reserve deriving from such legal differences. 

The Board believes that the recommended price and service level changes would not have a substantial effect on payments
system participants and would not have a direct and material effect on the ability of other service providers to compete
effectively with the Federal Reserve in providing similar services. The 1995 fees approved by the Board result in
a projected return on equity that meets the target return on equity based on the 50 bank holding company model. The Board
believes that the recommended fees for the noncash collection services are consistent with the approach that would
be used by a private-sector firm, which would absorb the results of structural changes through its retained earnings
account. Therefore, the Board does not believe that approval of the proposed fees would have an adverse effect on the
ability of other service providers to compete with the Reserve Banks.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed consent
order from Charter Medical Corporation (``Charter''), under which Charter would agree not to acquire certain psychiatric
facilities from National Medical Enterprises (``NME'').

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received, and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

Charter has proposed to acquire certain assets and businesses from NME, including 17 psychiatric hospitals, chemical
dependency facilities and residential treatment centers.

The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section
7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for
psychiatric services in several geographic areas in the United States. The proposed Consent Order would remedy the
alleged violation by allowing the NME facilities and those geographic areas to remain as viable competitors or be
sold to a third party other than Charter.

The proposed Consent Order provides that Charter forthwith modify its Asset Sale Agreement with NME, dated March
29, 1994, to rescind Charter's agreement to acquire the following facilities: MidSouth Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee;
Psychiatric Institute of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia; Brawner North Medical Health System, Smyrna, Georgia;
Crescent Pines Hospital, Stockbridge, Georgia; and Laurel Oaks Hospital and Residential Treatment Center, Orlando,
Florida. Under the terms of a letter of understanding from NME, the Commission will receive advance written notification
of sale of any of these facilities.

The Order also requires Charter, for a ten-year period, to obtain prior approval from the Commission before acquiring
any psychiatric facility in any of the following geographic areas, as defined in the Order: The Orlando area; the Atlanta
area; the Memphis area; and the Richmond area. The Order also requires Charter to obtain prior approval before permitting
any psychiatric facility it operates in the four geographic areas to be acquired by any person that operates, or will
operate immediately following such acquisition, any other psychiatric facility in the geographic areas, for a ten-year
period.

The Order also requires Charter, for a ten-year period to provide advance written notification to the Commission
before consummating any joint ventures with any other psychiatric facility in the four geographic areas specified.

Under the provisions of the Order, Charter is required to provide to the Commission a report of compliance with the
Order within sixty (60) days following the date the Order becomes final, and annually thereafter for period of ten
years.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order. and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed consent agreement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other other things,
a New Jersey-based corporation to divest its tetanus and diphtheria vaccine business to a Commission-approved buyer,
to license Cyanamid's rotavirus vaccine research to a Commission-approved licensee, and to discontinue reporting
arrangements with licensees that may provide competitively sensitive information. The consent agreement also
would prohibit, for ten years, the respondent from acquiring any interest in any entity engaged in the clinical development,

et seq. 

AHP shall agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Acquirer or the New Acquirer, as applicable, harmless from any and
all suits, claims, actions, demands, liabilities, expenses or losses alleged to result from the failure of the Tetanus

settlement of such claim, including the selection of counsel. This obligation shall not require AHP to be liable for
any negligent act or omission of the Acquirer or the New Acquirer, as applicable, or for any representations and warranties,

no minimum price; to assure that AHP enters into a Divestiture Agreement that complies with the provisions of paragraph
II.A; to assure that AHP complies with the remaining provisions of paragraph II of this Order; and to assure that the
New Acquirer obtains all necessary FDA approvals to manufacture Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines for sale in the United
States. The divestiture and the Divestiture Agreement shall be made to the New Acquirer in the manner set forth in Paragraph
II of this Order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity,
and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring
entity selected by respondent from among those approved by the Commission.

After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee,
including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of the respondent. The trustee's
compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's
locating a New Acquirier and assuring compliance with this Order.

8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any claim, whether
or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee.

9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III of this order.

of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the terms
of this Order.

11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine
Assets.

12. The trustee shall report in writing to respondent and the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning his or her
efforts to divest AHP's Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine Assets, AHP's compliance with the terms of this Order, and
the New Acquirer's efforts to obtain all necessary FDA approval to manufacture Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines for
sale in the United States.

13. If, within five (5) years from the date on which the Commission approves the New Acquirer, the New Acquier has not
obtained all necessary FDA approvals to manufacture Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccines for sale in the United States,
then the Divestiture Agreement between AHP and the New Acquirer shall terminate.

V


Rotavirus Vaccine Research Licensing Provisions




It is further ordered 

That:
A. Within twelve (12) months after the date this Order becomes final, Respondent shall: (1) Grant a non-exclusive
license, in perpetuity, and in good faith, of any technical information and patent rights included in Cyanamid's
Rotavirus Vaccine Research (see Paragraphs A & C of Confidential Appendix A); and (2) provide samples for research,
adequate to satisfy the needs of the Rotavirus Licensee, of any physical assets included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus
Vaccine Research (see Paragraph B of Confidential Appendix A) that are owned by AHP; 

Provided, however,

 That such license shall be limited: (i) To use solely in developing, producing and selling a vaccine to protect humans
against rotavirus disease; and (ii) to preclude its use to develop a vector for a vaccine intended to protect against
a disease other than rotavirus.
B. Respondent shall license Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research only to a Rotavirus Licensee that receives the
prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The purpose
of the licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research is to ensure the continuation of Cyanamid's Rotavirus
Vaccine Research as an ongoing research project for a rotavirus vaccine to be approved by the FDA for sale in the United
States and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from the Acquisition as alleged in the Commission's complaint.
C. Upon reasonable notice and request from the Rotavirus Licensee, Respondent shall provide reasonable assistance
to the Rotavirus Licensee regarding the Cyanamid Rotavirus Vaccine Research. Such assistance shall include reasonable
consultation with knowledgeable employees of AHP and training at the Rotavirus Licensee's facilities or at such
other place as is mutually satisfactory to Respondent and the Rotavirus Licensee for a period of time sufficient to
satisfy the Rotavirus Licensee's management that its personnel are appropriately trained to proceed with the Cyanamid
Rotavirus Vaccine Research. However, AHP shall not be required to continue providing such assistance for more than
six (6) months from the date the licensing is finally approved by the Commission. AHP may require reimbursement from
the Rotavirus Licensee for all its direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the assistance to the Rotavirus
Licensee.
D. Pending licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research, Respondent shall take such actions as are necessary
to maintain the viability and marketability of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research and to prevent the destruction,
removal, wasting, deterioration, or impairment of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research except for ordinary wear
and tear.


VI


Rotavirus Vaccine Research Trustee Exclusive Licensing Provisions




It is further ordered, 

That:
A. If AHP has not, within twelve (12) months of the date this Order becomes final, complied with the requirements of
Paragraph V of this Order, the Commission may appoint a trustee to (1) grant an exclusive license, in perpetuity, and
in good faith, of any technical information and patent rights included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research
(see Paragraphs A & C of Confidential Appendix A); and (2) provide samples for research, adequate to satisfy the
needs of the Rotavirus Licensee, of any physical assets included in Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research (see Paragraph
B of Confidential Appendix A) that are owned by AHP; 

Provided, however,

 That: (i) Such exclusive license shall be limited to use solely in developing, producing and selling a vaccine to protect
humans against rotavirus disease; (ii) such license shall be limited to preclude its use to develop a vector for a vaccine
intended to protect against a disease other than rotavirus; and (iii) AHP shall have the right to retain and use all
of the Cyanamid Rotavirus Vaccine Research assets, including samples of the assets in Paragraph B of Confidential
Appendix A, for the purpose of using them to develop a vector for a vaccine intended to protect against a disease other
than rotavirus and for any other purpose other than developing and producing a vaccine to protect humans against rotavirus
disease. In the event the Commission or the Attorney General brings an action against Respondent pursuant to section
5(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(1), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, AHP shall
consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint
a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties
or any other relief available to it, including a court appointed trustee, pursuant to section 5(1) of the FTC Act, or
any other statute enforced by the Commission, for any failure by Respondent to comply with this order.

B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph VI.A of this Order, AHP shall consent
to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authorities, and responsibilities.


1. The Commission shall select the trustee, subject to the consent of AHP, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The trustee shall be a person with experience and expertise in licensing technology. If AHP has not opposed,
in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten (10) days after notice
by the staff of the Commission to AHP of the identity of any proposed trustee, AHP shall be deemed to have consented to
the selection of the proposed trustee.
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to grant
an exclusive license of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research as described in Paragraph VI.A. (``the Rotavirus
Exclusive License'').

3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, AHP shall execute a trust agreement that, subject to the prior
approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the trustee all
rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to enter into the Rotavirus Exclusive License as required by this
Order.
4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph VI.C.3 to accomplish the Rotavirus Exclusive License required by Paragraph VI of this Order, which shall
be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the twelve (12) month period, the trustee
has submitted a plan of licensing or believes that exclusive licensing can be achieved within a reasonable time, the
twelve (12) month period may be extended by the Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court;
provided, however, the Commission may extend the twelve (12) month period only two (2) times.
5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records, data, facilities, and technical
information related to the Rotavirus Vaccine Research, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably
request. Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate
with the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's ability to accomplish
the exclusive licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research required by this Order. Any delays in exclusively
licensing Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research required by this Order caused by Respondent shall extend the time
under Paragraph VI.C.4 for accomplishing the exclusive licensing of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research required
by this Order in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for the court-appointed trustee,
by the court.

power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission
arrangement contingent on the trustee's ability to grant an exclusive license of Cyanamid's Rotavirus Vaccine Research.
8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparations for, or defense of any claim whether

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted subject to final approval an agreement containing a
proposed Consent Order from American Home Products Corporation (``AHP'') which requires AHP to divest its tetanus
and diphtheria vaccines business to a Commission-approved purchaser. Further, AHP would be required to license
American Cyanamid Company's (``Cyanamid'') rotavirus vaccine research and to aggregate royalty payment information
relating to sales of particular cytokines used for white blood cell and platelet restoration once FDA approval is
obtained for these products.

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.

Pursuant to an August 17, 1994, Agreement and Plan of Merger, AHP will acquire all of Cyanamid's voting stock. The proposed
complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C.
18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the following five markets in the United States:

(1) Combined tetanus and diphtheria vaccines approved for use for adults and children at least seven years old, known
as ``adult Td'';

(2) Combined diphtheria and tetanus vaccines for children between the ages of two months and seven years old, known
as ``pediatric DT'';

(3) Uncombined tetanus vaccines, known as ``tetanus toxoid'';

(4) Rotavirus vaccine research and development; and

(5) Cytokine research, development, and production.

The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation in each of these markets. In the area of tetanus and diphtheria
vaccines, AHP would be required to divest, within four months, its tetanus and diphtheria vaccines business to a Commission
approved purchaser. Because that purchaser will need to obtain FDA approval before it can begin selling tetanus and
diphtheria vaccines, the proposed Consent Order also requires AHP to manufacture these vaccines for the approved
purchaser for a period of five years or until the purchaser gains FDA approvals to manufacture its own tetanus and diphtheria
vaccines. AHP will be required to sell tetanus and diphtheria vaccines to the purchaser at cost, with annual adjustments
(exclusive of materials and labor) indexed to the Consumer Price Index. In addition, under the proposed Consent Order,
AHP is required to provide technical assistance and advice to assist the purchaser in obtaining FDA approval to manufacture
and sell tetanus and diphtheria vaccines. The proposed Order also provides for a trustee to assure that AHP appropriately
divests its tetanus and diphtheria vaccines business. If AHP fails to divest its tetanus and diphtheria business
within four months, or if the acquirer abandons its effort to obtain FDA approval to manufacture and sell tetanus and
diphtheria vaccines, then the trustee may be directed to find another acquirer.

The proposed Consent Order also requires AHP to license, within one year, on a nonexclusive basis, the Cyanamid rotavirus
vaccine research assets to a Commission-approved licensee. If AHP fails to find an approved licensee within one year,
then the Commission may appoint a trustee to license the Cyanamid rotavirus vaccine research assets on an exclusive
basis to an approved licensee. AHP is also required under the proposed Order to provide technical advice, assistance
and training to enable the licensee to continue the Cyanamid rotavirus research as an ongoing project.

The proposed Consent Order prohibits AHP from receiving information relating to the market for cytokines for white
blood cell and platelet restoration, unless the information is aggregated on a worldwide basis. This provision of
the proposed Consent Order does not become operative until the FDA approves AHP's products in this area.

The proposed Consent Order will also prohibit AHP, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring any interest in any
entity engaged in the clinical development, or manufacture and sale of tetanus, diphtheria or rotavirus vaccines
in the United States without prior approval from the Commission. The proposed Order will also require AHP to provide
to the Commission a report of its compliance with the provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date
this Order becomes final, and every six (6) months thereafter until the Commission has approved a purchaser and licensee.

One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, AHP will be required to provide
to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires AHP to notify the
Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of AHP resulting in the emergence of a successor.
A sunset provision is also included which terminates the order after 20 years.

Concurring Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga


In 

American Home Products Corp.,

 File No. 941-0116


Today, the Commission accepts for public comment a consent agreement settling charges that American Home Products'
proposed acquisition of American Cyanamid Company is likely substantially to lessen competition in the markets
for three existing diphtheria and tetanus vaccines and substantially to lessen competition to develop a new rotavirus
vaccine and to develop and produce cytokines. This appears to be a strong antitrust case, but I seriously question
whether the remedy is sufficient.
Under the order, the divestiture of tetanus and diphtheria vaccine assets is limited to certain intellectual property,
including formulations, patents, trade secrets, technology, and know-how. The divestiture is structured so that,
as a practical matter, the only firms that could acquire the assets in question are firms that in my opinion already
would satisfy the tests under the law for potential entrants. In short, the order will not restore the competition
lost as a result of the acquisition. Instead, the Commission should require the divestiture of a viable business unit,
even if that business unit produces and sells products other than the vaccines in question.

<DOCTITLE>Eli Lilly and Company, Inc.; Proposed Consent Agreement With Analysis to Aid Public Comment</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed consent agreement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, an Indiana
producer of pharmaceutical products to: Ensure that PCS Health Systems (PCS) maintains an open formulary; appoint
an independent Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee of health care professionals to objectively evaluate
drugs for inclusion in the PCS open formulary; ensure that PCS accepts all discounts, rebates or other concessions
offered by Eli Lilly's competitors for drugs that are accepted for listing on the open formulary, and to accurately
reflect such discounts in ranking the drugs on the formulary; and, for five years, obtain Commission approval before
acquiring an interest in any firm that provides formulary services to more than 2 million people in the United States.
In addition, the consent agreement would prohibit PCS and Eli Lilly from sharing proprietary or other non-public
information, such as price data, from competitors whose drugs may be placed on a PCS formulary.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 721, 15 U.S.C. 46 and  2.34 of the Commission's
rules of practice (16 CFR 2.34), notice is hereby given that the following consent agreement containing a consent
order to cease and desist, having been filed with and accepted, subject to final approval, by the Commission, has been
placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days. Public comment is invited. Such comments or views will be
considered by the Commission and will be available for inspection and copying at its principal office in accordance
with  4.9(b)(6)(ii) of the Commission's rules of practice (16 CFR 4.9(b)(6)(ii)).

The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission''), having initiated an investigation of the acquisition by Eli Lilly
and Company (``Lilly'') of the PCS Health Systems (``PCS'') business of McKesson Corporation (``McKesson''), and
it now appearing that Lilly, hereinafter sometimes referred to as ``proposed respondent,'' is willing to enter into
an agreement containing an Order to remedy the alleged lessening of competition resulting from such acquisition,
and providing for other relief:

It is hereby agreed by and between proposed respondent, by its duly authorized officer and its attorney, and counsel
for the Commission that:

1. Proposed respondent Lilly is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws
of the State of Indiana, with its office and principal place of business located at Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis,
Indiana 46285.

2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.

3. Proposed respondent waives:

a. Any further procedural steps;

b. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

c. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the Order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and

d. Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.

5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.

6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently
withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of  2.34 of the Commission's rules, the Commission may,
without further notice to the proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an Agreement Containing Consent Order from
Eli Lilly and Company (``Lilly'' or ``Proposed Respondent'') in resolution of antitrust concerns arising from Lilly's
proposed acquisition of PCS Health Systems, Inc. (``PCS'') from McKesson Corporation (``McKesson'').

The proposed consent order (``Order'') has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments
by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)
days, the Commission will again review the Agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw
from the Agreement or make final the Agreement's proposed Order.

The Commission has reason to believe that Lilly's acquisition of PCS would substantially lessen competition in violation
of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18 and section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. The Order,
if issued by the Commission, would settle the allegations of the proposed Complaint (``Complaint'').

The Complaint in this matter alleges that Lilly is engaged in the development, production and sale of pharmaceutical
products, including Prozac, an antidepressant (specifically, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor); Humulin,
an injectable insulin; Ceclor, an oral antibiotic; and Axid, an anti-ulcer product (specifically, an H2 antagonist).
It further alleges that through its subsidiary PCS, McKesson is engaged in the business of providing pharmacy benefit
management (``PBM'') services to insurance companies, third party payors, and other members of the healthcare industry.

The Complaint further alleges that a relevant line of commerce within which to analyze the effects of this acquisition
is the provision of PBM services by national full-service PBM firms, and any narrower markets contained therein.
Other relevant lines of commerce within which to analyze the effects of this acquisition are the development, manufacture
and sale of pharmaceutical products in specific therapeutic categories, and narrower markets contained therein
(including, but not limited to, the markets for injectable insulin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, H2
antagonists, and anti-ulcer drugs). It further alleges that the relevant market for PBM services by national full-service
PBM firms, as well as the relevant markets for pharmaceutical products in specific therapeutic categories, are highly
concentrated.

The Complaint further alleges that there are substantial entry barriers into the relevant markets. Even if new entry
were to occur, it would take a long time, during which time substantial harm to competition could occur.

The Complaint further alleges that as part of its PBM services, PCS maintains a drug formulary, which is a listing,
by therapeutic category, of ambulatory drug products that are approved for use by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration,
and which is made available to pharmacies, physicians, third-party payors, and other persons, to guide in the prescribing
and dispensing of pharmaceuticals. Lilly pharmaceutical products are included on the PCS formulary. PCS provides
a variety of other PBM services, including claims processing, drug utilization review, pharmacy network administration,
and related services. PCS negotiates with pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Lilly, concerning placement
on the PCS formulary, rebates, discounts, prices to be paid for pharmaceutical products purchased pursuant to pharmacy
benefit plans managed by PCS, and other issues. PCS thereby influences the prices of pharmaceutical products and
the availability of such products under the PCS pharmacy benefit plans.

The Complaint further alleges that the Agreement and Plan of Merger contains a Memorandum of Understanding (``MOU'')
in which Lilly and McKesson agreed to investigate closing Lilly's distribution centers and having McKesson handle
physical distribution of Lilly products to wholesalers and possibly be the sole distributor of Lilly products. Implementation
of this MOU would force wholesalers to deal with McKesson to obtain Lilly products or deny them access to Lilly products.

The Complaint further alleges that the effects of the proposed acquisition of McKesson by Lilly may be substantially
to lessen competition in the relevant markets in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18,
and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the following ways, among others:

(a) Products of manufacturers other than Lilly are likely to be foreclosed from the PCS formulary;

(b) Reciprocal dealing, coordinated interaction, interdependent conduct, and tacit collusion among Lilly and
other vertically integrated pharmaceutical companies will be enhanced;

(c) PCS will be eliminated as an independent negotiator of pharmaceutical prices with manufacturers;

(d) Incentives of other manufacturers to develop innovative pharmaceuticals will be diminished;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941128-2-00094 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941128-2-00047 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(e) Entry into the relevant markets may be more difficult because it will require entry at more than one level;

(f) Competition among drug wholesalers may be reduced because of the competitive advantage that control over Lilly
drugs will provide McKesson; and,

(g) The price of pharmaceuticals is likely to increase and the quality of the pharmaceuticals available to consumers
is likely to diminish.

The Complaint further alleges that the proposed acquisition of McKesson by Lilly would, if consummated, violate
section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 45. It further alleges that the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Lilly and McKesson violates section
5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45.

The Order requires Lilly to maintain an open formulary, and provides that the existing open PCS formulary will comply
with this provision. A copy of this formulary is appended to the Order. For the purposes of the Order an open formulary
is defined as a formulary that allows the inclusion of any ambulatory (

i.e.

, non-hospital) prescription drug product which the PCS independent Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (``P&T
Committee) determines is appropriate for inclusion in such formulary.

The Order requires that Lilly appoint an independent P&T Committee to administer the open formulary. This committee
will make all decisions concerning the inclusion and exclusion of drugs on the open formulary. The order sets forth
the parameters under which the P&T Committee is to operate.

The Order also requires that Lilly cause PCS to accept all discounts, rebates or other concessions offered by any other
manufacturer of pharmaceutical products on the open formulary, and requires that all such discounts, rebates and
concessions be truthfully and accurately reflected in determining relative rankings of products on the open formulary.
Nothing in the Order prohibits Lilly from offering closed formularies as well as the open formulary.

The Order also prohibits Lilly and PCS from providing, disclosing, or otherwise making available to each other Non-Public
Information. This includes information concerning other persons' bids, proposals, contracts, prices, rebates,
discounts, or other terms and conditions of sale.

The Order also requires Lilly to retain all documents, and cause PCS to separately retain all documents, for five years,
relating to the exclusion of any prescription drugs from the open formulary, any preference or ranking accorded to
any prescription drug on the open formulary, and statements or indications of discounts, rebates or other concessions.

The Order also requires Lilly to make known the availability of the open formulary to persons who currently have a PBM
service agreement of formulary agreement with PCS, and (for a period of five years) to prospective customers.


The Order also prohibits Lilly, for a period of five (5) years from the date the Order becomes final, from: Acquiring,
without the prior approval of the Commission, any stock, share capital, equity, leasehold or other interest in any
person, corporate or non-corporate, engaged in the providing of Formulary Services in the United States, if such
person has more than two (2) million lives covered by its Formulary Services in the United States; acquiring any assets
used for, or previously used for (and still suitable for use for), the providing of Formulary Services in the United
States from any person who has (or had within the two years preceding such acquisition) more than two (2) million lives
covered by its Formulary Services in the United States; or entering into any agreement, understanding, or condition
with McKesson or any wholesaler of pharmaceutical products that Lilly will sell or distribute pharmaceutical products
bearing any brand or trade name used by Lilly, in the United States or any part of the United States, exclusively through
such wholesaler.

The Order also compels Lilly to fulfill certain standard notification, reporting and inspection requirements.

The Order terminates ten years from the date it becomes final.

It is anticipated that the Order would resolve the competitive problems alleged in the Complaint. The purpose of this
analysis is to facilitate public comment on the Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation
of the agreement and Order or to modify it in any way.

The proposed consent order has been entered into for settlement purposes only, and does not constitute an admission
by the respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint.

Joint Statement of Chairman Janet D. Steiger and Commissioner Christine A. Varney in Eli Lilly/McKesson, File No.
941-0102



We voted in favor of the proposed consent agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (``Lilly'') in connection with its acquisition
of PCS Health Systems, Inc. from McKesson Corporation. We believe the consent agreement offers immediate effective
relief, avoids protracted litigation, and represents the best non-structural relief available to remedy the potential
anticompetitive consequences of the transaction. Moreover, the proposed consent achieves these goals and allows
potential efficiency gains to be realized. 

However, we remain concerned about the overall competitive impact of vertical integration by drug companies into
the pharmacy benefits management market. Through monitoring this proposed order and through analysis of these evolving
markets, the Commission intends to assess all the ramifications of vertical integration here. 



Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga 



Eli Lilly and Company, Inc., File No. 941-0102




Today, the Commissioner accepts a consent order for public comment that exudes a lack of conviction in the underlying
theory of competitive harm on which the order is based. The order does not cure the competitive problems alleged in
the complaint. Three of the four primary provisions in the order are inadequate, and the fourth, which addresses a
memorandum of understanding between Lilly and McKesson, is based on no colorable factual showing of a violation of
law. In addition, there is no justification for making the duration of the order half that of other Commission orders.
Finally, imposing this order without addressing similar acquisitions raises a question of evenhandedness and leaves
unanswered the broader question of the competitive effect of vertical integration in this industry. 

I dissent.

 Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA.


</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The GSA hereby gives notice under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 that it is requesting the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) to approve an extension for the information collection for Multiple Award Schedule Policy Statements
(MAS)_Discount Schedule and Marketing Data (DSMD). Extension is requested through October 31, 1995. DSMD sheets
are used to collect data about certain sales, discounts, and marketing. The data are used to determine the commerciality
of items offered, set the Government's negotiation objective, and determine price reasonableness. The extension
is necessary because recent enactment of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act is likely to have a significant
impact on the conduct of Federal procurement especially those aspects relating to the acquisition of commercial
items. The MAS Program, which is intended specifically for the acquisition of commercial items, will be affected
by the legislation. However, specific impacts cannot be determined until the Federal Acquisition Regulation is
revised to implement the new statute. Current plans call for those revisions to be effected during April, 1995.


It is emphasized that this extension is an interim measure. Given the likelihood of significant changes to the Federal
Acquisition Regulation in the near future, the Agency has determined that it would be inappropriate to make any long
term decision on the DSMD at this time. After regulations have been promulgated to implement the new statute, GSA will
evaluate the impact on the MAS program and take action as appropriate.

U.S.C. 552a) by establishing the conditions under which computer matching involving the Federal Government could
be performed and adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. The Computer
Matching and Privacy Protection Amendments of 1990, set out in section 7201 of Pub. L. 101-508, further amended
the Privacy Act regarding protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer
matching by Federal agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, or local government
records. Among other things, it requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to: 
(1) Make written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the matching programs; 
(2) Obtain their Data Integrity Boards' approval of the match agreements; 
(3) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget; 
(4) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; and 
(5) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments.




B. SSA Computer Matches Subject to the Privacy Act 



We have taken action to ensure that these computer matching programs comply with the requirements of the Privacy Act,
as amended.

Notice of Computer Matching Programs, States' Income Eligibility Verification System Records with the Social Security
Administration (SSA)



A. Participating Agencies 



SSA and the States. 



B. Purpose of the Matching Programs 



Section 1137 of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires States to have in effect an income and eligibility verification
system to administer certain State benefit programs including the exchange of information to verify eligibility
or benefit amounts of State beneficiaries. 

The purpose of these matching programs is to enable SSA to implement this provision. The agreements with the States
will describe the conditions under which SSA and the States agree to disclose information to each other relating to
the eligibility for, and payment of, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and State-administered
income, food assistance, and medical assistance programs, described in section 1137 (b). 



C. Authority for Conducting the Matching Programs 



Section 1137 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7). 



D. Categories of Records and Individuals Covered by the Matching Programs 




States will submit names and other identifying information of beneficiaries/recipients from their benefit rolls.
This information from the States will be matched with the SSA master file of Social Security number holders which contains
the SSNs and identifying information for all SSN holders and the SSA Master Beneficiary Record and Supplemental Security
Income Record which contain beneficiary and payment information. 



E. Inclusive Dates of the Match 



The matching programs shall become effective 40 days after a copy of the agreement, as approved by the Data Integrity
Board, is sent to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (or later if OMB objects to some or all of the
agreement), or 
30 days after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, whichever date is later. The matching programs will continue for 18 months from the effective date and may be extended
for an additional 12 months thereafter, if certain conditions are met.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to Prepare Land Use Plan Amendments and Environmental Impact Statement.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to 43 CFR 1601, 43 CFR 1610, and 40 CFR 1500-1508 notice is hereby given that the Susanville District
Office, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), California, will prepare amendments to three land use plans (LUPs) and prepare
an associated environmental impact statement (EIS). The LUPs to be amended are the (1) Cal-Neva Management Framework
Plan of 1982, (2) Tuledad-Home Camp Management Framework Plan of 1977, and (3) Alturas Resource Management Plan of
1984. The LUP amendments and EIS will be published in a single document entitled East Lassen Ecosystem Management
Plan and Environmental Impact Statement (ELEMP/EIS). 



PUBLIC PARTICIPATION:

 The public will be provided opportunities to participate and comment throughout scoping, preparation, and review
of the ELEMP/EIS. Opportunities for public participation at a series of public scoping meetings will also be provided.
Times, dates, and locations of public meetings will be announced through the news media, by mail, and personal contact.
Public meetings are anticipated to be held in Susanville, California; Alturas, California; Sacramento, California;

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The East Lassen area is located in the northwestern Great Basin, encompassing about 1.25 million acres in portions
of Washoe county in Nevada, and Lassen and Modoc counties in California. The area contains many jurisdictions, including
lands and resources administered by BLM Susanville and Winnemucca Districts, Modoc National Forest, Sierra Army
Depot, State of California, Nevada Division of Wildlife, California Department of Fish and Game, and private lands.
A BLM interdisciplinary (ID) team of specialists has been assigned to prepare the ELEMP/EIS. The ID team anticipates
the LUP amendments to result in decisions to incorporate ecosystem management principles, make resource allocations,
set goals and objectives, establish priorities, establish standards and guidelines, be consistent with Rangeland
Reform '94 and other initiatives, and define future public participation processes. The LUP amendments will be applicable
to the land and resources administered by BLM Susanville District in the East Lassen area. Preliminary issues to be
addressed are (1) vegetation, including riparian-wetland, (2) wild horses and burros, (3) fish and wildlife, (4)
livestock grazing, (5) recreation opportunities, and (6) local socio-economics. Preliminary future management
strategies (alternatives) to be addressed are (1) Baseline/Current Management (No Action), (2) Custodial Level
Management, (3) Native Species and Habitat Restoration, and (4) Featured Animals Management. At this time the ID
team does not anticipate LUP amendments to address BLM oil and gas, coal, geothermal, other mineral resources, cadastral
survey, user fees, or realty related decisions or actions.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for the issuance of a Special Use Permit
to the Government of Guam for the proposed Ritidian Point Territorial Park on the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, Dededo,
Guam is available for public review.



WRITTEN COMMENTS INFORMATION: 

Interested agencies, organizations, and individuals are encouraged to provide written comments to the Fish and
Wildlife Service within 30 days after publication of this Notice. Address comments to the Refuge Manager as shown
below:


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:

 Field Supervisor, Jerry Leinecke, Hawaiian and Pacific Islands NWR Complex, is the primary author of this document.
The Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft EA on its proposal to issue a Special
Use Permit to the Government of Guam for the proposed Ritidian Point Territorial Park within the Guam National Wildlife
Refuge.


The Government of Guam proposes to establish and operate the Ritidian Point Territorial Park (RPTP) within an approximate
20.24 ha (50 acres) site of the Ritidian Point Unit of the Guam National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). The RPTP would be operated
by the Guam Department of Parks and Recreation with the biological support of the Guam Department of Agriculture,
Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources, in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). The
proposed RPTP would provide the public with natural history educational and recreational opportunities within
the setting of the Ritidian Point Unit of the Guam NWR. The proposed RPTP would be managed to be compatible with the purposes
for which the Guam NWR was established and in accordance with a Special Use Permit issued by the Service to the Government
of Guam for the use of the approximate 20.24 ha site within the Ritidian Point Unit.
The proposed action is anticipated to have only minimal direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the human environment.
The establishment, operation and maintenance of the park will occur on a site that has been previously disturbed by
construction of fields, pavilions, shelters and Navy buildings and by the past use of the area for recreational purposes
by the Navy.
The major alternatives under consideration that were analyzed and evaluated during planning are: (A) Preferred
Alternative, establishment of the proposed RPTP on an approximate 20.24 ha (50 acre) site within the Ritidian Point
Unit by the Guam Department of Parks and Recreation; (Alternative 2) establishment of a Territorial Park at Tarague
Basin, South Finegayan, Falcona Beach, or the Anao Conservation Area at the present time; (Alternative 3) establishment
of a public use area at the Ritidian Point Unit by the Service; (Alternative 4) which is the No Action alternative.
Staffs of the Government of Guam, Department of Parks and Recreation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service jointly
cooperated to plan, prepare and evaluate the proposals and prepare this draft EA. Detailed information concerning
consultation and coordination is contained in Section VII of the draft EA.
All agencies and individuals are urged to provide comments and suggestions for improving this EA as soon as possible.
All comments received during the designated comment period will be considered in preparation of the final EA for this
proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Establishment of National Grain Car Council </DOCTITLE>
and Request for Suggestion of Candidates for Membership 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Establishment of Federal Advisory Committee. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As required by Section 9(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App., the ICC hereby gives notice
that it has obtained approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a National Grain Car Council
(NGCC) to assist the Commission in fulfilling its obligations to oversee the railroad industry's furnishing of safe
and adequate car service for the transportation of grain under reasonable rules and practices, 49 U.S.C. 10321 and
11121(a). The ICC is also requesting suggestions for candidates for membership on the NGCC. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission has traditionally played an integral role in attempting to balance the needs of rail carriers and grain
shippers. The regulatory reforms of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 encourage market-based private solutions to such
disputes, with resort to the Commission only when the free market has not successfully resolved a problem. It has become
apparent to the Commission that those involved in the shipment of grain by railroad face recurring equipment shortages,
and the current mechanisms available for addressing these problems are inadequate piecemeal measures, subject
to time-consuming and expensive litigation. 



The Commission attempted to encourage discussion between large and small railroads, grain shippers, car manufacturers,
and others by hosting a conference in April 1994. See the 

Report on the National Grain Car Supply Conference, 

Ex Parte No. 519 (Commissioner Simmons August 1994) (

Report

). Despite an airing of competing positions, the parties failed to reach any consensus solutions concerning the problems
facing shippers of grain. The 

Report 

suggested the formation of an NGCC, consisting of representatives of railroads, shippers, and manufacturers, to
give these diverse groups an ongoing mechanism for discussion in a forum that is not currently available. Particular
areas of discussion for the NGCC include identification of areas where car shortages might occur, new technological
developments, grain export policies, new rail car purchases, and continuing advice to the Commission. 

The NGCC will meet at least once a year, with such meetings of subcommittees or study groups as the NGCC deems necessary.
We anticipate that the NGCC will meet in early 1995. No honoraria, salaries, or travel and per diem is available to members
of the NGCC; however, reimbursement for travel expenses may be sought from the Commission in cases of hardship. 


Suggestions for candidates for membership on the NGCC should be submitted to the Commission within 20 days. The NGCC
will be balanced and representative of all interested and affected parties, and consist of 10 representatives of
Class I railroads, 5 representatives of Class II and Class III railroads, 5 representatives of grain shippers and
receivers, and 5 representatives of private car owners and car manufacturers. The Vice-Chairman of the ICC will serve
as an ex-officio member of the NGCC. 


Chairman McDonald has appointed Richard S. Fitzsimmons, Director of the Commission's Office of Congressional and
Public Affairs, to serve as the Designated Federal 
Official_the agency's liaison to the NGCC. 


Suggestions for members of the NGCC should be submitted in letter form, identifying the name of the candidate; evidence
of the interests the candidate will represent; and a representation that the candidate is willing to serve a two-year
term as a member of the NGCC. 


Copies of the Charter of the NGCC may be obtained from the Office of the Secretary, Room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission,
1201 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 927-7428 [Assistance for the hearing
impaired is available through TDD services (202) 927-5721.]

<DOCTITLE>Norfolk and Western Railway Company_Trackage Rights Exemption_Consolidated Rail Corporation </DOCTITLE>


Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) has agreed to grant overhead trackage rights to Norfolk and Western Railway
Company (N&W) between milepost 363.0 at Warsaw and milepost 319.2 at Fort Wayne, a distance of approximately
43.8 miles in Allen, Kosciusko, and Whitley Counties, IN. The transaction was to have been consummated on November
23, 1994. 
The transaction is intended to alleviate the congestion on N&W's own route between Fort Wayne and Chicago, IL,
by giving it an immediate, alternative routing. The trackage rights are temporary and are to be used in connection
with a line between Tolleston, IL, and Warsaw that N&W previously purchased from Conrail. N&W will purchase
the Warsaw-Fort Wayne line from Conrail on or before January 10, 1996. 
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected
under 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 

354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 

360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 
This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption
is void 

ab initio. 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to reopen
will not stay the exemption's effectiveness. An original and 10 copies of all pleadings, referring to Finance Docket
No. 32610, must be filed with the Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington,
DC 20423. In addition, a copy of each pleading must be served on Robert J. Cooney, 3 Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 23510-2191.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Modification of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed modification to the consent
decree in 

United States 

v. 

Accurate Partitions Corp., et al.,

 Civil Action No. S91-00646M, was lodged on October 19, 1994 with the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana. The 

Accurate Partitions

 decree, which was entered by the Court on February 27, 1992, resolves the United States' claims under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (``CERCLA'') against the Settling Defendants and the
Settling 

De Minimis

 Defendants for environmental contamination at the Fisher-Calo Superfund Site in LaPorte County, Indiana (``Fisher-Calo
Site'').

The proposed modification to the 

Accurate Partitions

 decree adds Lincoln Foodservice Products, Inc. (``Lincoln'') and Amphenol Corporation (``Amphenol'') as Settling


De Minimis

 Defendants to the decree. The United States filed its First Amended Complaint in this case on October 19, 1994, adding
Lincoln and Amphenol as defendants in this action. When this action was commenced, Lincoln and Amphenol were not named
as defendants in the United States' complaint, nor were they included as Settling 

De Minimis

 Defendants in Appendix 5 of the consent decree. Nevertheless, these two companies paid their allocable shares of
response costs to the Settling Defendants pursuant to Section XXVII of the consent decree, as if they had signed the
decree. This proposed modification to the decree would add Lincoln and Amphenol to Appendix 5 of the decree as Settling


De Minimis

 Defendants, if the following condition is satisfied: that the Settling Defendants pay to the United States the sum
of $25,000 of the $115,262 total amount that Lincoln and Amphenol previously paid to the Settling Defendants pursuant
to Section XXVII of the consent decree.

The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed modification to the 

Accurate Partitions

 consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General, Environment and Natural Resources
Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to 

United States

 v. 

Accurate Partitions Corp., et al.,

 (N.D. Ind.) and DOJ Ref. No. 90-11-2-549.

The proposed modification to the decree may be examined at the office of the United States Attorney, Northern District
of Indiana, 301 Federal Building, 204 South Main Street, South Bend, Indiana 46601; the Region V office of U.S. EPA,
77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604-3590; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G St., NW., 4th

a proposed consent decree in 

United States 

v. 

Federal Pacific Electric Company, Inc. et al., 

Civil Action No. 92-11924T, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

and to pay $1,500,000 in civil penalties and punitive damages for failure to comply with a Unilateral Administrative
Order issued in August 1990 to perform the remedy set forth in the Record of Decision for the Site. The $40,000,000 total
judgment amount is partially payable from the proceeds of claims the Friedlands have against Cooper Industries,
Inc., Cornell-Dubilier Electronics, Inc., and Federal Pacific Electric Company, Inc. for indemnification under
the terms of a lease agreement. The proposed consent decree also guarantees recovery of $7 million from the Friedlands.

American Microsystems, Inc., Testing Division, Pocatello, Idaho; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening



On November 9, 1994, the Department, at the request of the company reopened its investigation for the workers and former
workers of the subject firm in Pocatello, Idaho. The initial investigation resulted in a negative determination
July 7, 1994 because the workers who produce semiconductors did not meet the decreased sales or production criterion
of the Trade Act. The negative determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 26, 1994 (59 FR 37996).

Findings on reopening show that an appropriate subdivision of the subject firm was adversely affected by increased
imports. The Testing Division has decreased production and employment in 1994. Other findings show that the testing
operation is gradually being transferred offshore and the tested products (chips and wafers) are imported back to
the company. The shutdown process is expected to be completed by March 1995.



Conclusion



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, it is concluded that increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with the chips and wafers tested by the Testing Division of American Microsystems, Inc.,
contributed importantly to the decline in sales or production and to the total or partial separation of workers at
the Testing Division of the subject facility. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the
following revised determination:




All workers and former workers of the Testing Division of American Microsystems, Inc., Pocatello, Idaho who became
totally or partially separated from employment on or after May 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance
under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>Champion Parts Northeast Division, Beech Creek, PA and Lock Haven, PA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding
Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>


By an application dated October 3, 1994, with support from the Pennsylvania State Legislature, the workers- requested
administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice
was issued on September 13, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 4, 1994 (59 FR 50628).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
Investigation findings show that the workers produce rebuilt auto parts. The Beech Creek plant produces waterpumps,
starters, clutches and alternators while the Lock Haven plant produces carburetors.
Its claimed that the company has lost market share because competitors are either importing components or importing
the final product.
Investigation findings show that the decreased sales or production criterion and the ``contributed importantly''
test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act have not been met. The findings show that sales at the subject
firm increased in 1993 compared to 1992 and in the first six months of 1994 compared to the same period of 1993. Other
findings show that the layoffs are the result of a corporate decision to consolidate their operations by shifting
production to other domestic facilities. A domestic transfer of production would not form a basis for a worker group
certification.
The findings also show that Champion takes broken and worn out parts and rebuilds them into working parts. Other findings
show Champion imports only when a worn out or broken part is not available to rebuild. These company imports account
for a very small portion of Champion's sales.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Investigations Regarding Certifications of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under Section 221(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade
Adjustment Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, has instituted investigations pursuant to Section
221(a) of the Act. 

The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.


The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address show below, not later than December 8, 1994. 

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than December 8, 1994.


The petitions filed in this case are available for inspection at the Office of the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, DC, 20210.

<DOCTITLE>First Image Management Company, Houston, Texas; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>


By an application dated October 2, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the
subject petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice will soon be published in the Federal Register

.
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
Investigation findings show that the workers produce microfilm.
Although the Department's denial was erroneously based on the fact that the workers did not produce an article, the
workers still do not meet the ``contributed importantly'' test of the worker group eligibility requirements of the
Trade Act of 1974.
The ``contributed importantly'' test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the firm's major customers.
The Department's survey of the subject firm major declining customers shows that none of the respondents imported
microfilming services.
Technological unemployment as in the rapid development of PCs and new disk technology for storing data would not provide
a basis for a worker group certification.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Job Training Partnership Act, Title III Program; Career Management Accounts </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Employment and Training Administration, Labor. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds and solicitation for grant application (SGA). 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA), announces a demonstration program
to provide dislocated workers with re-employment and retraining services through individual career management
accounts. The demonstration program will be funded with Secretary's National Reserve funds appropriated through
Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). This notice describes the process that eligible entities must
use to apply for demonstration funds, the subject area for which applications will be accepted for funding, how grantees
are to be selected, and the responsibilities of grantees. It is anticipated that up to $3 million will be available
for funding the demonstration projects covered by this solicitation. 

Everything needed to apply is contained in this announcement.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This announcement consists of four parts. Part I describes the authorities and purpose of the demonstration program
and identifies demonstration policy and topics. Part II describes the application process and provides detailed
guidelines for use in applying for demonstration grants. 

There is no separate application package.

 Part III includes the statement of work for the demonstration projects. Part IV identifies and defines the selection
criteria which will be used in reviewing and evaluating applications. Part V describes the reporting requirements.




Part I. Background 



A. Authorities 



Section 324 of the Job Training Partnership Act authorizes the use of funds reserved under Part B of Title III for demonstration
programs of up to three years in length. Under section 324, the Secretary is required to conduct or provide for an evaluation
of the success of each demonstration program. 



B. Purpose of the Demonstration 



Projects funded through this solicitation are to provide reemployment and retraining services_as described in
sections 314(c), 314(d) and 314(e) of JTPA_to dislocated workers through the use of individual career management
accounts. The goals of career management accounts are to:

 


_Increase customer choice; 

_Allow maximum flexibility in customizing services, and service delivery, to the needs of the individual dislocated
worker; 

_Expand the resources and sources of assistance which are available to the individual dislocated worker. 




The purpose of this demonstration is to determine if career management accounts are an administratively feasible
approach for achieving these goals. 



C. Demonstration Policy 



1. Awards



DOL will select three to five applicants to conduct demonstrations of the use of career management accounts. It is
anticipated that individual grant awards will be up to a maximum of $1,000,000 each.

<TEXT>
 

2. Evaluation 



Each grantee must establish a process whereby eligible dislocated workers are referred, after an assessment of individual
needs, to a treatment group which will be served through the use of career management accounts. As described in Sections
III.F and III.G of this solicitation, project designs will be expected to address both quantitative and qualitative
measures of participant outcomes, including customer satisfaction. 

Under a separate announcement, DOL will select and fund separate evaluation contractors to: (1) provide technical
assistance to selected grantees in establishing appropriate data collection methods and processes; and (2) conduct
an independent evaluation of the outcomes, impacts and benefits of the demonstration projects. Grantees will be
expected to make available participant records and access to personnel, as specified by the evaluation contractor.


In addition, DOL will establish, for each demonstration project site, an oversight group made up of federal, State
and substate staff. 



3. Eligible Participants 



Workers eligible for assistance under these demonstration grants are those individuals who are ``eligible dislocated
workers'' in accordance with Section 301(a) or Section 314(h) of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). 



4. Allowable Activities 



Grant funds awarded under this demonstration may be used to provide the services described in JTPA Section 314(c),
Section 314(d) and Section 314(e). These services are more fully described in the statute. In addition, funds may
be used to cover the costs of developing and implementing processes or mechanisms by which an individual worker can
manage his/her ``career account'' and access payments for the costs of reemployment and retraining services at qualified
providers. Funds may also be used to cover administrative costs, including the costs associated with establishing
coordination with the unemployment compensation system, as described at Section 314(f). 



5. Cost Limitations 



Demonstration grants are not subject to the cost limitations for formula-funded Title III grants at Section 315 of
the JTPA. However, any offeror proposing administrative costs that exceed 15 percent of the budget or needs-related
payments and supportive services that exceed 25 percent of the funds requested in the application shall provide a
narrative justification. 



D. Demonstration Topic 



DOL is soliciting applications for demonstrations of the feasibility of establishing career management accounts
for individual workers. Career management accounts are funding commitments, which can be accessed by eligible individuals,
to pay for the cost of training and other career or employment transition services allowable under the grant. The career
management account is intended to provide maximum flexibility to the individual worker in selecting the types, timing
and sources of career and employment transition assistance. The account is tied to the individual worker. However,
to optimize the use of resources available from other funding sources, the account should provide the means to accept
credits or deposits from multiple sources. 



Part II. Application Process 



A. Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants for demonstration projects funded under this announcement are States and Title III substate
grantees. States and substate grantees are defined at Section 301 of the Act. An application from a State agency shall
be submitted by the Governor. An application from a substate grantee shall include written comments from the Governor.
An application from a state should include comments, or a letter of support, from each substate area in which the Career
Management Account System is to be implemented. 

To adequately test the career management account concept, applicants must be able to serve at least 200 individuals
during the grant period of performance. It is expected that funds under this grant will provide no more than 50% of the
funding support for the career management accounts. Other public and private funds, including JTPA Title III formula
funds, should be used to provide the additional funding support. 

DOL expects that, in such cases where more than one eligible entity (e.g., State and SSG, two or more adjacent SSGs)
wishes to apply for a grant to serve the same target population, applicants will establish appropriate linkages and
submit a single application under a single proposed administrative entity. 



B. Submission of Proposals 



An original and three (3) copies of the proposal shall be submitted. The proposal shall consist of two (2) separate
and distinct parts_Part I, the Financial Proposal, and Part II, the Technical Proposal. 

1. 

Financial Proposal. 

The Financial Proposal, Part I, shall contain the SF-424, ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (Appendix
No. 1), and SF 424-A, ``Budget'' (Appendix No. 2). The Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number is 17.246.
The budget shall include on separate pages: a cost analysis of the budget, identifying in detail the amount of each
budget line item attributable to each of the Title III cost categories at Section 314 of JTPA for funds requested through
this grant; and an identification of the amount of each budget line item which will be covered by other funds, and the
sources of those funds (including employer funds, in-kind resources, secured and unsecured loans, grants, and other
forms of assistance, public and private). 

Federal funds cannot be used to support training which an employer is in a position to, and would otherwise, provide.
Federal funds may not be used for acquisition of production equipment. The only type of equipment that may be acquired
with Federal funds is equipment necessary for the operation of the grant. Grant funds may cover 

only 

those costs which are appropriate and reasonable. In the instance of a purchase, the cost of the equipment is to be prorated
over the projected life of the equipment to determine the cost to the grant. Awardee must receive prior approval from
the Department of Labor/Employment and Training Administration's Property Officer for the purchase and/or lease
of any property and/or equipment with a per unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more, and a useful life of more than one
year as defined in OMB Circulars A-102 and A-110. This includes the purchase of ADP equipment. The request
must be directed through your GOTR and must include a detailed description and cost of the items to be acquired. 

Applicants may budget limited amounts of grant funds to work with technical expert(s) to provide advice and develop
more complete project plans.

2.

 Technical Proposal. 

The technical proposal, Part II, shall demonstrate the offeror's capabilities in accordance with the Statement
of Work in Section III. NO COST DATA OR REFERENCE TO PRICE SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.

3. 

Page Count Limit. 

Applications are to be limited to 30 single-side pages, single-spaced. The technical proposal should include a 2
to 3 page executive summary.



C. Hand-Delivered Proposals



Proposals should be mailed at least five (5) days prior to the closing date. However, if proposals are hand-delivered,
they must be received at the designated place by 2 p.m., Eastern Time by January 20, 1995. All overnight mail will be
considered to be hand-delivered and must be received at the designated place by the specified time and closing date.
Telegraphed and/or faxed proposals will not be honored. Failure to adhere to the above instructions will be a basis
for a determination of nonresponsiveness.



D. Late Proposals



Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will
not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it_

(1) Was sent by the U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the
date specified for receipt of the application (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt
of applications by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); or

(2) Was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service_Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5 p.m. at
the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term ``working days''
excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent either by the U.S. Postal Service
registered or certified mail is the U.S. postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the
U.S. Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark''
means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that
is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. Postal
Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation
``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.

The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal sent by ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service_Post
Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope and wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S.
Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined above. Therefore, applicants should request the postal
clerk to place a legible hand cancellation ``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



E. Withdrawal of Proposals



Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award.
Proposals may be withdrawn in person or by an applicant or an authorized representative thereof, if the representative's
identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposal before an award.



F. Period of Performance



The period of performance will be from the date of grant execution through June 30, 1997. 



G. Funding 



DOL has set aside up to $3 million to be disbursed, contingent upon resources being available for this purpose. It is
expected that grant awards will be up to a maximum of $1 million each. 



H. Option to Extend 



Based on the availability of funds, effective program operation and the needs of the Department, options for annual
funding of up to two (2) additional years for project operation may be provided.



Part III. Government's Requirement/Statement of Work Solicitation Specifications

Part IV. Evaluation Criteria 



Prospective offerors are advised that the selection of grantee(s) for award is to be made after careful evaluation
of proposals by a panel of specialists selected by DOL. Panelists will evaluate the proposals for acceptability with
emphasis on the various factors enumerated below. The panel results are advisory in nature and not binding on the Grant
Officer. Evaluations will be made on the basis of both what the proposed offeror intends to do during the grant period,
and on the usefulness of the demonstration after the end of the grant period. 



A. Technical Evaluation (75 points) 





Services and Target Group. 

The responsiveness of the services to be provided, including the degree to which the services appear to meet the needs
of the target population. The degree to which the services to be provided and the process for selecting eligible individuals
to be served through individual career management accounts are appropriate to the objectives of this demonstration.
(20 points) 



Career Management Account System Design. 

The completeness of the description of career management system. The extent to which the system creates more flexibility
and individual choice for the individual worker. The extensiveness/scope of the service provider network. (30 points)




Coordination and Linkages; Utilization of Resources. 

The extent to which the project will be integrated with other existing public and private resources, and is supported
by appropriate State and local organizations. Extent to which project design clearly leverages funds from non-JTPA
sources. (15 points) 



Evaluation and replicability. 

The completeness of the description of the methods which will be used to determine the performance of the project,
including assessments of customer satisfaction. The likelihood that the approach may be applicable to the full range
of dislocated worker programs across the country. (10 points) 



B. Cost Evaluation (25 points) 



The cost effectiveness of the project as indicated by the relationship of proposed costs to number of participants
to be served, the range of services to be provided and the planned outcomes. 

Applicants are advised that discussions may be necessary in order to clarify any inconsistencies in their applications.
Applications may be rejected where the information required is not provided in sufficient detail to permit adequate
assessment of the proposal. The final decision on the award will be based on what is most advantageous to the Federal
Government as determined by the ETA Grant Officer.

<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 

hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. 

No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 

The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 



Statutory Findings 



In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 




(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 

(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 

their participants and beneficiaries; and 

(c) They are protective of the rights of the 

participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

respectively, in Paris, France and 

New York, New York 



[Prohibited Transaction Exemption 94-80; Application Nos. D-9178 and D-9179] 



Exemption 



The restrictions of sections 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of
the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code shall not apply to the guarantee by the Bank to an
employee benefit plan (the Plan) that retains the Manager as investment manager for such plan of the value of the Plan's
principal investment with the Manager, provided that each of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) The fiduciaries
of the Plan who are responsible for the selection and retention of the Manager as investment manager for the Plan, and
for the selection of the guarantee from the Bank, are independent of the Manager, the Bank, and their affiliates; (2)
no separate fee or remuneration is payable by the Plan or any other person to the Manager, the Bank, or any of their affiliates
for the guarantee; (3) the Plan is entitled to cancel the investment management agreement with the Manager, and/or
the guarantee provided by the Bank, at any time upon reasonable notice; (4) the agreement between each Plan and the
Manager and the Bank will be amended to provide that, for purposes of enforcing the Bank's guarantee, the determination
of the value of a Plan's assets under the Manager's investment management at any relevant time shall be made pursuant
to objective standards determined jointly by the Manager and the Plan's custodian, which is the bank or other entity
holding the assets of the Plan or other Plan fiduciary responsible for causing the Plan to enter into the agreement;
(5) however, if the Manager and the Plan's custodian are unable to agree as to the value of the Plan's account, they will
jointly select a qualified appraiser to make this determination; if they are unable to agree on an appraiser, the Manager
and the Plan's custodian will each select a qualified appraiser and the value will be determined by mutual agreement
of such appraisers or, if they cannot agree, by a third qualified appraiser designated by the two appraisers, and all
such appraisers will be independent of the Manager; and (6) the investment management agreement between each Plan
and the Manager and the Bank will provide: (a) that income from any lending from a Plan's account will be credited to
the Plan's account and not to the Manager's account, and (b) that no lending of this type will occur under circumstances
where the borrower is a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to the Plan, unless the conditions of
Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 81-6 (52 FR 18754, May 19, 1987) and 82-63 (47 FR 14084, April 6, 1982,
as corrected by 47 FR 16437, April 16, 1982)] are satisfied.

For purposes of this exemption, the term ``affiliate'' of another person means any person directly or indirectly,
through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person, provided
that the Manager shall not be deemed an affiliate of another person solely because the Manager has investment management
authority or discretion over the assets of the other person. For purposes of the foregoing, the term ``control'' means
the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a person other than an individual.
Further, for purposes of this exemption, a Plan fiduciary shall be deemed ``independent'' of a person only if: (1)
the fiduciary is not an affiliate, as defined above, of such person; and (2) the fiduciary has no other relationship
to or interest in such persons that might affect the exercise of such fiduciary's best judgment as a fiduciary. 

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on September 19, 1994, at 59 FR 47947.

General Information 



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 


(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of
the exemption.

Sammons Enterprises, Inc. 
Employee Stock Ownership Trust (the Trust) 
Located in Dallas, Texas 


[Exemption Application No. D-9743] 


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).
If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions
resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code,
shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) by certain accounts (the Prior Plan Accounts) in the Trust of certain
limited partnership interests (the Limited Partnership Interests) and an undivided interest in certain real property
(the Property Interest; collectively, the Interests) to Otter, Inc. (Otter), a party in interest with respect to
the Trust. 

This proposed exemption is conditioned upon the following requirements: (1) All terms and conditions of the Sale
are at least as favorable to the Prior Plan Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction; (2) the Sale
is a one-time cash transaction; (3) the Prior Plan Accounts are not required to pay any commissions, costs or other
expenses in connection with the Sale; (4) the Prior Plan Accounts receive a sales price equal to the greater of: (a)
the fair market value of the Interests as determined by qualified, independent appraisers; or (b) the Prior Plan Accounts'
aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Interests; (5) the trustee of the Trust determines that the Sale is appropriate
for the Prior Plan Accounts and is in the best interests of the Prior Plan Accounts and their participants and beneficiaries;
(6) the Prior Plan Accounts, prior to the Sale, obtain the written consent of the general partner of each of the limited
partnerships involved with respect to the sale of the Limited Partnership Interests; and (7) the other partners of
such limited partnerships, as per the limited partnership agreements, are given the right of first refusal with respect
to the Limited Partnership Interests. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. Sammons Corporate Services, Inc. (SCSI), an affiliate of Sammons Enterprises, Inc. (SEI), sponsors a defined
contribution plan designated as the Sammons Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan), the assets of which are the
corpus of the Trust. SEI is the common parent of Consolidated Investment Services, Inc. (CIS), of which Otter, SCSI
and many other corporations are subsidiaries. SEI, through various wholly owned subsidiaries, is involved in a variety
of industries, including the insurance, cable television, industrial supply and bottled water industries. Otter
is engaged primarily in the business of collecting and monetizing debts incurred in oil and gas related transactions.


2. As of December 31, 1993, the Trust had total assets of $101,618,265 and 2,242 participants. The trustee of the Trust
(the Trustee) is Texas Commerce Bank, N.A., formerly Ameritrust, N.A. The Trustee has the sole investment discretion
with regard to the Trust's assets. The purpose of the Plan is to invest primarily in the outstanding stock of SEI (the
Stock), which is not publicly traded.

1

 As of December 31, 1993, the Trust held approximately ninety-eight percent of its assets in the Stock. The Trust owns
7.65 percent of the Stock; the balance of the outstanding stock is privately held. 





3. In 1960, Texas Marine & Industrial Supply Company (TMIS), a Texas corporation engaged in the business of selling
marine supplies, adopted the Texas Marine & Industrial Supply Company Profit Sharing Plan (the TMIS Plan). In
1971, TMIS was acquired by TMI Supply Company and, as a result of that transaction, became a member of the consolidated
group of which SEI is the common parent. Effective 1991, the TMIS Plan merged into the Plan. As a result of this merger,
the existing TMIS Plan accounts were frozen and all future contributions under the TMIS Plan were discontinued. The
Prior Plan Accounts consist of these frozen accounts which have been maintained as separate accounts for TMIS employees
under the Trust and have continued to be invested in assets other than the Stock, such as the Interests described herein
below and certain liquid investments in securities. 

The Prior Plan Accounts involve forty-three participants. The fair market value of the assets in the Prior Plan Accounts
totalled $1,994,394 as of December 31, 1993. The Interests account for approximately twenty-five percent of the
Prior Plan Accounts' assets. Several TMIS employees who have substantial amounts in the Prior Plan Accounts are expected
to retire in the near future. Therefore, the Trust must convert the assets in the Prior Plan Accounts into more liquid
investments to insure that sufficient cash will be available to make such distributions. Because Otter has offered
to purchase the Interests at a price higher than any actual or anticipated offers resulting from the Trustee's efforts
to sell the Interests to an unrelated party, the Trustee proposes to sell the Interests to Otter for the greater of:
(a) The fair market values of the Interests as determined by qualified, independent appraisers; or (b) the Prior Plan
Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Interests. The Sale will be a one-time cash transaction, and
the Prior Plan Accounts will not be required to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Sale. The
Trustee has determined that the Sale is appropriate for the Prior Plan Accounts and is in the best interests of the Prior
Plan Accounts and their participants and beneficiaries. However, the Sale will be subject to the Prior Plan Accounts
obtaining, prior to the Sale, the written consent of the general partner of each of the limited partnerships involved
with respect to the sale of the Limited Partnership Interests. In addition, the other partners of such limited partnerships,
as per the limited partnership agreements, must be given the right of first refusal with respect to the Limited Partnership
Interests. The inability of the Prior Plan Accounts to sell one of the Limited Partnership Interests to Otter either
due to the failure of the Prior Plan Accounts to obtain the written consent of the general partner or the exercise of
the right of first refusal by any partner does not preclude the sale of the other Limited Partnership Interest to Otter
if the requisite conditions are met. Accordingly, Otter and the Trustee request an administrative exemption from
the Department to permit the Sale of the Interests under the terms and conditions described herein.

The Limited Partnership Interests 



4. The Limited Partnership Interests consist of a 22.50 percent interest in Sunbelt Commercial Associates (Sunbelt
Commercial) and two interests_a 14.15 percent Class A interest and a 14.5 percent Class B interest_in Sunbelt City,
Ltd. (Sunbelt Oklahoma). (Sunbelt Commercial and Sunbelt Oklahoma are collectively referred to as the Limited Partnerships).
The Prior Plan Accounts acquired the Limited Partnership Interests as a result of a series of purchases occurring
between 1981 and 1993, in the case of Sunbelt Commercial, and 1982 and 1984, in the case of Sunbelt Oklahoma. The Prior
Plan Accounts made such purchases either directly from the Limited Partnerships or from withdrawing limited partners.
The general partners of both Limited Partnerships, as well as the other investors, are unrelated to the Prior Plan
Accounts, SEI and its affiliates. The Limited Partnerships were formed for the purpose of investing in real estate
through a sale-leaseback arrangement with Cyclops Inc. (Cyclops). In 1982, the Limited Partnerships purchased
certain properties in Tulsa and Oklahoma City from Cyclops and leased such properties back to Cyclops for use by its
Silo Division for the retail sale of major electrical appliances. The leases are triple net leases for a term of fifteen
years with two five-year lessee renewal options. In 1993, Cyclops closed its Silo stores in the Tulsa and Oklahoma
City locations but has advised the Limited Partnerships that it intends to honor its lease agreements. 

The Prior Plan Accounts invested $250,600 in Sunbelt Commercial and $230,089 in Sunbelt Oklahoma with the total Prior
Plan Account investment in the two Limited Partnerships amounting to $480,689. As of December 31, 1993, the Prior
Plan Accounts had received distributions representing returns of capital totaling $480,689 and income distributions
totaling $146,064 for the two Limited Partnerships combined. Sunbelt Commercial and Sunbelt Oklahoma have experienced
average compounded rates of return of 10.1 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively. 

Annual valuations of interests in both partnerships are furnished, on behalf of the general partners, to investors
by Churchill Management Corporation (Churchill), the investment adviser to the Limited Partnerships. The applicants
represent that Churchill is independent of, and unrelated to, the Prior Plan Accounts, SEI and its affiliates. Based
upon the valuation reports from Churchill dated February 14, 1994, the aggregate fair market value of the Limited
Partnership Interests for the three Limited Partnership investments was $400,508 as of 
December 31, 1993. 

Substantially all of the assets of each Limited Partnership consist of its real estate and its lease contract with
Silo. 
The Limited Partnerships' only other material asset is cash. Therefore, Churchill bases its valuation of the Limited
Partnerships on the fair market values of the underlying assets of the Limited Partnership, which are the Tulsa and
Oklahoma City properties, plus the Limited Partnerships' available cash. Independent, qualified appraisers annually
value these underlying properties. 

The most recent appraisals, dated January 14, 1994, by 
Duane J. Blevins, MAI of Tulsa, Oklahoma, taking into account 
the existing long-term leases on the properties, place primary emphasis on the income approach. Mr. Blevins placed
the fair market values on the Tulsa and Oklahoma City properties at $950,000 and $1,250,000, respectively. Mr. Blevins
notes that the values of these properties have declined since the closing of the Silo stores because the Limited Partnerships
will not be able to renew the lease with Cyclops. As a result, Mr. Blevins further notes, the Limited Partnerships,
as owners, will be faced with added expenses such as marketing, leasing commissions, vacancy and possibly up-front
renovation costs for a prospective tenant. The applicants represent that the Limited Partnership Interests are
highly illiquid investments for which there is a very limited secondary market.

2

 On March 14, 1994, an attorney for the Trust contacted Churchill and inquired whether either the general partner or
any of the other limited partners would be interested in purchasing the Limited Partnership Interests. On April 6,
1994, Churchill advised the attorney that none of the Limited Partners were interested in purchasing those interests
and that the general partner would consider purchasing them at a purchase price equal to one third to one half of their
original purchase price.

5. The Property Interest consists of a 3.125 percent undivided interest in a 117,956 square foot retail center with
a 1,500 square foot addition and the underlying land (collectively, the Property). The Property is located at 5029-5139
Austell Road in Cobb County, Georgia. 

On November 30, 1988, the TMIS Plan participated with unrelated investors in a loan in the original amount of $1,600,000
to Atlanta Austell Plaza, Ltd. (Atlanta Ltd.), a California limited partnership which was unrelated to the Prior
Plan Accounts.

3

 The TMIS Plan's contribution was $50,000 or 3.125 percent of the total principal amount. A second deed of trust on the
Property secured the loan. The first deed of trust, originally held by the Fulton National Bank of Atlanta, secured
a loan in the original principal amount of $1,800,000. The first deed of trust note was subsequently assigned to Western
Savings Bank and is now held by Meritor Savings Bank (formerly known as Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, successor
by merger to Western Savings Bank). At the time that the parties entered into the second deed of trust loan, the unpaid
principal balance on the first deed of trust loan was $1,113,000. 





Eventually, Atlanta Ltd. experienced difficulties and became unable to service the debt on the first and second deed
of trust loans. In February of 1991, the Prior Plan Accounts and the other lenders foreclosed on the second deed of trust,
thereby acquiring direct ownership of the Property.

4

 In accordance with their original investment, the Prior Plan Accounts received a 3.125 percent interest in the Property.
The other investors in the Property are unrelated to SEI and its affiliates. The Prior Plan Accounts and the other lenders
contributed the necessary funds to make current the principal and interest payments on the first deed of trust loan.
The Trust contributed a total of $11,406 to cover the costs of foreclosure, the payments of the first deed of trust loan
and other costs which included operating, maintenance and advertising expenses.

5

 As a result of such foreclosure, the Prior Plan Accounts and the other lenders assumed Atlanta Ltd.'s position as debtor
on the first deed of trust loan. 






In 1993, the Property owners, pursuant to the terms of a lease, were required to make tenant improvements in the amount
of $225,000. Several of the Property owners objected to further mortgaging the Property in an effort to raise this
additional $225,000. Finally, the tenant and the Property owners agreed that the tenant would pay for its own improvements
but would be reimbursed in the amount of $225,000 by the Property owners out of any proceeds which resulted from the
sale of the Property. As of December 31, 1993, the outstanding balance on the original first deed of trust loan was $617,000.
Accordingly, the outstanding liabilities on the Property (the Liabilities), as of December 31, 1993, increased
by $350,000 to $842,000. 

The applicants represent that the Property has been and continues to be leased to unrelated parties. As of December
31, 1993, the Property had a fifty percent occupancy rate with the average lease being a five-year, triple net lease
with the tenant responsible for all of the actual tenant finish work on the space. The Prior Plan Accounts' portion
of the lease income collected since 1991 will amount to $36,349 as of December 31, 1994. 

Roger R. Upton, MAI and Martha H. Mathis, MAI 
(the Appraisers) of Upton Associates located in Atlanta, 
Georgia appraised the Property as of January 14, 1994 on an 
``as is'' basis, i.e., a fifty percent lease rate. Otter represents that both the Appraisers and Upton Associates
are independent of and unrelated to SEI and its affiliates. In placing the fair market value of the Property at $2,650,000,
the Appraisers utilized the income approach and the market approach, but gave primary emphasis to the income approach
for the value estimate of the Property. Accordingly, the Trust's 3.125 percent interest in the Property minus its
pro rata share of the Liabilities would be worth $56,500.

6. Because the fair market value of the Property Interest is less than the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring
and holding the Property Interest, the Property Interest will be sold by the Trust to Otter for the aggregate costs
of acquiring and holding the Property which totaled $61,406. The rental income received by the Prior Plan Accounts
covered any interest which might have reasonably accrued on the holding costs as well as any interest which was due
but not received under the second deed of trust loan. However, the rental income is insufficient to fully cover the
actual holding costs.

6

 Because the Prior Plan Accounts have received a complete return of capital with regard to their investment in the Limited
Partnerships, the Trust will sell the Limited Partnership Interests to Otter at their combined fair market values
of $400,508. Accordingly, the Trust will sell the Interests for an aggregate sales price of $461,914. 




7. In summary, it is represented that the transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the
Act because: (a) All terms and conditions of the Sale will be at least as favorable to the Prior Plan Accounts as those
obtainable in an arm's length transaction; (b) the Sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (c) the Prior Plan Accounts
will not be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the Sale; (d) the Prior Plan
Accounts will receive a sales price equal to the greater of the: (1) the fair market values of the Interests as determined
by qualified, independent appraisers; or (2) the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the
Interests; (e) the trustee of the Plan will determine that the Sale is appropriate for the Prior Plan Accounts and is
in the best interests of the Prior Plan Accounts and their participants and beneficiaries; (f) the Prior Plan Accounts,
prior to the Sale, will obtain the written consent of the general partner of each of the limited partnerships involved;
and (g) the other partners of such limited partnerships, as per the limited partnership agreements, will be given
the right of first refusal with respect to the Limited Partnership Interests.

(4) The proceeds of the sale are used solely to discharge the Plan's obligations to participants and beneficiaries
in connection with the termination of the Plan. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is a defined benefit pension plan, with 30 participants as of December 31, 1993. The Plan was established
in 1974 by Lucky Electric Supply, Inc. (the Employer), which is a closely-held Tennessee corporation engaged in wholesale
and retail electrical supply operations, with its place of business in Memphis, Tennessee. The trustee of the Plan
is Marylew Lewis who is a director of the Employer. 
2. In 1991, the Employer took the actions necessary to terminate the Plan, and established May 31, 1991 as the termination
date. The Employer represents that notice of intent to terminate the Plan was made to Plan participants, and was filed
with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), in accordance with the requirements of the PBGC. 
3. The sole asset in the Plan upon its termination was group annuity contract No. 03057 (the GAC) issued by Mutual Benefit
Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (Mutual Benefit). The Employer represents that Mutual Benefit was notified
of the termination of the Plan, and that Mutual Benefit acknowledged receipt of such notification in a letter to the
Employer dated July 22, 1991. Mutual Benefit also advised the Employer that effective July 16, 1991, Mutual Benefit
had been placed in a rehabilitory conservatorship (the Conservatorship) by the insurance commissioner of the State
of New Jersey (the Commissioner).

7

 The Employer represents that the Conservatorship effected a freeze on regular payments and withdrawals from Mutual
Benefits group annuity contracts, including the GAC held by the Plan. Since the Conservatorship commenced, the only
withdrawals with respect to the GAC have been to enable hardship distributions under the Plan (the Hardship Withdrawals).
The Employer represents that upon commencement of the Conservatorship on July 16, 1991, the GAC had a face value, referred
to in the terms of the GAC as ``contract value'', of $147,477.68 (the Conservatorship Face Value), consisting of total
principal deposits, plus interest at the rates guaranteed by the GAC (the Contract Rates), less previous withdrawals.
The Employer represents that a total of $37,743.55 in Hardship Withdrawals from the GAC have been made by the Plan since
the commencement of the Conservatorship. 




4. In January of 1993, the Employer received a letter from the PBGC requesting a certification that final distribution
of Plan benefits, in connection with termination of the Plan, had been accomplished. Due to the Conservatorship's
freeze on withdrawals and payments with respect to the GAC, other than the Hardship Withdrawals, the Employer has
not been able to accomplish final distribution of benefits to the Plan's participants, in accordance with requirements
of the PBGC. In order to enable the Plan to accomplish complete discharge of Plan benefit obligations and distribution
of assets in accordance with requirements of the PBGC, the Employer proposes to purchase the GAC from the Plan, and
is requesting an exemption to permit such transaction under the terms and conditions described herein. 
5. The Employer proposes a purchase price for the GAC which represents its new value as determined with reference to
the Conservatorship, as described herein. As a result of the Conservatorship, a plan of rehabilitation of Mutual
Benefit (the Rehab Plan) has been approved by the Commissioner, under which the terms of the GAC have been redefined
and restated. Under the Rehab Plan, as the holder of a Mutual Benefit group annuity contract, the Plan had the options
of ``opting out'' of the Rehab Plan, in which case the GAC would have been terminated, or ``opting in'', in which case
the GAC would be restated, redefined, and would be supported and reinsured by a consortium of life insurance companies.
By not submitting the forms necessary to ``opt out'' of the Rehab Plan, the Trustee allowed the Plan to be ``opted in''
automatically. Consequently, the GAC has been assigned a new value (the New Value) equal to 100 percent of the Conservatorship
Face Value, less subsequent Hardship Withdrawals, plus interest on this amount as follows: (a) For the period of July
16, 1991 through December 31, 1991, interest at the Contract Rates; (b) for calendar year 1992, interest an annual
rate of four percent; and (c) for calendar years 1993 and 1994, an annual rate of 3.5 percent. The Rehab Plan provides
that subsequent to 1994, the New Value will earn an annual rate of interest determined each year by the performance
of a separate account maintained by Mutual Benefit. On the basis of the foregoing, the GAC's New Value plus interest,
as of December 31, 1993, was $123,422.43. The Employer represents that the Plan is unable to withdraw its investment
in the GAC without the payment of a substantial fee, which would be assessed by Mutual Benefit under the terms of the
Rehab Plan. 
6. In accordance with the Rehab Plan's new valuation of the GAC, the Employer proposes to pay the Plan cash for the GAC
in the amount of the New Value plus all interest accrued in accordance with the Rehab Plan as of the date of the purchase.
The Employer states that such a purchase transaction will allow the Plan to substitute the GAC, which is illiquid due
to the inability to withdraw its value, for the cash assets necessary for the Plan's participants to receive the full
amount of the benefits due them under the terms of the Plan. The Employer represents that no participant will receive
less than the full value of his or her accrued benefits under the terms of the Plan. The Employer estimates that the termination
value of all Plan participants' accrued benefits as of March 31, 1995 will be $239,953.57. Commensurate with the Employer's
proposed purchase of the GAC, the Employer will make cash contributions to the Plan to supply funding for the excess
of the Plan's accrued benefit obligations over the purchase price of the GAC. 
7. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for
the following reasons: (1) The transaction enables the Plan to liquidate it sole asset, the GAC, to enable distribution
of benefits in connection with termination of the Plan; (2) The transaction is a one-time cash transaction in which
the Plan will incur no losses or expenses; (3) The Plan will receive a purchase price for the GAC equal to its New Value
plus interest through the date of sale in accordance with the Rehab Plan; and (4) All Plan participants will receive
all benefits due them under the terms of the Plan.

CNA Employees' Retirement Trust (the Trust) 
Located in Chicago, Illinois 



[Application Nos. D-9539 through D-9544] 



Proposed Exemption 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections
406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code,
by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply, effective January 17, 1992, to fifteen
past sales and purchases by the Trust of twelve issues of short-term commercial paper (the CNA Transactions), as identified
below, involving the Continental Casualty Company, the Continental Assurance Company, the Continental Assurance
Company Guaranteed Investment Fund, the Valley Forge Life Insurance Company, Valley Forge Insurance Company, and
the American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania (collectively, the CNA Companies), each of which is a party
in interest with respect to the CNA Employees' Retirement Plan (the Plan), whose assets are held by the Trust; provided
that the following conditions are satisfied: 

(A) In each of the CNA Transactions, the Trust paid no more, or received no less, than the fair market value of the commercial
paper involved in the transaction; 

(B) The CNA Transactions constituted, in the aggregate, less than four percent of all commercial 
paper transactions of the Trust during 1992; and 

(C) The CNA Companies have undertaken efforts to prevent any recurrence of direct or indirect transactions involving
the Trust and the CNA Companies, including the appointment of an independent investment manager of all the Trust's
commercial paper investments. 




Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. The Plan is a defined contribution pension plan sponsored by CNA Financial Corporation (CNAF), an Illinois public
corporation, 83 percent of the stock of which is owned by Loews Corporation. CNAF's largest wholly-owned subsidiary
is the Continental Casualty Company (Casualty), one of the largest property-casualty insurance underwriters in
the United States. Among Casualty's eleven insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the CNA Companies) are the Continental
Assurance Company (Assurance) and the American Casualty Company of Reading, Pennsylvania (ACCP). Valley Forge
Life Insurance Company (VF Life) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Assurance, and Valley Forge Insurance Company (VF
Insurance) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACCP. Assurance is a registered investment advisor under the Investment
Advisors Act of 1940, as amended. The Plan had 19,858 participants as of December 31, 1992, and total assets of approximately
$443 million as of June 30, 1993. 

2. Prior to January 2, 1992, the Plan's assets had been invested by Assurance, as Plan fiduciary, through a variety
of separate accounts, and in a participating investment contract issued by Assurance. Effective January 1, 1992,
all of the Plan's investment contracts and separate accounts were canceled and terminated, and the liquidated assets
were transferred to the CNA Employees' Retirement Trust (the Trust). Simultaneously, CNAF entered into a contract
with Assurance (the Advisory Agreement), effective January 1, 1992, under which Assurance agreed to provide investment
advice to the Trust.

8

 Among other things, Assurance agreed to supervise the composition of the Trust's portfolio continuously, and to
determine the nature and timing of changes in the portfolio and the manner of effectuating such changes, subject to
the oversight of the Trust's trustees. Assurance's responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement include the provision
of advice, information and recommendations with respect to acquisition, holding and disposition of securities
by the Trust. During 1992, two individuals who were employed by Assurance and Casualty (the Traders) had investment
discretion over commercial paper transactions of the Trust, Casualty, and the other CNA Companies. 





3. The Applicants represent that as part of an internal compliance program, Casualty's employee benefits planning
staff developed a systems program designed to detect related-party transactions involving the Trust. A trial run
of that program on May 6, 1993 detected that certain Trust transactions involved commercial paper which was purchased
by CNA Companies. Upon this discovery, further investigations were conducted by Casualty's legal staff in June 1993
to determine whether any more of the Trust's commercial paper transactions involved CNA Companies. As a result of
these voluntary investigative efforts, Casualty has determined that fifteen of the commercial paper transactions
engaged in by the Trust between January 17 and December 10, 1992 involved five of the CNA Companies (the CNA Transactions).
In response to the discovery of these transactions, the five CNA Companies involved (the Applicants) are requesting
an exemption for the CNA Transactions under the terms and conditions described herein. 

4. The CNA Transactions fall into four categories: (a) Direct Trust sales, which are direct sales by the Trust of commercial
paper to a CNA Company; (b) Indirect Trust sales through the issuer, which are sales by the Trust of commercial paper
to the issuer of the commercial paper, and the purchase by CNA Companies, on the same date and from the same issuer, of
commercial paper issued by that same issuer with the same maturity date; (c) Indirect Trust sales through dealers,
which are sales by the Trust of commercial paper to independent broker-dealers, and the purchase by CNA Companies
on the same date from the same broker-dealers of commercial paper of the same issuer and with the same maturity date;
and (d) Indirect Trust purchases through dealers, which are sales by CNA Companies of commercial paper to independent
broker-dealers, and the purchase by the Trust on the same date from the same broker-dealers of commercial paper of
the same issuer and with the same maturity date. The Applicants describe the details of the CNA Transactions as follows:


(a) Direct Trust sales: 

(1) On November 2, 1992, the Trust sold Ameritech Capital Funding commercial paper with a maturity date of November
13, 1992, principal amount $17,575,000, to Casualty for $17,558,245.17. 

(2) On November 2, 1992, the Trust sold Woolworth Corporation commercial paper with a maturity date of November 13,
1992, principal amount $17,950,000, to Casualty for $17,928,011.25.

(b) Indirect Trust sales through the issuer: 
On November 2, 1992, the Trust sold Chevron commercial paper which it had acquired on October 28, 1992, with a maturity
date of December 3, 1992 and the principal amount $65,900,000, to Chevron for $65,928,614.85,

10

 and on the same date Assurance and Casualty bought Chevron commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same
principal amount from Chevron. 





(c) Indirect Trust sales through dealers: 

(1) On January 17, 1992, the Trust sold Federal Farm Credit commercial paper, in the principal amount of $15 million
with a maturity date of January 24, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $14,988,625, and on the same date Assurance

independent broker-dealer for $14,988,654.17. 

(2) On January 31, 1992, the Trust sold Student Loan Mortgage commercial paper, in the principal amount of $24,800,000
with a maturity date of February 14, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $24,762,097.33, and on the same date
Student Loan Mortgage commercial paper with the same maturity date in a lesser principal amount was purchased from
the same independent broker-dealer for $20,693,567.08 by the Continental Assurance Company Guaranteed Investment
Fund (the G.I. Fund), which is a sub-account of a separate account maintained by Assurance. 

(3) On February 18, 1992, the Trust sold Bell Atlantic commercial paper, in the principal amount of $24,700,000 with
a maturity date of February 21, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $24,691,252.08, and on the same date the
G.I. Fund bought Bell Atlantic commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same principal amount from the
same independent broker-dealer for $24,691,355. 

(4) On November 2, 1992, the Trust sold Detroit Edison commercial paper, in the principal amount of $10 million with
a maturity date of November 23, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $9,979,466.67, and on the same date Casualty
bought Detroit Edison commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same principal amount from the same independent
broker-dealer for $9,980,722.22. 

(5) On November 18, 1992, the Trust sold Abbot Labs commercial paper, in the principal amount of $13,970,000 with a
maturity date of December 14, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $13,938,218.25, and on the same date Casualty
bought Abbott Labs commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same principal amount from the same independent
broker-dealer for $13,938,420.04. 

(6) On December 1, 1992, the Trust sold Wal-Mart commercial paper, in the principal amount of $20,645,000 with a maturity
date of December 10, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $20,628,225.94, and on the same date Casualty, VF Life,
and ACCP bought Wal-Mart commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same principal amount from the same
independent broker-dealer for $20,628,484. 

(d) Indirect Trust purchases through dealers: 

(1) On March 4, 1992, Casualty sold Unilever Capital Corporation commercial paper, in the principal amount of $17,530,000
with a maturity date of April 2, 1992, to an independent broker-dealer for $17,471,396.24, and on the same date the

(3) On December 10, 1992, VF Insurance sold GTE Corporation commercial paper, in the principal amount of $11 million
with a maturity date of January 13, 1993, to an independent broker-dealer for $10,959,275.56, and on the same date
the Trust bought GTE Corporation commercial paper with the same maturity date and in the same principal amount from
the same independent broker-dealer for $10,959,483.33. 

5. The Applicants represent that any violations of the Act attributable to the participation of CNA Companies in the
CNA Transactions resulted inadvertently and unintentionally from actions customarily taken by the Traders in effecting
commercial paper transactions. The Applicants represent that, except for three indirect Trust purchases of commercial
paper through dealers, the CNA Transactions were effected to accomplish the necessary liquidation of Trust assets
in order to satisfy the Trust's obligations arising from commitments to purchase U.S. Treasury securities or short-term
commercial paper issued by U.S. corporations. The Applicants state that in all of the CNA Transactions, the commitments
on behalf of the Trust to purchase the commercial paper or U.S. Treasury securities were made because the yields on
the obligations to be purchased were higher than those on the commercial paper which was sold. The Applicants maintain
that if the commercial paper in issue had not been sold by the Trust on the dates of the CNA Transactions, the Trust would
have foregone the incremental return on the government obligations and commercial paper to which it was committed,
and the Trust would have been required to reimburse its broker for any costs of carrying the obligations until settlement.


The Applicants represent that the three indirect Trust purchase transactions were mistakenly initiated by the Traders,
who proceeded on erroneous assumptions about the Trust's ability to engage in the transactions with the CNA Companies.
The Applicants state that the sellers in these transactions were under no obligation to sell the commercial paper
to the Trust, nor was the Trust obligated to purchase the commercial paper from the sellers. The Applicants represent
that the commercial paper involved in the Trust purchase transactions was readily tradable on the open market, and
that sellers other than the CNA Companies could readily have been located. 


The Applicants represent that as a percentage of commercial paper transactions entered into during 1992 by the Trust,
the CNA Transactions were minor. Specifically, the Applicants state that the total amount involved in the CNA Transactions
constituted only 3.15 percent of all commercial paper transactions entered into by the Trust during 1992 and only
2.52 percent of all transactions entered into by the Trust during 1992. 

6. The Applicants represent that in each of the CNA Transactions, the Trust bought or sold commercial paper on terms
which were as favorable or more favorable to the Trust as those which the Trust could have obtained in arm's-length
transactions with unrelated parties on the open market. Specifically, the Applicants represent that in the purchase
transactions, the Trust did not pay, and the CNA Companies did not receive, prices which were in excess of the fair market
value of the commercial paper purchased. Similarly, with respect to the sale transactions, the Applicants represent
that the Trust received purchase prices which were equal to or in excess of the fair market values of the commercial
paper at the time of the transactions.

11

 With respect to the Trust purchases, the Applicants also represent that the commercial paper issues involved in the
CNA Transactions were highly liquid and involved highly liquid issuers, and that none of the parties to the transactions
were under any compulsion or duress because the commercial paper involved could have been sold by and purchased by
sellers and purchasers other than the Trust and the CNA Companies. The Applicants have obtained written determinations
by independent commercial paper broker-dealers (the Independent Dealers), confirming the fair market value prices
and liquidity of the commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions. The representations of the Independent Dealers
are summarized as follows:

(a) In a letter dated December 20, 1993, William H. Honnaker III (Honnaker), vice-president of Goldman Sachs Money
Markets, L.P. (GSMM) states that after a review of the CNA Transactions, it is the opinion of GSMM that the Trust sold
and purchased the commercial paper at rates which are representative of those at which such paper would have traded
on the open market for the time periods in question between unrelated buyers and sellers, and that the Trust purchased
the commercial paper at rates which are representative of those at which such paper would have traded on the open market
for the time periods in question between unrelated buyers. With respect to the Trust purchases, in a letter dated January
14, 1994, Honnaker states that GSMM could have found a willing buyer other than the Trust to purchase the Nestles and
Unilever commercial paper if it had held or acquired such paper at the time of those transactions, and that the commercial
paper traded by Nestles and Unilever was readily tradable in the market at the time of those transactions. 

(b) In a letter dated December 2, 1993, Andrea L. Dullberg (Dullberg), a senior vice-president of Merrill Lynch Money
Markets, L.P. (MLMM) states that the prices at which the CNA Transactions were consummated were within the bid-offer
ranges for such securities on the dates involved. With respect to the Trust purchases of GTE and Unilever commercial
paper, involving MLMM as broker-dealer, Dullberg states the purchase prices were the fair market prices of the commercial
paper at the time of the transactions.

12

 In a letter dated January 5, 1994, another vice president of MLMM, John B. Sprung, states that it could have found a willing
buyer other than the Trust to purchase the GTE and Unilever commercial paper involved in the Trust purchases in which
MLMM participated as broker-dealer, and that the commercial paper issued by GTE and Unilever was readily tradable
on the open market at the times of the Trust purchases of that commercial paper. 





(c) Michael B. Connolly, vice president of Citicorp Securities, Inc., states in a letter dated January 7, 1994, that
the purchase prices in the CNA Transactions were within the bid-offer range for similar commercial paper on the dates
involved. 

(d) William D. Folland, vice president of CS First Boston Corporation, in a letter dated January 6, 1994, represents
that the prices at which the Trust purchased and sold commercial paper in the CNA Transactions were equal to or better
than the rates which such paper would have been quoted on the open market by a dealer willing to make a market in such paper.


7. In addition to the foregoing representations of the Independent Dealers, the applicants have also obtained the
opinions of an independent professional analyst of commercial paper markets, Dr. Marcia L. Stigum (Dr. Stigum).
Dr. Stigum (Ph. D. in economics, 1961, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), who is president of her money market
consulting firm in Quechee, Vermont, represents that she is independent of and unrelated to the CNA Companies, and
that she has substantial experience as an expert on commercial paper market issues. Dr. Stigum has submitted a report
containing analyses of each of the CNA Transactions and the market environments in which each one occurred. Dr. Stigum
represents that her report was prepared with the objective of addressing two questions: (1) Was the paper sold to and
bought by the Trust in each CNA Transaction readily marketable at the time of the transaction? (2) Were the CNA Transactions
consummated at fair market value? Dr. Stigum's findings detailed in her report in response to these two questions
are summarized as follows: 

(A) All twelve issues of commercial paper sold to and bought by the Trust in the CNA Transactions were unequivocally
readily marketable. Dr. Stigum states that in this context, the term ``readily marketable'' means ``highly liquid.''
She states that at any time, the original owner or subsequent owner of each issue of the commercial paper could have
sold that paper at a fair market value to the issuing dealer or, in the case of direct paper, could have obtained a prepayment
from the issuer. 

(1) Dr. Stigum notes that all issues of paper sold by the Trust to CNA Companies, except for the Chevron paper, was ``dealer
paper'' which the Trust had purchased from dealers rather than directly from the issuers. Dr. Stigum states that every
dealer in commercial paper stands ready to bid for paper issued by one of the names which that dealer sells (i.e., ``dealer
paper''), in order to make the paper sold by that dealer as liquid as possible. Dr. Stigum has determined that the Trust
could have sold to an unrelated third party, including any dealer through whom the paper of a particular name is issued,
each piece of dealer paper it sold to the CNA Companies, on the same date it sold that paper to the CNA Companies. Accordingly,
Dr. Stigum concludes that all dealer paper in the CNA Transactions was 100 percent liquid. With respect to the Chevron
paper, Dr. Stigum states that it was ``direct paper'' which the Trust purchased directly from the issuer, featuring
the ability to have the issuer prepay at any time before maturity, and that this issue of Chevron paper was and is 100
percent liquid. 

(2) Dr. Stigum states that two of the three issues of commercial paper bought by the Trust from the CNA Companies were
dealer paper which carried the top credit ratings given by Moody's and Standard & Poors, and that the third issue
of such paper carried a split rating which even conservative investors consider to be quite acceptable. Dr. Stigum
states that at no time during the period over which the commercial paper involved in the CNA Transactions matured,
or subsequently, have any one of the issuers of such paper experienced financial difficulties that either caused
the issuer's paper to be downgraded or caused the issuer to exit the commercial paper market. Dr. Stigum concludes
that the commercial paper sold by the Trust was 100 percent liquid.

(B) All of the CNA Transactions, both buys and sells, were consummated at fair market values, i.e., terms at least as
favorable to the Trust as could have been obtained in open-market transactions with unrelated parties. Dr. Stigum's
report includes an analysis of, and conclusions regarding, each of the CNA Transactions, and she represents that
her findings on each transaction demonstrate that each of the CNA Transactions was consummated at fair market value,
which she defines as ``a price (rate) at which a willing seller would have sold to a willing buyer, neither being under
any compulsion to sell or buy.'' 

In her report, Dr. Stigum explains that her determinations of the fair market values of the commercial paper involved
in the CNA Transactions were based on comparisons with LIBOR rates

13

, because time-series data on short-term commercial paper rates are not available, and short-term commercial paper
was traded during the relevant period at a relatively constant spread to LIBOR rates, on which accurate time-series
data are readily available. She states that over the time period of the CNA Transactions, commercial paper for different
maturities consistently traded at a spread below LIBOR rates for Eurodollar deposits having those same maturities.
Accordingly, for each CNA Transaction, Dr. Stigum presented and compared actual CNA Transactions data with two LIBOR
yield curves: (1) For the week of the initial purchase of the commercial paper; and (2) for the week of the subsequent
sale or purchase of such paper. She states that her determinations were also influenced by her awareness that the rates
at which secondary trades of commercial paper may be effected through a dealer depend on the name and rating of the issuer,
the rates that the issuer is posting, and the precise time of day at which the secondary trade is made. On the basis of
these factors, Dr. Stigum represents that she has judged the prices (rates) involved in the CNA Transactions to be
fair market prices if they fell within a range of five basis points above or below the rate that the data indicated to
be a fair market rate. 




8. The Applicants represent that since discovery of the CNA Transactions in May and June 1993, they have undertaken
efforts to prevent any recurrence of direct or indirect transactions between the Trust and the CNA Companies. The
Applicants state that three full-time attorneys were appointed to review all proposed CNA intercompany trades of
commercial paper, to detect any proposed transactions involving the Trust. Additionally, a memorandum describing
the prohibitions of the Act was distributed to all personnel involved in commercial paper transactions on behalf
of the Trust, the receipt of which was acknowledged in writing. The Applicants state that this memorandum will be recirculated
annually to all such investment personnel. The Applicants represent that personnel involved in the Trust's commercial
paper transactions have been directed to develop a ``real-time'' trading audit computer program which would interdict
proposed party-in-interest transactions before the trade can be accomplished. Furthermore, Assurance has entered
into an investment management agreement with Harris Investment Management, Inc. (Harris), under which Harris manages
all the Trust's commercial paper investments and approves all the Trust's commercial paper transactions, in order
to prevent any transactions involving parties related to the Trust. 

9. In summary, the Applicants represent that the CNA Transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act
for the following reasons: (a) The prices at which the Trust sold commercial paper were not less than the paper's fair
market value, and the prices at which the Trust purchased commercial paper were not in excess of the paper's fair market
value; (b) The transactions resulted from actions customarily taken by the Traders in effecting commercial paper
transactions; (c) The transactions involved a very small percentage of the Trust's total commercial paper transactions
for 1992; and (d) The Applicants have undertaken efforts to prevent any recurrence of direct or indirect transactions
involving the Trust and the CNA Companies, including the appointment of Harris as an independent investment manager
of all the Trust's commercial paper investments.

John R. Lyman Company 401(k) Profit 
Sharing Plan (the Plan) 
Located in Chicopee, Massachusetts 


[Application No. D-9759] 


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) by the Plan of Guaranteed Investment Contract CGO1303A3A
(GIC1303) and Guaranteed Investment Contract CGO1344A3A (GIC1344, collectively, the GICs) issued by Executive
Life Insurance Company (Executive Life), 
a California corporation, located in Los Angeles, California, 
to John R. Lyman Company, a Massachusetts corporation (the Employer), the sponsoring employer and a party in interest
with respect to the Plan; provided that (1) the Sale is a one-time transaction for cash; (2) the Plan experiences no
loss nor incurs any expense from the Sale; (3) the Plan receives as consideration from the Sale the greater of either
the fair market value of the GICs as determined on the date of the Sale or an amount that is equal to the total amount expended
by the Plan for the GICs at the time of acquisition, less withdrawals, plus the amount the GICs would have earned by the
date of the Sale if Executive Life had not been placed under conservatorship; and (4) any funds from the GICs in excess
of the Sale price that are received by the Employer, or its successors, from Executive Life, or its successors, after
the date of the Sale are paid to the Plan. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Employer, a Massachusetts corporation, is a closely held corporation that was established in 1906 and currently
employs approximately 186 individuals. It is located in Chicopee, Massachusetts where it is engaged primarily in
the manufacture and distribution of wiping products that include woven (textiles) and non-woven (paper and synthetic)
materials. 
2. The Plan is a defined contribution plan with individual accounts for participants that is intended to meet the qualification
requirements of sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. The Plan intends also to comply with section 404(c) of the Act
whereby participants self-direct the investments of assets in their respective individual accounts. As of January
31, 1994, the Plan had 79 participants and total assets of $499,249.87. Approximately 2.25 percent of the total assets
of the Plan, valued at $12,906.58, remain invested in the GICs for individual accounts of 19 participants of which
4 are retired. 
At the adoption of the Plan by the Employer on September 29, 1989, Edward S. Wright (president, director, and shareholder
of the Employer) and his wife, Jean C. Wright (treasurer, clerk, director, and shareholder of the Employer) were appointed
Trustees of the Plan. In their undertakings, the Trustees are authorized by the Plan to employ agents and to pay their
reasonable expenses and compensation. 
The Plan also provides that the Employer may make appointments of persons to direct and manage the Plan. In the absence
of such an appointment the Employer is the Plan Administrator and Named Fiduciary. Currently the Plan is administered
by a committee (the Committee) which consists of 11 members of which 4 members act as a quorum (the Executive Committee)
in administering daily activities of the Plan. This includes the Executive Committee selecting the optional investment
vehicles used by Plan participants in directing investments for their respective accounts. The Executive Committee
also appoints legal counsel, accountants, investment advisors, and administrators for the Plan. The Executive
Committee has currently retained Lamoriello & Company, Inc. of Warwick, Rhode Island to perform various functions
for the Plan, which include the preparation and filing of annual earnings reports and disbursing periodic reports
to participants. The Executive Committee also has retained Inside Management, Inc. of Wellesley, Massachusetts
as the current registered Investment Advisor for the Plan.

When the Employer adopted the Plan in 1989, Feingold & Feingold Insurance Agency, Inc. of Worcester, Massachusetts
(Feingold) was appointed Plan Administrator. Included in Feingold's duties, among other things, was the responsibility
to maintain books and records for the Plan, manage Plan assets, and recommend investment vehicles for Plan participants
to invest the assets of their respective accounts. Feingold submitted the GICs as one of its five recommended investment
vehicles for the Plan. The GICs were purchased from Executive Life by Feingold at the direction of the respective participants
and were held in trust by its subsidiary, Feingold Investment Planning Trust, for the benefit of the participants
in the Plan.
 GIC 1303, with 
an issue date of January 1, 1989, and a maturity date of 
December 31, 1995, was to pay an annual interest yield of 
8.95 percent until maturity. GIC 1344, with an issue date of January 1, 1990, and a maturity date of December 31, 1996,
was to pay an annual interest yield of 8.65 percent until maturity. 




As of March 31, 1991, GIC 1303 had a balance of $9,147.56, which was determined by adding its earnings of $1,165.42 to

the original price of $9,227.31 and subtracting $1,245.17 in withdrawals. The GIC 1344 was determined, as of March
31, 1991, to have a balance of $3,759.12 which was determined by the same calculation of adding its earnings of $338.20
to the original price of $3,881.30 and subtracting the withdrawals of $460.38. 

3. On April 11, 1991, the California Department of Insurance obtained a court order placing Executive Life under conservatorship
and freezing, as of March 31, 1991, the value of the GICs and their interest payments.
 The following month, First Executive Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which wholly owns Executive Life, filed
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 




On August 13, 1993, the Superior Court of California approved a Rehabilitation Plan of the Department of Insurance
of California and authorized the Insurance Commissioner for California and the successor of Executive Life, Aurora
National Life Insurance Company (Aurora), a California corporation, to implement all the provisions of the Rehabilitation
Plan. Included in the implementation was an offer of an option to every contract holder of Executive Life to continued
coverage through Aurora, or opt out of the Rehabilitation Plan and receive a reduced return over a longer extended
period of time. 
On or about February 11, 1994, Feingold, with its subsidiary holding the GICs in trust for the participants of the Plan,
elected to continue the GICs with Aurora under the Rehabilitation Plan. 
Under the Rehabilitation Plan the maturity dates of the GICs were extended to September 3, 1998, from their respective
maturity dates of December 31, 1995, and December 31, 1996. Also, under the Rehabilitation Plan the interest rates
for the GICs were reduced at various periods of time from a low of 2.68 percent to the high of 5.34 percent. 
In addition, the GICs are subject to an ongoing litigation concerning a determination of the priority of payment to
creditors of Executive Life. The application represents that no payments to the holders of the GICs are anticipated
until all possible appeals to the litigation are exhausted. The applicant represents that if the court determines
that holders of the GICs are creditors of Executive Life and not insurance policy holders, the holders of the GICs will
have little or no recovery. The applicant further represents that the GICs do not have the protection of the State Participating
Guaranty Association. 
4. In order to avoid the continued risk to the participants and beneficiaries of the Plan with investments in the GICs,
the Employer proposes to purchase the GICs from the Plan for cash in a one-time transaction with no expense to the Plan.
The Employer intends to pay the Plan the greater of either the fair market value of the GICs on the date of the Sale, or
an amount that is equal to the total funds expended by the Plan in acquiring the GICs, less withdrawals, plus the earnings
the GICs would have received to the date of the Sale if Executive Life had not been placed under conservatorship. In
addition the Employer will pay to the Plan any funds emanating from the GICs in excess of the Sale price and received
by the Employer after the date of the Sale. 
In a written statement dated September 15, 1994, Kidder, Peabody & Co., Incorporated (Kidder, Peabody) represented
that it was retained by the Employer to make an independent determination on the date of the Sale that the exact amount
of payment will be made to the Plan in accordance with the formula set forth by the Employer in its application for exemption.
Also, Kidder, Peabody represented that the payment will not be less than the fair market value of the GICs on the date
of the Sale. Both Kidder, Peabody and Merrill Lynch stated that there is no market for the GICs in written statements
dated September 15, 1994, and July 28, 1994, respectively. 
In a statement dated October 20, 1994, Feingold represents that the Sale will enable the Plan and its participants
and beneficiaries to avoid continued risk associated with holding the GICs; and the proposed Sale to the Employer
is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of the participants
and beneficiaries. 
5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because (a) the Plan will receive from the Employer in a one-time transaction cash in
an amount that is the greater of either the fair market value of the GICs or an amount that is equal to the total amount
paid by the Plan for the GICs, less any withdrawals during ownership of the GICs, plus earnings the GICs would have received
to the date of the Sale if Executive Life had not been placed under conservatorship by the Superior Court of California,
as well as, any funds from the GICs in excess of the Sale price received by the Employer subsequent to date of the Sale;
(b) the transaction will enable the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries to avoid any risk associated with
the continued holding of the GICs; (c) the Plan will not incur any losses or expenses from the proposed transaction;
and (d) the fiduciaries of the Plan have determined that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan
and its participants and beneficiaries.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete, and that each application accurately describes all material
terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicant's Representations


1. Applicant, a Massachusetts trust, is an open-end management company that may issue more than one series of shares
with each series representing a separate investment portfolio. On November 25, 1985, applicant registered under
the Act as an investment company and filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 to register shares
for two series: the Equity Series and the U.S. Government Series (currently, the U.S. Government Capital Accumulation
Series and referred to herein as the ``Accumulation Series'').
 The registration statement was declared effective on September 4, 1986, and applicant's initial public offering
commenced immediately thereafter. On April 30, 1990 and February 24, 1992, applicant filed post-effective amendments
to register shares for two new series: the U.S. Government Adjustable Rate Series (the ``Adjustable Rate Series'')
and the Oklahoma Municipal Bond, Tax Free Series (the ``Oklahoma Series''), respectively. The amendments were effective
on the date of filing and the public offering for the respective series commenced immediately thereafter.





2. During the period from 1987 to 1990, the Equity Series performed poorly and, as a result, a substantial number of
shareholders redeemed their shares. As of June 30, 1990, the Equity Series had only 12 shareholders. In addition,
applicant's investment adviser at the time, James Baker & Company (``James Baker''), determined that it would
no longer subsidize the Equity Series through reimbursements of expenses as it had done in prior years. Shareholders
were notified of this determination by letter dated October 3, 1990. As a result, all shareholders of Equity Series
other than James Baker redeemed their shares. At a shareholder meeting held on October 26, 1990, James Baker, as sole
shareholder, approved the liquidation of the Equity Series and redeemed its shares at net asset value shortly thereafter.
3. In December 1992, James Baker & Associates (the successor to James Baker and referred to herein as ``James Baker
II'') notified the Oklahoma Series board of trustees that it also would no longer subsidize the Oklahoma Series through
reimbursements of expenses. Shareholders were notified of this determination by letter dated December 12, 1992.
As a result, the public shareholders redeemed their shares at net asset value. As of February 28, 1993, James Baker
II was the sole remaining shareholder. On March 19, 1993, James Baker II voted to liquidate the series and redeemed
its shares at net asset value shortly thereafter.
4. The portfolio securities for both the Equity Series and the Oklahoma Series were liquidated at market value to fund
the public shareholders' redemptions. Accordingly, at the time of liquidation, both series no longer maintained
a portfolio of securities. No brokerage commissions were incurred with these transactions.
5. On June 29, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved termination of the Adjustable Rate Series and the Accumulation
Series and the liquidation of applicant. On September 1, 1993, applicant mailed proxy materials to the shareholders
of each series. At a joint meeting held on September 17, 1993, the shareholders of the series approved the termination
of their respective series and the liquidation of applicant.
6. Pursuant to the liquidation, the portfolio securities of the Adjustable Rate Series and the Accumulation Series,
which consisted of U.S. government or agency issued securities, were sold at market value. No brokerage commissions
were incurred in these transactions.
7. In connection with the liquidation, the Adjustable Rate Series paid approximately $2,289,463 to its redeeming
shareholders and the Accumulation Series paid approximately $14,559,895 to its redeeming shareholders. Shares
were redeemed at net asset value of the respective series.
8. James Baker II will bear all the costs for the liquidation of applicant.
9. As of the date of the application, applicant had no assets, debts or liabilities, and was not a party to any litigation
or administrative proceeding.
10. On June 30, 1994, applicant filed a notice of termination with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
which terminated its existence.

Holyoke Water Power Company (70-7495)


Holyoke Water Power Company (``HWP''), One Canal Street, Holyoke, Massachusetts 01040, an electric utility subsidiary
company of Northeast Utilities, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections
6(a) and 7 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6(a) and 7 and Rule 50(a)(5)
thereunder.
By Commission order dated November 9, 1988 (HCAR No. 24742), HWP was authorized to finance certain pollution control
facilities at its Mt. Tom Station (``Facilities''). The cost of acquiring, constructing and installing the Facilities
was financed by HWP through its use of the net proceeds from the sale by the Industrial Development Finance Authority
of the City of Holyoke, Massachusetts (``IDA'') of its pollution control revenue bonds (``Bonds'') in the principal
amount of $8 million. The Bonds were issued pursuant to an Indenture of Trust between the IDA and Baybank Middlesex,
as trustee (``Trustee''), and the proceeds of the issuance of the Bonds were loaned to HWP pursuant to a Loan Agreement
(``Loan Agreement'') between HWP and the IDA.
In order to obtain the benefits of a high quality rating for the Bonds, HWP's obligations under the Loan Agreement are
secured by an irrevocable letter of credit (``Letter of Credit'') in the amount of $8,667,000 issued by Union Bank
of Switzerland, New York Branch (``Bank'') in favor of the Trustee. The Letter of Credit secures $8 million of principal
amount plus interest in the amount of $667,000 at the maximum rate of 15% per annum for 218 days.
HWP now proposes to amend the Reimbursement and Security Agreement, dated as of November 1, 1988 between HWP and the
Bank in order to: (1) change the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, from perpetual to a three-year term ending
November 1, 1997, extendible for successive one-year terms thereafter during the term of the Loan Agreement, with
the consent of HWP and the Bank; (2) reduce the annual Letter of Credit fee payable to the Bank; and (3) extend, modify
or replace the Letter of Credit provided by the Bank, as permitted by the Loan Agreement, by delivery of a substitute
credit facility, consisting of a new letter of credit, and related agreements, to be provided by a substitute bank
to be chosen by HWP (``Substitute Bank'').
The proposed Letter of Credit fee will be changed from 0.45% of the Letter of Credit amount to 0.40% of that amount. This
represents an annual fee reduction of $4,334 per annum.
HWP proposes to extend, modify or replace the Bank's Letter of Credit with a new letter of credit (``Substitute ``LOC'')
to be issued by the same or a Substitute Bank during the term of the Bonds. The Substitute LOC would be issued under a new
letter of credit and reimbursement agreement (``New LOC Agreement'') substantially identical to the Letter of Credit
and Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of September 1, 1993 among HWP's associate company, The Connecticut Light
& Power Company, Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch and various co-agents and participating banks, as approved
by Commission order, dated September 15, 1993 (HCAR No. 25881). The New LOC Agreement will be in accordance with the
Loan Agreement and provide that: (1) the total amount available to be drawn under any such extended, modified, or replacement
letter of credit does not exceed $8,667,000; (2) the annual letter of credit costs applicable to any such extension,
modification, or replacement do not exceed 1.00% per annum of the total amount available; (3) that tender advances
bear interest until paid at a rate not to exceed the higher of (a) the prime rate plus 2.00% or (b) the federal funds rate
plus 2.00%; (4) such extension, modification, or replacement is otherwise on terms that are substantially similar
in all material respects to those applicable to the New LOC Agreement.


GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al. (70-8425)


GPU Nuclear Corporation (``GPUN''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey, 07054, a public-utility subsidiary
company of General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), a registered holding company; Energy Initiatives,
Inc. (``EII''), One Upper Pond Road, Parsippany, New Jersey, 07054, a nonutility subsidiary company of GPU; Jersey
Central Power & Light Company (``JCP&L''), 300 Madison Avenue, Morristown, New Jersey, 07960, a public-utility
subsidiary company of GPU; Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met Ed''), P.O. Box 16001, Reading, Pennsylvania, 19640;
a public-utility subsidiary company of GPU; Pennsylvania Electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street, Johnstown,
Pennsylvania, 15907, a public-utility subsidiary company of GPU; and GPU Service Corporation (``GPUS''), 100 Interpace
Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey, 07054, a nonutility subsidiary company of GPU, have filed a declaration under Section
13(b) of the Act and Rules 87, 90 and 91 thereunder.
GPUN proposes to perform a range of nonnuclear technical, training, management and consulting services (``Services'')
for GPU Service, Initiatives, JCP&L, Met Ed, and Penn Elec (``GPU Companies''),
 which include: (1) plant operations and maintenance; (2) plant inspections and risk analysis; (3) plant equipment
corrosion control and failure analysis; (4) engineering and design services; (5) plant life extension analysis;
(6) project and construction management; (7) plant modification, design, installation, evaluation and testing;
(8) environmental protection services; (9) emergency preparedness training and services; (10) quality assurance
services; (11) training programs; (12) plant management consulting and operation analysis; (13) industrial safety
and hygiene services; and (14) medical services.

GPUN intends to enter into a Non-Nuclear Technical, Training, Management and Consulting Services Agreement (``Agreement'')
with the GPU Companies to provide the Services in connection with their business operations. The Agreement will be
substantially in the form of the Laboratory Service Agreement previously filed (Exhibit A-4) in SEC File No.
70-7720.

Schedule I to the Agreement describes the types of Services that GPUN intends to furnish to the GPU Companies. Schedule
II to the Agreement, Determination of Cost of Service and Allocation Thereof, provides that any Services to be rendered
by GPUN will be charged at cost pursuant to the Act and the regulations thereunder.

Schedule II will also reflect the practice of (i) charging capital costs for providing Services to the serviced companies
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and (ii) billing to the serviced company the costs of
service before they are paid by GPUN, which is consistent with the practice that was approved by the Commission in its
letter to GPUS dated June 3, 1982. Such costs will be accounted for and billed to the GPU Companies substantially as
described in HCAR No. 25149 (Sept. 14, 1990).

The GPU Companies believe that the technical, analytical and related expertise of GPUN can be usefully applied in
support of their business activities. Providing the Services will not interfere with GPUN's primary responsibility
of operating and maintaining nuclear generating facilities of behalf of those companies. The total level of Services
GPUN will provide will not exceed ten percent of the level of primary nuclear services which it is currently providing
to the GPU Companies.

GPUN will, by May 1 each year, separately report to the Commission any revenues received from the performance of the
Services on its annual report on Form U-13-60 filed under the Act.



American Electric Power Co., et al. (70-8429)



American Electric Power Company, Inc. (``AEP''), 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a registered holding
company, and AEP Resources, Inc. (``Resources''), 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a non-utility subsidiary
company of AEP, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 32 and 33 of the Act
and Rules 45 and 53 thereunder.

AEP and Resources propose to issue and sell up to $300 million in debt and/or equity securities through June 30, 1997
to invest in two types of power projects (``Power Projects'')_exempt wholesale generators (``EWGs'') and foreign
utility companies (``FUCOs''). AEP and Resources also request approval to acquire the securities of one or more companies
(``Project Parents'') that will directly or indirectly own and hold the securities of one or more FUCOs and EWGs.

AEP proposes to guarantee the debt securities and other commitments of Resources, and AEP and Resources also propose
to guarantee the securities of one or more Project Parents or Power Projects, and for Project Parents to guarantee
the securities of their Power Projects, through June 30, 1997, in an aggregate amount which together with the securities
will not exceed $300 million.

With respect to AEP equity financing, AEP proposes to issue and sell up to 10 million additional shares (``Shares'')
of its common stock, par value $6.50 per share, which are authorized but unissued or held by AEP, provided that the gross
proceeds from such sale will not exceed $300 million. AEP proposes to effect the issuance and sale by competitive bidding,
negotiations with underwriters or agents, or agents at market prices. The Commission is requested to reserve jurisdiction
over the issuance and sale by AEP of the Shares pending completion of the record.

With respect to long-term debt financing, AEP and Resources also request authorization to issue and sell through
June 30, 1997 promissory notes (``Long-term Notes'') in the aggregate principal amount of up to $300 million to one
or more commercial banks, financial institutions or other institutions or other investors pursuant to one or more
loan agreements (``Proposed Agreement''). The Proposed Agreement and the Long-term Notes thereunder would be for
a term of not less than nine months nor more than twenty years.

The Proposed Agreement would provide that the Long-term Notes bear interest at either a fixed rate, a fluctuating
rate or some combination of fixed and fluctuating rates. Any fixed rate of interest of the Long-term Notes will not
be greater than 250 basis points above the yield at the time of issuance of the Long-term Notes of United States Treasury
obligations (``Applicable Treasury Rate''). Any fluctuating rate will not be greater than 200 basis points above
the rate of interest announced publicly by a major bank as its base or prime rate (``Prime Rate''). If the indebtedness
is denominated in the currency of a country other than the United States, the fixed or floating rate, when adjusted
for inflation in such country, will not be greater than 700 basis points over the Applicable Treasury Rate or Prime
Rate.

With respect to short-term debt financing, AEP and Resources request authorization to incur such indebtedness through
June 30, 1997 through the issuance and sale of notes to banks and, in the case of AEP, commercial paper to dealers in commercial
paper in an aggregate amount not to exceed $300 million. Borrowings under the lines of credit would generally bear
interest at an annual rate not greater than the prime commercial rate in effect from time to time. The total annual cost
of borrowings under all such bank lines is estimated to be not greater than the effective rate for borrowings bearing
interest at the prime commercial rate with compensating balances of up to 10% of the line of credit. The effective annual
interest cost under any of the above arrangements, assuming full use of the line of credit, will not exceed 125% of the
prime commercial rate in effect from time to time, or not more than 10.625% on the basis of a prime commercial rate of
8.50%.

Commercial paper will be sold directly by AEP to dealers in commercial paper. The commercial paper will be in the form
of promissory notes in denominations of not less than $50,000, and of varying maturities, with no maturity more than
270 days after the date of issue. Such notes will not be prepayable prior to maturity and will be sold at a discount rate
not to excess of the discount rate per annum prevailing at the time of issuance for commercial paper of comparable quality
and maturity.

The application-declaration states that it may be necessary from time to time for AEP to guarantee certain indebtedness
or other financial commitments of Resources, for AEP or Resources to guarantee certain indebtedness or financial
commitments of a Project Parent or Power Project in which they may invest, or for a Project Parent to guarantee certain
indebtedness or financial commitments of a FUCO or EWG in which it may invest. The terms and conditions of such guarantees
would be negotiated in individual cases, would vary in duration, and may be contingent and conditional or absolute
and unconditional. AEP and Resources request authority to issue, or have Project Parents issue, from time to time
through June 30, 1997, up to $300 million in guarantees provided that any guarantee outstanding on June 30, 1997 would
expire or terminate in accordance with its terms.

AEP will not sell any Shares and neither AEP nor Resources will incur any indebtedness or issue, or have a Project Parent
issue, any guarantee if the gross proceeds of all Shares and the principal amount of all indebtedness and all guarantees
authorized hereunder would exceed $300 million. AEP intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Shares or the
short-term or long-term indebtedness to make additional investments in Resources and direct or indirect investments
in Power Projects. Resources intends to use such funds from AEP and the net proceeds from any short-term or long-term
indebtedness to make direct or indirect investments in Power Projects.


Investments in Resources by AEP would be by acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances
and/or loans. Open account advances or loans would bear interest at a rate based on the cost of funds to AEP in effect
on the date of issue. If AEP uses the proceeds of long-term indebtedness to fund such investment, then the interest
rate will be the same as that of the term loan. If AEP uses the proceeds of short-term borrowings to fund such investment,
then the cost of such funds will be the interest rate of short-term borrowings_that is, would generally bear interest
at an annual rate not greater than the prime commercial rate in effect from time to time.

AEP and Resources request authority to make direct or indirect investments in Project Parents in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $300 million. It is proposed that investments by AEP and Resources in any Project Parent may take the form
of (i) purchases of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing,
(ii) open account advances or loans, and/or (iii) guarantees by AEP or Resources.

Open account advances or loans to a Project Parent would bear interest at a rate based on cost of funds to AEP or Resources
on the date of issue. Any open account advance or loan may be converted to a capital contribution to such Project Parent.
Funds for any open account advances or loans by AEP or Resources in any Project Parent will be derived from the sale of
common stock and/or the issuance of short-term and long-term indebtedness or guarantees and from available cash.

Approval is requested for Project Parents to issue short-term and long-term indebtedness to persons other than AEP
or Resources which would be guaranteed by AEP or Resources (``Recourse Debt''). Recourse Debt would be subject to
the same terms and conditions as indebtedness of AEP and Resources. Approval is also requested for any Project Parent
to issue equity securities and debt securities to persons other than AEP or Resources (``Non-Recourse Securities'')
exclusively for the purpose of financing investments in Exempt Subsidiaries. It is proposed that the aggregate principal
amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project Parents to persons other than AEP and Resources will not
exceed $800 million provided that no more than $200 million principal amount may be denominated in currencies other
than U.S. dollars.

Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to a person other than AEP or Resources may include capital shares,
partnership interests, trust certificates, or any of the foregoing. Non-recourse debt securities issued to persons
other than AEP or Resources may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated notes, bonds, or other
evidence of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign
currencies. The amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including interest rate, maturity, prepayment
or redemption privileges, and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would be negotiated
on a case by case basis.
However, AEP and Resources state that any note, bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project
Parent will mature not later than 30 years from the date of issuance thereof, and will bear interest, if such note, bond
or other indebtedness is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Applicable Treasury Rate,
or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Prime Rate, and, if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated
in the currency of a different country, will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted for inflation
in such country, will not exceed 10% over the Applicable Treasury Rate or Prime Rate.
The application-declaration states that AEP will not sell any Shares, and neither AEP nor Resources will incur any
indebtedness or issue, or have a Project Parent issue, any guarantee, if the gross proceeds of all outstanding Shares
and the principal amount of all such outstanding indebtedness and all such outstanding guarantees authorized hereunder
would exceed $300 million.


New England Electric System, et al. (70-8475)


New England Electric System (``NEES''), a registered holding company, and New England Electric Resources, Inc.
(``NEERI''), its wholly owned, nonutility subsidiary company, both of 25 Research Drive, Westborough, Massachusetts
01582, have filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and rule 45 thereunder.
NEERI proposes to enter into a joint arrangement with Separation Technologies, Inc. (``STI''), the developer of
a process for separating unburned carbon from coal ash. In connection with this joint arrangement, NEERI will be called
on to invest in STI projects and to provide certain consulting services to STI. Applicants-declarants state that
STI has developed a system of economically separating unburned carbon from coal (or fly) ash produced by utility generating
plants. The separated carbon can be reburned by the utility. The processed ash can be sold as a cement substitute in
the manufacture of concrete.
As part of its joint arrangement with STI, NEERI proposes to enter into a project with STI involving the processing
of coal ash at an electric generation facility in the New England/New York region (``NE/NY Project'') owned by a nonaffiliated
electric company (``Owner''). NEERI proposes to invest $700,000 in the NE/NY Project in return for a percentage of
the NE/NY Project revenue stream. In addition, NEERI will provide to STI consulting services for a fee. STI will be
responsible for processing the ash at the Owner's facility.
NEERI proposes to enter into similar joint arrangements with STI at other locations where STI equipment will be installed.
NEERI's investment in these other utility locations is anticipated to range between $0.5 and $2.0 million per installation.
NEERI and STI also propose to perform research to further refine the carbon-rich and low carbon processed waste stream
and to find other applications for the STI separation process in recycling.
NEES proposes to provide additional financing to NEERI by making capital contributions up to an additional $11.7
million and/or by lending to NEERI from time to time additional amounts not to exceed $11.7 million at any one time,
such loans to be in the form of non-interest bearing subordinated notes. The aggregate amount of all investments (including
amounts previously authorized by the Commission) by NEES in NEERI shall not exceed $13.95 million.


Louisiana Power & Light Company (70-8487)


Louisiana Power & Light Company (``LP&L''), 639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, an electric
public-utility subsidiary company of Entergy Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration
under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), and 10 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder.
LP&L proposes to issue and sell up to an aggregate principal amount of $565 million its first mortgage bonds (``Bonds'')
to be issued and sold in one or more new series from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996. Each series of Bonds will
be sold at such price, will bear interest at such rate and will mature on such date as will be determined at the time of
sale. One or more series of Bonds may include provisions for redemption or retirement prior to maturity, including
restrictions on optional redemption for a given number of years. LP&P may determine to provide an insurance policy
for the payment of the principal of and/or interest and/or premium on one or more series of Bonds.
LP&L further proposes to issue and sell, from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, one or more new series
of its preferred stock, cumulative, of either $25 par value or $100 par value (collectively, the ``Preferred'').
The total aggregate par value of shares of those new series of the Preferred issued will be up to an aggregate principal
amount of $110 million. The price, exclusive of accumulated dividends, and the dividend rate for each series of Preferred
will be determined at the time of sale. LP&L may determine that the terms of the Preferred should provide for an
adjustable dividend rate thereon to be determined on a periodic basis, subject to specified maximum and minimum rates,
rather than a fixed dividend rate. The terms of one or more series of the Preferred may include provisions for redemption,
including restrictions on optional redemption, and/or a sinking fund designed to redeem all outstanding shares
of such series not later than thirty years after the date of original issuance.
LP&L proposes to use the net proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of Bonds and/or the Preferred for general
corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the possible acquisition of certain outstanding securities.
LP&L states that it presently contemplates selling the Bonds and the Preferred either by competitive bidding,
negotiated public offering or private placement.
LP&L also proposes to enter into arrangements to finance on a tax-exempt basis certain solid waste, sewage disposal
and/or pollution control facilities (``Facilities'') at Unit No. 3 of its Waterford Steam Electric Generating Station
in the Parish of St. Charles, Louisiana (``Parish''). LP&L proposes, from time to time through December 31, 1996,
to enter into one or more installment sale agreements and supplements (``Agreement''), pursuant to which the Parish
may issue one or more series of tax-exempt revenue bonds (``Tax-Exempt Bonds'') up to an aggregate principal amount
of $65 million. The net proceeds from the sale of Tax-Exempt Bonds will be deposited by the Parish with the trustee (``Trustee'')
under one or more indentures (``Indenture'') and will be applied by the Trustee to reimburse the Company for, or to
permanently finance or refinance on a tax-exempt basis, the costs of the acquisition, construction, installation
or equipping of the Facilities.
LP&L further proposes, under the Agreement, to sell the Facilities to the Parish for cash and simultaneously
repurchase the Facilities from the Parish for a purchase price, payable on an installment basis over a period of years,
sufficient to pay the principal of, purchase price of, the premium, if any, and the interest on Tax-Exempt Bonds as
the same become due and payable. Under the Agreement, LP&L will also be obligated to pay certain fees incurred
in the transactions.

The price to be paid to the Parish for each series of Tax-Exempt Bonds and the interest rate applicable thereto will
be determined at the time of sale. The Agreement and the Indenture will provide for either a fixed interest rate or an
adjustable interest rate for each series of the Tax-Exempt Bonds. Each series may be subject to optional and mandatory
redemption and/or a mandatory cash sinking fund under which stated portions of such series would be retired at stated
times.


In order to obtain a more favorable rating and thereby improve the marketability of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, LP&L
may: (1) arrange for a letter of credit from a bank (``Bank'') in favor of the Trustee (in connection therewith, LP&L
may enter into a Reimbursement Agreement pursuant to which LP&L would agree to reimburse the Bank for amounts
drawn under the letter of credit and to pay commitment and/or letter of credit fees); (2) provide an insurance policy
for the payment of the principal of and/or interest and/or premium on one or more series of Tax-Exempt Bonds; and/or
(3) obtain authentication of one or more new series of First Mortgage Bonds (``Collateral Bonds'') to be issued under
LP&L's Mortgage on the basis of unfunded net property additions and/or previously retired First Mortgage Bonds
and delivered to the Trustee and/or the Bank to evidence and secure LP&L's obligations under the Agreement and/or
the Reimbursement Agreement, respectively.




Allegheny Power System, Inc., et al. (70-8491)




Allegheny Power System, Inc. (``Allegheny''), a registered holding company, and AYP Capital, Inc. (``AYP Capital''),
its wholly owned nonutility subsidiary, both of 12 East 49th Street, New York, New York 10017, have filed an application-declaration
under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a) and 10 of the Act and rule 45(a) thereunder.


Allegheny proposes to invest in AYP Capital up to $5 million in the form of cash contributions from time to time through
December 31, 2002. This money will fund AYP Capital's proposed acquisition, as a limited partner of up to 10% of the
interests of all limited partners in Envirotech Investment Fund I Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership
(``Envirotech Partnership''). In no event shall AYP Capital's investment be more than $5 million.


The sole general partner of the Envirotech Partnership (``General Partner'') will be Advent International Limited
Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership of which Advent International Corporation (``AIC'') is the general
partner. A key objective of the Envirotech Partnership is to make investments that will contribute to the reduction,
avoidance or sequestering of greenhouse gas emissions; help utilities and their customers handle waste by-products
more effectively or produce or manufacture goods or services more cost effectively; improve the efficiency of the
production, storage, transmission, and delivery of energy; and provide investors with attractive opportunities
relating to the evolving utility business climate which meet the above objectives.


In selecting suitable investments, the Envirotech Partnership will focus on the following technology sectors,
among others: alternate and renewable energy technologies; environmental and waste treatment technologies and
services; energy efficiency technologies, processes and services; electrotechnologies used in the reduction
of medical waste; technologies and processes promoting alternative energy for transportation; and other technologies
related to improving the generation, transmission and delivery of electricity.


The term of Envirotech Partnership shall be for 10 years from the date of the partnership agreement, subject to extension
for up to two years upon agreement of the General Partner and limited partners holding 662/3% of the combined capital
contributions of all limited partners. Subject to certain limitations set forth in the partnership agreement, the
management, operation, and implementation of policy of the Envirotech Partnership will be vested exclusively in
the General Partner. Among other powers, the General Partner shall have discretion to invest the Partnership's fund
in accordance with investment guidelines set forth in the charter. The investment guidelines may be amended or modified
only upon the affirmative vote of limited partners representing at least 75% of the commitments of all limited partners.

Entergy Corporation (70-8509)



Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, a registered holding company,
and its wholly owned nonutility subsidiary companies, Entergy Enterprises, Inc., (``Enterprises''), Three Financial
Centre, 900 South Shackleford Road, Suite 210, Little Rock, Arkansas 72211, and Entergy Systems and Service, Inc.
(``Entergy SASI''), 4740 Shelby Drive, Suite 105, Memphis, Tennessee 38118, (collectively, ``Applicants''),
have filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and rules 45 and 54 thereunder.

Pursuant to Commission order dated December 28, 1992 (HCAR No. 25718), Entergy SASI was organized as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Enterprises that would provide energy management services to commercial, industrial and institutional
customers. Such order authorized Entergy SASI to provide energy management services, without limitation, to customers
within a region consisting of the states of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi; and the service territories of utilities
from which the Entergy system could expect to purchase economy, replacement and emergency energy (``Base Region'').
The order also permitted Entergy SASI to solicit and serve customers outside the Base Region to a limited extent and
subject to the condition that at least 50% of Entergy SASI's annual revenues be derived from its activities within
the Base Region (``50% Revenue Restriction'').


The Applicants now seek additional authorization for Entergy SASI to provide consulting services related to energy
management and demand-side management (``DSM'') activities. Such consulting services would generally be limited
to the rendering of advice, know-how and management/technical services for a consulting fee in order to assist energy
customers, utilities, federal, state and foreign government entities and other customers with energy management
and/or DSM activities in cases where Entergy SASI is not directly involved in the performance of such energy management
and/or DSM services. Entergy SASI proposes to provide such consulting servies on a worldwide basis and that associated
revenues not be subject to the 50% Revenue Restriction.

Specifically, Entergy SASI's consulting services would include the following: (1) development and review of architectural,
structural and engineering drawings for energy and other resource efficiency; (2) design and specification of energy
consuming or conservation equipment, controls and systems; (3) design and marketing of intellectual property,
i.e. any process, program, technique, or computer software used to analyze energy conservation opportunities and
results; (4) general technical advice concerning the use, benefits, planning and/or administration of energy management
and/or DSM programs; and (5) general management advice and services relating to the implementation of functions,
practices and procedures incidental to the conduct of the energy management services business and/or DSM programs.

In addition, Entergy SASI proposes to provide funding to other energy management and DSM contractors to enable them
to carry out energy conservation measures. Although the precise terms of such funding arrangements will not be determined
until the time of the applicable transactions, it is anticipated that Entergy SASI will be repaid through assignments
of a portion of the monthly fees paid by customers under contracts relating to the installation of such energy conservation
measures. The Applicants state that the proposed funding arrangements will not involve the acquisition by Entergy
SASI of any promissory notes.

Finally, the Applicants request authorization for: (1) Entergy to make additional investments in Enterprises of
up to an aggregate amount of $100 million from time to time through December 31, 1997, with such investments to be made
through any combination of purchases of Enterprises' common stock and/or capital contributions to Enterprises;
(2) Enterprises to use the proceeds of such transactions to make additional investments in Entergy SASI (in the form
of equity investments and/or loans) of up to $100 million from time to time through December 31, 1997; and (3) Entergy
SASI to issue and sell to nonaffiliated third parties during the same period up to $100 million of commercial paper,
promissory notes and/or other debt securities, secured or unsecured (collectively, the ``Debt Securities).

It is proposed that the proceeds derived from Enterprises' investments, as well as any third party financing, be used
by Entergy SASI for the following purposes: (1) to repay its existing indebtedness under notes issued to Entergy;
(2) to provide financing for customer contracts and funding for the implementation of energy conservation measures
by other energy management and DSM contractors; and (3) to provide Entergy with necessary working capital in connection
with its ongoing energy management, consulting and other authorized businesses, as well as to pay for general and
administrative expenses and to provide for Entergy SASI's other capital needs.

Any loans made by Enterprises to Entergy SASI would be evidenced by promissory notes bearing an interest rate to be
determined at the time of borrowing (but in no event greater than the then prevailing prime rate, as reported by the
Wall Street Journal) and maturing no later than ten years from the date of borrowing. Where Debt Securities issued
to nonaffiliates are involved, the yield to maturity of such Debt Securities would not exceed the then current yield
to maturity on U.S. Treasury securities of comparable maturities (subject to straight line interpolation when there
is no comparable U.S. Treasury security), plus 400 basis points, and no Debt Securities would be issued for a term of
greater than thirty years. It is further proposed that any notes issued by Entergy SASI to Enterprises may, at the option
of Enterprises, be converted to capital contributions to Entergy SASI by the forgiveness of the debt represented
thereby.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes
by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.,
and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Extension of the Hedge Exemption Pilot Programs</DOCTITLE>


November 18, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 2, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''); on November 7, 1994, the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''); on November 9, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''); and on November
17, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') (each individually referred to as an ``Exchange'' and
two or more collectively referred to as ``Exchanges'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''
or ``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by
the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes


The proposed rule changes filed by the Amex and PHLX extend for six months (

i.e., 

from November 17, 1994, to May 17, 1995) the Exchanges' pilot programs for exemptions from equity position limits
for certain hedged positions.
 The proposals filed by the CBOE and the PSE extend for six months (

i.e., 

from November 17, 1994, to May 17, 1995), the Exchanges' pilot programs for position limit exemptions for certain
hedged equity option positions and certain stock index option positions.




The text of the proposals are available at the Office of the Secretary of the respective Exchanges and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organizations included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule changes. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organizations
have prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes


The Commission has previously approved pilot programs by the Amex and the PHLX providing exemptions from position
limits for certain fully hedged equity option positions.
 In addition, the Commission has previously approved pilot programs proposed by the CBOE, the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc., and the PSE providing exemptions from position limits for certain fully hedged equity option positions and/or
stock index option positions.
 Each of the pilot programs allow the underlying hedged positions to include securities that are readily convertible
into common stock.
 Under all of the pilot programs, exercise limits continue to correspond to position limits, so that investors are
allowed to exercise, during five consecutive business days, the number of option contracts set forth as the position
limit, as well as those contracts purchased pursuant to the pilot program.

<TEXT>
 

The Exchanges believe that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that they are designed to protect investors and the public interest
and to remove impediments and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchanges do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statements on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members,
Participants or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule changes were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action


The Exchanges have requested that the proposed rule changes be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes to extend the pilot programs until May 17, 1995, are consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,
and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) thereunder.
 The Commission concludes, as it did when originally approving each of the pilot programs, that providing for increased
position and exercise limits for equity options and stock index options in circumstances where those excess positions
are fully hedged with offsetting stock positions will provide greater depth and liquidity to the market and allow
investors to hedge their stock portfolios more effectively, without significantly increasing concerns regarding
intermarket manipulations or disruptions of either the options market or the underlying stock market.




The Commission also notes that before the pilot program of an Exchange can be extended or approved on a permanent basis,
that Exchange must provide the Commission with a report on the operation of its pilot program since its inception by
January 31, 1995. Specifically, an Exchange must provide the Commission details on (1) the frequency with which the
exemptions have been used; (2) the types of investors using the exemptions; (3) the size of the positions established
pursuant to the pilot program; (4) what types of convertible securities are being used to hedge positions and how frequently
the convertible securities have been used to hedge; (5) whether the Exchange has received any complaints on the operation
of the pilot program; (6) whether the Exchange has taken any disciplinary action against, or commenced any violation
of any term or condition of the pilot program; (7) the market impact, if any, of the pilot program; and (8) how the Exchange
has implemented surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the pilot program.
In addition, the Commission expects each Exchange to inform the Commission of the results of any surveillance investigations
undertaken for apparent violations of the provisions of its position limit hedge exemption rules.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the extension of the pilot programs prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to permit the continuation of the pilot programs. The Commission notes that the Exchanges have not experienced
any significant programs with the pilot programs since their inception and that the Exchanges will continue to monitor
the pilot programs to ensure that no problems arise. Finally, no adverse comments have been received by the Exchanges
or the Commission concerning the pilot programs. Based on the above, the Commission believes good cause exists to
approve the extension of the pilot programs through May 17, 1995, on an accelerated basis. Therefore, the Commission
believes that granting accelerated approval of the proposal is appropriate and consistent with sections 6 and 19(b)(2)
of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Expedited Proceedings and Offers of Settlement</DOCTITLE>



November 18, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 12, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 17.3, ``Expedited Proceeding,'' and 17.8 ``Offers of Settlement,'' to (1) specify
that the subject of an Exchange investigation must notify the CBOE staff in writing within 15 days of the date of notification
under paragraph (d), ``Notice, Statement and Access,'' of CBOE Rule 17.2, ``Complaint and Investigation'' that
he elects to proceed in an expedited manner pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.3; (2) reduce the time period during which settlement
offers may be submitted by a subject in an Exchange disciplinary matter who seeks to resolve the matter through expedited
proceedings pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.3; and (3) allow either the subject or the Exchange staff to end the negotiations
for a letter of consent at any point during the negotiations.
 If either the CBOE staff or the subject ends the negotiations, the subject will have 15 days to submit a written statement
to the BCC pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.2(d) indicating why no disciplinary action should be taken; the CBOE staff may then
bring the matter to the BCC for appropriate action. If the subject and the CBOE staff are able to agree upon a letter of
consent, the CBOE staff will submit the letter to the BCC. 





In addition, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.8, Interpretation and Policy .01, to provide that if the respondent
and the CBOE staff are unable to reach agreement on a letter of consent under CBOE Rule 17.3 then the number of days over
30 between the time when the CBOE staff receives notice of the respondent's election to proceed in an expedited manner
under CBOE Rule 17.3 and the date when either party ends the consent negotiations shall be deducted from the 120-day
period specific in CBOE Rule 17.8 (a), ``Submission of Offer,'' which provides a 120-day period within which a respondent
may submit a settlement offer to the BCC. Regardless of the amount of time spent in unsuccessful consent negotiations,
the respondent will have no less than 14 days to submit a settlement offer to the BCC pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.8(a). 

The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statement may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.




(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




Background 



Pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.2(d), prior to the time that the CBOE staff submits an investigative report to the Exchange's
BCC concerning possible disciplinary violations, the staff if required to provide a notice to the subject of the report
which sets forth the general nature of the allegations made in the report and the specific rules that appear to have
been violated (a ``Notification Letter''). CBOE Rule 17.2(d) provides further than, except when the BCC determines
that expeditious action is required, the subject of an investigative report shall have 15 days from the date of the
Notification Letter in which to submit a written statement to the BCC concerning why no disciplinary action should
be taken against a subject (a ``Notification Response''). In accordance with CBOE Rule 17.4, ``Charges,'' the CBOE
staff then submits the investigative report and the Notification Response to the BCC, and if the BCC determines that
probable cause exists for finding a disciplinary violations, a statement of charges is issued against the subject.



Upon the issuance of a statement of charges against a subject, the subject is referred to as a respondent under the Exchange's
rules.
 Pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.8(a), a respondent has 120 calendar days from the date of service of a statement of charges
in which to submit settlement offers to the BCC. However, the 120-day settlement period does not include the number
of days in excess of seven calendar days that it takes the Exchange's staff to comply with a respondent's request for
access to documents which is made properly pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.4(c), ``Access to Documents.''
 In addition, with one exception, a respondent is only entitled to submit a maximum of two settlement offers to the BCC
during the 120-day settlement period.
 Upon the expiration of the 120-day settlement period, or earlier if the BCC rejects a respondent's second settlement
offer prior to the expiration of such period, a hearing is scheduled with respect to the charges.










Notwithstanding the foregoing, CBOE Rule 17.3 sets forth an expedited proceeding process pursuant to which a subject
may seek to resolve a disciplinary matter through a letter of consent with the Exchange prior to the issuance of a statement
of charges against the subject. CBOE Rule 17.3 requires that a letter of consent contain a description of the facts,
violation, and sanction and must be agreed upon by the Exchange staff and by the respondent. In addition, CBOE Rule
17.3 requires that all such letters of consent be accepted by the BCC. If the Exchange staff and the subject are unable
to agree upon a letter of consent or if they agree upon a letter of consent and the letter is rejected by the BCC, CBOE Rule
17.3 provides that the matter shall proceed as if no letter of consent had been submitted to the BCC (

i.e, 

the BCC may decide to authorize the issuance of a statement of charges against the subject; the subject is then entitled
to submit settlement offers to the BCC pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.8 during the 120-day settlement period).

Therefore, under the Exchange's current rules, a subject who unsuccessfully attempts to resolve a disciplinary
matter through expedited proceedings is permitted to take advantage of the entire 120-day settlement period, no
matter how long the subject may have spent in the expedited proceeding process. As a result, as noted by the Exchange
and by the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') of the Commission in connection with the Division's inspection
of the Exchange's surveillance, investigative, and enforcement programs which took place last year, it is possible
for a respondent to utilize the expedited proceeding process as a means of circumventing the 120-day settlement period
limit and accordingly as a means of simply delaying the resolution of the case.





Proposal


In response to this concern, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.8 to reduce the time period during which settlement
offers may be submitted by a subject who seeks to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings, is
unable to reach an agreement with Exchange staff, and consumes over 30 days in the expedited proceeding process. Specifically,
under the proposal, the number of days in excess of 30 days that a subject spends in the expedited proceeding will be
deducted from the 120-day settlement period applicable to the subject; provided, however, that in no event will a
subject's settlement period under CBOE Rule 17.8 ever be less than 14 days.





The mechanism for limiting settlement periods will apply only to a subject who attempts to resolve a disciplinary
matter through expedited proceedings and is unable to reach an agreement with CBOE staff upon a letter of consent.
It will not apply to a subject who attempts to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings and who
reaches an agreement with CBOE staff upon a letter of consent, but finds that the agreed-upon letter of consent is not
accepted by the BCC. In addition, under this mechanism, in no event will the number of days between the time that the
expedited proceedings process is deemed to end (as described below) and the time that a subject is served with a statement
of charges be deducted from the 120-day settlement period applicable to the subject.
The proposed amendment will also refine the procedures that are applicable to expedited proceedings under CBOE Rule
17.3 in two ways. First, the proposed amendment will impose a new requirement that any subject desiring to attempt
to resolve a disciplinary matter through expedited proceedings submit a written notice of this fact to the Exchange
staff within 15 days from the date of service upon the subject of a Notification Letter. Second, the proposed amendment
will permit either the Exchange staff or the subject to declare an end to the negotiations regarding a letter of consent
and thus an end to the expedited proceeding process at any point in the consent negotiations by delivering a written
declaration to this effect to the other party. After the declaration is delivered, the subject will have 15 days to
submit a Notification Response and the Exchange staff will then be permitted to bring the matter to the BCC. Currently,
there is no provision in the CBOE's rules setting forth when a subject is deemed to enter the expedited proceeding process
or when the expedited proceeding process is deemed to end, and these new procedures will establish a start and end date
for when a subject is deemed to be in the expedited proceeding process so that the number of days that the subject spends
in the expedited proceeding process can be calculated for the purposes of CBOE Rule 17.8. 
Finally, the proposal makes certain editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rules 17.8 and 17.3 without affecting their
substance.
The CBOE believes that the proposal will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Exchange's disciplinary
process. Specifically, the Exchange believes that by limiting the settlement period applicable to those subjects
who consume over 30 days in the expedited proceeding process but cannot reach an agreement with the Exchange staff
upon a letter of consent, the proposed changes will minimize opportunities for delay and thereby help to preserve
evidence and the memories of witnesses.

The CBOE believes that the proposal is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and further the objectives
of section 6(b)(1) and 6(b)(6), in particular, in that it promotes appropriate disciplinary processes and enables
the Exchange to efficiently enforce compliance with its rules and federal securities laws.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by December 19, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change
by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS'')</DOCTITLE>


November 18, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 21, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which items have been prepared by the NYSE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NYSE proposes to amend its listing standards for equity-linked debt securities (``ELDS'') contained in Paragraph
703.21 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual'') to provide for greater flexibility in the listing of
ELDS. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NYSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


ELDS are intermediate-term, debt securities of an issuer where the value of the debt is based, at least in part, on the
value of another issuer's common stock or non-convertible preferred stock.
 The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide alternative market capitalization and trading volume criteria
for the linked security, that is, the security on which the value of the ELDS is based. Specifically, the proposed rule
change will add the following alternative standard for securities that can be linked to an ELDS: (1) market capitalization
of at least $500 million; and (2) annual U.S. trading volume for the one-year period prior to the listing of the ELDS
of at least 80 million shares.
 Paragraph 703.21 will also be amended to provide flexibility for the listing of issues of ELDS in cases where the linked
security does not meet the specified capitalization and trading volume criteria provided in Paragraph 703.21 of
the Manual, provided the staff of the Commission concurs with the listings.





Finally, the proposed rule change amends existing language in Paragraph 703.21 regarding the listing of ELDS that
represent more than the specified maximum percentages of the outstanding shares of the linked security.
 The amended language parallels the language discussed above regarding the ability of the Exchange to list ELDS that
do not meet the specific capitalization and trading volume standards, 

i.e.,

 an ELDS linked to more than the maximum specified percentages of the outstanding shares of the linked security could
be listed provided that the NYSE, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, determines that the listing
is appropriate.






The NYSE believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives
of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market and a national market system.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NYSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were either solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The NYSE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) of the Act
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed
change does not raise any significant regulatory issues that were not addressed in the Commission's approval orders
regarding ELDS.
 The Commission finds that the proposal to add an additional market capitalization and trading volume requirement
for eligible linked securities will expand the number of securities that can be linked to an ELDS while maintaining
the requirement that the linked security be an actively traded common stock or sponsored ADR issued by a highly capitalized
issuer. While the proposal introduces a third alternative for ELDS eligibility that reduces the minimum market capitalization
requirement for the linked security, the stock of such an issuer (or sponsored ADR related thereto) could only be linked
to an ELDS issue if its trading volume in the U.S. for the prior one-year period is at least 80 million shares, which is
four times higher than the current minimum trading volume requirement.
 The Commission believes that together, the new capitalization and trading volume requirements will continue to
ensure that ELDS are only issued on highly liquid securities of broadly capitalized companies and that these requirements
will reduce the likelihood of any adverse market impact on the securities underlying ELDS.






Additionally, allowing the NYSE, subject to the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to approve an issue of
ELDS that either does not satisfy one of the existing requirements regarding market capitalization and trading volume
merely adds flexibility to the proposed rule change. The Commission believes that this portion of the proposal does
not raise any regulatory concerns, particularly given the requirement of obtaining the concurrence of the staff
of the Commission prior to listing.





Moreover, as stated above, amending the language of Paragraph 703.21 to state that the concurrence of the staff of
the Commission is required prior to listing an ELDS linked to greater than the maximum specified percentages of the
outstanding shares of the linked security merely clarifies the intent of the language currently contained in Paragraph
703.21.
 Accordingly, this portion of the proposal raises no new regulatory concerns.




The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to allow the Exchange to begin listing ELDS satisfying the revised listing standards described herein without
delay. For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal does not raise any significant
regulatory issues. Additionally, the changes proposed herein are substantively the same as amendments recently
approved by the Commission for the listing of equity linked debt by the American Stock Exchange, Inc.,
 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
 and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc,
 for which no comments have been received by the Commission.






For the above reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 19(b)(2)
 of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.




IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change.
Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written
statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications
relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from
the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File Number SR-NYSE-94-37
and should be submitted by December 19, 1994.


It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-94-37) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.
Relating to the Reporting by the Exchange to the Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') of Information Concerning
Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceedings</DOCTITLE>



November 18, 1994.



On September 15, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change requiring
the CBOE to report information concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings to the Central Registration
Depository (``CRD'').
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the CBOE proposal.








Currently, the Exchange discloses to the CRD information with respect to formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings
only upon the conclusion of such proceedings.
 Under the proposed rule change, the amount of information concerning formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings
 reported by the Exchange to the CRD would be expanded to include the issuance of a statement of charges in such proceedings
and all significant changes
 in the status of such proceedings while such proceedings are pending. For purposes of Rule 17.14, a formal Exchange
disciplinary proceeding would be considered to be pending from the time that a statement of charges is issued in the
proceeding
 until the outcome of the proceeding becomes final.








In addition to the foregoing, the proposed rule change would renumber the provisions which are currently contained
in Rule 17.12 (Miscellaneous Provisions) without affecting the substance of these provisions. Specifically, under
the proposed rule change, the current provisions of Rule 17.12 would be separated into two rules, Rule 17.12 and Rule
17.13.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.





In the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Penny Stock Reform Act''), Congress
mandated that the NASD establish its 800 number service for the purpose of receiving and responding to inquiries from
the public regarding the background of NASD members and their associated persons.
 As initially implemented, a caller using the 800 number service could request a written report from the NASD with the
following information contained in the CRD:
 past and present employment history of NASD members and their associated persons; all final disciplinary actions,
 taken by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs, that relate to securities or commodities transactions;
and all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U-4.







In 1993, the Commission approved a rule change by the NASD to expand the scope of information that is reportable through
its 800 number service.
 Thus, in addition to the information set forth above, the NASD may disclose to the public such events as pending formal
disciplinary actions initiated by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs; criminal indictments or informations;
civil judgments; and certain arbitration awards in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers.
Currently, the NASD relies on members and associated persons to report these events to the CRD on form BD or Form U-4,
respectively.
 Because this represents the only means by which the NASD can obtain data about pending disciplinary actions (other
than its own), the quality of the CRD database, and thus of the 800 number service, depends on complete and timely reporting
by members and associated persons.






As stated in the NYSE and CHX Approval Orders,
 the proposed rule change should help fill a potential gap in the NASD's 800 number service by authorizing the Exchange
to report directly to the CRD the initiation of a formal CBOE disciplinary proceeding and significant changes in the
status thereof. As a result, that information will be available to the public whether or not it is voluntarily reported
by the member or associated person. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change should enhance the
fairness and accuracy of the CRD database and, accordingly, of information released to the public through the 800
number service.

The Commission has long believed that investors need access to reliable information in order to protect themselves
against potential fraud and abuse. In this respect, the CBOE proposal should help customers make an informed decision
about whether they should conduct or continue to conduct business with particular securities professionals. In
sum, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should increase the flow of information to the public
and thus should ultimately strengthen investor protection.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-94-33) is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement; Berkeley and Jefferson Counties, West Virginia</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revised notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement being prepared for the
proposed highway project in Berkeley and Jefferson Counties, West Virginia, has revised project limits.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the West Virginia Department of Highways (WVDOH), will prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve West Virginia Route 9 (WV 9) between Charles Town and Martinsburg. The improvement
as previously proposed would provide a four-lane controlled access roadway for WV 9 from the existing Charles Town
Bypass to just east of South Queen Street in Martinsburg. The improvement as currently proposed reduces the project
limit by 0.92 mile on the eastern terminus so that a four-lane controlled access roadway would be provided from the
existing Charles Town Bypass to Berkeley County Route 9/36 (Grapevine Road). This 0.92 mile section between South
Queen Street and Grapevine Road will be considered as a separate project in order to address current unacceptable
access and safety problems associated with that section.



Improvements to the WV 9 corridor between Charles Town and Martinsburg are considered to adequately provide for a
safe and efficient transportation system to serve the existing and future transportation needs of the area and to
sustain and encourage local and regional economic development. Alternatives under consideration for the environmental
impact statement include (1) No Build; (2) widening portions of the existing two-lane highway to four lanes; and (3)
constructing a four-lane, controlled access highway along new alignment.

Informational public meetings were held February 18, 1992 in Charles Town and February 19, 1992 in Martinsburg to
present preliminary information and solicit questions, comments and concerns. The previous Notice of Intent appeared
in the 

Federal Register

 June 1, 1992. The scoping meeting was held October 21, 1992 with participants from federal, state, and local agencies
in attendance. A public workshop was held November 3, 1993 and a public meeting on December 21, 1993, both in Kearneysville
to present updated information and continue the public involvement process. The pre-draft EIS was circulated to
federal, state, and county agencies January 1994. The draft EIS is not yet available for public circulation. A section
106/public meeting was held June 29, 1994 in Martinsburg to present current information and solicit additional information
regarding history and archaeology in the area. Additional meetings and hearings will be scheduled when a draft EIS
is available for circulation. Notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearings. A public hearing
for the 0.92 mile section as a separate project was held August 11, 1994. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided.

ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared for a proposed
highway project in Greene County, Pennsylvania.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PADOT), will prepare an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for improvement of a portion of U.S. Route 19 (U.S. 19). This section of U.S. 19 is located in
the community of Morrisville in Franklin Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania. Generally, U.S. 19 is a north-south
roadway, but through the project area travels east-west. The limits of the proposed project will be from the Waynesburg
borough line eastward to the intersection of U.S. 19 and S.R. 0021, having a total length of approximately 3244 feet.
The project area is bordered by the south fork of Tenmile Creek to the north and Morris Street (T-541) to the south.
Improvements in the study area are considered necessary to adequately provide for a safe and efficient transportation
system to serve the existing and future transportation needs of the project area.


A phased approach will be utilized to complete the preliminary design studies for this proposed highway project.
Included in the first phase of the preliminary engineering and environmental studies will be a detailed needs analysis,
an environmental overview, and a preliminary alternatives analysis. The second and final phase will include a detailed
environmental analysis of alternatives which are recommended for further study as a result of the first phase studies.

Alternatives under consideration will include but are not limited to: (1) Taking no action; (2) Transportation System
Management (TSM) improvements to the existing U.S. 19, (3) upgrading existing U.S. 19; (4) two-lane relocation to
the northern side of U.S. 19; and (5) two-lane relocation to the southern side of U.S. 19. Additional alternatives
may be evaluated based on the findings and recommendations of the Phase 1 studies and public agency involvement process.
Design variations of grade and alignment will be incorporated and studied with the various build alternatives.


During the preparation of the EIS, the following subject areas will be investigated: traffic, air quality; noise
and vibration; surface water resources; aquatic environments; floodplains, groundwater; soils and geology; wetlands;
vegetation and wildlife; endangered species; agricultural lands assessment; visual; socioeconomics and land
use; construction impacts; energy; municipal, industrial, and hazardous waste facilities; historic and archaeological
structures and sites; Section 4(f) evaluation; wild and scenic rivers; natural and wild areas and national natural
landmarks.


Information describing the proposed action and study process (EIS Plan of Study) will be sent to appropriate federal,
state, and local agencies and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to
have interest in this project to solicit comments. A series of public meetings will be held in the area. Public notices
of the time and place of these meetings and any required public hearings will be given in a timely fashion. The Draft
EIS will be available for agency and public review and comment prior to the public hearing. Public involvement and
interagency coordination will be maintained throughout both phases of the study process. A formal scoping meeting
will be held upon request.
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning the proposed
action should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a draft policy on its development and use of standards with respect
to international harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines. Specifically, the draft policy is intended
to address the conditions under which FDA participates with standards bodies outside of FDA, domestic or international,
in the development of standards applicable to products regulated by FDA. The policy also covers the conditions under
which FDA uses the resultant standards, or other available domestic or international standards, in fulfilling its
statutory mandates for safeguarding the public health.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




The text of the draft policy follows:


International Harmonization of Regulatory Requirements and Guidelines


I. Background


The purpose of this document is to articulate FDA's policy on development and use of standards with respect to international
harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines. As used throughout this document, the term ``standards''
includes what are commonly referred to as ``consensus standards,'' ``voluntary standards,'' and ``industry standards.''
Also, FDA sometimes adopts standards, making them mandatory regulatory requirements. Although the draft policy
focuses on international harmonization and international standards, its principles are applicable as well to domestic
standards activities in which FDA participates. 


A. Statutory Mandates for FDA-Regulated Products 


FDA is the principal regulatory agency within the Public Health Service (PHS). The agency protects the public health
by, among other things, implementing statutory provisions designed to ensure that food is safe and otherwise not
adulterated or misbranded; that human and veterinary drugs, human biological products, and medical devices are
safe and effective; that cosmetics are safe; and that electronic product radiation is properly controlled. FDA-regulated
products must be truthfully and accurately labeled and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The
statutory mandates for safeguarding the public health in these product sectors are prescribed in several statutes,
notably in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Public Health Service Act; and the Fair Packaging and Labeling
Act.


B. International Harmonization of Regulatory Requirements


In recent decades, great changes in the world economy, together with expanded working relationships of regulatory
agencies around the globe, have resulted in increased interest in international harmonization of regulatory requirements.
Increased international commerce, opportunities to enhance public health through cooperative endeavors, and
scarcity of government resources for regulation have resulted in efforts by the regulatory agencies of different
nations to work together on standards and harmonize their regulatory requirements. Such harmonization enhances
public health protection and improves government efficiencies by reducing both unwarranted contradictory regulatory
requirements and redundant applications of similar requirements by multiple regulatory bodies. Harmonization
facilitates cooperation in regulatory activities.
In 1991, the FDA Task Force on International Harmonization was formed to provide a broad assessment of the goals, scope,
and direction of FDA's international harmonization activities. These activities were found to comprise a wide variety
of efforts by FDA to retain and strengthen its public health safeguards, while trying to reach common ground with its
foreign government counterparts on product standards, criteria for the assessment of test data, and enforcement
procedures. Based on these findings, the task force, in its report of December 1992, formulated a number of recommendations
for the agency, including an overall policy with goals and general principles. As reflected in that report, the FDA
policy on international harmonization is: ``* * * to encourage the initiation and support of efforts, consistent
with the goals and principles below, that will further the international harmonization of standards and policies
for the regulation of products for which FDA has authority.''


1. Goals 


FDA's goals in participating in international harmonization activities are:


f

 To safeguard U.S. public health,


f

 To assure that consumer protection standards and requirements are met,


f

 To facilitate the availability of safe and effective products,


f

 To develop and utilize product standards and other requirements more effectively, and


f

 To minimize or eliminate inconsistent standards internationally.


2. General Principles


FDA participation in international harmonization should be guided by the following general principles:


f

 The harmonization activity should be consistent with U.S. Government policies and procedures and should promote
U.S. interests with foreign countries. 


f

 The harmonization activity should further FDA's mission to protect the public health by, among other things, ensuring
that food is safe and otherwise not adulterated or misbranded; that human and veterinary drugs, human biological
products, and medical devices are safe and effective as required by law; that cosmetics are safe; and that electronic
product radiation is properly controlled; and that these products are labeled truthfully and informatively.


f

 FDA's input into international standard setting activities should be open to public scrutiny and provide the opportunity
for the consideration of views of all parties concerned.


f

 FDA should accept, where legally permissible, the equivalent standards, compliance activities, and enforcement
programs of other countries, provided that FDA is satisfied such standards, activities, and programs meet FDA's
goals.


f

 Scientific and regulatory information and knowledge should be exchanged with foreign government officials, to
the extent possible within legal constraints, to expedite the approval of products and protect public health.
Thus, the agency's primary goal in all of its international harmonization activities is to preserve and enhance its
ability to accomplish its public health mission. Global harmonization is also approached with the aim of enhancing
regulatory effectiveness, by providing more consumer protection with scarce government resources, and increasing
worldwide consumer access to safe, effective, and high quality products. 


C. Other Obligations and Policies


1. International Agreements 


The U.S. Government is a party to international trade agreements. In the United States, such trade agreements become
effective only after implementing legislation is signed into law. FDA has participated in recent international
trade negotiations to ensure that FDA's requirements are preserved and the regulatory practices can remain focused
on fulfilling the agency's mission to protect the public health while being supportive of emerging, broader U.S.
Government obligations and policies.
The principal international trade agreement is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which entered
into force on January 1, 1948. GATT has since been amended several times following negotiation sessions known as rounds.

The GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), popularly known as the Standards Code, was negotiated during
the Tokyo Round of the GATT in the 1970's and entered into force on January 1, 1980. As part of a general effort to reduce
unnecessary nontariff barriers to trade, the TBT agreement was intended to promote use by countries of standards,
technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures that have been developed by international standard
bodies. To assure that such harmonization would not result in lowering safety or quality standards for U.S. consumers,
the implementing legislation for the TBT agreement, provided in the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39;
19 U.S.C 2531-2582), provides additional authority for FDA's international standards activity and contains
the safeguard that:
``* * * No standard-related activity of any private person, Federal agency, or State agency shall be deemed to constitute
an unnecessary obstacle to the foreign commerce of the United States if the demonstrable purpose of the standards-related
activity is to achieve a legitimate domestic objective including, but not limited to, the protection of legitimate
health or safety, essential security, environmental, or consumer interests and if such activity does not operate
to exclude imported products which fully meet the objective of such activity.''
The most recent GATT round, the Uruguay Round, was concluded on December 15, 1993, and was formally signed at the Marrakech
Ministerial Meeting on April 15, 1994. Congressional consideration of the legislation to implement the Uruguay
Round is now occurring.
One of the agreements of the Uruguay Round, the new GATT agreement on TBT, is similar in many respects to the 1980 TBT
agreement. As with the 1980 TBT agreement, the purpose of the new TBT agreement is to ensure that product standards,
technical regulations, and related procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. The new World Trade
Organization (WTO) will administer the new TBT agreement, and every country that is a member of the WTO will be required
to adhere to it. 
The new TBT agreement ensures, and clearly states, that each country has the right to establish and maintain technical
regulations for the protection of human, animal, and plant life, and health of the environment and for prevention
against deceptive practices. The new TBT agreement provides that each country may determine its appropriate level
of protection and ensures that the encouragement to use international standards as the bases for technical regulations
will not result in ``downward harmonization.''
In the new TBT agreement, the term ``standard'' is defined as: 
``[A] document approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics
for products or related processes and production methods, 

with which compliance is not mandatory

 (emphasis added). It may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling
requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method.''
Also, ``technical regulation'' is defined as: 
``[A] document which lays down product characteristics or their related processes and production methods, including
applicable administrative provisions, 

with which compliance is mandatory

 (emphasis added). It may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking, or labelling
requirements as they apply to a product, process or production method.''
Thus, in the language of the new TBT agreement, when a government acts to adopt a voluntary standard to make it mandatory,
the resulting document is a technical regulation. A measure used to ascertain compliance with a standard or technical
regulation is a conformity assessment procedure. 
The new TBT agreement continues and strengthens the reference to international standards found in the 1980 TBT agreement.
Specifically, the agreement states that, where technical regulations are required and relevant international
standards exist or their completion is imminent, WTO-member countries shall use them, or the relevant parts of them,
as a basis for their technical regulations, except when such international standards or relevant parts would be an
ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfillment of the legitimate objectives pursued. Further, the agreement
states that with a view towards harmonizing technical regulations on as wide a basis as possible, WTO-member countries
shall play a full part within the limits of their resources in the preparation by appropriate international standards
bodies of international standards for products for which they either have adopted or expect to adopt technical regulations.
Another agreement of the Uruguay Round is the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
(SPS). SPS pertains to those measures intended: (1) To protect animal or plant life or health within a territory from
risks arising from the entry, establishment, or spread of pests, diseases, disease carrying organisms, or disease
causing organisms; (2) to protect human or animal life or health within a territory from risks arising from additives,
contaminants, toxins, or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages, or feedstuffs; (3) to protect human life
or health within a territory from risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants, or products thereof, or
from entry, establishment, or spread of pests; or (4) to prevent or limit other damage within a territory from the entry,
establishment, or spread of pests. The SPS agreement like the new TBT agreement encourages use of international standards.
The SPS agreement refers specifically to standards established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, as discussed
below.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) also contains TBT and SPS agreements similar to those in the new GATT
agreements to be administered by WTO.


2. Internal U.S. Government


The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in its revision to OMB Circular No. A-119 (58 FR 57643,
October 26, 1993), provides policy on Federal use of standards and agency participation in voluntary standards bodies
and standards-developing groups:
``It is the policy of the Federal Government in its procurement and regulatory activities to:
a. Rely on voluntary standards, both domestic and international, whenever feasible and consistent with the law and
regulation pursuant to law;
b. Participate in voluntary standards bodies when such participation is in the public interest and is compatible
with agencies' missions, authorities, priorities, and budget resources; and 
c. Coordinate agency participation in voluntary standards bodies so that: (1) The most effective use is made of agency
resources and representatives; and (2) the views expressed by such representatives are in the public interest and,
as a minimum, do not conflict with the interests and established views of the agencies.''
OMB Circular No. A-119 also establishes additional policy guidance and responsibilities for U.S. Government
agencies. It is applicable to all executive agency participation in voluntary standards activities, domestic and
international, but not to activities carried out pursuant to treaties and international standardization agreements.
The term ``standard,'' as defined in OMB Circular No. A-119, means:
``* * * a prescribed set of rules, conditions, or requirements concerned with the definition of terms; classification
of components; delineation of procedures; specification of dimensions, materials, performance, design, or operations;
measurement of quality and quantity in describing materials, products, systems, services, or practices; or descriptions
of fit and measurement of size.''
The circular defines ``voluntary standards'' as:
``* * * established generally by private sector bodies, both domestic and international, and are available for use
by any person or organization, private or governmental. The term voluntary standard includes what are commonly referred
to as ``industry standards'' as well as ``consensus standards,'' but does not include professional standards of
personal conduct, institutional codes of ethics, private standards of individual firms, or standards mandated
by law, such as those contained in the United States Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary, as referenced in 21 U.S.C.
351.''
These definitions in OMB Circular No. A-119 conform to common usage and are consistent with the usage of these
terms throughout this policy document. It should be noted that under the TBT, ``standards'' are considered to be nonmandatory
(i.e., voluntary) unless promulgated into mandatory technical regulations. 


II. Standards Programs and Practices Within FDA


A. Purpose of FDA Involvement in Standards


The central purpose of FDA involvement in the development and use of standards is to assist the agency in fulfilling
its public health, regulatory missions. The agency intends to participate in the development of standards, domestic
or international, and adopt or use standards when such action will enhance its ability to protect consumers and the
effectiveness or efficiency of its regulatory efforts. In doing so, FDA recognizes that standards often serve as
useful adjuncts to agency regulatory controls and that economies of time and human resources are often realized in
solving problems when consensus-building activities are undertaken and conducted in open, public arenas. The working
together of FDA staff with other professionals outside the agency in standards bodies effectively multiplies the
technical resources available to FDA. Further, standards bodies generally have in place procedures for periodically
reviewing and updating completed standards, thus extending the resource-multiplier effect, as well as keeping
the solutions current with the state of knowledge. The economy of effort translates into monetary savings to the agency,
regulated industries, and ultimately consumers. Further, using standards, especially international ones, is
a means to facilitate the harmonization of FDA regulatory requirements with those of foreign governments, to better
serve domestic and global public health.
Another benefit of participating in the development of standards at both domestic and international levels is that
in sharing technical information with technical groups and professionals outside FDA, staff members have opportunities
to learn of other viewpoints on an issue, to establish scientific leadership, and to remain informed of state-of-the-art
science and technology.


B. Past and Present Activities


FDA has been involved in standards activities for many years, and in June 1977 the agency promulgated a final regulation
at 21 CFR 10.95 ( 10.95) covering the participation by FDA employees in standards-setting activities outside
the agency. This regulation encourages FDA participation in standards setting activities that are in the public
interest and specifies the respective circumstances under which FDA employees can participate in various types
of standards bodies.
Standards activities of multilateral organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are often important to FDA and frequently involve multiple product
types. For example, OECD is developing Genetic Toxicology Test Guidelines that are of interest to all FDA Centers.
Similarly, guidelines developed under the International Programme on Chemical Safety of the WHO relate to chemicals
that may be in a wide variety of FDA-regulated products, such as food additives, pesticides, drugs, animal drugs,
biologics, and devices.


1. Foods and Veterinary Medicine


FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) and Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) actively participate
in the development of international standards by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex). Codex is an international
organization formed in 1962 to facilitate world trade in foods and to promote consumer protection. It is a subsidiary
of two United Nations groups, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Codex standards cover products such as food commodities, food additives, food contaminants, and residues of veterinary
drugs in food. FDA officials chair two Codex committees, the Food Hygiene Committee and the Residues of Veterinary
Drugs in Foods Committee, and participate in many others. Through its involvement, FDA has been influential in the
establishment of a number of Codex standards. FDA's procedures for reviewing Codex standards for purposes of regulation
are codified in 21 CFR 130.6.
In 1988, the governments of the United States and Canada entered into the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (now largely
superseded by NAFTA). Since then, officials from CFSAN and CVM have participated in technical working groups responsible
for implementation of the chapter of the agreement that deals with agriculture, food, beverage, and related goods
(the CUSFTA Groups).
Officials from CFSAN and CVM also participate in the development of standards by such domestic and international
groups as the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC), the Association of Official Analytical Chemists International (AOAC),
expert committees of the WHO, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and other international
consensus standards bodies. Standards developed by these organizations are used by industry, both in the United
States and abroad. These standards provide industry with guidance for food grade materials and processes, and thus
help elevate the quality of food and food chemicals in domestic and international trade. 
CFSAN has adopted many FCC and ASTM standards and AOAC methods, incorporating them into regulations for both food
additives and generally recognized as safe food ingredients. CFSAN also refers industry to relevant FCC, Codex,
or ASTM standards when discussing particular issues related to good manufacturing practices. CFSAN accepts many
AOAC and equivalent methods for use by laboratories in assaying food and in testing for contaminants in food.
CVM accepts many AOAC and equivalent methods for use by laboratories in testing for drug residues in animal tissues.
CVM also is working towards harmonizing its approach to the development of standards for drug residues in animal tissues
with those of Codex.


2. Biologics and Drugs


There has been active international standard setting for biological products for more than 50 years. Officials from
FDA's Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) serve as experts or members of a variety of international
committees which perform standard-setting functions. Activities have encompassed collaborative studies to establish
international units of measure and to develop internationally accepted standards and requirements for control
of biologics, including WHO requirements. Efforts have been directed to many kinds of biological products, including
vaccines, human blood and plasma products, blood testing reagents, and allergenic extracts, and have extended to
biotechnology-derived growth factors, cytokines, and monoclonal antibody products.
FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), CBER, and the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR)
actively participate in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration
of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). This ongoing project begun in 1989 has been undertaken by governmental agencies
responsible for regulation of drugs and by industry trade organizations from the European Union (EU), Japan, and
the United States. Specifically, ICH is sponsored jointly by the Commission of the European Communities (CEC), the
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW), FDA, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries' Associations
(EFPIA), the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
Association (PhMA) of the United States. In addition, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Associations (IFPMA) participates as an umbrella organization for the pharmaceutical industry and provides the
secretariat function for ICH, which operates under the direction of the ICH Steering Committee. The Steering Committee
is comprised of representatives of these organizations. Official observer status has been given to WHO, the European
Free Trade Area (EFTA), and the Health Protection Branch of Canada.
The purposes of ICH are to: (1) Provide a forum for a dialogue between regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry
on differences in the technical requirements for product registration (i.e., requirements for product marketing)
in the EU, Japan, and the United States; (2) identify areas where modifications in technical requirements or greater
mutual acceptance of research and development procedures could lead to more efficient use of human, animal, and material
resources without compromising safety, quality, and efficacy; and (3) make recommendations of practical ways to
achieve greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements
for registration. The work products of ICH, created in working groups of experts from the regulatory agencies and
industry, consist of a series of consensus guidance documents. These guidance documents, after successive ICH steps
of review and acceptance, including an opportunity for public review and comment in the respective jurisdictions,
are forwarded to the regulatory agencies with the expectation that they will be formally adopted by the agencies.
Officials from both CBER and CDER also participate in a consensus standard setting activity sponsored by the Council
for International Organizations
