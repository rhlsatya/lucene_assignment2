with the applicant's proposal; a minor upgrade; decommissioning the project; and the no action alternative.


The public meeting on the Snoqualmie Falls Project, which will be recorded by an official stenographer, is scheduled
from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on Thursday, December 15, 1994. The meeting will be held at the Mount Si High School in Snoqualmie,
Washington.

2. Southern Natural Gas Company



[Docket No. CP94-682-001]



Take notice that on November 14, 1994, pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), as amended, and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) Regulations (18 CFR Section 157.6), Southern Natural Gas Company
(Applicant), P.O. Box 2563, Birmingham, Alabama 35202, filed an amendment to its original application for certificate
of public convenience and necessity filed in Docket No. CP94-682-000.

In its original application in Docket No. CP94-682-000, Applicant had requested authorization to construct,
install and operate approximately 21 miles of 12-inch pipeline and the necessary measurement facilities to connect
Applicant's system at or near mile post 101.44 on its Chattanooga Branch Line in Catoosa County, Georgia, with the
facilities of East Tennessee Natural Gas Company in Bradley County, Tennessee. The total cost of the facilities was
estimated to be $6,951,000. The facilities were proposed to serve 11 municipal and distribution customers (Customers)
in Eastern Tennessee with firm transportation under Applicant's Rate Schedule FT.

Specifically, Applicant states that because of the execution of service agreements for firm transportation by several
of its existing customers, Applicant has determined that it requires additional compression on its North Main Lines
to provide the full firm subscription requested by the Customers of 11,350 Mcf per day. Accordingly, Applicant requests
in the amendment authorization to construct, install and operate an additional turbine compressor engine of 1,452
horsepower isometrically rated at 59 degrees fahrenheit at its existing McConnells Compressor Station (McConnells)
located in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. In addition, Applicant plans to modify the compressor wheel assemblies of
the two existing 1,360 horsepower turbine compressor engines at McConnells. The total horsepower at McConnells
upon installation of the proposed turbine engine would be 6,872. The cost of the installation and rewheeling of the
compressors is estimated to be $2,128,000. Applicant requests authorization from the Commission by May 1, 1995,
or sooner, to construct and install the compression and pipeline facilities because of the long lead time required
for the purchasing, construction and permitting of the facilities.

In addition to supporting the full firm service subscription to the Customers, Applicant states the compression
facilities proposed in the amendment will enable it to provide firm service to the City of Austell, Georgia (Austell)
pursuant to a transportation request made by Austell on July 15, 1994. Austell and Applicant have executed a Service
Agreement for service under Applicant's Rate Schedule FT for 2,500 Mcf per day for a term of ten years. Applicant states
Austell had the next position in its transportation queue after the Customers.

Applicant has submitted a revised statement of revenues and cost of service with the amendment reflecting the cost
of the additional facilities and the additional firm subscription of Austell. Applicant represents such statement
demonstrates that the project remains a benefit to its system.

1

 and (ii) certain certificated agreements and services rendered by Transwestern using such facilities, all as more
fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.





Transwestern states that, because it is also conveying to TGC other facilities that are nonjurisdictional, it requests
any permissions and approvals which the Commission deems necessary to permit their transfer to TGC.

Transwestern states that TGC intends to file with the Commission a Petition for a Declaratory Order seeking a determination
that the subject facilities, upon the conveyance thereof, are gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's
jurisdiction under NGA Section 7(b). Transwestern requests that its application be consolidated with TGC's petition
to be filed in the near future.

Transwestern specifically requests authorization to abandon:

1. 

Certificated Facilities

_All jurisdictional facilities owned and operated by Transwestern and jurisdictional service provided by Transwestern
in Clark County, Kansas; Beaver, Commanche, Custer, Ellis, Harper, Roger Mills and Woodward Counties, Oklahoma;
Cimmaron, Crane, Gray, Hansford, Hemphill, Hutchinson, Lipscomb, Loving, Ochiltree, Pecos, Reeves, Roberts,
Sherman, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas, and Eddy, Lea, Roosevelt, and Chaves Counties, New Mexico. Transwestern
states that the certificates for the facilities and services for which Transwestern requests abandonment are described
in Exhibit T to its application.

2. 

Non-Certificated Facilities

_Even though abandonment authority is only required for jurisdictional facilities, since Transwestern is proposing
to transfer to TGC all of its gathering facilities, whether certificated or not, Transwestern also requests any permissions
and approvals which the Commission deems necessary to permit assignment to TGC of such non-certificated facilities.

3. 

Services

_Transwestern proposes to abandon and/or assign the following contracts and services rendered by Transwestern
in conjunction with the Facilities:

(i) 

Service under Rate Schedule
 ITS-1

Transwestern requests authorization to abandon certain interruptible service under Rate Schedule ITS-1,
to the extent that receipt points on contracts effectuating such service are located on the Facilities.

(ii) Service under Rate Schedule
 FTS-2

Transwestern requests authorization to abandon certain firm (no-notice) transportation service under Rate Schedule
FTS-2 provided to various right-of-way grantors or agricultural users and small general customers.

(iii) Exchange Agreements

Transwestern requests authorization to abandon certain certificated exchange services utilizing the Facilities
which are performed under Rate Schedules X-1 and X-15.

Transwestern contends that the proposed abandonment will permit it to optimize its system operations and principle
business activity of transporting natural gas. It is stated that this benefits customers connected to such facilities
as well as Transwestern's remaining shippers by assuring maximum supply access to such shippers and substituting
workable competition in lieu of continued regulatory restraints in providing gathering services.

Transwestern states that while preparing for further proceedings in its refunctionalization proceeding in Docket
No. CP94-254-000, and upon further analysis of its system in response to the gathering orders recently
issued by the Commission, it was discovered that certain field facilities, including certain compressors, plants,
meters, dehydrators, and other miscellaneous wellhead facilities are no longer used and useful or are uneconomical
or otherwise unnecessary for continued operation of the pipeline. It is stated that this abandonment requests authorization
to abandon certain compression, plants, metering, dehydration, and other miscellaneous facilities, and to secure
all other authorizations as may be required under the circumstances.

Southern proposes to abandon by sale 4.5 miles of pipeline (the Black Warrior Pipeline), which extends from its interconnection
with Geodyne's network of gathering facilities in Monroe County, Mississippi, to interconnecting facilities with
Mississippi Valley Gas Company (MVG) in Monroe County, Mississippi. Southern also proposes to abandon in place 4.8
miles of pipeline (the Corinne Field Pipeline) which extends from Milepost 4.45 on the Black Warrior Pipeline to an
interconnection with Southern's Muldon Pipeline in Monroe County, Mississippi. In addition, Southern proposes
to abandon by removal a 600 horsepower compressor and a 360 horsepower compressor which comprise Southern's Corinne
Compressor Station, as well as a measuring and receiving station located near Milepost 4.45 on the Black Warrior Pipeline.

feet of 16-inch diameter pipeline located in Cameron Parish, 
Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application on file 
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Trunkline proposes to abandon 160 feet of its 205A-0100 
Kaplan mainline located between Gate Valves 205A-1 and 205A-101, 
downstream of its Trident Lowery Plant. Trunkline states that in 
August 1992, it discovered that this segment of pipeline had 
incurred an internal corrosion leak and determined that it should 
be replaced under  2.55(b) of the Commission's

the Trident Lowery Plant into its adjacent 24-inch Line 200-2 for 
a short haul to the next downstream crossover. Trunkline asserts 
that it is not necessary to replace the subject pipeline segment 
because its present system is capable of the short-haul of the 
Lowery Plant volumes without any detrimental impact on system 
requirements or daily operations.

Texas 77056-1642, filed an application in Docket No. CP95-74-000 pursuant to Section 7(c) of the
Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing it to provide additional firm long-term
incremental transportation service for Rate Schedule FTS-7 and FTS-8 customers, to construct and operate
additional pipeline facilities required to render such services, and to charge revised FTS-7 and FTS-8
rates reflecting the incremental facility costs, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 

Texas Eastern requests the subject authorization to provide firm transportation service for New Jersey Natural
Gas Company (NJN), Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW), and Colonial Gas Company (Colonial), collectively referred to
as the Customers. Texas Eastern proposes to render the firm transportation service for the Customers to and from the
interconnection of Texas Eastern's and CNG Transmission Corporation's (CNG) facilities at the Oakford storage
field at Meter Station No. 082 in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. Texas Eastern states that it will redeliver
the requested volumes of natural gas to the customers at existing points of delivery. 

Texas Eastern indicates that pursuant to Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8, a former SS-2 or SS-3
customer can request firm transportation under Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8 (``firm-up'') of all or
a portion the interruptible delivery component of the service formerly provided under Rate Schedules SS-2
and SS-3. their service. It is further stated that Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8 also provide that
if Texas Eastern goes forward with such requests, receives required authorizations and expands its system, the costs
associated with the expansion will be borne by all Rate Schedule FTS-7 and FTS-8 customers 

In addition, to requesting authorization to provide additional transportation service to the Customers pursuant
to Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8, Texas Eastern seeks to construct and operate certain facilities necessary
to provide this service and to ``roll-in'' the capital costs to its existing FTS-7 and FTS-8 rates as permitted
by those rate schedules. 



Specifically, Texas Eastern requests authorization to: 

(1) Provide firm, additional, long-term, incremental transportation service of natural gas under Rate Schedules
FTS-7 and/or FTS-8 of up to a total of 8,776 Dekatherms per day (Dthd) for the Customers as follows: 






(2) Construct, install, own and operate facilities necessary to provide the proposed services, consisting of approximately
2.39 miles of 36-inch pipeline looping in two separate segments within the state of Pennsylvania. The specific facilities
include: 

 1.0 mile of 36-inch pipeline looping between Texas Eastern's Delmont Compressor Station in Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania and 

 1.39 miles of 36-inch pipeline looping between Texas Eastern's existing Shermans Dale and Grantsville Compressor
Stations in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. 

The estimated total cost of the proposed facilities (in 1996 dollar is $8,203,000, of which $8,180,000 is attributable
to FTS-7 service and the remaining $23,000 is attributable to FTS-8 service. Texas Eastern would finance
the proposed facilities with short-term borrowings or funds on hand. Texas Eastern proposes to complete the construction
and installation of the incremental facilities on or about November 1, 1996, the proposed date of in-service for the
firm transportation service proposed herein.

<TEXT>
 

(3) Adjust the reservation charges applicable to Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8 to reflect the impact
of ``rolling in'' the costs associated with the expanded facilities. Texas Eastern states that the rate treatment
is a material aspect of the agreements between it and the customers and therefore requests that the Commission specifically
authorize this treatment, consistent with the Commission's previous ``firm-up'' orders, the agreement of the parties
and Section 10 of Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8 

Based on the annual cost of service for the facilities proposed herein, Texas Eastern proposes for Rate Schedule FTS-7,
a revised reservation charge of $7.138 per dth. For Rate Schedule FTS-8, Texas Eastern estimates a revised reservation
charge of $6.972 per dth. Texas Eastern asserts that provision of this service will, therefore, have no impact on the
rate or services of Texas Eastern's other customers. Prior to the commencement of the proposed incremental services,
Texas Eastern states that it will file revised tariff sheets for Rate Schedules FTS-7 and FTS-8 to reflect
the adjusted reservation charges. 

Comment date: December 7, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



4. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation


[Docket No. CP95-78-000]



Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), Post Office Box 1396,
Houston, 
Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP95-78-000 a request pursuant 
to   157.205 and 157.208 of the Commission's Regulations 
under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to construct and 
operate facilities located at Compressor Station 200, Chester 
County, Pennsylvania to comply with the Clear Air Act Amendments 
of 1990, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-426-000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of
the Natural Gas Act, all as 
more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the 
Commission and open to public inspection. 

Transco states that the Clear Air Act Amendments of 1990 and 
state implementation plans pursuant thereto require certain 
reductions of NO

X

 (oxides of nitrogen) air emissions at certain 
of Transco's compressor stations. Transco proposes to install 
certain facilities at the compressor stations to achieve the 
reductions of NO

X

. It is stated that Transco plans to install 
these facilities pursuant to its part 157 subpart F blanket 
certificate. 
 Transco states that it would file under the 
prior notice procedure if the total cost of installing facilities 
at a compressor station exceeded $6.6 million. 





Specifically, Transco states that at Station No. 200 in 
Chester County, Pennsylvania it plans to install turbocharger and 
associated equipment on six of the thirteen existing engines in 
order to reduce NO

X

 emissions. It is stated that these engines 
currently do not have turbochargers on them. It is also stated 
that on the other seven engines, Transco states that it plans to 
modify the existing turbochargers to increase their capacity and 
install associated equipment in order to reduce NO

X

 emissions. 
It is stated that, in both cases, these emissions would be 
reduced because of an increase in the air-to-fuel ratio and other 
engine adjustments. Transco states that the higher air content 
serves to increase the heat capacity of the mixture in the 
combustion chamber, which lowers combustion temperature and thus 
reduces the formation of NO

X

.

<TEXT>
 

Transco further states that with respect to the installation 
of turbochargers on the six engines where there have been none 
before, the potential would be created of these engines being 
capable of performing at above their current operating 
horsepower. It is stated that since that station is automated, 
Transco has the ability to shut down other engines or reduce 
their load to ensure that the station would not operate above the 
stations' total certificated horsepower. Transco states that, 
since it would install these turbochargers at Station No. 200 
solely to address an environmental matter, i.e., NO

x

 emissions, 
Transco has no intent or need to operate the station above its 
certificated horsepower. Therefore, Transco states that when it 
installs these turbochargers at Station No. 200, it would adjust 
the automation program at the station so the station would not 
operate above its certificated horsepower.
 





Transco states that, at the other seven engines, 
modification of the existing turbochargers to increase their 
capacity would not create the potential of the engines performing 
above their current operating horsepower because the engines are 
already operating at maximum horsepower and cannot operate at a 
higher horsepower output. Thus, it is stated, there would be 
increase in the capacity on Transco's system in the vicinity of 
the station as a result of installation of the six new 
turbochargers. It is also indicated that all of the installation 
work would be within the yard of the existing station. 

It is stated that the estimated cost of Transco's proposed 
facilities in $14,694,000.

of the Vaca Lateral facilities to TGC, TGC will in turn reconvey such facilities to Enron, the original transferee.



Comment date:

 December 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. East Tennessee Natural Gas Company



[Docket No. CP95-66-000] 



Take notice that on November 9, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston,
Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP95-66-000 a request pursuant to   157.205, 157.212 and
157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212, 157.216) for authorization
to abandon and replace an existing delivery point facility in Sevier County, Tennessee for its customer Sevier County
Utility District (Sevier) under East Tennessee's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-412-000
pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
East Tennessee proposes to install a 4-inch stopple assembly on its Sevierville lateral Line, 581 feet upstream of
the current tap which will be abandoned. This abandonment and replacement is necessary for safety since the current
tap is located adjacent to a heavily traveled highway. The gas will continue to be metered and transferred to Sevier
upstream of the proposed tap. 
East Tennessee proposes to abandon all pipe and the current S.V.3302A-111 downstream of the new valve by removal.
Sevier's current FT-A contract will reflect the relocation of this tap. There will be no maximum daily quantity
increase with the tap's construction and peak day and annual deliveries will not be affected. 
East Tennessee will own, operate and maintain the proposed facility. The estimated cost for current facilities abandonment
is $8,700, new facilities construction is $16,000, and the total project cost is fully reimbursable to East Tennessee.

The total quantities to be delivered to Sevier after abandonment and replacement of the facilities will not exceed
that authorized to be delivered. East Tennessee has sufficient capacity to accomplish deliveries under the proposed
change without detriment or disadvantage to other customers.

3. CNG Transmission Corporation


[Docket No. CP95-81-000] 


Take notice that on November 16, 1994, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West
Virginia 26301, filed in Docket No. CP95-81-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural
Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon certain pipeline facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application
on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
CNGT proposes to (a) abandon in place one old deteriorated pipeline, and (b) abandon by sale to CNG Producing Company
(CNG Producing, an affiliate) three short lines, a segment of another line, and a small leased field compressor. CNGT
states that the facilities would be sold at net book value, $168,542. CNGT encloses letters from the only affected
producers (other than CNG Producing), Shawmut Development Company (Shawmut), and Fairman Drilling Company, consenting
to the proposal. CNGT explains that the facilities are no longer necessary to its operations because CNGT is not a merchant
under its Order 636 reorganization. CNGT anticipates that the facilities would be operated as part of a non-jurisdictional
gathering system, once acquired by CNG Producing. 
More specifically, CNGT proposes to: 
(1) Abandon in place 2.71 miles of 8-inch pipeline (Line H-176) in McElroy District in Tyler County, West
Virginia, due to deterioration. CNGT states that the line was built in 1925 and certificated on May 12, 1942, in Docket
No. G-290 (3 FPC 994 (1943)). CNGT further states that the sole customer of Hope Gas Inc., which was located on
the line, has been relocated to another line, and the line temporarily has been closed off pending action on CNGT's
abandonment proposal. 
(2) Abandon three lines (LN 2270, LN 2272, LN 2397) and part of line LN 2246, by sale to CNG Producing. CNGT states that
the lines are located in the East Cherry Tree area of Clearfield and Cambria Counties, Pennsylvania, and total 3.22
miles of 2, 3, and 6-inch pipeline. CNGT further states that the lines currently are operated at a pressure of
approximately 150 psig. It is stated that the lines were constructed under CNGT's blanket certificate as reported
in the annual report of blanket certificated projects for 1984 and the budget application report for 1982 filed by
CNGT's predecessor in Docket No. CP80-293-000. 

(3) Abandon, by sale to CNG Producing, a 340-horsepower leased field compressor and 63 feet of related 2-inch
field pipe at Bells Landing in Ferguson Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. CNGT states that the compressor
enables gas from a CNG Producing well to enter a gathering system jointly owned by Shawmut with CNG Producing, and operated
by Shawmut. It is further stated that the compressor was built in 1988 and reported in the annual report filed in November
1989 in Docket No. CP82-537-000. 


Comment date:

 December 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 


4. NorAm Gas Transmission Company



[Docket No. CP95-82-000] 


Take notice that on November 16, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), 1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002,
filed, in Docket No. CP95-82-000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act and Part
157 of the Commission's Regulations for an order permitting and approving the abandonment and removal of a 300 h.p.
skid-mounted compressor unit which will result in the down sizing of its Calhoun Compressor Station in Quachita Parish,
Louisiana, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

NGT states that it received authorization in Docket No. CP87-458-000 to construct and operate the Calhoun
Compressor Station, consisting of three skid-mounted compressor units with a total of 980 horsepower (h.p.) on NGT's
HT-1, Section 34, Township 18N, Range 1E, Quachita Parish, Louisiana. NGT relates that the compressor station
was installed to receive gas supply from the Calhoun Field central point for the transmission of such gas through Line
HT-1 into its mainline system. 
NGT maintains that due to declining production from the Calhoun Field, it is no longer necessary to operate the 300
h.p. unit to receive gas from this field. Additionally, NGT says the 300 h.p. unit has been inactive for some time and
would require repair before becoming operational. NGT asserts that it will continue to operate the two 340 h.p. units
and no production will be interrupted or abandoned. NGT further states that the removal would only be above ground
facilities within an existing fenced compressor station yard and no soil would be disturbed.

Take notice that on November 21, 1994, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation (MRT) submitted for filing as
part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets listed below, with a proposed effective
date of November 1, 1994:






Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 127

Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 224







MRT states that the purpose of the filing is to comply with the Commission's November 4, 1994, order by deleting the
tariff language on Sheet No. 127 which the Commission viewed as inconsistent with its curtailment policy set forth
in Order No. 636, and by revising the tariff language on Sheet No. 224 to the billing, statements, payment and records
provisions to reflect the language that was originally approved in MRT's restructuring proceeding under Order No.
636 and that was in effect prior to MRT's October 7, 1994 filing.


MRT states that a copy of the filing has been mailed to each of its sales customers and the State Commissions of Arkansas,
Illinois and Missouri.

North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with  385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 1, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

be filed on or before December 1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Tributyltin fluoride (TBTF); Cancellation Order </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Cancellation Order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Order, issued pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
7 U.S.C. 136 et seq., announces EPA's cancellation of the registrations for ELF ATOCHEM North America, Inc. (``Atochem'')
products containing Tributyltin Fluoride (TBTF). Further, this Order announces the Agency's decision prohibiting
Atochem's sale, distribution and use of existing stocks of its TBTF products. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 




I. Background 



TBTF compounds are registered for use in paint formulations as an antifoulant treatment for hulls, outboard motors,
and lower drive units of certain types of marine vessels. They are used to inhibit the growth of fouling organisms such
as barnacles and algae. Atochem manufactured the technical product, an intermediate formulation, and one end-use
product.
On July 7, 1994, EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 a Notice of Receipt of Request to Cancel Registrations of Atochem's three registrations of TBTF products, EPA registration
numbers 5204-19, 5204-61, and 5204-64. In that Notice, EPA announced its intent to grant the request
for cancellation of these products and also set forth a proposal to prohibit Atochem's sale, distribution and use
of these products effective on the date of the cancellation order. Other dealers and distributors would be permitted
to sell and distribute these products until supplies were exhausted. End-users would be permitted to use these products
until supplies were exhausted. For further information regarding the request for voluntary cancellation and the
existing stocks proposal, see the July 7, 1994 Notice (59 FR 34814). EPA received no comments during the 30-day
comment period which ended August 8, 1994. 




II. Existing Stocks Determination



EPA has determined that Atochem will not be permitted to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of its TBTF products
as of November 30, 1994. Furthermore, Atochem must, as the basic registrant, notify any and all supplemental registrants
of its product(s) that this Agency action also applies to their supplementally registered products. Registrants
may be held liable for violations committed by their supplemental registrants. Other dealers and distributors will
be permitted to sell and distribute existing stocks of affected Atochem products until stocks are exhausted. End
users may use existing stocks until stocks are exhausted. 




III. Cancellation Order



Effective November 30, 1994, EPA is hereby issuing a cancellation order for the following Atochem product registrations:
EPA registration numbers 5204-19, 5204-61, and 5204-64. Effective November 30, 1994, all sale,
distribution, and use of these products must be in accordance with the following existing stocks provision of this
cancellation order: Atochem will not be permitted to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of its TBTF products
as of November 30, 1994. Furthermore, Atochem must, as the basic registrant, notify any and all supplemental registrants
of its product(s) that this Agency action also applies to their supplementally registered products. Registrants
may be held liable for violations committed by their supplemental registrants. Other dealers and distributors will
be permitted to sell and distribute existing stocks of affected Atochem products until stocks are exhausted. End
users may use existing stocks until stocks are exhausted.

<DOCTITLE>Accredited Training Programs Under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) </DOCTITLE>



Agency:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




Action:

 National Directory of AHERA Accredited Courses (NDAAC); notice of availability of new edition. 





<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Effective November 30, 1994, the EPA is announcing the availability of a new edition of its National Directory of AHERA
Accredited Courses (NDAAC). This publication, updated quarterly, provides information to the public about training
providers and courses approved for accreditation purposes pursuant to the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
(AHERA). As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar
listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the 

Federal Register

. The November 30, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on August 31, 1994, may be ordered through
the NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors
who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or
design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and
commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA
therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so
that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining
the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation
and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses
and organizations. 

Previously, EPA had published this listing in the 

Federal Register

 on a quarterly basis. The last 

Federal Register

 listing required by law was published on August 30, 1991. EPA recognized the need to continue publication of this document
even though the legislative mandate had expired. The NDAAC fulfills the public need for this information while at
the same time, it reduces EPA cost and improves the service's capabilities.

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management </DOCTITLE>
and Budget for Review


November 22, 1994.


The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for
review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW, Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418-0214. Persons wishing
to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10214
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.






OMB Number:

 3060-0438




Title: 

 Transmittal Sheet for Cellular Applications for Unserved Areas


Form Number:

 FCC Form 464


Action: 

 Revision of a currently approved collection 


Respondents: 

 Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses)


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement 


Estimated Annual Burden:

 20,000 responses; .166 hours average burden per response; 3,320 hours total annual burden 


Needs and Uses:

 In CC Docket No. 90-6, the Commission adopted its initial rules and requirements for the processing, filing
selection of unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service. These rules were later refined
in CC Docket No. 92-115 in which the Commission conducted a comprehensive revision of Part 22 rules. The procedures
for processing cellular applications were soon thereafter revised in GN Docket No. 93-252. In this proceeding,
the Commission determined that it would also use competitive bidding to select among certain mutually exclusive
cellular applications. A two phase licensing scheme for accepting applications for unserved area applications
is used. In Phase I, applications are filed during specified filing windows for any unserved area that may exist on
frequency blocks within each market. In Phase II, unserved area applications are processed using a 30-day notice
and cut-off procedures. Applicants must submit a transmittal sheet, FCC Form 464, in addition to other filing requirements.
FCC Form 464 is designed to facilitate application intake and other processing functions by serving as a cover sheet
to the application. The applicant must certify on the form that the application is complete in every respect and contains
all the information required by the Commission's cellular rules. The information on the transmittal sheet must match
exactly the information on the jacket of the microfiche and on the cover of the application. 

Application filed with an incorrect or previous transmittal sheet will not be accepted for filing.

 FCC Form 464 is used only in Phase I of the licensing scheme. In Phase I, applicants need not initially file the paper
original with the application. The paper original must be filed seven days after the release of the public notice announcing
the applicant as the winner and include a full sized map. For Phase I filings, applicants must file the original or master
microfiche and one microfiche copy and a reduced copy of the map should be depicted in the microfiche and contained
in the paper original. The microfiche must be a signed copy of the application, be properly labelled and enclosed in
a properly labelled envelope. The FCC Form 464 has been updated to replace references to FCC Form 401 with FCC Form 600.
Other minor changes have been made to coincide the form with the revised rules. The information collected will be used
by FCC staff to determine whether the applicant is qualified legally, technically, and financially to be licensed
as a cellular operator. Without such information the Commission could not determine whether to issue licenses to
the applicants that provide telecommunication services to the public and therefore fulfill its statutory responsibilities
in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This public notice announces the Canadian Interim Sharing Arrangement for the broadband personal communications
service (PCS). This action is taken on the Commission's own motion. The arrangement permits the United States and
Canada to use PCS spectrum without causing interference to the operations of the other country.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is the text of the Commission's public notice in GEN Docket No. 90-314, released November 21, 1994. The arrangement
itself is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239),
1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC and also may be purchased from the Commission's duplication contractor, International
Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.



Text of Public Notice 




On November 14, 1994, representatives of the FCC and Industry Canada concluded a sharing arrangement for 2 GHz Broadband
Personal Communications Services (PCS). This interim sharing arrangement provides for use of the 1850-1990
MHz band for PCS along the United States and Canada border. This sharing arrangement should assist parties intending
to participate in the FCC auction process and should facilitate the eventual provision of PCS services along the border.

The principal provisions of this interim sharing arrangement are:

 The frequency band 1850-1990 MHz is to be shared on an equal basis and both countries are to have full use
of these frequencies for the provision of PCS services. 

 Additional use of the 1850-1990 MHz frequency band for fixed point-to-point microwave use is to be limited
and discouraged and any new use of the 1910-1930 MHz band for fixed microwave operations is to be avoided. (The
1910-1930 MHz portion of the 1850-1990 MHz band has been designated for unlicensed PCS use in the United
States and a similar type of use in Canada.)

 Any new PCS use of these frequencies is not to cause harmful interference to existing fixed point-to-point
microwave operations in the other country. 

 Coordination of all PCS systems within 120 km (75 miles) of the border is required and will be based on: 




_A technical analysis, using recognized industry procedures such as TIA/EIA Bulletin (TSB10-F), that interference
is not caused to existing microwave operations; or, alternatively, 

_A mutually acceptable arrangement between the PCS and fixed microwave operators.





 Licenses for PCS base station facilities within 72 km (45 miles) of the border will be conditioned to indicate
that future coordination is required between PCS operators in both countries to ensure that interference is not caused
to PCS operations in the other country and that the band is shared on an equal basis. (This is similar to actions taken
during the initial licensing of the cellular radio service.) 

 The predicted or measured median field strength of any PCS base station is not to exceed 47 dBuV/m at any location
at or beyond the border unless the affected PCS operators in the adjacent areas agree. 

 Compatible PCS operations at the border are best assured through coordination of operating and technical
parameters by PCS operators; and, PCS operators are to notify the FCC and Industry Canada of any agreements. Such agreements
are subject to review by the Agencies.

The full text of the arrangement has bee placed in GEN Docket No. 90-314 and copies are available from International
Transcription Service at (202) 857-3800. For further information, contact Tom Mooring or Rod Small in the Office
of Engineering and Technology at (202) 653-8114 (6) or Henry Straube in the International Bureau at (202) 254-3394.

By notice published in the 

Federal Register 

on Monday, October 31, 1994 (59 FR 54454) Hemisphere Forwarding, Inc. (``Hemisphere'') was listed among other freight
forwarders as having its ocean freight forwarder license (No. 2731) revoked because of a failure to maintain a valid
surety bond on file with the Commission. This notice was in error. Hemisphere should not have been included on this

<DOCTITLE>Practices of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement and its Members With Respect to Independent Action; Order of Investigation
and Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The Trans-Atlantic Agreement (``TAA'' or ``Agreement''), FMC Agreement No. 202-011375, first became effective
August 31, 1992, pursuant to the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1701 et seq.

 Sixteen ocean common carriers, identified in Appendix A hereto, currently are members of the Agreement.






By Order issued July 27, 1994, the Commission instituted Fact Finding Investigation No. 21, entitled Activities
of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement and Its Members. In the Fact Finding Order, the Commission directed the designated
Investigative Officers to investigate, 

inter alia,

 allegations that TAA or its members may have reached agreements or taken other actions which discourage or suppress
the right of members to take independent action (``IA'') on rate or service items. The Fact Finding Order also provides
that the Investigative Officers are not precluded from developing facts related to any possible violations of the
1984 Act that may be uncovered in the course of the proceeding. In commencing the above nonadjudicatory investigation,
the Commission's objective was to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant formal adjudicatory,
assessment or injunctive proceedings for alleged violations of the 1984 Act by the TAA or its carrier members.

Through responses to subpenas issued by the Investigative Officers and to an order issued by the Commission pursuant
to section 15 of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1714, through testimony in hearings held in connection with the Fact Finding
Investigation, and through other means, it now appears to the Commission that carrier members of the TAA engaged in
practices which may have artificially constricted the members' right of independent action. Testimony from numerous
shipper witnesses appearing in the hearing failed to identify any meaningful IA rate activities taken by a TAA member,
despite shipper requests. To the contrary, shippers have testified that they had been informed by TAA carrier representatives
that independent action would not, or could not be taken under TAA.

In addition to shipper testimony concerning the absence of IA, documents have been obtained which indicate that TAA
members may have agreed to a procedure requiring that rate matters be tabled for discussion at a conference meeting
before filing an IA rate, and that TAA members expected and demanded that other members adhere to this IA procedure.
Also, it appears that TAA members may have agreed to limit their authority to take IAs to one or two designated high level
executives, and that TAA's Executive Director may have been authorized by the members to cancel any tariff filing
that he deemed not to be in the best interests of TAA. Such strategies appear designed to inhibit and curtail IA rather
than facilitate its exercise.

It appears that these alleged agreements or other similar practices designed to constrict IA may violate section
5(b)(8), 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(8), which requires that every conference agreement must provide that any conference
member may take IA on any rate or service item required to be filed in a tariff. Such agreements or practices also may
violate section 10(a) (2) or (3) of the 1984 Act,
 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(a) (2) or (3). In addition, such practices may violate provisions of the Commission's regulations
designed to protect the integrity of the right of independent action within conferences. In particular, 46 CFR 572.801
prohibits a conference from prescribing notice periods for adopting, withdrawing, postponing, canceling or taking
similar actions on independent action matters; from requiring that notice of independent action be given by the proposing
member to the other parties to the agreement; from requiring the proposing member to attend a conference meeting,
to submit any further information other than that necessary to accomplish the filing of the independent tariff item,
or to comply with any other procedure for the purpose of explaining, justifying, or compromising the proposed independent
action; and from failing to include an IA rate or service item in the conference tariff effective no later than 10 days
after receipt of an IA notice, 46 CFR 572.801(b)(2), (c), and (d).





In commencing the Fact Finding Investigation, the Commission noted that the right of independent action is a critical
ingredient of the compromise reflected in the 1984 Act between carrier and shipper interests and has been guarded
carefully by the Commission. In the Conference Report accompanying the 1984 Act, H.R. Rep. No. 98-600, 98th
Cong., 2d Sess., 34 (1984), the conferees state their belief ``that potential reductions in competition will be at
least partially offset by a member carrier's right of independent action and ability to enter and leave the conference
freely.'' It appears that TAA may have suppressed that right and, thus, removed a competitive counterbalance to the
conference's ability and desire to increase rates.

The Commission recognizes that its action instituting this formal adjudication necessarily precludes that opportunity
to obtain additional testimony on this subject from conference and carrier witnesses in the context of the ongoing
Fact Finding Investigation. The Commission is taking action at this time because it believes that there is sufficient
evidence to warrant such action, and because of the importance of this issue to effective Commission regulation of
conferences. The initiation of a formal adjudicatory proceeding will provide the full measure of procedural due
process accorded respondents in adjudicatory matters generally.

Now therefore, 

it is ordered,

 That pursuant to sections 5, 10, 11, and 13 of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704, 1709, 1710, and 1712, an investigation
is instituted to determine:

with the mandatory independent action provision of that section of the 1984 Act and, if found to be operating in violation
of section 5(b)(8) of the 1984 Act, why the Agreement should not be disapproved, canceled or modified by the Commission;
(2) Whether the TAA and its carrier members, joint or severally, violated section 10(a)(2) of the 1984 Act by operating

1984 Act and, if found to be operating in violation of section 10(a)(2) of the 1984 Act, why the Agreement should not
be disapproved, canceled or modified by the Commission; 
(3) Whether the TAA and its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10(a)(3) of the 1984 Act by operating

and, if found to be operating in violation of section 10(a)(3) of the 1984 Act, why the Agreement should not be disapproved,
canceled or modified by the Commission;
(4) Whether the TAA and its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated the provisions of 46 CFR 572.801 by operating

by the Commission;
(5) Whether, in the event violations of sections 5(b)(8), 10(a)(2), or 10(a)(3) of the 1984 Act are found, civil penalties
should be assessed and, if so, the amount of such penalties; and
(6) Whether, in the event violations are found, an appropriate cease and desist order should be issued.

Law Judge only after consideration has been given by the parties and the Presiding Administrative Law Judge to the
use of alternative forms of dispute resolution, and upon a proper showing that there are genuine issues of material

the nature of the matters in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary for the development
of an adequate record;

<DOCTITLE>Fact Finding Investigation No. 21; Activities of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement and Its Members; Amended Order of
Investigation</DOCTITLE>


On July 27, 1994, pursuant to sections 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 23 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app.
1704, 1706, 1707, 1709, 1710, 1711 and 1721, and Part 502, Subpart R of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 46
CFR 502.281, 

et seq

., the Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') issued an order (``July 27 Order'') to institute a nonadjudicatory
investigation into the practices of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (``TAA'') and its member lines. Recent events
have demonstrated a need to clarify and amend various parts of the July 27 Order as explained below.
On July 5, 1994, the TAA member lines filed amendments to the TAA, including a change of the conference's name to the
Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (``TACA'').
 As noted in footnote 1 of the July 27 Order, the Commission intended that this nonadjudatory investigation would continue
if TACA became effective. On October 24, 1994, TACA became effective, with certain modifications. To ensure clarity
as to its intent regarding investigation of TACA, the Commission is revising the first ordering paragraph of the July
27 Order to state expressly that this nonadjudicatory investigation is to develop evidence on whether or not TAA,
TACA, and some or all of the sixteen ocean common carriers which comprise TACA's membership
 may have engaged in, or may be engaged in activities violative of various provisions of the 1984 Act, and to provide
a basis for any subsequent adjudicatory, assessment or injunctive action.





By three separate orders issued this date, the Commission has commenced adjudicatory proceedings to determine whether
TAA and some or all of its members violated various provisions of the 1984 Act in connection with the establishment
and operation of container pools; limitations on the right of independent action; and restrictions contained in
certain vessel sharing agreements in the trans-Atlantic trades. In view of the institution of these adjudicatory
proceedings, the Commission will not seek testimony or further evidence from TAA (or TACA) and its members in the remainder
of the Fact Finding investigation as to the issues under adjudication.
To ensure a thorough examination of the facts regarding TACA's implementation, and to provide adequate resources
and flexibility for addressing the issues remaining in this investigation, the Commission is amending the July 27
Order to add a sixth Investigative Officer to the proceeding and to give the Investigative Officers additional time
for the preparation of a final report of findings and recommendations. The July 27 Order required issuance of a final
report within 180 days after publication of that Order. The amendment extends that deadline for approximately two
months, to March 24, 1995.


Now therefore, it is ordered, 

That pursuant to sections 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 23 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704, 1706, 1707, 1709,
1710, 1711 and 1721, and Part 502, Subpart R of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 46 CFR 502.281, 

et seq., 

the Commission's July 27 Order is amended to preclude the Investigative Officers from seeking additional testimony
or further evidence in this proceeding from the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (or the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement),
or any of its members on the following issues:



1. Whether or not TAA (or TACA) or any of its members has violated or is violating any of the prohibited acts set forth
in section 10 of the 1984 Act by providing chassis and/or container equipment to shippers at U.S. West Coast and interior
locations other than the carrier's designated containeryard or terminal facility;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941130-2-00049 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941130-2-00031 </PARENT>

2. Whether or not TAA (or TACA) or any of its members has violated or is violating section 5(b)(8), 10(a)(2), or 10(a)(3)
of the 1984 Act, or 46 CFR 572.801 of the Commission's regulations by imposing restrictions on the right of members
to take independent action; and
3. Whether or not any of the members of TAA (or TACA), and of agreement Nos. 203-011171, 203-011394, 203-011395,
and 203-011396, has violated or is violating section 5(b) (2) or (3) of the 1984 Act, by failing to provide reasonable
and equal terms and conditions for admission and readmission to conference membership, or by failing to permit any
member to withdraw from conference membership upon reasonable notice without penalty.





It is further ordered, 

That the first ordering paragraph of the Commission's July 27 Order is amended to read as follows:





Now therefore, it is ordered, 

That pursuant to sections 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 23 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704, 1706, 1707, 1709,
1710, 1711 and 1721, and Part 502, Subpart R of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 46 CFR 502.281, 

et seq.

, a nonadjudicatory investigation is hereby instituted into the practices of TAA (or TACA) and its member lines (including
Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd.), listed in the Appendix to this order, to develop the issues set forth in this order and to
provide a basis for any subsequent adjudicatory, assessment or injunctive action by the Commission.





It is further ordered, 

That the first sentence of the second ordering paragraph of the July 27 Order is amended as follows:





It is further ordered, 

That the Investigative Officers shall be Wm. Jarrel Smith, Jr., Vern W. Hill, Charles L. Haslup III, Carolyn H. Grigg,
Peter J. King and Martha C. Smith of the Commission.





It is further ordered, 

That the third ordering paragraph of the July 27 Order is amended as follows:





It is further ordered, 

That the Investigative Officers shall issue a joint report of findings and recommendations not later than March 24,
1995, and interim reports if it appears that more immediate Commission action, particularly injunctive action,
is necessary, such reports to remain confidential unless and until the Commission provides otherwise;





It is further ordered, 

That the Appendix of the July 27 Order is amended. The amended Appendix is attached as an appendix to this Order;


It is further ordered, 

That this Amended Order of Investigation be served on the respondents listed in the Appendix attached to this Order
and the July 27 Order be served on Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd.;


Finally, it is ordered, 

That the July 27 Order is in every other respect unchanged.



By the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Container Pool Practices of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement and its Members; Order of Investigation and Hearing</DOCTITLE>





The Trans-Atlantic Agreement (``TAA'' or ``Agreement''), FMC Agreement No. 202-011375, first became effective
August 31, 1992, pursuant to the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1701 

et seq. 

Sixteen ocean common carriers, identified in Appendix A hereto, currently are members of the Agreement.






By Order issued July 27, 1994, the Commission instituted Fact Finding Investigation No. 21, entitled Activities
of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement and Its Members. Among issues to be examined in the course of the Fact Finding Investigation
were, 

inter alia

, whether the carrier members of the TAA had violated sections 10 (b)(1), (b)(4), and (b)(12) of the 1984 Act.
 The Fact Finding Order further provides that the designated Investigative Officers are not precluded from developing
facts related to any other possible violations of the 1984 Act that may be uncovered in the course of the proceeding.
In commencing the above nonadjudicatory investigation, the Commission's objective was to determine whether sufficient
evidence exists to warrant formal adjudicatory, assessment or injunctive proceedings for alleged violations of
the 1984 Act by the TAA or its carrier members.





Through responses to subpenas issued by the Investigative Officers, testimony in fact finding hearings and through
other means, it now appears to the Commission that carrier members of the TAA have engaged in certain practices relating
to the provision of chassis and container equipment to shippers at U.S. West Coast and interior locations other than
the carrier's designated container yard (``CY'') or terminal facility at the port.
 It further appears that these practices may have encompassed the positioning by the carrier of an inventory of container
equipment and chassis either at facilities operated by the shippers (so-called ``shippers' pools'') or at facilities
operated by third parties such as trucking companies (``neutral container pools'' or ``equipment depots''). It
is believed that the ocean common carriers have absorbed all or a portion of the inland costs of positioning empty equipment
at these facilities on behalf of the shipper, for loading and subsequent use in the transportation of commodities
in the TAA trades. The carriers also may have absorbed related costs of maintaining and controlling such equipment
for the benefit of certain shippers, including benefits or concessions as to personnel, advance allocations of equipment,
and extended freetime arrangements. It does not appear that these individual facilities or benefits are identified
or held out generally to the shipping public through the tariffs of the TAA or its member carriers.

In addition, a review of materials furnished in response to subpenas by the Investigative Officers indicate that,
in May 1994, the carrier members agreed in a meeting of the TAA to permit such pools to continue in existence through
August 31, 1994, despite concerns and complaints by some members that operation of the pools was untariffed and unlawful.
It appears that the membership agreed that such pools would be limited to those already established, and further limited
to shippers of dried fruit and nuts for the balance of the 1993-1994 shipping season. These latter allegations
raise the implication that TAA member carriers, in addition to maintaining container pools or equipment depots on
an individual carrier basis, may have participated in a TAA decision jointly to permit some carriers to operate container
pools in violation of the 1984 Act. To the extent that TAA's action was further limited to certain shippers of dried
fruit and nuts, other shippers of similar commodities or shippers in locations physically proximate to these so-called
container pools may have been deprived of equivalent concessions or benefits, or subjected to undue or unreasonable
prejudice or disadvantage in respect of such container pools.








Now therefore, it is ordered, 

That pursuant to sections 10, 11, and 13 of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1709, 1710, and 1712, an investigation is instituted
to determine:
(1) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(1) or (b)(4) of the 1984 Act
by charging a lesser or different compensation for transportation or services involving the use of container pools
than the rates or charges set forth in its tariffs or service contracts, or allowed any person to obtain such transportation
or services at less than applicable charges by an unjust or unfair device or means with respect to such container pools;
(2) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(3) or (b)(11) of the 1984
Act by extending to any person a privilege, concession, equipment or facility involving the use of container pools
except in accordance with its tariffs or service contracts, or made or gave any undue or unreasonable preference or
advantage to any particular person or description of traffic with respect to such container pools;
(3) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(3), (b)(6) or (b)(12) of
the 1984 Act by denying to any person a privilege, concession, equipment or facility involving the use of container
pools except in accordance with its tariffs or service contracts, engaged in any unfair or unjustly discriminatory
practice in the matter of container pool facilities, or subjected any particular person or description of traffic
to any undue or unreasonable disadvantage or prejudice with respect to such container pools;

(4) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6),
(b)(11), or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act by agreeing to permit the continuation by certain carriers of the use of container
pools through the period ending August 31, 1994;
(5) Whether the TAA or its carrier members, jointly or severally, violated section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6),
(b)(11), or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act by agreeing to permit the continuation by certain carriers of the use of container
pools through the period ending August 31, 1994, which agreement limited such privileged, concessions or facilities
to shippers of dried fruits and nuts in California;
(6) Whether, in event violations of section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(11) or (b)(12) of the 1984 Act are
found, civil penalties should be assessed and, if so, the amount of such penalties;
(7) Whether, in the event violations of section 10 (b)(1), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of the 1984 Act are found, the Commission
should suspend any common carrier's rights to use any or all tariffs of the TAA and, if so, the period of such tariff suspension;
and
(8) Whether, in the event violations are found, an appropriate cease and desist order should be issued.

<DOCTITLE>Vessel Sharing Agreements; Order to Show Cause</DOCTITLE>




Section 5(a) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(a), requires the filing at the Federal
Maritime Commission (``Commission'') of agreements among ocean common carriers regarding vessel space/slot charters,
sailing arrangements and vessel deployment (collectively referred to herein as ``vessel sharing agreements'')
for the common carriage 
of goods by water in the foreign commerce of the United States.
 In recent years, three vessel sharing agreements involving the trans-Atlantic trade (``Trade'') have been filed
which require membership in a separate conference agreement. These agreements are Agreement No. 203-011394
(``OOCL Agreement''),
 Agreement No. 203-011395 (``Maersk Agreement'')
 and Agreement No. 203-011396 (``Cooperative Agreement).
 They require the participants, Sea-Land Service, Inc. (``Sea-Land''), P & O Containers Ltd. (``P & O''),
Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V. (``Nedlloyd''), Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd. (``OOCL'') and A.P. Moller-Maersk Line
(``Maersk''), to be members of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (``TAA''), now known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference
Agreement (``TACA''), (Agreement No. 202-011375).










A conference is defined by the 1984 Act as an ``association of ocean common carriers permitted, pursuant to an approved
or effective agreement, to engage in concerted activity and to utilize a common tariff,'' 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(7).
Like vessel sharing agreements, conference agreements must be filed at the Commission. However, to ensure that a
conference or its members cannot restrict or otherwise control conference membership, section 5(b)(3) of the 1984
Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(3), requires that a conference agreement must permit any member to withdraw from conference
membership upon reasonable notice without penalty. In addition, section 5(b)(2), 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(2), states
that each conference agreement must provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for admission and readmission
to conference membership. Any conference agreement that imposes withdrawal penalties or unreasonable terms and
conditions for readmission to a conference violates the 1984 Act and may be canceled or modified by the Commission
under section 11(c) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710(c).

As noted above, the OOCL Agreement, the Maersk Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement require Sea-Land, Nedlloyd,
P & O, OOCL and Maersk to be members of TACA. If one of these carriers withdraws from TACA, it is compelled to withdraw
from these vessel sharing agreements.
 The OOCL Agreement, the Maersk Agreement and Agreement No. 202-011171, another vessel sharing agreement,
involving Sea-Land, P & O and Nedlloyd,
 impose penalties on the carrier that withdraws from the vessel sharing agreements, i.e.,






(1) The withdrawing party must give six months irrevocable notice to the other parties.

(2) The withdrawing party shall cease operation as a common carrier in the Trade.

(3) The withdrawing party shall not re-enter the Trade as a common carrier for a period of five (5) years.

(4) The withdrawing party shall, during the six month notice period, make all reasonable efforts to assist the other
parties in succeeding to the business of the withdrawing party including, but not limited to, providing customer
lists, and affirmatively recommending the other parties to the withdrawing parties customers.

Because of the withdrawal penalties and conference membership requirements, it appears that these four agreements,
when examined in connection with each other and TACA, do not provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for
readmission to TACA and do not permit these conference members to withdraw from TACA upon reasonable notice without
penalty. As a result, the carrier parties appear to accomplish indirectly through the interaction of TACA and these
vessel sharing agreements that which they are precluded from accomplishing directly under the 1984 Act.



Now therefore, it is ordered,

 That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710, the vessel sharing agreements set forth
in Appendix A and their members show cause why they should not be found to be operating in violation of section 5 (b)(2)
of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(2), for restraining readmission to conference membership for
any former vessel sharing agreement member willing to serve the particular trade or route, and, if found to be operating
in violation of section 5(b)(2) of the 1984 Act, why these agreements should not be disapproved, canceled or modified
by the Commission;



It is further ordered,

 That pursuant to section 11 of the Shipping Act of 1984, the vessel sharing agreements set forth in Appendix A and their
members show cause why they should not be found to be operating in violation of section 5(b)(3) of the Shipping Act of
1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(3), for not complying with the conference membership withdrawal provisions of that
section of the 1984 Act and, if found to be operating in violation of section 5(b)(3) of the 1984 Act, why these agreements
should not be disapproved, canceled or modified by the Commission;



It is further ordered,

 That should it be determined that the vessel sharing agreements and their members have operated in violation of section
5(b)(2) or 5(b)(3) of the Shipping Act of Act the matter may, pursuant to section 13 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C.
app. 1712, be referred to an Administrative Law Judge in an appropriate proceeding to determine whether penalties
should be assessed and, if so, the level of such penalties;



It is further ordered,

 That this proceeding is limited to the submission of facts and memoranda of law, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission;


It is further ordered,

 That the Commission's Bureau of Hearing Counsel be made a party to this proceeding;



It is further ordered,

 That the vessel sharing agreements set forth in Appendix A and their members are named Respondents in this proceeding;



It is further ordered,

 That any person having an interest and desiring to intervene in this proceeding shall file a petition for leave to intervene
no later than January 3, 1995, in accordance with Rule 72 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 46 CFR
502.72;



It is further ordered,

 That affidavits of fact and memoranda of law shall be filed by Respondents and any intervenors in support of the vessel
sharing agreements no later than January 20, 1995. Reply affidavits and Memoranda of law shall be filed by the Bureau
of Hearing Counsel and any intervenors in opposition to the vessel sharing agreements no later than February 21, 1995.
Rebuttal affidavits and memoranda of law shall be filed by Respondents and inrtervenors in support of the vessel sharing
agreements no later than March 3, 1995;



It is further ordered,

 That:
(a) Should any party believe that an evidentiary hearing is required, that party must submit a request for such hearing
together with a statement setting forth in detail the facts to be provided, the relevance of those facts to the issues
in this proceeding, a description of the evidence which would be adduced, and why affidavits of fact are not sufficient
to present such evidence;
(b) Should any party believe that an oral argument is required, that party must submit a request specifying the reasons
therefore and why argument by memorandum is inadequate to present the party's case; and

(c) Any such request for evidentiary hearing or oral argument shall be filed no later than March 10, 1995;



It is further ordered,

 That notice of this Order to Show Cause be published in the 

Federal Register

, and that a copy thereof be served upon Respondents;

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Federal Open Market Committee; Domestic Policy Directive of September 27, 1994</DOCTITLE>


In accordance with  271.5 of its rules regarding availability of information (12 CFR part 271), there is set forth below
the domestic policy directive issued by the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting held on August 16, 1994.
 The directive was issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as follows:



The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of economic expansion, though perhaps moderating
slightly in recent months, remains substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably further in August,
and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.1 percent. Reflecting strength in motor vehicles, industrial
production rose sharply in August after posting sizable gains in other recent months, and capacity utilization moved
up further from already high levels. Retail sales were up considerably in August, boosted by a rebound in sales of durable
goods, including motor vehicles. Housing starts rose in August but were unchanged from their second-quarter level.
Orders for nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong expansion in spending on business equipment; permits
for non residential construction remain on a mild uptrend. Inventory accumulation appears to have moderated recently
after surging in the second quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened in July from its
second-quarter average. Prices of materials have remained under upward pressure, and increases in broad indexes
of consumer and producer prices have been somewhat larger in recent months.
On August 16, 1994, the Board of Governors approved an increase in the discount rate from 3-1/2 to 4 percent, and Committee
agreed that this increase would be allowed to show through completely to interest rates in reserve markets. Most market
interest rates are up somewhat on balance since the August meeting. The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms
of the other G-10 currencies depreciated somewhat over the intermeeting period.
M2 and M3 declined in August after expanding moderately in July; for the year through August, M2 and M3 grew at rates
slightly above the bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate
rate in recent months.
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote
sustainable growth in output. In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed
the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured
from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that developments contributing
to unusual velocity increases could persist during the year and that money growth within these ranges would be consistent
with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained
at 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from
the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee
provisionally set the associated monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995.
The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability,
movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.
In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure
on reserve positions. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable
economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat
greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the balance
of the year.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Delegation of Authority </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission (FTC).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Delegation of authority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission is delegating certain functions in matters wherein a majority of the members of the Commission are
unable to resolve or dispose of a matter as a result of recusals. This delegation shall expire at such time as the Commission
has a full complement of five members. It is limited to actions affecting parties or interveners that have waived their
right to review by the full Commission, or where no such right would be involved. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Commission Rule 0.7, 16 CFR 0.7, provides that the Commission, pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961 (75 Stat.
837, 26 FR 6191), may delegate, by published order or rule, certain of its functions to a division of the Commission,
an individual Commissioner, or others within the Commission. As noted in section 1(a) of the Plan, this authority
supplements the Commission's inherent authority to delegate its functions. 




The Commission has determined that there may be instances in which it would be unable to resolve or dispose of certain
matters because recusals result in the absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. 

See 

Commission Rule 4.14(a), 16 CFR 4.14(a) (Commission quorum). Under these circumstances, the Commission believes
that delegation of its authority to act to the remaining Commissioner or Commissioners eligible to participate in
the matter would be appropriate. 

Accordingly, the Commission has determined to delegate its functions, subject to certain limitations, when no quorum
is available for the transaction of business. First, the delegate or delegates is authorized to act in matters in which
no party or intervener would be adversely affected by the Commission's action and entitled to seek review by the full
Commission, as provided by section 1(b) of the Plan. Second, the delegate or delegates is authorized to act in matters
where a party or intervener would be adversely affected and entitled to seek such review, but the affected party or
intervener has waived such right. In either instance, the delegation would not adversely affect the procedural rights
of the relevant party or intervener. 

This delegation is not subject to re-delegation, and is not intended to alter or affect existing delegations to Commission
staff. The delegation shall expire at such time as the Commission has a full complement of five members. 




By direction of the Commission, Commissioner Azcuenaga abstaining with a separate statement.

Separate Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga 



Delegation of Authority in Absence of Quroum 



Today the Commission announces a new procedure to delegate ``certain functions in matters wherein a majority of the
members of the Commission are unable to resolve or dispose of a matter as a result of recusals.'' Although I have considered
the merits of the new delegation procedure, I abstain from expressing a view because the factual context in which the
procedure was proposed and debated makes clear to me that the delegation is intended to affect the merits of one or more
matters on which I am not participating by reason of recusal. Specifically, it seems clear that the Commission's intention
in adopting the delegation is to make possible before judicial review certain changes in two final orders recently
issued by the Commission following full adjudicative proceedings. Although the delegate or delegates will decide
what changes, if any, to make in these orders, it is also clear to me what those changes now are expected to be. 

I have received advice that it would not be inappropriate for me to vote on the merits of the new delegation procedure.
I have considered the merits of the new delegation in a manner consistent with my recusal in the cases to which I have
alluded, but in my view, given the context and timing of the motion, a substantive vote on the delegation would be inconsistent
with those recusals. I have chosen, therefore, to abstain. I regret that I am constrained from expressing a view on
the merits of today's action.

Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for the Steamboat Buckwheat (Eriogonum Ovalifolium var. Williamsiae) for
Review and Comment




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the endangered Steamboat buckwheat (

Eriogonum ovalifolium 

var. 

williamsiae

). This plant species is endemic to substrates derived from the deposits of a single hot spring in the Steamboat Hills,
southern Washoe County, Nevada. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) endangered species
program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed
species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation
of the species, establish criteria for reclassification or delisting, and estimate time and cost for implementing
the recovery measures needed.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.


Eriogonum ovalifolium 

var. 

williamsiae 

is endemic to substrates derived from the deposits of a single hot spring in the Steamboat Hills, southern Washoe County,
Nevada. This plant is locally abundant, but apparently restricted to approximately 20 hectares (ha) of plants in
an area of approximately 100-150 ha. Populations and habitat of 

Eriogonum ovalifolium 

var. 

williamsiae 

are threatened by a variety of activities, including geothermal resource development, commercial and industrial
construction, highway expansion, and off-road vehicle travel. The habitat for this taxon is under both private ownership
and Federal management.
Recovery of 

Eriogonum ovalifolium 

var. 

williamsiae 

will require protection of its habitat from adverse physical and biological modifications, identification of factors
limiting long-term population viability, and public information and education.


Public Comments Solicited


The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
will be considered prior to approval of the plan.


Authority


The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Notice.




In the matter of: Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for a Permit to Allow Incidental
Take of the Threatened Northern Spotted Owl by Weyerhaueser Company on its Millicoma Tree Farm in Coos and Douglas
Counties, Oregon.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that Weyerhaueser Company (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as
amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit number PRT-796822. The requested permit would authorize
the incidental take of the threatened northern spotted owl (

Strix occidentalis caurina

) on the Millicoma Tree Farm in Coos and Douglas Counties, Oregon. The proposed incidental take would occur as a result
of timber harvest activities in northern spotted owl habitat.


The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed issuance of the
incidental take permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy
Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Under section 9 of the Act and its implementing regulations, ``taking'' of the northern spotted owl, a threatened
species, is prohibited. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take threatened
wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations
governing permits for threatened species are in 50 CFR 17.32.

The Applicant proposes to implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the spotted owl that will allow timber harvest
on portions of approximately 209,000 acres of the Applicant's land in Coos and Douglas Counties, Oregon. The Applicant's
proposed timber harvest may result in the take, as defined in the Act and its implementing regulations, of any owls
in the harvest area. The HCP and permit would be in effect for 50 years with the possibility of extending the permit with
10 year extensions, for a total of an additional 30 years, given certain biological and economic criteria are met.
The application includes an HCP and Implementation Agreement.

The Applicant proposes to mitigate for the incidental take by maintaining at least 40 percent of the tree farm in dispersal
habitat with limitations on gap size between habitat blocks; retaining 1,592 acres of existing forest habitat for
20 years to enhance the dispersal landscape and productive capability at 4 known spotted owl sites; retaining 371
acres of existing forest habitat adjacent to 4 known spotted owl sites on Federal lands near the tree farm for 20 years;
protecting at least 70 acres of nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat around all occupied sites. The Applicant
will minimize take by prohibiting timber harvest and road construction within 0.25 miles of active spotted owl nests
during the active breeding season, March 1 through September 30 each year.

The EA considers the environmental consequences of four alternatives, including the proposed action and no-take
alternatives. The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a) of the Act that would authorize incidental
take of spotted owls on the Applicant's private landholding of the 209,000-acre permit area, and require implementation
of the Habitat Conservation Plan. Under the no-take alternative, the applicant would avoid incidental take of spotted
owls and the permit would not be issued. The third alternative is to manage the tree farm for dispersal habitat without
retaining any nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat. The fourth alternative is to manage the tree farm for dispersal
habitat, and simultaneously avoid the incidental take of selected spotted own pairs.

<DOCTITLE>Housing Guaranty Program; Notice of Investment Opportunity</DOCTITLE>



The purpose of this notice is to provide advance notice to interested firms that Nedcor Bank Limited of South Africa
(``Nedcor'') intends to request proposals for the services of a U.S. financial institution to raise funds in the U.S.
market pursuant to the U.S. Agency for International Development's (``USAID'') Housing Guaranty Program. Nedcor
will seek to borrow US$30 million, or the South African Commercial Rand equivalent thereof (the ``Loan''). Nedcor's
long-term objective is to develop a relationship with a U.S. financial institution that will provide Nedcor with
future access to the U.S. capital market. For the purpose of this particular transaction, Nedcor intends to request
proposals on an expedited basis. Therefore, upon receipt of this notice, interested firms should promptly communicate
with Nedcor's representative, Dr. Brennan Nelson, at the following address:



South Africa Project No. 674-HG-001, Housing Guaranty Loan No. 674-HG-001 A01



Postal Address 



Nedcor Bank Unlimited, P.O. Box 1144, Johannesburg 2000, Republic of South Africa, Attn: Dr. Brennan Nelson (Branch
858)



Physical Address 



Nedcor Bank Limited, 100 Main Street, 8th Floor, Johannesburg 2000, Republic of South Africa, Attn: Dr. Brennan Nelson
(Branch 858)




Dr. Nelson will be available, upon issuance of this notice, to answer questions concerning this transaction and the
programs it will support by telephone at (27 11) 630-7365; and by facsimile transmission at (27 11) 630-7231
or (27 11) 630-7584.

Firms interested in responding to this notice must do so by 12:00 noon, Eastern Standard Time, on January 4, 1995, by
submitting their bids to Nedcor at the address specified above. Copies of all bids should be simultaneously sent to
the following: Mr. David Grossman, Assistant Director, Mr. Peter Pirnie, Financial Advisor, Facsimile (preferred
communication): (202) 663-2772 and (703) 875-4384.

Within 48 hours after the closing time for submission of proposals, Nedcor, with the approval of USAID, will select
the financial institution(s) deemed best qualified to arrange the financing on terms most advantageous to Nedcor.
Thereafter, Nedcor would seek to close the transaction within 30 days after it has notified the successful financial
institution(s) that its proposal has been accepted, but in no event later than 45 days after such notification.



Additional Information



Provided below is a preliminary description of the terms of the financing. Nedcor reserves the right, however, to
change these terms after the selection process based upon advice from the consultations with the successful respondent.



I. Background



The Loan will be guaranteed by the U.S. Government acting through USAID. The Loan will be part of the U.S. Government's
special aid package in support of the democratic transition in South Africa. It will be the first of its kind to a private
sector bank in South Africa. The funds generated by this Loan will be used to provide the initial funding for a home mortgage
program dedicated to servicing the large and immediate needs of South African Black families for housing.

The Loan will be either a fixed-rate or a floating rate, 8-year, non-amortizing (bullet) loan, denominated in either
United States dollars or South African Rand, and will be made available to Nedcor at any of its branches. Restrictions
may be placed on the transferability of the promissory notes evidencing the Loan, in the event such notes are denominated
in Rand. All transactions concerning the Loan must be reported to both Nedcor and USAID.

The Loan will be backed by a full faith and credit guaranty as to payment of both principal and interest of the United
States of America, acting through USAID. The guaranty will be issued pursuant to the authority of Section 222 of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the ``Act''). In the event the Loan is disbursed in Rand, USAID's liability
under its guaranty of the Rand obligations of Nedcor shall be limited to (1) The Rand equivalent of U.S. $30 million
in principal, plus (2) the Rand equivalent of the total aggregate interest payments due over the life of the loan as

In order to assure compliance with statutory provisions binding USAID, USAID reserves the right to accelerate the
Loan only in the extraordinary event of a material breach by Nedcor of its obligations with regard to the use of the proceeds
of the Loan. It should be noted that since the inception of the Housing Guaranty Program in 1962, USAID has not exercised
its right of acceleration.


II. Objectives of the Proposed Financing


The objectives of Nedcor with respect to the proposed financing are to:
A. Minimize the cost of financing the Loan to Nedcor, and thereby minimize its debt payments, consistent with the other
objectives stated herein.
B. Minimize the ongoing administrative costs of financing the program.
C. Establish a positive precedent, in terms of market perceptions, for contemplated future offerings of similar
securities by Nedcor.


III. Diversity of Investors and Financial Services Firms


Nedcor desires to encourage the participation of minority- and women-owned and controlled investors and financial
services providers to the maximum extent practicable in the financing of the Loan. To this end, Nedcor strongly encourages
such firms to respond to this notice, either directly or through a consortium or some other joint venture arrangement.
Nedcor also strongly encourages that all firms proposing to provide financial services make efforts to offer the
investment opportunity to such minority- and women-owned and controlled investors, and to other investors who have
a long-term commitment to supporting South Africa's democratic transition.


IV. Scope of Services


In order to accomplish Nedcor's objectives, the provider of financial services will need to offer the following:
A. Market the Loan to Eligible U.S. investors and, in the event the promissory notes evidencing the Loan are denominated
in Rand, market the Loan to accredited eligible U.S. investors.
B. Provide a mechanism for notification to USAID in the case of any default on the part of Nedcor, in the event the promissory
notes evidencing the Loan are denominated in Rand.
C. Advise and assist in obtaining any necessary exemptions or approvals from securities exchanges, governmental
securities regulators or other institutions, and any necessary legal opinions.
D. Provide a detailed listing and full disclosure of all fees and costs for the transaction, which must be inclusive
of all legal, consulting, and management fees, and costed into the final rate/result.

V. Required Information for Proposals



Each proposal for the provision of banking services will need to address the questions set forth in this section, in
the order shown and as specifically and succinctly as possible.



A. Structure of Loan



You will need to discuss your financial institution's views with respect to the structure of the Loan that would best
serve Nedcor's objectives, addressing at a minimum the following issues:

1. The terms of the financing have not yet been determined and are subject to USAID's approval. However, for purposes
of your proposal, you will need to provide a complete set of financial forms detailing the costs you expect Nedcor would
incur as a result of your recommended financing, based on the financing of US$30 million, and in terms of the following
two scenarios:

a. Rand-denominated Loan:

(i) Fixed rate, eight-year, non-amortizing (bullet).

b. United States dollar-denominated Loan:

(i) Fixed rate, eight-year, non-amortizing (bullet), and based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury bond with a remaining
life of eight years, such as the bond due November 2002; and

(ii) Floating rate, eight-year, non-amortizing (bullet), and based on the yield of the twenty-six (26) week U.S.
Treasury bill as of COB December 18, 1994 (indicative).

Please specify the fees you would charge to provide banking services. You will also need to include an itemization
of all legal fees, management fees, consultation fees, selling concession fees and costs of issuance.

2. Discuss any alternative structures which should be considered.



B. Marketing Strategy



You will need to discuss your financial institution's view of the optimal strategy for the marketing of the Loan, keeping
in mind the requirements for any exemptions from securities registration being relied upon.



C. Organizational Experience and Capabilities



Because Nedcor's overall objective is to develop a long-term banking relationship and not simply to arrange for this
US$30 million financing, firms responding to this notice will be required to provide more information than may be
typical for a loan of this size. Accordingly, you will need to provide the following information on your organization:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941130-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941130-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. A brief, general description of your financial institution. Enclose your audited financial information for the
two most recent periods under separate cover.

2. Your financial institution's ``equity capital position'' (net capital) and ``excess net capital position''
based on Securities and Exchange Commission regulations for uniform reporting (if applicable).

3. A discussion of your financial institution's qualifications to serve as lead provider of financial services for
the Loan, including in particular:

a. Experience in bringing U.S. Government-guaranteed securities to the market;

b. A description of your financial institution's capacity to provide financial services and distribution and marketing
capabilities in the U.S., including examples of significant debt-offerings managed by your firm during the last
five years;

c. Any other relevant experience or particular strength that would give your firm a distinct competitive advantage
in providing the services required.



D. Qualifications of Personnel



You will need to provide the following information:

1. The names and relevant experience of the professionals, including any key sales and distribution personnel, to
be assigned to this matter, with a description of each individual's role.

2. If you would expect to rely on outside advisors, such as legal counsel, accountants or local representatives, you
will need to identify the persons or firms which you propose to retain.



VI. Criteria for Selection



Selection of the provider(s) of financial services and the terms of the Loan will be initially subject to the individual
discretion of Nedcor and thereafter will be subject to the approval of USAID. Disbursements under the Loan will be
subject to certain conditions required of Nedcor by USAID as set forth in agreements between Nedcor and USAID. Awards
will be made to the proposals found to be most advantageous to Nedcor based on the following criteria, and such other
criteria as Nedcor may determine:



A. Financial Plan



Ability to minimize Nedcor's financing costs; and



B. Previous Experience, Distribution Capabilities, and Personnel



The firm's experience with similar, previous financing programs executed primarily in the U.S. capital markets,
the extent of the firm's distribution network, and experience of specified assigned personnel.

Information as to the eligibility of investors and other aspects of the USAID housing guaranty program can be obtained

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


Neville Jack, M.D., Revocation of Registration 


On September 7, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Neville Jack, M.D., of Tampa, Florida, proposing to revoke his DEA Certificate
of Registration, BJ0575603, under 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(4) and (5), and deny any pending applications for registration
as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Jack's continued registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest, and that he had been excluded from participation in a program pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a).
The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail and delivered to Dr. Jack on September 12, 1994, at his registered
location in Tampa, Florida. No response was received from Dr. Jack or anyone purporting to represent him.
Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Jack was waived his opportunity for a hearing.
The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order
under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.57.
The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Jack was convicted, on December 16, 1991, in the Circuit Court of Hillsborough
County, Florida upon his plea of nolo contendere, of seven misdemeanor counts of petit theft related to the provision
of Medicaid services. He was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay restitution. On July 14, 1992, the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mandatorily excluded Dr. Jack from the Medicare program for a period
of five years and directed that he be excluded from state programs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a) by virtue
of his conviction of criminal offenses defined in 42 U.S.C. 1128(a), and 1128(b)(1-3).
The Deputy Administrator further finds that on January 4, 1994, Dr. Jack was convicted of the felony of retaliation
against a witness in the above noted state case and sentenced to four years probation.
The Deputy Administrator may revoke or suspend a DEA Certificate of Registration under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), upon a finding
that the registrant:
(1) Has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of
this chapter;
(2) Has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United
States, or of any state relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance;
(3) Has had his state license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent state authority and is no
longer authorized by state law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances
or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of registration recommended by competent state authority;
(4) Has committed such acts as would render his registration under section 823 of this title inconsistent with the
public interest as determined under such section;
(5) Has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to Section 1320a-7(a)
of Title 42.
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors will be considered:
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local was relating to controlled substances.
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health or safety.''
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. 

Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D., 

Docket No. 88-42, 54 FR 16422 (1989).
The Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Jack's conduct underlying his state convictions threatens the public health
and safety. Thus, his continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest. The Deputy Administrator
further finds that Dr. Jack has been excluded from participation in a program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a).
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Dr. Jack's registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C.
824(a)(4) & (5).
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
BJ0575603, previously issued to Neville Jack, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and that any pending applications
for registration, be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective December 30, 1994.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office of program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.



Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.

This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) and conduct scoping for the development and testing
of liquid-fuel engines and components for the Advanced Propulsion Technology Program.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts
1500-1508), and NASA policy and regulations (14 CFR 1216 Subpart 1216.3), NASA intends to prepare an EIS for
its proposed Advanced Propulsion Technology Program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Program''). NASA is considering
a wide variety of liquid-fuel engines to accommodate the propulsion requirements of a new space vehicle(s) that would
be the focus of the Access to Space initiative. The proposed Program would consist of (1) testing new and advanced engines
and components for possible use in developing the new space vehicle(s) and (2) modifying government-owned facilities
to support the Program. Two of the sites being considered for the testing are Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in
Huntsville, Alabama, and John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC) near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

To meet the technical and programmatic challenges of developing a new space vehicle(s), key advanced technologies
in propulsion systems must be explored. The Program would be designed to demonstrate the technology maturity levels
necessary to reduce the development risk of the selected propulsion system(s) to an acceptable level and to produce
a highly operable, high thrust-to weight propulsion system. Therefore, NASA is proposing to develop and test one
or more liquid engines and components that could be used in the final configuration(s) of a new space vehicle(s). Engines
under consideration would use liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The fuel would be either liquid hydrogen, kerosene,
or a combination of the two.






Facilities under consideration for testing these engines include, but are not necessarily limited to, those located
at MSFC and SSC. Existing test facilities at these two NASA Centers would need to be upgraded to accommodate Program
objectives. Modification may include addition of a kerosene tank on the test stand(s), a common structural and functional
interface, and an engine mounting adapter. Many aspects of the Program would parallel test activities of propulsion
systems undertaken in the 1960's for the Apollo Program.





All test facilities at MSFC are located in the southern portion of the Center; in turn, MSFC is almost centrally located
within Redstone Arsenal's 15,400 hectares (38,000 acres), with the closest private property being approximately
4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the proposed MSFC test facilities. SSC occupies 5,480 hectares (13,480 acres) in western
Hancock County, Mississippi, and is surrounded by 50,600 hectares (125,000 acres of acoustical buffer zone.




Alternatives for this proposal include, but are not necessarily limited to, (1) alternative test sites, (2) test
facility construction and modification options, (3) alternative fuels and engines, and (4) cancellation of the
proposed Program (``no action'').




The EIS will consider the potential environmental impacts associated with the Program and any needed construction
or modification of facilities. An initial assessment of environmental effects suggests that the greatest impacts
are likely to arise from noise and air emissions. However, analysis indicates that air quality would remain within
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards at both MSFC and SSC. IF MSFC and/or SSC were selected, little environmental
impact is anticipated on biological resources, threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, wetlands,
and recreational or scenic areas.



A public scoping meeting will be held near MSFC at the Ridgecrest Elementary School, 3505 Cerro Vista SW, Huntsville,
Alabama, on December 6, 1994, starting at 7:00 pm. Another such meeting will be held near SSC at the Hancock County High
School, 7084 Stennis Airport Drive, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, on December 13, 1994, starting at 7:00 pm.




Written public input and comments on environmental issues of the proposed Program, including, but not limited to,
test site and facility options and fuel and engine alternatives, as well as related environmental concerns, are hereby
solicited.

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co.; Haddam Neck Plant Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO, the licensee), for operation
of the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut. 



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



The proposed amendment would revise the Haddam Neck Technical Specification (TS) Table 3.3-2, ``Engineered
Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation,'' Table 3.3-3, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation
System Instrumentation Trip Setpoints,'' and Table 4.3-2, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System
Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,'' and their associated Bases sections, to reflect the addition of
permissive interlocks on the core deluge system motor-operated valves. The proposed action is in accordance with
the licensee's amendment request dated August 4, 1994. 



The Need for the Proposed Action



CYAPCO is planning to install permissive interlocks on the core deluge valves SI-MOV-871A and B. The permissive
interlocks will serve to block the opening of these valves until the reactor coolant pressure (RCS) has decreased
below a specified setpoint. This modification is necessary to ensure that should an inadvertent safety injection
actuation signal (SIAS) occur, the low pressure safety injection (LPSI) isolation valves would not open and expose
the LPSI system piping, which has a design rating of 600 psi, to the normal operating pressure of the RCS, which is approximately
2000 psi. To assure the operability of the new permissive interlocks the licensee has proposed adding various components
of the interlock system to the TS. In addition, the Bases section will be modified to include a discussion on the functioning
of the core deluge motor-operated valves and their control circuitry. 



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



In the present design a large break LOCA will generate a safety injection signal which will open the core deluge valves
SI-MOV-871A and B to provide borated water to the reactor vessel. The new design will install redundant
open permissive interlocks in the core deluge valve control circuitry to prevent opening of these valves on a SIAS
until the RCS pressure falls below 1135 psig. This permissive interlock system has been included in the TS to assure
its operability. The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed modifications and the associated TS
changes and concludes that the modifications and TS changes will decrease the possibility of an intersystem loss-of-coolant-accident
(LOCA) without compromising the previously performed LOCA analysis. The RPS control cabinets were previously evaluated
and approved by the NRC. The proposed changes to the RPS TS as result of the new interlocks are similar to previous RPS
TS analog-to-digital changes. 

The proposed TS change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in
the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual
or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological environmental impacts associated with this proposed TS amendment. 

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does involve features located entirely
within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has
no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. 



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed amendment,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the amendment would be to deny the amendment request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment
and would result in unjustified cost to the licensee.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Haddam Neck Plant.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments. 



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment. 

For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated August 4, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC, and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown
CT 06547.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact, Georgia Power Co., et al.; Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2 </DOCTITLE>

 

This U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-57 and NPF-5, issued to Georgia Power Company (GPC or the licensee), for operation of
the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Appling County, Georgia. 

 

Environmental Assessment 

 

Identification of the Proposed Action 

 

The proposed amendments will replace the existing Technical Specifications (TS) in their entirety with the Improved
Technical Specifications (ITS). The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's amendment request dated
February 25, 1994, and supplemented July 8, August 8 and August 31, September 23, October 19, and November 1, 1994.


 

The Need for the Proposed Action 

 

It has been recognized that nuclear safety in all plants would benefit from improvement and standardization of TS.
The ``NRC'' Interim Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors,'' (52
FR 3788 dated February 6, 1987) and later the Final Policy Statement, formalized this need. To facilitate the development
of individual ITS, each reactor vendor owners group (OG) and the NRC staff developed standard technical specifications.
For General Electric (GE) plants, the standard TS (STS) are found in NUREG-1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications,
General Electric Plants, BWR/4,'' dated September 1992, which formed the basis of the Hatch ITS. The NRC Committee
to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR) reviewed the STS, made not of its safety merits, and indicated its support of
conversion by operating plants to the STS. 

 

Description of the Proposed Change 

 

The proposed revision to the TS is based on NUREG-1433 and on guidance provided in the Policy Statement. Its objective
is to completely rewrite, reformat, and streamline the existing TS. Emphasis is placed on human factors principles
to improve clarity and understanding. The Bases section has been significantly expanded to clarify and better explain
the purpose and foundation of each specification. In addition to NUREG-1433, portions of the existing TS were
also used as the basis for the ITS. Plant-specific issues (unique design features, requirements, and operating practices)
were discussed at length with the licensee, and generic matters were discussed with the licensee, GE, and other OGs.


 The proposed changes from the existing TS can be grouped into four general categories, as follows: 

 

Non-Technical (administrative)

 changes were intended to make the ITS easier to use for plant operations personnel. They are purely editorial in nature
or involve the movement or reformat of requirements without affecting technical content. Every section of the Hatch
TS has undergone these types of changes. In order to ensure consistency, the NRC staff and GPC have used NUREG-1433
as guidance to reformat and make other administrative changes. 

 

Relocation of requirements

 includes items that were in the existing Hatch TS, but did not meet the criteria set forth in the Policy Statement for
inclusion in TS.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941130-2-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941130-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In general, the proposed relocation of items in the Hatch TS to the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR), appropriate
plant-specific programs, procedures, and ITS Bases follows the guidance of the GE STS, NUREG-1433. Once these
items have been relocated by removing them from the TS to other licensee-controlled documents, the licensee may revise
them under the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59 or other NRC staff-approved control mechanisms which provide appropriate
procedural means to control changes.


More restrictive requirements

 are those proposed Hatch ITS items that are either more conservative than corresponding requirements in the existing
Hatch TS, or are additional restrictions which are not in the existing Hatch TS, but are contained in NUREG-1433.
Examples of more restrictive requirements include: placing a Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) on plant equipment
which is not required by the present TS to be operable; more restrictive requirements to restore inoperable equipment;
and more restrictive surveillance requirements.


Less restrictive requirements

 are relaxations of corresponding requirements in the existing Hatch TS which provided little or no safety benefit
or placed unnecessary burden on the licensee. These relaxations were the result of generic NRC actions or other analyses.
They have been justified on a case-by-case basis for Hatch as described in the Safety Evaluation to be issued with the
license amendment, which will be noticed in the 

Federal Register.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS. Changes which are administrative
in nature have been found to have no effect on technical content of the TS, and are acceptable. The increased clarity
and understanding these changes bring to the TS are expected to improve the operator's control of the plant in normal
and accident conditions.
Relocation of requirements to other licensee-controlled documents does not change the requirements themselves.
Future changes to these requirements may be made by the licensee under 10 CFR 50.59 or other NRC-approved control mechanisms,
which assure continued maintenance of adequate requirements. All such relocations have been found to be in conformance
with the guidelines of NUREG-1433 and the Policy Statements, and, therefore, to be acceptable.
Changes involving more restrictive requirements have been found to be acceptable.
Changes involving less restrictive requirements have been reviewed individually. When requirements have been
shown to provide little or no safety benefit or to place unnecessary burden on the licensee, their removal from the
TS was justified. In most cases, relaxations previously granted to individual plants on a plant-specific basis were
the result of a generic NRC action, or of agreements reached during discussions with the OG and found to be acceptable
for Hatch. Generic relaxations contained in NUREG-1433 have also been reviewed by the NRC staff and have been
found to be acceptable.
In summary, the proposed revision to the TS was found to provide control of plant operations such that reasonable assurance
will be provided that the health and safety of the public will be adequately protected.
These TS changes will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types
of an effluent that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed TS amendments.
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed amendment involves features located entirely
within the restricted areas as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluent and has
no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed amendments,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the amendments would be to deny the amendment request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with the State of Georgia regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.



Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment.
For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's submittals dated February 25, as supplemented
July 8, August 8 and 31, September 23, October 19, and November 1, 1994. The submittals are available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the

<DOCTITLE>GPU Nuclear Corp.; Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-16, issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (the licensee), for operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear
Generating Station, located in Ocean County, New Jersey.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of the Proposed Action


The proposed action would delete Technical Specification Section 2.3.0 and its associated bases. The amendment
would remove the limiting safety system setting for a high recirculation flow reactor scram based on a maximum attainable
recirculation flow analysis.
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated June 24, 1994, as supplemented
by letter dated September 30, 1994.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed action would delete the high recirculation flow scram setpoint of " 117% of rated flow since the licensee
has analytically demonstrated that the flow scram setpoint is not necessary.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that deletion of the high recirculation
flow reactor scram based on a maximum attainable flow analysis performed by the licensee with respect to safety system
settings and thermal safety limit analysis is acceptable.
The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with the New Jersey State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 24 1994, as supplemented
by letter dated September 30, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document

<DOCTITLE>Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2 and 3; Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1
and 2; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33, DPR-52, DPR-68, DPR-77, DPR-79.
These licenses are issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant
Units 1, 2 and 3 (BFN) located in Limestone County, Alabama, and the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (SQN) located
in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee. In addition, by this action, the Commission is considering issuing a similar exemption
to TVA's Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (WBN) located at TVA's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately
50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Operating licensers have not been issued for WBN; they are currently
under Construction Permits CPPR-91 and CPPR-92, for Units 1 and 2 respectively.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


The proposed action is in accordance with the TVA's application dated October 24, 1994, for exemption from certain
requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for Physical Protection of Licensed Activities in Nuclear Power Reactors
Against Radiological Sabotage.'' The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometrics system
to control site access at BFN, SQN, and WBN so that photograph identification badges for non-TVA employees who have
been granted unescorted access into protected and vital areas may be taken offsite.




The Need for the Proposed Action



Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), TVA shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and
security organization. Regulation 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``licensee
shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Regulation 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) specifies
that, ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access
to protected areas without escort.'' Regulation 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by
the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual
``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected
area. * * *''
Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of BFN and SQN (with plans to establish a similar system at WBN)
plants is controlled through the use of a photograph on a badge/keycard (hereafter referred to as a ``badge''), which
is stored at the access point when not in use. The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the
badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both TVA employees and contractor personnel
who have been granted unescorted access are given to the individuals at the entrance location upon entry and are returned
upon exit. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), the badges are not allowed to be taken offsite.

<DOCNO> FR941130-2-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941130-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

TVA proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need to issue
and retrieve badges at the entry point and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep their badges
with them when departing the site.

An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors to take their badges offsite instead of returning
them when exiting the site.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of TVA's application. Under the proposed system, each individual who
is authorized unescorted access would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered
with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places
the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics
of the hand image would be compared with the previously stored template to verify authorization for entry. Individuals,
including TVA employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site.

Based on a Sandia report entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices`` (SAND91_0276-UC-906
Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on its experience with the current photo-identification system, TVA
demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system would provide enhanced site access control. Since both the badge
and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would provide a positive
verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge offsite, would not
enable unauthorized entry into protected areas. TVA will implement a process for periodically testing the proposed
system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical
Security Plans for all plants will be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control
system and to allow TVA employees and contractors to take their badges offsite.

TVA has determined that the proposed hand geometry access control process for identifying personnel meets the American
National Standard ANSI/ANS-3.3, ``Security for Nuclear Power Plants'' criteria. It will provide the same
high assurance objective regarding onsite physical protection as provided by the photo-identification process
now in use.

The access process will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. A numbered pictured badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escorts.
Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.

Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect non-radiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application
would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and
the alternative action are similar.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements
related to operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, dated September 1, 1972; the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, dated
February 13, 1974; or the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, dated December 1978.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the State of Tennessee and Alabama regarding the environmental impact of the proposed
action.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated October 24, 1994 which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC; at the local public
document room located at the Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama (for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant);
and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 (for the Sequoyah
Nuclear Plant and the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant).

<DOCTITLE>Availability of the License Application Review Plan for a Geologic Repository for Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level
Radioactive Waste_Draft Review Plan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is announcing the availability of NUREG-1323, ``The License Application
Review Plan for a Geologic Repository for Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste_Draft Review Plan.''




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The License Application Review Plan (LARP) provides guidance to the NRC staff who will review the U.S. Department
of Energy's (DOE's) license application to construct a mined geologic repository for the disposal of spent nuclear
fuel and other high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The LARP is intended to ensure the quality
and uniformity of the staff reviews and establishes the appropriate review priorities, and presents a well-defined
base from which to evaluate proposed changes in the scope and requirements of staff reviews. Because it is a public
document, it will also make available to DOE and other interested parties information on the staff's review process
so that they may better understand the review strategies, procedures, and acceptance criteria that the staff will
use.




In developing the LARP at this time, there are numerous benefits to be realized by the NRC staff. First, the LARP will
help structure and coordinate the staff's efforts to develop a well-integrated review capability supported by the
staff's independent technical assessment capability and the results of NRC-sponsored research. Second, identifying
technical issues most important to geologic repository performance will help focus and prioritize the prelicense
application reviews, independent technical assessment capabilities, and research needed by the staff. Third,
the regulatory and technical basis for the staff's pre-license application reviews and guidance will be improved
due to the focus on regulatory and technical issues.

The LARP is divided into three parts. Part A contains the License Application Review Strategy, which gives general
guidance to the staff in conducting its license application reviews. Part B contains eight individual review plans,
to be used by the staff to review general information in the license application. Part C contains 89 individual review
plans, distributed among ten chapters, which the staff will use to review the Safety Analysis Report, the principal
part of the license application in which DOE provides the information needed to demonstrate compliance with the technical
requirements of 10 CFR Part 60. The organization of the individual review plans in Parts B and C is consistent with the
organization of the license application as specified in the draft regulatory guide ``Format and Content for the License
Application for the High-Level Waste Repository.'' Finally, each individual review plan has a standard format consisting
of the following seven sections:

(1) Applicable [10 CFR Part 60] Regulatory Requirements;

(2) Review Strategy;

(3) Review Procedures and Acceptance Criteria;

(4) Implementation;

(5) Example Evaluation Findings; and

(6) References.

This draft version, designated Revision 0, represents the staff's initial efforts in developing the LARP. Beginning
with this version, the staff anticipates issuing a revision to the draft LARP each year through 2000, culminating
with the issuance of the LARP in 2001. Each revision of the draft LARP will contain the work completed by the staff during
that particular year. Revision 0 and subsequent revisions of the draft LARP are preliminary documents and, as such,
are subject to change.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Notice of Intention To Cancel Registrations of Certain Investment Advisers



November 22, 1994.



Notice is given that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') intends to issue an order, pursuant
to Section 203(h) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Act''), cancelling the registrations of those investment
advisers whose names appear in the attached Appendix.

Section 203(h) provides, in pertinent part, that if the Commission finds that any person registered under Section
203, or who has pending an application for registration filed under that section, is no longer in existence, or is not
engaged in business as an investment adviser, the Commission shall by order, cancel the registration of such person.

Paragraph (b) of Rule 204-1, requires an investment adviser to file promptly an amendment to its application
for registration (Form ADV) and when its address changes or when certain other information becomes inaccurate in
a material manner.
 The Commission has been sending all registrants a booklet of registration materials annually since 1987. Each booklet
contains copies of Forms ADV, ADV-S, ADV-E and ADV-W.
 These forms, when properly filed, are used to update the Commission's records. Since the 1990 mailing, the Commission
has had correspondence for each of the registrants listed in the Appendix returned as ``undeliverable'' (addressee
unknown, forwarding order expired, or no longer at this address) by the U.S. Postal Service. The Commission's records
indicate that these registrants have not filed amendments to their registration, reflecting their current business
and/or mailing addresses, as required by Rule 204-1(b). The Commission's records also indicate that many of
these registrants have not made annual filings of Form ADV-S, as required by Rule 204-1(c). Accordingly,
the Division of Investment Management believes that reasonable grounds exist for a finding that these registrants
are no longer in existence or are no longer engaged in business as investment advisers.






Notice is also given that any interested person may, by January 6, 1995, at 5:30 P.M., submit to the Commission in writing
a request for a hearing on the cancellations, accompanied by a statement as to the nature of his interest, the reason
for such request, and the issues, if any, of fact or law proposed to be controverted, and he may request that he be notified
if the Commission should order a hearing thereon. Any such communication should be addressed: Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549.

At any time after January 6, 1995, the Commission may issue an order cancelling any or all of the investment advisers
listed in the Appendix, upon the basis of the information stated above, unless an order for a hearing on the cancellation
shall be issued upon request or upon the Commission's own motion. Persons who requested a hearing, or to be advised
as to whether a hearing is ordered, will receive any notices and orders issued in this matter, including the date of
the hearing (if ordered) and any postponements thereof.

For further information contact: Robert L. Lewis, Staff Accountant at (202) 942-0517 (Division of Investment
Management, Office of Financial Analysis).

<DOCTITLE>Consolidated Tape Association; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Sixteenth Charges Amendment to
the Restated Consolidated Tape Association Plan</DOCTITLE>



November 23, 1994.



Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on November
18, 1994, the Consolidated Tap Association (``CTA'') and Consolidated Quotation (``CQ'') Plan Participants filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') amendments to the Restated CTA Plan increasing
CTA charges to ticker subscribers. The new rates are effective as of January 1, 1995.

CTA/CQ has designated the proposals as changing a charge collected on behalf of all the participants, permitting
them to become effective upon filing, pursuant to the terms of Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(3)(i) under the Act. The Commission
is publishing this notice to solicit comments from interested persons on the amendments.



I. Description and Purpose of the Amendments



The purpose of the amendment is to recover the ticker network expense increases that common carriers have recently
imposed on the CTA Plan Participants. The present fees of $110.00 per connection for Network A and Network B have been
in effect since 1985. Since 1985, each of the Networks has absorbed a number of increases in common carrier costs. The
most recent increases effected in August 1994, however, were significant and CTA has determined to pass the increased
costs along to customers. Effective January 1, 1995, Network A charges will increase to $160.00 for those subscribers
in the continental USA that are serviced via the AT&T terrestrial network that Dow Jones manages for the CTA Plan
Participants and to existing customers located in Montreal and Toronto; the fee for all other locations in Canada
will be based on the cost of delivering the ticker signal to the subscriber. Rates for subscribers located south of
Chambers Street in New York City, where facilities are leased from NYNEX, and for customers presently receiving the
signal via satellite, remain unchanged. Network B charges will increase to $130.00 per unit, effective January 1,
1995, for all customers presently receiving service in the continental USA and Toronto, Canada, including subscribers
in downtown New York City and those currently receiving the ticker signal via satellite; the fee for all other locations
in Canada will be based on the cost of delivering the ticker to the subscriber.



II. Solicitation of Comments 



Rule 11Aa-3(c)(3) under the Act provides that the proposed amendment may be put into effect upon filing with
the Commission. The Commission may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling
and approval of the amendments by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c) (2), if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance
of fair and orderly markets, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National Market System, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the CTA/CQ. All submission should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by December
21, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change
and Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to Permanent Approval
of the Modified Trading System Pilot Program</DOCTITLE>



November 22, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 21, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I
and II below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on November
14, 1994.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested
persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE is requesting permanent approval of its Modified Trading System pilot program (``MTS Pilot Program'').
 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to obtain permanent approval of the Exchange's MTS Pilot Program.
 Under Exchange Rule 8.80(a), the MTS Pilot Program has been authorized by the Commission to operate through November
30, 1994.
 The proposed rule change would amend Exchange rule 8.80(a) to delete the expiration date for the MTS Pilot Program
that is contained in the rule.

The Exchange's MTS Pilot Program permits the CBOE to assign a Designated Primary Market Maker (``DPM'') for options
classes traded at the Exchange. A DPM is a CBOE member who functions in assigned securities as market-maker, floor
broker, and order book official.





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in particular, in that it is designed to perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market. Specifically, the CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will continue the operation of a trading
system that, in accordance with Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act,
 assures the economic and efficient execution of securities transactions.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Sections
6(b)(5)
 and 11A
 thereunder. Specifically, the Commission concludes that permanently approving the MTS Pilot Program will contribute
to the protection of investors and to the Exchange's ability to provide fair and orderly markets in new options products.





The Commission notes that prior to the last extension of the MTS Pilot Program, the CBOE was required to submit a report
discussing various aspects of the pilot program (``1993 MTS Report'').
 The findings contained in the 1993 MTS Report were as follows: (1) No complaints had been lodged with the Exchange concerning
the operation of the MTS Pilot Program; (2) no disciplinary of performance action had been taken against any Exchange
member due to the operation of the pilot program; (3) since its inception, use of the pilot program by members had consistently
increased in terms of the number of DPMs, the number of options classes assigned to DPMs, and the aggregate average
daily trading volume associated with options classes assigned to DPMs' and (4) objective and subjective evaluations
had shown that DPMs were consistently ranked at the high end of the scale in terms of depth of markets, price continuity,
and width of bid/ask spreads, in assigned options classes.
 In granting the last extension of the MTS Pilot Program, the Commission also stated that before the MTS Pilot Program
would be permanently approved or further extended, the CBOE would be required to update the 1993 MTS Report highlighting
any material developments during the extension of the pilot program (``1994 MTS Report'').
 The Commission notes that the Exchange has submitted the 1994 MTS Report as part of this proposed rule change and that
the 1994 MTS Report contains no material changes from the findings reported in the 1993 MTS Report.

Based on the representations made by the Exchange in the 1994 MTS Report, the Commission concludes that the MTS Pilot
Program has contributed to the protection of investors and to the Exchange's ability to provide fair and orderly markets
in new options products. Additionally, the growth in the use of the MTS Pilot Program as represented by the CBOE, combined
with the Exchange's findings that options classes assigned to DPMs, relative to other options classes, rate high
in the quality of their markets (e.g., 

depth of the markets and which of bid/ask spreads), leads the Commission to conclude that the MTS Pilot Program is beneficial
for investors and will promote fair and orderly markets for options classes. Accordingly, for the reasons stated
herein, for the reasons articulated in the Commission's order establishing the MTS Pilot Program,
 and because of the success of the pilot program since its inception (as represented by the Exchange in the 1994 MTS Report),
the Commission believes that granting permanent approval of the MTS Pilot Program at this time is appropriate.





The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended, prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register 

in order to permit the uninterrupted continuation of the Modified Trading System. As set forth in the 1994 MTS Report,
the CBOE has represented that no adverse comments have been received and no problems have arisen in connection with
the operation of the MTS Pilot Program since its inception. Furthermore, the Commission has not received any comments
opposing the MTS Pilot Program or otherwise indicating that the MTS Pilot Program is operating other than as originally
intended. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5), 11A, and 19(b)(2) of the
Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.



IV. Solicitation of Comments





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the proposed rule change and
Amendment No. 1 thereto. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent
amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and
all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than
those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such
filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-36 and should be submitted by December 21, 1994.



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-94-36), as amended, is hereby approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice Regarding Outstanding Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges </DOCTITLE>


November 23, 1994. 


The recently enacted Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994 (``Act''), Public Law 103-389 (codified as amended
at 15 U.S.C. 78l (f) (1) to (3) (1988)), which became effective on October 22, 1994, authorizes any national securities
exchange to extend unlisted trading privileges to any security that is listed and registered on a national securities
exchange, otherwise registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or exempt from registration,
all in accordance with the requirements and limitations of the Act and the rules thereunder.
 Prior to the amendment, exchanges were required to apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
and receive approval from the Commission before extending unlisted trading privileges to any security. The Act eliminated
these requirements. 




As a result, any national securities exchange that has previously applied to the Commission for approval of unlisted
trading privileges in any security may extend unlisted trading privileges to such security in accordance with the
terms of the Act, notwithstanding that the Commission has yet to approve the exchange's outstanding application.
 Accordingly, the Commission is publishing this notice to inform interested persons that no further Commission action
on these applications is necessary. For further information, interested persons may contact Glen P. Barrentine,
202/942.0145, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange
Commission, Mail Stop 5-1, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington D.C. 20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Applicants' Representations and Statements



1. Investors is a stock life insurance company which was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
in 1963. Investors changed its state of domicile to the State of Washington in 1992.

2. In September 1982, Investors established Account I as a separate investment account to fund certain flexible premium
and single premium variable annuity policies (the ``Account I Policies''). Account I is organized and registered
under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. Account I currently has five divisions, each of which invests exclusively
in shares of a designated portfolio of the CIGNA Annuity Funds Group (the ``CIGNA Funds'').
 Each such division contains two subdivisions, one for the allocation of tax qualified and one for non-tax qualified
net payments made under variable annuity contracts.





3. The underlying investment vehicle for Account I is the CIGNA Funds, a Massachusetts business trust organized on
April 10, 1985, which is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management company of the series type. The CIGNA
Funds currently consist of five portfolios, each with its own investment objectives and investment portfolio. Before
November 29, 1993, the investment adviser to the five portfolios of the CIGNA Funds was CIGNA Investments, Inc. (``CII''),
a subsidiary of CIGNA Corporation.

4. In June 1980, the Investors established INA/Putnam Account as a separate investment account to fund certain single
premium variable annuity policies (the ``INA/Putnam Policies''). The INA/Putnam Account is organized and registered
under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The INA/Putnam Account initially had five divisions, each of which invested
exclusively in shares of one of the following mutual funds (collectively, the ``Putnam Funds''): Putnam Income Fund;
Putnam High Yield Trust; Putnam Equity Income Fund (formerly known as Putnam Strategic Income Trust and Putnam Option
Income Trust); Putnam Daily Dividend Trust; and Putnam Investors Fund. Each division of the INA/Putnam Account contained
two subdivisions, one for the allocation of tax qualified and one for the allocation of non-tax qualified net payments
made under variable annuity contracts. Putnam Investment Management, Inc. (``Putnam'') currently serves as investment
adviser to the Putnam Funds.

5. Following the issuance of Revenue Ruling 81-225 by the Internal Revenue Service on September 25, 1981, Investors
discontinued offering the INA/Putnam Policies.
 For owners of INA/Putnam Policies issued prior to Revenue Ruling 81-225 who were adversely affected by that
Revenue Ruling, Investors added an additional division to the INA/Putnam Account, for which the underlying investment
vehicle is the CIGNA Funds. Those INA/Putnam Policy owners were able to transfer contract values from the Putnam Funds
to the CIGNA Funds. The CIGNA Funds initially offered a money market option (the ``CIGNA Annuity Money Market Fund'');
subsequently, the investment options were expanded to include the CIGNA Annuity Income Fund and the CIGNA Annuity
Equity Fund as well.
 The Putnam Funds have remained available under INA/Putnam Contracts issued prior to the cut-off dates described
in Revenue Ruling 81-225. Accordingly, there currently are eight divisions of the INA/Putnam Account.

6. In July 1993, CII advised the Board of Trustees of the CIGNA Funds that CIGNA Corporation and its subsidiaries intended
to redirect resources away from the active management of equity securities and concentrate their equity management
activities in indexing strategies. Accordingly, CII indicated to the Board of Trustees of the CIGNA Funds and to Investors
that it would be unwilling to continue to serve as investment adviser to any of the CIGNA Funds on a long-term basis.
CII also indicated that it would work with Investors to identify and implement a successor arrangement.

7. Following discussions with several major mutual fund groups, Investors and CII determined that Putnam Capital
Manager Trust (the ``PCM Funds'') and Putnam would provide a means for the orderly withdrawal of CII's investment
advisory services in light of: (i) The willingness of Putnam to provide interim advisory services to the CIGNA Equity
Funds; (ii) the availability of funds which offer investment objectives similar to those provided by each series
of the CIGNA funds; and (iii) the availability of a current PCM Funds registration for funds which could be substituted
for the CIGNA Funds as the underlying investment vehicle for variable annuity contracts sponsored by Investors.






8. On November 29, 1993, the board of trustees of the CIGNA Funds, acting on the advice of CII, terminated the appointment
of CII as investment adviser to the CIGNA Annuity Equity Fund, the CIGNA Annuity Growth and Income Fund and the CIGNA
Annuity Aggressive Equity Fund (the ``CIGNA Equity Funds''). Concurrently, the board of trustees appointed Putnam
as the investment adviser to the CIGNA Equity Funds, effective as of November 30, 1993. The investment advisory agreement
between the CIGNA Funds and Putnam is substantially the same as the agreement between the CIGNA funds and CII, except
with respect to the provisions of certain administrative services.
 On March 8, 1994, the shareholders of the CIGNA Equity Funds approved the investment advisory agreement between Putnam
and the CIGNA Equity Funds.





9. The PCM Funds are registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management company of the series type. The PCM Funds
currently consist of nine portfolios, each with its own investment objectives and investment portfolio. The proposed
substitution would utilize four of the portfolios of the PCM Funds with respect to Account I Policies and three of the
portfolios with respect to the INA/Putnam Policies.

10. Investors proposes to substitute shares of the CIGNA Funds for shares of the PCM Funds on the following basis.

 As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Money Market Fund would be redeemed by
Investors. On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of the PCM
Money Market Fund.

 As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Income Fund would be redeemed by Investors.
On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of PCM U.S. Government
and High Quality Bond Fund.

 As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Equity Fund would be redeemed by Investors.
On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of the PCM Growth and
Income Fund.
 As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Growth and Income Fund would be redeemed
by Investors. On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of PCM
Growth and Income Fund.

 As of the effective date of the Substitution, shares of CIGNA Annuity Aggressive Equity Fund would be redeemed
by Investors. On the same day, Investors would use the proceeds to purchase the appropriate number of shares of PCM
Voyager Fund.
11. The Substitution would take place at relative net asset values of the CIGNA Funds and the PCM Funds, with no change
in the amount of any policyholder's account value under either the Account I or the INA/Putnam Policies.
12. It is expected that the CIGNA Funds will incur brokerage fees and expenses in connection with the redemption by
Investors of the shares of the CIGNA Funds. These expenses would be charged to the applicable portfolio of the CIGNA
Funds. To alleviate the potential impact of such brokerage fees and expenses upon the CIGNA Funds, CII and the CIGNA
Funds have proposed to Investors that the redemption of the shares of the CIGNA Funds be accomplished, in part, by ``in
kind'' payments. Under the proposal, the CIGNA Funds would transfer to Investors cash and/or securities held by the
CIGNA Funds at the effective date of the Substitution, and Investors would use such cash and/or securities to purchase
shares of the applicable portfolio of the PCM Funds. Investors has indicated that it would be agreeable to the ``in
kind'' aspect of the proposal, on the conditions that: (i) The CIGNA Funds identify prior to the effective date of the
Substitution the securities to be included in the ``in kind'' transfer; and (ii) the PCM Funds and Putnam, in its capacity
as investment adviser to the PCM Funds, agree to accept the securities so identified in payment for the purchase by
Investors of shares of PCM Funds to effectuate the Substitution. The valuation of any ``in kind'' transfers will be
on a basis consistent with the valuation of the assets of the CIGNA Funds and the normal valuation procedures of the
PCM Funds.
13. Following the Substitution, the fees and expenses imposed by Investors under the Account I Policies and the INA/Putnam
Policies would remain the same as currently in effect. In addition, the Substitution would not impose any federal
income tax liability on owners of Account I Policies or INA/Putnam Policies.
14. Following the Substitution, Account I Policy owners would have the right to transfer account values among the
divisions of Account I for which the four PCM Funds described above serve as the underlying investment vehicle. INA/Putnam
Policy owners would have the right to transfer account values among the divisions of the INA/Putnam Account for which
three PCM funds (the PCM Money Market Fund, the PCM U.S. Government High Quality Bond Fund, and the PCM Growth and Income
Fund) serve as the underlying investment vehicles. In addition, INA/Putnam Policy owners who currently utilize
one or more of the Putnam Funds as their underlying investment vehicle(s) would be able to transfer such values amongst
the PCM Money Market Fund, the PCM U.S. Government and High Quality Bond Fund, and the PCM Growth and Income Fund. The
current provisions of the INA/Putnam Policies which prevent a policyholder who transfers values from the Putnam
Funds to the CIGNA Funds from subsequently transferring such values back to the Putnam Funds would continue in effect,
with the restriction applying to PCM Funds in place of the CIGNA Funds.
15. Following the Substitution, Investors intends to redeem its investment of seed money. However, the timing of
such withdrawal has not been established and will be at the discretion of Investors. By making this withdrawal after
the Substitution, Investors anticipates that the brokerage and related expenses incurred by the underlying fund
would have a substantially reduced impact, if any, upon Policy owners, as a result of the larger overall size of the
applicable PCM Funds.
16. Investors has been advised by CII that, following the Substitution and the redemption of CIGNA Funds shares by
Investors, the CIGNA Funds intends to file an application under Section 8(f) of the 1940 Act, requesting an order that
it has ceased to be an investment company. Following the issuance of such an order, the CIGNA Funds will dissolve, pursuant
to the applicable provisions of Massachusetts law.

17. If the Commission approves the Substitution, Policy holders will receive notice of the intended substitution
and will have the opportunity to vote on the matter. The Account I Policies and the INA/Putnam Policies provide that
a substitution of the shares of one registered investment company for those of another registered investment company
may be implemented with respect to a particular division of the applicable separate account only if it (i.e., the substitution)
has been previously approved by a majority of the votes to be cast be persons having a voting interest in the fund shares
allocated to the applicable separate account division.






18. The historical expense ratios for the CIGNA Funds generally have been higher than the historical expense ratios
for the PCM Funds. The difference is attributable, in part, to the larger asset size of the PCM Funds, as compared to
the asset size of the CIGNA Funds.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



A. Request for Order Pursuant to Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act



1. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act provides:

It shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single
issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution.
The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.






2. The purpose of Section 26(b) is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment
trust will accumulate the shares of a particular issuer, and to prevent unscrutinized substitutions which might,
in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares, thereby incurring
either a loss of the sales load deducted from initial proceeds, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption
proceeds, or both. Section 26(b) affords this protection to investors by preventing a depositor or trustee of a unit
investment trust holding the shares of one issuer from substituting the shares of another issuer for those shares,
unless the Commission approves the substitution.

3. The Applicants represent that, for the following reasons, the purposes, terms, and conditions of the Substitution
will not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(b) is designed to prevent.

 The Substitution is being proposed because the investment adviser to CIGNA Funds has indicated that it would
be unwilling to serve as investment adviser to any of the CIGNA Funds on a long-term basis. This decision, which is beyond
the control of Investors, has necessitated the proposal of an alternative funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts
offered by Investors.

 The Substitution is for shares of PCM Funds with investment objectives which are sufficiently similar to the
objectives of the corresponding portfolios of the CIGNA Funds to provide a means for Policy holders to continue their
current investment goals and risk expectations.

 The transactions effecting the Substitution, including the redemption of the shares of the CIGNA Funds and
the purchase of shares of PCM Funds, will be effected at net asset value of the respective shares, in conformity with
Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder.

 Utilization of ``in kind'' redemptions by the CIGNA Funds, to the extent appropriate, followed by the use by
Investors of the shares received to purchase shares of PCM Funds, would reduce the expenses and transaction costs
involved in the Substitution.

 The Substitution will not alter or affect the insurance benefits provided by Investors to Policy holders under
the terms of the contracts.

 The Substitution will not affect adversely the tax benefits available to Policy holders. The Substitution
will not give rise to any current federal income tax to Policy holders.

 The Substitution provides Policy holders with an underlying investment vehicle with enhanced asset size.

4. The Account I Policies and the INA/Putnam Policies reserve to Investors the right_subject to prior approval of
affected Policy holders, as well as approval by the SEC_to substitute shares of another management investment company
for shares of an investment company held by a division of Account I or the INA/Putnam Account, or to add or eliminate
one or more such divisions.

5. Investors reserved this right of substitution in order to protect itself and its Policy holders in several adverse
situations. This includes the present situation where the investment adviser to the underlying investment vehicles
has stated that it intends to withdraw from the equity advisory business, with the related implication that a dissolution
of the CIGNA Funds would result in a forced liquidation of Account I and that portion of the INA/Putnam Account for which
the CIGNA Funds serves as the underlying investment vehicle.

6. The Applicants submit that, under the circumstances, it is in the best interests of Account I and INA/Putnam Policy
owners to proceed with the Substitution. The Applicants represent that the overall investment objectives of the
portfolio of PCM Funds which would be substituted for the corresponding portfolio of the CIGNA Funds are sufficiently
similar for the Substitution to be appropriate. The Applicants believe that the investment objectives are compatible.

7. The Applicants further represent that total fees and expenses, as a percentage of net assets, for the portfolios
of PCM Funds which would be so substituted are not expected to increase as a result of the Substitution. The Applicants
acknowledge that, with the exception of the PCM Money Market Fund, the advisory fee for each of the PCM Funds is higher
than the advisory fee for the corresponding CIGNA Fund. However, the Applicants submit that since the PCM Funds are
substantially larger in asset size than the CIGNA Funds, the operating expenses are spread over a larger base, thereby
producing total expense ratios for the PCM Funds which, on a historical basis, have been lower than the ratios for the
CIGNA Funds.



B. Request for Order Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the 1940 Act



1. Under certain circumstances, Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered
investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any security or other property
to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits any of the persons described above
from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company.

2. The Applicants submit that because the Substitution may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities
between and among affiliated persons as a result of the purchase by Account I and the INA/Putnam Account of shares of
PCM Funds with proceeds (including ``in kind'' distributions of securities in lieu of cash) from the redemption of
shares of the CIGNA Funds, the Substitution may involve transactions prohibited by Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act.
The Applicants further submit that the Substitution would not be exempt from Section 17 of the 1940 Act pursuant to
Rule 17a-7 thereunder, since the affiliations among the parties do not arise solely by reason of having common
investment advisers, common directors and/or common officers.

3. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that:

Notwithstanding subsection (a), any person may file with the Commission an application for an order exempting a proposed
transaction of the applicant from one or more provisions of that subsection. The Commission shall grant such application
and issue such order of exemption if evidence establishes that_




(1) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and
fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned;

(2) The proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited
in its registration statement and reports filed under this title; and

(3) The proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of this title.




4. The Applicants seek an exemption from Section 17(a) under both Sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the 1940 Act, because Section
17(b) refers to a single ``proposed transaction'' while, under Section 6(c), the Commission may exempt a series of
transactions.

5. The Applicants represent that the terms of the Substitution meet all of the requirements of Section 17(b). The Applicants
submit that, for the reasons set forth in their request for exemptive relief under Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act_particularly
those set forth below, the terms of the Substitution are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the
part of any person concerned.

 The Substitution will be effected pursuant to the established net asset values of CIGNA Funds and PCM Funds
as of the effective date of the Substitution, in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder.

 The Substitution is intended to provide owners of Account I Policies and INA/Putnam Policies with underlying
investment vehicles which correspond to the options currently available under the CIGNA Funds.

 The Substitution is intended to provide owners of Account I Policies and INA/Putnam Policies with continuity,
given the announced intention of CII to withdraw as investment adviser to the CIGNA Funds.

 The Substitution is expected to result in lower expense ratios.

 The Substitution is not expected to have federal income tax consequences for Policy holders.
6. The Applicants further submit that, with respect to the ``in kind'' aspects of the Substitution: (a) Investors
has been advised by CIGNA Funds and PCM Funds that only those securities which Putnam otherwise would select for the
applicable portfolios of PCM Funds will be included in the ``in kind'' transfer to Investors; (b) Investors has been
assured by CII and Putnam that the securities to be included in the ``in kind'' transfer will be valued at independent
current market prices on the effective date of the Substitution; and (c) CII and Putnam have assured Investors that
no brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration would be paid or charged in connection with the in kind transfers.

7. The Applicants represent that because the ``in kind'' transfer would occur only once_i.e., on the effective date
of the Substitution, Account I and INA/Putnam Account have not adopted the written procedures described in paragraph
(e)(1) of Rule 17a-7. Investors submits that the purposes intended to be served by such written procedures are
not applicable to the current situation. Investors submits that the proposed transactions involved in the Substitution
fall within the intent of Rule 17a-7 securities redeemed in kind and that, consequently, there will be no overreaching
because all securities redeemed in kind and used to purchase shares of the PCM Funds will be consistently valued for
all purposes. Nonetheless, Investors, Account I and INA/Putnam Account will comply with paragraphs (b), (c) and
(d) of Rule 17a-7.

8. The Applicants submit that the Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and does not
present any of the investor protection concerns that Section 26(b) is designed to address. The Applicants note that
Policy holder will be informed fully of the terms of the Substitution and will have an opportunity to vote on the Substitution
following the approval of this application by the Commission. The variable annuity contracts issued by Account I
and the INA/Putnam Account provide that, in the event of a substitution of underlying fund shares, ``prior approval
by the vote of a majority of the votes to be cast by persons having their contract values determined by the affected [separate
account] [d]ivision will be obtained.''



Applicants' Conclusion



For the reasons discussed above, the Applicants submit that the requested order under Section 26(b) meets the standards
of that section, and that the requested exemption from Section 17(a) meets the standards of Sections 6(c) and 17(b).



For the Commission by the Division of Investment Management pursuant to delegated authority.

Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. Applicant is a closed-end diversified management investment company organized as an Iowa corporation. On August
28, 1989, applicant registered under section 8(a) of the Act. On January 2, 1990, applicant filed a registration statement
under section 8(b) of the Act. Applicant did not file a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 but
rather undertook a private offering of its securities under Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933.

2. Applicant has 174 shareholders, consisting exclusively of banks and bank holding companies, three insurance
companies, and one utility company.

3. The purpose of the applicant is to advance economic development in the State of Iowa. Applicant is authorized by
and regulated under the Iowa Business Development Finance Act of 1988 (the ``Iowa Act''). The Iowa Act provides for
pervasive government regulation of applicant. As required by the Iowa Act, applicant's board of directors consists
of twelve directors, seven of whom are Iowa public officials. Among applicant's public directors are the Iowa Superintendent
of Banking and the Iowa Commissioner of Insurance. Applicant's president is appointed by the Director of the Iowa
Department of Economic Development (the ``Department'') from the division within the Department that administers
business financial assistance programs. Currently, two employees of the Department are the only officers of applicant.

4. The Iowa Act requires applicant to submit annual reports of its operations and condition to the Iowa Governor and
the Iowa Legislature. The Iowa Act also gives the Department authority to request the Iowa Superintendent of Banking
to examine applicant and submit a report to the Department, with copies to the Governor and Iowa Legislature.

5. Applicant received an order from the SEC under section 6(c) granting an exemption from all provisions of the Act.
 Thus, applicant was exempted from the requirement that it register as an investment company under the Act. In the application
for the exemptive order, applicant undertook to file an application under section 8(f) of the Act for an order declaring
that it ceased to be an investment company. Upon deregistration, applicant will remain an ongoing corporation subject
to regulation under the Iowa Act.





6. As of August 31, 1994, applicant had assets of approximately $6.7 million consisting primarily of cash, and debt
and equity securities. After deregistration, applicant will continue as an ongoing entity, and thus there will be
no winding-up of applicant's affairs and no distributions to shareholders relating to a winding up of affairs. Applicant
is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings.




For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 


Applicant's Representatives


1. Applicant is a diversified open-end investment management company organized as a Massachusetts business trust.
On August 17, 1983 applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N-8A and a registration statement
on Form N-1 pursuant to section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on December 1, 1983
and the initial public offering commenced shortly thereafter.
 
2. On December 13, 1993, applicant's Board of Directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant would
become a separate series of Merrill Lynch Funds for Institutions Series (the ``Acquiring Fund''). The Acquiring
Fund is a series company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. The Acquiring Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes
the issuance of shares in different series and authorizes the Board of Trustees to establish and create additional
series and designate the rights and preferences thereof. Pursuant to such authority, on December 13, 1993, the Board
of Trustees designated a new series of the Acquiring Fund to be known as the ``Merrill Lynch Institutional Tax-Exempt
Fund'' series (the ``Series''). 
3. Applicant and the Series share the same investment adviser, Fund Asset Management, L.P. Accordingly, applicant
and the Series may be deemed to be affiliated persons by reason of being under the common control of the same investment
adviser. Applicant therefore relied on the exemption provided by rule 17a-8 under the Act to effect the transaction.
Consequently, the trustees of the Series determined, in accordance with rule 17a-8, that the purchase of the
assets of applicant by the Series was in the best interest of the shareholders of the Series, and that such purchase
would not result in any dilution to the interests of the existing shareholders of the Series.





4. On December 17, 1993 preliminary copies of proxy materials were filed with the SEC. On January 6, 1994, definitive
copies were distributed to applicant's shareholders and transmitted to the SEC. At a special meeting held on February
18, 1994, the shareholders of the applicant approved the reorganization.

5. On February 18, 1994, applicant had one class of securities outstanding, shares of beneficial interest of $.10
par value, of which 378,376,365 shares were outstanding on that date, having an aggregate and per share net asset value
of $378,400,368 and $1.00, respectively. On February 18, 1994, applicant transferred all of its business and assets
and assigned all of its liabilities to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for delivery to applicant of a number of shares
(both full and fractional) of beneficial interest of the Series equivalent to the number of shares of beneficial interest
of the Applicant outstanding on that date.

Georgia Power Company et al. (70-8193)


Georgia Power Company (``Georgia Power''), 333 Piedmont Avenue, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30308, and Savannah Electric
and Power Company (``Savannah''), 600 East Bay Street, Savannah, Georgia 31402, both electric public-utility subsidiary
companies of The Southern Company, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration under sections
9, 10, 12(d) and 13(b) of the Act and rules 43, 44, 86, 90, and 91 thereunder.
Savannah and Georgia Power propose to construct on real property owned by Savannah eight combustion turbine-generator
units (``CTs'') to be known as Plant McIntosh CT Nos. 1 through 8, and up to eight additional CTs to be known as Plant McIntosh
CT Nos. 9 through 16. Six of the initial CTs will be developed for Georgia Power, two will be developed for Savannah.
Upon completion, each applicant will own 100% interest in and will be entitled to 100% of the output of its respective
CTs. The construction costs of the eight CTs and associated facilities are estimated to be approximately $182 million
for Georgia Power and $61 million for Savannah.
The initial CTs will be simple-cycle generators each having a nominal capacity of 80 megawatts, and will burn primarily
natural gas with No. 2 fuel oil as a backup fuel supply. In addition to the CT units, other facilities to be constructed
for the project include fuel systems, water systems, an extension of existing fire protection systems, a switchyard,
a 230-kv tie line to the existing Plant McIntosh substation, and a service building.
Savannah proposes to sell to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power proposes to purchase, a percentage undivided ownership
interest in certain of the equipment which will comprise the facilities common to all of the Plant McIntosh CTs (``Common
Facilities''). Savannah and Georgia Power will hold the Common Facilities as tenants-in-common. The assets to be
acquired by Georgia Power at closing consist of pre-existing fuel oil storage tank which shall be converted into a
demineralized water tank. The purchase price for the fuel oil storage tank represents Georgia Power's pro-forma
ownership interest (75%) of the original book cost of the asset less depreciation, which, if calculated as of December
31, 1992, is estimated to be $648,710.
Savannah also proposes to lease to Georgia Power a 100% leasehold interest in the real property on which Georgia Power's
CTs will be developed, a percentage undivided interest in that portion of the Common Facilities which consist of real
property, and any related easements or other rights necessary to develop Georgia Power's CTs and the Common Facilities.
It is estimated that the rental payments to be made by Georgia Power to Savannah will amount to $2,220 annually.

Georgia Power proposes to make Savannah its agent in the procurement, construction, management, control, operation,
maintenance, renewal, addition, replacement, modification, and disposal of the Plant McIntosh CTs, the Common
Facilities, and the fuel supply for the Plant McIntosh CTs. The operating agreement provides for the sharing of operating
costs and costs of construction by Savannah and Georgia Power in accordance with their respective pro forma ownership
interests.



The Columbia Gas System, Inc., et al. (70-8235)



The Columbia Gas System, Inc. (``Columbia''), a registered holding company, and its wholly owned nonutility subsidiary
company, TriStar Ventures Corporation (``TVC''), and the following direct or indirect nonutility subsidiaries
of TVC, TriStar Binghamton General Corporation, TriStar Binghamton Limited Corporation, TriStar Fuel Cells Corporation,
TriStar Georgetown General Corporation, TriStar Georgetown Limited Corporation, TVC Nine Corporation, TriStar
Pedrick General Corporation, TriStar Pedrick Limited Corporation, TriStar Rumford Limited Corporation, TriStar
Ten Corporation, TriStar Vineland General Corporation, and TriStar Vineland Limited Corporation (collectively,
``TVC Subsidiaries''), all located at 20 Montchanin Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19807, have filed an application-declaration
with this Commission under Sections 6, 7, 9, 10, 12(b), 12(c), and 33 of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 46, and 54 thereunder.

To fund preliminary development, administration, and new investments through December 31, 1997 by using up to $34.1
million of their self generated funds (``Self Generated Funds''), TVC and the TVC Subsidiaries request authority
for: (1) the TVC Subsidiaries to issue and sell to TVC shares of its common stock, and for TVC to acquire the shares; (2)
the TVC Subsidiaries to issue and sell to TVC installment promissory notes (``Notes''), and for TVC to acquire these
Notes; and/or (3) TVC to make short-term advances and/or capital contributions to the TVC Subsidiaries. The shares
of the TVC Subsidiaries' common stock are valued at $25 par value per share, and TVC would acquire the shares at or above
par value.

Alternatively, the TVC Subsidiaries could issue and sell to TVC Notes bearing a fixed interest to be determined at
the time of issuance. The interest rate would be based upon the preceding calendar quarter three-month average yield
on newly issued ``A'' rated 25-30 year utility bonds as published in Salomon Brothers' weekly Bond Market Roundup
or 2% per annum above the foregoing applicable rate if interest or principal payment on the Notes becomes past due.
The Notes would be payable in installments over a period not to exceed 30 years and would be dated the date of their issue.

TVC's short-term advances to the TVC Subsidiaries would be made on open account, would bear interest at a rate equivalent
to the composite weighted effective cost of Columbia's short-term financing transactions, and would be repaid by
the TVC Subsidiaries as funds are available but no later than April 30 of the following year.

TVC and the TVC Subsidiaries request authority through December 31, 1997, for the payment of dividends out of capital
surplus by the TVC Subsidiaries to permit TVC to recapture funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and
excess to the needs of the subsidiaries. The proposed amount of dividends paid out of capital surplus would not exceed
the following: TriStar Binghamton General Corporation, $1.2 million; TriState Binghamton Limited Corporation,
$2.8 million; TriStar Vineland General Corporation, $350,000; and TriStar Vineland Limited Corporation, $3.15
million.

<TEXT>
 

TVC also requests authority through December 31, 1997 to invest directly or indirectly in exempt wholesale generators
(``EWGs'') and foreign utility companies (``FUCOs'') on the same basis as Columbia with regard to permissible activities
under Sections 32 and 33. TVC proposes to use all or a portion of its Self Generated Funds for such investments.
TVC plans to form, acquire, finance and own the securities or interest in the business of EWGs and/or FUCOs directly
or indirectly through subsidiary companies (``Project Parents''). The Project Parents would be special purpose
domestic corporations, foreign corporations, partnerships, or limited liability companies (or the equivalent
thereof) and could include joint ventures engaged in EWG/FUCO activities. With regard to FUCO activities, the organization,
formation, or acquisition of one or more Project Parents may be necessary or desirable to facilitate such projects.
A holding structure of one or more Project Parents also may be necessary or desirable to minimize tax liabilities,
to bid on projects through joint ventures, to facilitate a participant's consolidated tax and accounting activities
in joint ventures, to insulate TVC from certain risks, and to facilitate adjustments to or sales of interests of joint
ventures or partnerships. A single Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct and indirect interest in both EWGs
and FUCOs.
Investments by TVC directly or indirectly in any Project Parent may take the form of any combination of acquisitions
of capital shares, partnership interest, trust certificates or the equivalent of any of the foregoing. Any investment
in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have a stated par value will be in an amount
equal to or greater than par value.
To the extent that a Project Parent is itself determined to be an EWG or FUCO, it would be exempt from project financing
filing under the Act except as may otherwise be provided in Sections 32 and 33. As to Project Parents that are not EWGs
or FUCOs, TVC and the Project Parent would make a filing, if required, for project financing authority at the appropriate
time.
TVC does not contemplate utilizing the services of employees of the Columbia system's domestic public utility companies
for its EWB and FUCO activities. However, were it to do so, no more than two percent of the employees of the system's domestic
public utility companies would render services at any one time, directly or indirectly, to EWGs or FUCOs in which TVC
may directly or indirectly hold an interest unless previous Commission approval were sought.

In addition, TVC proposes to provide fuel management, operations and maintenance, and related services to nonaffiliated
entities. These services would be provided at negotiated rates.

TVC proposes to cancel the debt of three of its subsidiaries through December 31, 1996. These companies were involved
in projects that never proceeded past development. The amount of debt cancelled would not exceed: TriStar Georgetown
General Corporation, $125,000; TriStar Georgetown Limited Corporation, $6.2 million; and TriStar Fuel Cells Corporation,
$900,000.



Northeast Utilities, et al. (70-8507)



Northeast Utilities (``NU''), 174 Brush Hill Avenue, West Springfield, Massachusetts 01089, a registered holding
company, and its wholly owned subsidiary companies, Charter Oak Energy, Inc. (``Charter Oak'') and COE Development
Corporation (``COE Development''), both located at 107 Seldon Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, (collectively,
the ``Applicants'') have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 13(b) and 33 of the Act
and Rules 53, 83, 86, 87, 90 and 91 thereunder.

NU proposes to invest directly in Charter Oak and indirectly in COE Development up to an aggregate principal amount
of $200 million from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996. In addition, the Applicants propose: (1) to form intermediate
subsidiary companies (``Intermediate Companies'') to acquire an interest in, finance the acquisition and hold
the securities of exempt wholesale generators, as defined by Section 32 of the Act (``EWGs''), and foreign utility
companies, as defined by Section 33 of the Act (``FUCOs'') through the issuance of equity securities and debt securities
to third parties; (2) for Intermediate Companies to make partial sales of qualifying congeneration and small power
production facilities as defined in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (``QF''), independent power
production facilities that would constitute a part of NU's ``integrated public utility system'' within the meaning
of Section 2(a)(29)(A) of the Act (``Qualified IPPs''), EWGs and FUCOs (``Exempt Projects''); (3) to participate
in joint ventures engaged exclusively in Exempt Project activities and to dissolve Intermediate Companies under
specified circumstances; and (4) for Charter Oak's employees and employees of other NU service companies to provide
a de minimis amount of services to affiliated Intermediate Companies, EWGs (both foreign and domestic) and FUCOs.

NU, Charter Oak and COE Development are seeking to invest up to $200 million in development activities associated
with QFs, Qualified IPPs and Exempt Projects. Any debt financing which Charter Oak may obtain may not exceed a term
of 15 years or bear an interest rate in excess of 6.5% over the then applicable prime rate (``Applicable Prime Rate'')
at a U.S. money center bank designated by NU. Similarly, any debt financing backed by NU's guarantee will be limited
to a term of 15 years and will be at an interest rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Applicable Prime Rate.

Charter Oak also requests authority for itself and its subsidiaries to make loans (on either a recourse or non-recourse
basis) to unaffiliated developers of QFs, Exempt Projects or Qualified IPPs as part of its financing of the acquisition
of interests in such projects. Such loans shall count against the overall $200 million funding authorization.



Applicants seek approval for any Intermediate Company to issue equity securities and debt securities, with or without
recourse to the Applicants, to persons other than the Applicants including banks, insurance companies, and other
financial institutions, exclusively for the purpose of financing (including any refinancing of) investments in
Exempt Projects through December 31, 1996. The Intermediate Companies' investments in Exempt Projects may take
the form of acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions, open account advances, and/or subordinated loans,
provided that such open account advances or subordinated loans will bear interest at a rate based on NU's cost of funds
in effect on the date of issue, but in no case in excess of the prime rate at a bank designated by NU.



It is proposed that the aggregate principal amount of recourse debt securities issued by Intermediate Companies
to persons other than the Applicants will not exceed $150 million at any one time outstanding, provided that no more
than $100 million principal amount of such debt securities at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies
other than U.S. dollars. The aggregate amount of nonrecourse debt securities, to persons other than Applicants,
will not be more than $600 million outstanding at any one time and not more than $400 million denominated in currencies
other than U.S. dollars.



The recourse to the Applicants will be in the form of the guarantees and assumptions of liability and will be included
within the Applicants overall investment authorization limit or $200 million. In any case in which the Applicants
directly or indirectly own less than all of the equity interests of an Intermediate Company, only that portion of the
recourse or non-recourse indebtedness of such Intermediate Company equal to the Applicants' equity ownership percentage
shall be included for purposes of the foregoing limitations.



The Applicants assert that the amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including (in the case of
any indebtedness) interest rate, maturity, prepayment of redemption privileges, and the forms of any collateral
security granted with respect thereto, would be negotiated on a case by case basis, taking into account differences
from project to project in optimum debt-equity ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives,
and other similar financial and performance characteristics of each project.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Applicants state that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued
or sold by an Intermediate Company for a consideration that is less than such par value; and that any note, bond or other
evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Intermediate Company will mature not later than 30 years from the date
of issuance thereof, and will bear interest at a rate not to exceed the following: (1) If such note, bond or other indebtedness
is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the yield to maturity on an activity traded, non-callable,
U.S. Treasury note having a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other indebtedness (the ``Applicable
Treasury Rate''), or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Applicable Prime Rate; and (2) if such note, bond
or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency of a country other than the United States, at a fixed or floating
rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official
indices published by such country, would be equivalent to a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical
average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable Treasury Rate (interpolated if necessary) or Applicable
Prime Rate, as the case may be.



In connection with the issuance of any debt securities by any Intermediate Company, it is anticipated that such Intermediate
Company may grant security in its assets. Such security interest may take the form of a pledge of the shares or other
equity securities of an Exempt Project that it owns, including a security interest in any distributions from any such
Exempt Project, and/or a collateral assignment of its rights under and interests in other property, including rights
under contracts.

The Applicants are also requesting authorization for Intermediate Companies to effect adjustments in the respective
ownership interests in any Exempt Project held by the Applicants and unaffiliated co-investors and to facilitate
a partial sale of an interest in any such Exempt Project. In addition, the Applicants also request authority to participate
directly or through Intermediate Companies in joint ventures with non-associates which join ventures are in the
business of researching investment opportunities in, and owning and developing Exempt Projects. The Applicants
also request authority to liquidate, dissolve or sell any Intermediate Company within 45 days after the Applicants
determine that the purpose for owning such Intermediate Company no longer exists unless the Applicants determine
that such Intermediate Company may be used in connection with a proposal or plan to develop or acquire an interest in
a different Exempt Project.
The Applicants request authorization for Charter Oak employees (who are employees of Northeast Utilities Service
Company) or other NU Service Company employees (collectively, ``Service Company Employees'') to provide a de minimis
amount of services to affiliated Intermediate Companies, EWGs (both foreign and domestic) and FUCOs, subject to
certain limitations.
The services to be rendered to affiliated Intermediate Companies, EWGs and FUCOs by Service Company Employees include:
management, administrative, legal, tax, and financing advice, accounting, engineering consulting, software
development and language skills. The total number of Service Company Employees engaged in rendering such services
will not exceed, in the aggregate, 0.5% of the total NU holding company system's employees and no more than 1% of the
total of Service Company Employees at any one time.
The provision of services to affiliated domestic EWGs and Intermediate Companies will be made at cost pursuant to
Section 13(b) of the Act. Applicants request authority to provide such services at market rates to affiliated foreign
EWGs, Foreign Intermediate Companies and FUCOs, which are companies that do not derive, directly or indirectly,
any material part of their income from sources within the United States and are not public-utility companies operating
in the United States.


Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (70-8527)


Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (``Ohio Valley''), P.O. Box 468, Piketon, Ohio 45661, an electric public-utility
subsidiary company of American Electric Power Company, Inc., a registered holding company, has filed a declaration
under sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act.
Ohio Valley proposes to incur short-term debt through the issuance and sale of notes (``Notes''), prior to January
1, 1997, to banks in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25 million outstanding at any one time. It is stated that the Notes
will mature not more than 270 days after issuance, and no note will mature later than June 30, 1997. Notes will bear interest
at an annual rate not greater than the bank's prime commercial rate. Such credit arrangements may require the payment
of a fee that is not greater than 1/5 of 1% per annum of the size of the line of credit made available by the bank and the maintenance
of additional balances of not greater than 20% of the line of credit.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF STATE</USDEPT>





Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs; U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program: Request
for Proposals for the Tropical Ecosystems Directorate


The Tropical Ecosystems Directorate (TED) of the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program (U.S. MAB) announces a call for
research and activity proposals addressing the theme of sustainable use of tropical forest resources. A total of
$60,000 is available to support a small number of research and activity grants, in the range of $10,000 to $20,000 which
will be awarded in the summer of 1995. Preference will be given to proposals which focus on the Tri-National Region
of Belize, Guatemala, and/or Mexico and complement the core project activities of the TED. Persons interested in
applying for these grants are encouraged to first obtain a copy of the TED core project, ``A Regional Approach for Sustainable
Development and the Conservation of Natural Resources in the Maya Tri-National Region of Belize, Guatemala and Mexico,''
from the U.S. MAB Secretariat.


Funding Objectives


The U.S. MAB/TED small grant program is intended to directly foster cross-border cooperation, research, and exchange
of information to promote the sustainable management of tropical forests in the Tri-National Region. Given limited
available funding and the purpose of the program, U.S. MAB/TED places highest priority on activities that are bi-
or tri-national in nature. In addition, U.S. MAB/TED funding can assist research teams and/or activity projects
to: add a national researcher to their effort; better integrate conservation and sustainable development; add a
particular discipline to an ongoing research project; explore the application of ongoing site-specific research
to an additional site in the Maya Tri-National region; or carry out activities complementary to the TED project in
the region. U.S. MAB/TED funding will not be provided for planning purposes.


Focal Issues


Within the broad thematic focus of sustainable use of tropical forest resources in the Maya Tri-National Region,
U.S. MAB/TED encourages research projects and activities addressing focal issues such as community-based production
systems, tropical forest management for timber and/or non-timber products, economic valuation and accounting
of tropical forest products and services, benefits and costs of low impact uses such as ecotourism, or integration
of biodiversity conservation with production forestry. Proposals which focus on other issues should be consistent
with and complementary to the U.S. MAB/TED core project activities.


Proposal Content


Each proposal should have a title page, a one-page synopsis of the proponent's existing research project if any, a
one-page synopsis of the proposed activities, and up to five pages detailing the proposed use of U.S. MAB/TED funds
that would be complementary of the TED core program, and a one-page itemized budget including personnel, travel,
operations, equipment/supplies, and justification. All sources of income for the project must be included in the
budget. No funds are available for institutional overhead; only direct costs can be supported.


Evaluation and Review Process


A review panel of the U.S. MAB Tropical Ecosystems Directorate will evaluate the proposals based on the following
criteria:

_Degree of relevance to TED core program objectives; 

_Bi-national or tri-national nature of the research or activity; 

_Applicability to promoting sustainable use of tropical forest resources in the Maya Tri-National Region; 

_Degree of involvement of host country investigators; 

_The quality and demonstrated productivity of the principal investigators. 

 


Persons interested in applying should first submit a one to two page project prospectus by January 31, 1995. This prospectus
should provide a brief description of the proposed project and explain how the project meets U.S. MAB/TED selection
criteria. The prospectus should include a simple four-item budget (salaries, equipment/materials, travel, other
costs). The U.S. MAB/TED will review the prospectuses and invite full proposals by March 10, 1995. 

Invitees will have until June 16, 1995 to submit a full proposal. The U.S. MAB/TED will evaluate all proposals and make
final decisions by July 14, 1995. Funds will be committed to the managing institutions identified in the proposals
during August 1995. Principles will receive from the U.S. MAB Secretariat copies of all U.S. MAB/TED review evaluations
of their proposals and a written notification of the directorate's decision on their proposal. 

For further information contact Dr. Roger Soles, U.S. MAB Secretariat, OES/EGC/MAB, Department of State, Washington,
