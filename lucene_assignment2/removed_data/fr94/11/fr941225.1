Milk in the Carolina Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed suspension of rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend for a cooperative association the diversion limitation
of the Carolina Federal milk marketing order (Order 5) for the months of January and February 1995. The proposed suspension
was requested by Carolina Virginia Milk Producers Association (Carolina Virginia). The cooperative association
contends the action is necessary to maintain orderly marketing conditions and ensure that the milk of its member producers
will continue to be pooled during these months. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers
would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.




The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended
to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order
or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling. 

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the suspension
of the following provision of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina marketing area is being considered
for the period of January 1 through February 28, 1995: 

In  1005.13(d)(2), the words ``and January and February''. 

All persons who want to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of their views to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, DC 20090-6456, by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective.

Statement of Consideration 



The Carolina order requires that during each of the months of July through November, January, and February, the total
quantity of milk diverted to nonpool plants by a cooperative association not exceed 25 percent of the producer milk
that such cooperative caused to be delivered to or diverted from such pool plants. The proposed action would suspend
the 25 percent diversion limitation for a cooperative association for the months of January and February. It would
allow a cooperative association to divert an unlimited quantity of each member producer's milk to nonpool plants
if at least six days' production was delivered to a pool plant during the month. 

Carolina Virginia Milk Producers Association (Carolina Virginia), a cooperative association with member producers
pooled on the Alabama (Order 93), Georgia (Order 7), Tennessee Valley (Order 11), and Carolina (Order 5) Federal milk
marketing orders, indicates that effective August 1, 1994, it lost Class I sales with a handler regulated under Order
7. The cooperative then gained Class I sales with a handler regulated under Order 5 effective October 1, 1994, and shifted
the producer milk supply formerly associated with the Order 7 handler to Order 5. This realignment resulted in additional
producer milk delivered to Carolina handlers during the summer and fall months of 1994. 

The cooperative states that it is the balancing agent for its Class I customers under Order 5 for their weekly and seasonal
milk supply. It asserts that the proposed suspension is necessary to accommodate pooling the anticipated production
of its member producers during these months. 

Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from January 1 through February 28, 1995.

Milk in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Marketing Areas; Proposed
Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Orders



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed suspension of rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal that would extend a suspension of certain provisions of the Carolina,
Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Federal milk orders from March 1, 1995, through
February 28, 1996, or until the conclusion of an amendatory proceeding that has been scheduled to deal with these matters.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This action
would lessen the regulatory burden on small entities by removing pricing disparities that are causing or could cause
financial hardship for certain regulated plants.



The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This proposed suspension has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not
intended to have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies,
unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule.

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under  608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the
order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing,
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review
the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the
entry of the ruling.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601-674), the suspension of the following provisions of the orders regulating the handling of milk
in the Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville marketing areas is being considered
for a 12-month period beginning March 1, 1995:

1. In  1005.7(d)(3) of the Carolina order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route disposition,
except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area'';

2. In  1007.7(e)(3) of the Georgia order, the words ``, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section,'';

3. In  1007.7 of the Georgia order, paragraph (e)(4);

4. In  1011.7(d)(3) of the Tennessee Valley order, the words ``from'', ``there'', ``a greater quantity of route
disposition, except filled milk, during the month'', and ``than in this marketing area''; and

5. In  1046.2 of the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville order, the word ``Pulaski''.

All persons who desire to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies
of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington,
DC 20090-6456, by the 30th day after publication of this notice in the

Statement of Consideration



This proposed suspension would extend an existing suspension that has been in effect since March 1, 1994. This suspension
allows a distributing plant at Kingsport, Tennessee, that is located within the Tennessee Valley marketing area
and that meets all of the pooling standards of the Tennessee Valley order to be regulated under that order rather than
the Carolina order despite the plant having greater sales in the Carolina marketing area. It also allows a distributing
plant located at Somerset, Kentucky, that has been regulated under the Tennessee Valley order to remain regulated
there even if it has greater sales in the Louisville-Lexington-Evansville (Order 46) marketing area. In addition,
the suspension allows a supply plant at Springfield, Kentucky, that has been supplying the Somerset plant to remain
pooled under the Tennessee Valley order without having to make uneconomic shipments of milk that it contends would
be necessary to remain pooled if the Southern Belle plant were regulated under Order 46.

The problems prompting the existing suspension of these provisions were thoroughly explained in a suspension order
issued on March 28, 1994 (published April 1, 1994 [59 FR 15315]). In that document, it was noted that ``orderly marketing
will be best preserved by adopting the proposed suspension, for a 12-month period only, to allow the industry time
to develop proposals for a hearing to be held before the suspension period expires.'' [emphasis added]

Due to significant changes that have occurred in these markets within the past year, the Department was delayed in
scheduling the promised proceeding to hear industry proposals for resolving the problems which lead to the suspension
order. Although a hearing has now been scheduled for January 4, 1995, to hear these proposals, this will not allow sufficient
time to evaluate the record and to extend the suspension, if found to be warranted, by the time the current suspension
expires on February 28, 1995.

Advised of these facts, both Southern Belle Dairy Company and Land-O-Sun Dairies, Inc., who were proponents of the
existing suspension, submitted requests to extend the current suspension until the amendatory proceeding was concluded.
This notice is in response to those requests.

Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from March 1, 1995, through February 28, 1996,
or until such earlier time as an order amending the aforesaid orders may be issued on the basis of the hearing that has
been scheduled for January 4, 1995.

Milk in the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the

 Proposed suspension of rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend a portion of the supply plant shipping requirement
of the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri Federal milk marketing order (Order 32) for the months of December 1994
and January 1995. The proposal was submitted by Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc., which contends the suspension is necessary
to ensure that producers historically associated with Order 32 will continue to have their milk pooled under the order
without having to move milk uneconomically.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule

All persons who want to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies

. The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete
the required procedures before the requested suspension is to be effective. 
All written submissions made pursuant to this notice will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division
during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). 


Statement of Consideration 


The proposed action would suspend a portion of the supply plant shipping requirement for a cooperative association
that operates a supply plant under Order 32. It would permit a supply plant operated by a cooperative association to
qualify as a pool plant if the cooperative shipped 25 percent of the plant's total producer receipts to pool distributing
plants during the month and milk from the plant was delivered to a pool distributing plant during each of the immediately
preceding months of September through August. It would remove a requirement that the cooperative must have shipped
75 percent of its milk to pool distributing plants during the September through August period. 
According to Prairie Farms, a dairy farmer cooperative based in Carlinville, Illinois, it owns and operates six fluid
milk processing plants and five manufacturing plants. Prairie Farms states that four of the six fluid milk processing
plants, as well as a cultured product/supply plant, are regulated under the Southern Illinois-Eastern Missouri
Federal milk order. It states that these plants are supplied by its own member dairy farmers and balanced by four cooperative
associations, two of which operate supply plants. 
Prairie Farms indicates that its producer milk for recent months at its plants is about 12 to 14 percent higher than
the same period in 1993 from approximately the same number of producers. It states that the increased production from
its members_primarily due to improved growing conditions that resulted in an abundant supply of high quality feed_has
caused it to reduce purchases from other cooperative associations. As a result, it states that two pool supply plants
operated by the cooperative associations barely met the shipping requirements for the month of October. Prairie
Farms anticipates that a similar situation will occur in November and expects the problem to worsen in the months of
December 1994 and January 1995. 
Prairie Farms states that the proposed suspension would allow Order 32 supply plants to serve the market, but at a level
that should reduce or eliminate the need to make expensive and inefficient movements of milk to meet the supply plant
shipping requirement. Accordingly, it may be appropriate to suspend the aforesaid provisions from December 1, 1994,
through January 31, 1995.

Milk in the Carolina, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville Marketing Areas; Notice of Hearing
on Proposed Amendments to Tentative Marketing Agreements and Orders 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearing on proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 A public hearing is being held in response to industry requests to amend the Carolina, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
Federal milk marketing orders. Several proposals would amend the pooling standards of the Tennessee Valley and Carolina
orders; one proposal would change the marketing areas of the Tennessee Valley and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville
orders; and another proposal would change locational pricing under the Carolina order.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 



Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Radisson Plaza Hotel, 101 South Tryon Street, Charlotte,
NC 28280 (Tel: (704) 377-0400), beginning at 9:00 a.m., on January 4, 1995, with respect to proposed amendments
to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina, Tennessee
Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville marketing areas. 

The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601-674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR Part 900). 

The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreements and to the orders. 

Actions under the Federal milk order program are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and informational requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small businesses. 

The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties
may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary
a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order
is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler
is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition.
The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant,
or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition,
provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 4 copies
of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of
other participants at the hearing.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking; Extension of Time for Comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On September 30, 1994, the Financial Management Service issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes to revise
the regulations defining the responsibilities and liabilities of the Federal Government, Federal Reserve Banks,
financial institutions, Receivers, and Originators doing business with the Government through the Automated Clearing
House (ACH) system. (59 FR 50112). The revisions are intended to provide a regulatory basis for broader use of the ACH
system to meet the future payment, collection and information flow needs of the Government. The revisions also are
intended to bring Government regulations more in line with financial industry rules so as to eliminate, as much as
possible, the need for the financial industry to operate under two sets of rules for processing ACH transactions.
The date for filing comments is being extended at the request of various interested commenters.

Claims Based on Exposure to Ionizing Radiation (Lymphomas Other Than Hodgkin's Disease and Cancer of the Rectum)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the Department of Veterans Affairs adjudication regulations concerning diseases
presumed to be the result of exposure to ionizing radiation. This amendment is necessary to implement a decision by
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that lymphomas other than Hodgkin's disease and cancer of the rectum are ``radiogenic.''
The intended effect of this action is to add these conditions to the list of radiogenic diseases for service-connected
compensation purposes. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under 38 CFR 1.17(c), when the Secretary determines that a significant statistical association exists between exposure
to ionizing radiation and any disease, 38 CFR 3.311(b)(2) 
 is amended to provide guidelines for the establishment of service-connection for that disease. Such a determination
is made after receiving the advice of the Veterans Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards (VACEH) based on its
evaluation of scientific and medical studies. 


On October 28-29, 1993, the VACEH held a public meeting in Washington, DC, and reviewed 53 medical and scientific
studies having to do with radiation exposure and subsequent development of disease. Based on this review, VACEH recommended
that VA add lymphomas other than Hodgkin's disease and rectal cancer to the list of diseases recognized by VA as being
radiogenic. 
VA has previously recognized an association between radiation exposure and the development of multiple myeloma
as well as all forms of leukemia except chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In its report, VACEH noted the close histologic
relationship between acute lymphocytic leukemia and some of the lymphomas. Further, the report of the National Research
Council's Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR), entitled ``Health Effects of Exposure
to Ionizing Radiation: BEIR V,'' noted that both malignant myeloma and the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are malignancies
of the B lymphocytes which have been observed in humans to increase in frequency after irradiation. Based on these
considerations, the Secretary has determined that an association exists between radiation exposure and subsequent
development of lymphomas other than Hodgkin's disease. 
VA has also previously recognized both colon cancer and skin cancer as radiogenic diseases. While some studies have
addressed colon cancer and rectal cancer together, the BEIR V report addressed them separately. VACEH also considered
them as separate entities, noting that the rectal tissue of ectodermal origin is not pathologically part of the colon.
While the BEIR V report gave conflicting conclusions about rectal cancer, the report of the United Nations Scientific
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation recognized an association between radiation exposure and rectal cancer.
VACEH therefore recommended that cancer of the rectum be added to the radiogenic disease list. After review of these
studies, the Secretary has determined that an association exists between radiation exposure and rectal cancer.

We propose to amend 38 CFR 3.311(b) (2) to implement the Secretary's decision effective the date of publication of
the final rule. 
The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP)
request to redesignate the Jersey County, Illinois ozone nonattainment area to attainment. The USEPA is also approving
the accompanying maintenance plan as an SIP revision. The redesignation request and maintenance plan were submitted
by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) on November 12, 1993. The State has met the requirements for
redesignation contained in the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990. The redesignation request is based on ambient
monitoring data that show no violations for the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) during the three-year
period from 1990 through 1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 12, 1993, the IEPA submitted a redesignation and maintenance plan for Jersey County as a requested revision
to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP). The IEPA has requested that Jersey County be redesignated to attainment
for ozone. 


On November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694), the USEPA formally designated Jersey County as a marginal ozone nonattainment area.
This classification and designation was based on a monitored violation of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) in Jersey County in 1988. 
Jersey County is a rural county located approximately 25 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri. Based on the 1990 census,
the population of Jersey County is 20,539, with the largest urban population being that of Jerseyville, with a population
of approximately 8,000. 


I. USEPA Redesignation Policy


The Act's requirements for redesignation to attainment are contained in section 107(d)(3)(E). These requirements
and other USEPA redesignation requirements are discussed in a September 4, 1992, memorandum from the Director of
the Air Quality Management Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Directors of Regional Air Divisions.
As outlined in this memorandum, section 107(d)(3)(E) requires that the following conditions be met for redesignation
to attainment: 
1. The USEPA must determine that the area subject to the redesignation request has attained the NAAQS; 
2. The USEPA must have fully approved the applicable SIP for the subject area under section 110(k) of the Act; 
3. The USEPA must determine that the improvement in air quality in the area is due to permanent and enforceable reductions
in emissions resulting from the implementation of the applicable SIP, Federal air pollution control regulations,
and other federally enforceable emission reductions; 
4. The USEPA must have fully approved a maintenance plan for the area as meeting the requirements of section 175A of
the Act; and 
5. The State must have met all requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D of the Act. 
To demonstrate that the area has attained the ozone NAAQS, the State must show that the ozone data in the area do not exhibit
violation of the NAAQS at any monitoring site in the area during the most recent three years of monitoring at the sites.
In accordance with 40 CFR part 50.9, the annual average number of expected exceedances of the ozone standard (0.12
parts per million [ppm], one-hour averaged) at any monitor cannot exceed 1.0 during the three year period. The data
used in this demonstration must be quality assured, in accordance with 40 CFR part 58, and collected in accordance
with 40 CFR part 50, appendix H. The data should be recorded in USEPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS).

The SIP for the area must be fully approved under section 110(k) of the Act and must satisfy all requirements that apply
to the area. These requirements include new requirements added by the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The State
must meet all requirements of section 110 and part D of the Act that were applicable prior to the submittal of the complete,
finally adopted redesignation request. (It should be noted that, based on section 175A of the Act, other requirements
of part D of the Act remain in effect until the USEPA approves the maintenance plan and the redesignation to attainment.
If the USEPA disapproves the request to redesignate an area to attainment, these requirements remain in effect with
no delay.) A SIP which meets the pre-redesignation request submittal requirements must be fully approved by the USEPA
prior to USEPA's approval of the redesignation of the area to attainment of the NAAQS. The requirements of title I of
the Act, which includes section 110 and part D of the Act, are discussed in the April 16, 1992, 

General Preamble to Title I

 (57 FR 13498). 
The State must be able to reasonably attribute the improvements in air quality to permanent and enforceable emission
reductions. Attainment resulting from temporary emission reductions or from temporary favorable (not conducive
to high ozone concentrations) meteorology would not qualify as a permanent air quality improvement. The State should
demonstrate that the emission reductions from a past high ozone period (generally the year or period for which the
area's ozone classification design value was determined, 1988 for Jersey County) to the period of attainment were
due to the implementation of permanent and enforceable emission control measures and were sufficient to explain
the attainment of the ozone NAAQS. 
Prior to the redesignation of an area to attainment, the USEPA must fully approve a maintenance plan (as a SIP revision)
which meets the requirements of section 175A of the Act. The maintenance plan must provide for maintenance of the NAAQS
attainment in the area for at least 10 years after the USEPA approval of the redesignation request. The maintenance
plan must contain additional emission control measures as necessary to assure maintenance of the NAAQS (generally
this means maintaining the precursor emissions at or below the attainment year levels). The Act also requires (section
175A(b)) a second SIP revision 8 years after an area is redesignated to attainment to assure maintenance of the NAAQS
for an additional 10 years beyond the first 10 year maintenance period. 
The maintenance plan must contain such contingency measures as the USEPA deems necessary to ensure prompt correction
of any violation of the NAAQS occurring after the area is redesignated to attainment or exceedance of other triggering
levels, such as emissions exceeding attainment levels (this could be caused by emission increases not anticipated
in the maintenance plan). 
At a minimum, the maintenance plan should contain the following elements: 


1. Attainment Inventory 


The State must develop an emissions inventory for the initial period of attainment to identify the level of emissions
which is associated with attainment of the NAAQS. This emissions inventory must be consistent with USEPA's most recent
guidance on preparation and documentation of emission inventories. The emissions inventory should be based on actual,
typical summer weekday emissions of ozone precursors (Volatile Organic Compounds [VOC], Oxides of Nitrogen [NO

X

], and Carbon Monoxide [CO]). 


2. Maintenance Demonstration 


A State may generally demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS by either showing that future emissions of the ozone precursors
will not exceed the levels of the emissions in the attainment inventory or by modeling to demonstrate that the future
mix of sources and emission rates will not cause a violation of the NAAQS. The maintenance plan should be based on the
same type and level of modeling used to demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS in the SIP. Regardless of which approach
is used, the State must project the emissions for the 10 year period following the anticipated time of the USEPA approval
of the redesignation request (the State should assume that the USEPA will take two years to complete the rulemaking
on the redesignation request). The projected emissions must reflect the expected actual emissions based on enforceable
emission rates and typical source activity rates, such as production rates, adjusted for expected source growth.
Projected emission reductions must reflect the impacts of permanent, enforceable emission control measures. The
assumptions of emission reductions and source growth and techniques used to project the emissions must be clearly
documented.

<TEXT>
 

3. Monitoring Network


The maintenance plan must contain provisions for the continued operation of ozone air quality monitors in the area
to be redesignated. This is needed to provide verification of the maintenance of the NAAQS attainment, and is also
needed to provide triggering data for the activation of contingency measures in the event of a future violation or
exceedance of the NAAQS (the State may choose to activate some contingency measures when the NAAQS is simply exceeded
but not yet violated to prevent future NAAQS violations).


4. Verification of Continued Attainment


The State must assure that it has the legal authority to implement and enforce all measures necessary to attain and
maintain the NAAQS. In addition, the maintenance plan must indicate how the State will track the progress and success
of the maintenance plan. This includes tracking air quality levels and emissions.


5. Contingency Plan


Section 175A of the amended Act requires that a maintenance plan include contingency provisions, as necessary, to
promptly correct any violation of the NAAQS that occurs after the redesignation of an area to attainment. For the purposes
of section 175A, a State is not required to fully adopt contingency measures that will take effect without further
action by the State. The contingency plan, however, is considered to be an enforceable part of the SIP and must ensure
that the contingency measures will be adopted and implemented expeditiously after they are triggered. The plan must
clearly identify the measures that will be considered for adoption, a schedule and procedure for their adoption and
implementation, and a specific time limit for action by the State. The plan must also identify the specific indicators
or triggers that will be used to determine when the contingency measures will be required.


II. Summary of the Illinois Redesignation Submittal


Summarized below are the contents of the Illinois redesignation request and maintenance plan.


A. Monitored Attainment of the NAAQS


During the period of 1990 through 1992 (the three year period covered by the redesignation request), two exceedances
of the ozone standard, 0.127 ppm and 0.125 ppm, were monitored in Jersey County, with both exceedances recorded in
1990. The expected ozone standard exceedance rate for the 1990-1992 period was 0.67 exceedance per year. This
is in contrast to seven ozone standard exceedances, with a peak ozone concentration of 0.128 ppm, monitored in 1988,
when ozone monitoring was initiated in Jersey County. The IEPA has quality assured the 1990-1992 ozone data
for Jersey County and has entered these data into AIRS.
As a check on the continued attainment of the NAAQS in Jersey County, one may also consider the 1993 peak ozone concentrations
(not addressed in the Illinois redesignation request, but registered in AIRS). Two exceedances of the ozone standard,
0.135 ppm and 0.127 ppm, were monitored in Jersey County in 1993. The 1991 through 1993 data continue to show attainment
of the ozone NAAQS, with an annual average expected exceedance rate of 0.67.
These data show that attainment of the ozone NAAQS has been monitored in Jersey County based on the most recent quality
assured air quality data available.


B. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D


Until 1991 and prior to the 1990 amendment of the Act, Jersey County had been designated as attainment for ozone. The
only ozone precursor emission control regulations covering Jersey County were statewide Reasonably Available
Control Technology (RACT) regulations and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations covering
the growth of new or existing sources. The USEPA has promulgated PSD regulations for Illinois, which have been delegated
to the State for implementation. The USEPA has previously approved Illinois' RACT regulations covering Jersey County.
The IEPA certifies that all RACT controls required in Jersey County have been implemented and will remain in effect
after the redesignation of the County to attainment. These rules will remain in effect until the State demonstrates
to the USEPA's satisfaction that the ozone standard can be maintained without one or more of the controls.
Title 40 CFR part 52, subpart O, section 52.722, evidences that the Illinois SIP was approved under section 110 of the
Act and that the USEPA found that the SIP satisfied all part D, title I (as amended in 1977), requirements. The 1990 Act
amendments, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and under part D, revised sections 172 and 182 adding new requirements
for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to satisfy the requirement that the SIP meet
all applicable requirements under the Act, USEPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures and information
that were due under the Act, as amended in 1990, prior to or at the same time Illinois submitted the redesignation request
as considered here. The USEPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(V) of the Act to mean that, for a redesignation request
to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that applied to the subject area prior to and at the same time
of the submission of the complete redesignation request.


B.1. Section 110 Requirements


Although section 110 of the Act was amended in 1990, the Illinois SIP addressing the Jersey County area meets the requirements
of section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements in section 110(a)(2) did not change in substance and, therefore,
USEPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP meets these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended (57
FR 27936 and 23939, June 23, 1993), many duplicate other requirements of the Act and are addressed below.


B.2. Part D Requirements


Before Jersey County can be redesignated to attainment, the area and its associated SIP must meet the applicable requirements
of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1
of part D sets forth the basic requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Subpart 2 of part D establishes
additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified in table 1 of section 181(a) of the Act. As described
in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I, specific requirements of subpart 2 may override
Subpart 1's general provisions (57 FR 13501). On November 6, 1991, Jersey County was classified as a marginal ozone
nonattainment area (56 FR 56694). Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the State, for Jersey County,
must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of
part D as they pertain to marginal ozone nonattainment areas.

B.2.a. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions


Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the
section 172(c) requirements are applicable on a schedule as determined by the Administrator, but no later than three
years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the amended Act. With the exception of requirements
for which subpart 2 established SIP submission dates for corollary requirements prior to November 12, 1993 (which
are discussed below), the requirements of section 172(c) were not applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before
November 12, 1993, the date on which the State of Illinois submitted the complete redesignation request for Jersey
County. Therefore, these requirements, including those of sections 172(c)(2) and 172(c)(9) are not applicable
requirements for purposes of evaluating this redesignation request.
With respect to the requirement of section 172(c)(1) concerning the adoption of RACT, the USEPA notes that, as discussed
elsewhere in this action, Illinois has completed the adoption of stationary source RACT rules statewide, the USEPA
has approved these rules in prior rulemaking, and has found no deficiencies in the rules for Jersey County. In addition,
the USEPA notes that, with respect to Jersey County, no additional RACT controls beyond the RACT rules already covered
in the SIP are necessary or were required at the time of the submission of the redesignation request.
With respect to the emissions inventory requirement of section 172(c)(3), the USEPA notes that the State of Illinois
has developed and submitted the required emissions inventory, which section 182(a)(1) required to be submitted
by November 15, 1992. This emissions inventory has been the subject of separate review and rulemaking by the USEPA.
EPA expects to take final action approving the emissions inventory before the USEPA takes final action approving
the redesignation request for Jersey County. The emissions inventory must be approved for EPA to take final action
approving this redesignation request.
As for the section 172(c)(5) New Source Review (NSR) requirement, once an area is redesignated to attainment this
requirement is no longer applicable. The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD)
requirements in lieu of the part D NSR program. Under USEPA policy described in a Memorandum from Mary Nichols, Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation, dated October 14, 1994, and area need not comply with the NSR requirement of section
172(c) to be redesignated if it is demonstrated that the area will continue to maintain the ozone standard without
a part D NSR program in place. As the State of Illinois has demonstrated the maintenance of the standard will occur without
a part D NSR program (see discussion below) and PSD requirements will apply, the lack of fully-approved part D NSR rules
applicable to Jersey County does not preclude the redesignation of Jersey County.
The requirements of section 172(c) are discussed below along with their relevancy to the redesignation request at
hand:
(1) Section 172(c)(1) of the Act requires SIPs to provide for all Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) as
expeditiously as practicable and to provide for attainment of the NAAQS. As discussed elsewhere in this action, Illinois
has completed the adoption of stationary source RACT rules statewide. The USEPA has approved these statewide RACT
rules in prior rulemaking and has found no deficiencies in the rules for Jersey County.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941125-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the USEPA notes that, with respect to Jersey County, no additional RACM controls beyond the RACT rules
already covered in the SIP are necessary upon redesignation to attainment. The April 16, 1992, General Preamble to
the Implementation of Title I (57 FR 13560) explains that section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment
areas to provide for the implementation of RACM as expeditiously as practicable. The USEPA interprets this requirement
to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such
measures as are reasonably available for implementation in the area's attainment demonstration. Because attainment
has been reached in Jersey County, no additional measures are needed to provide for attainment. 


(2) Section 172(c)(2) requires the SIP to provide for Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) towards attainment of the
NAAQS. This requirement only has relevance during the time it takes the area to attain the NAAQS. Because Jersey County
has already attained the NAAQS, the SIP has already achieved the necessary RFP towards attainment of the NAAQS. 


(3) Section 172(c)(3) requires the SIP to contain a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions
from all sources of the relevant pollutants. The State of Illinois has developed and submitted the required emissions
inventory for Jersey County. This emissions inventory has been the subject of separate review and rulemaking by the
USEPA. The approval of the emissions inventory is expected to be (and must be) finalized before the USEPA takes action
to approve in final the redesignation of Jersey County to attainment for ozone. 


(4) Section 172(c)(4) requires the SIP to identify and quantify the emissions which will be allowed to result from
the construction of major new or modified stationary sources in the ozone nonattainment areas. Although the USEPA
has not approved Illinois' NSR regulations, it should be noted that once an area is redesignated to attainment, nonattainment
NSR requirements are not generally applicable. The redesignated area becomes subject to PSD requirements instead
of the NSR requirements. The USEPA has promulgated acceptable PSD regulations for Illinois and has delegated the
implementation of these regulations to the State. It should be noted, however, that until the USEPA officially redesignates
Jersey County to attainment for ozone, sources seeking permits for major modifications or major source construction
must be addressed through a new source review acceptable to the USEPA. 




(5) Section 172(c)(7) requires the SIP to meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). As noted above, the
USEPA believes that the Illinois SIP meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2). 


(6) Section 172(c)(9) requires the SIP to contain contingency measures to be undertaken if an area fails to make RFP
or fails to attain the NAAQS. Since Jersey County has attained the NAAQS, the section 172(c)(9) contingency measure
requirements are not applicable unless the redesignation request and maintenance plan are not fully approved. It
should be noted that section 175A contingency measures apply to areas that are redesignated to attainment. 




B.2.b. Other Part D Requirements 




Below is a summary of Illinois' compliance with the part D requirements for marginal ozone nonattainment areas, such
as Jersey County. 


(1) 

Submittal of a Comprehensive Base Year Emissions Inventory. 


Section 182(a)(1) of the Act requires the State to submit a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual
emissions from all sources of ozone precursors. As noted above, Illinois has submitted a final, adopted 1990 base
year emissions inventory and associated documentation for Jersey County. This emissions inventory is being reviewed
in a separate rulemaking action. A Technical Support Document (TSD) recommending approval of this emissions inventory
has been prepared to support a direct final rulemaking on this emissions inventory. This emissions inventory must
be approved in final rulemaking before the USEPA can approve the redesignation of Jersey County in final rulemaking.



(2) 

Emission Statement SIP Revision. 

Section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Act requires the State to submit a SIP revision to require stationary sources of VOC or
NO

X

 to annually submit statements of emissions from the sources. Illinois has submitted this SIP revision. A final USEPA
rulemaking approving this SIP revision was published on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47379). 


(3) 

New Source Review Regulations. 

Section 182(a)(2)(C) of the Act requires the State to submit a SIP revision to: (a) require source permits in accordance
with sections 172(c)(5) and 173 of the Act for the construction and operation of each new or modified major source (with
respect to the emissions of ozone precursors); and (b) correct requirements in the existing SIP concerning permit
programs as were required under section 172(b)(6) of the pre-1990 Act to comply with regulations promulgated by the
USEPA prior to the 1990 amendment of the Act. Illinois has submitted a SIP revision request to comply with the requirements
of section 182(a)(2)(C). The USEPA has reviewed this SIP revision request and has proposed to approve it (September
23, 1994, 59 FR 48839). Although the USEPA has not taken final rulemaking Action on this SIP revision, it should be noted
that the USEPA does not consider compliance with these requirements to be a prerequisite to the redesignation or an
area to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA believes that the applicability of the part C PSD program to maintenance
areas makes it unnecessary to require that an area have obtained full approval of NSR regulations required by part
D of the Act in order to be redesignated. The USEPA believes that this interpretation of the Act is appropriate notwithstanding
the requirement in section 175A(d) that the contingency provisions of a maintenance plan include a commitment on
the part of the State to implement all measures to control the relevant air pollutant that were contained in the SIP
prior to redesignation. The term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and it appears that Congress utilized
the terms ``measure'' or ``control measure'' differently in different provisions of the Act that concern the PSD
and NSR permitting programs. Compare section 110(a)(2) (A) and (C) with section 161. In light of this ambiguity in
the use of the term ``measure,'' USEPA believes that the term ``measure'' as used in section 175A(d) may be interpreted
so as not to include NSR permitting programs. That this is an appropriate interpretation is further supported by USEPA's
historical practice, dating before the amended Act, of not requiring redesignating areas to demonstrate through
modeling or to otherwise justify replacing the nonattainment area NSR program with the PSD program once the areas
were redesignated. Rather, the USEPA has historically allowed the NSR programs to be automatically replaced by the
PSD programs upon redesignation. 


(4) 

RACT corrections. 

Section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act requires the State to correct deficiencies in the State's RACT regulations noted
by the USEPA prior to the amended Act. The State notes that no deficiencies were noted for the RACT regulations applicable
to Jersey County. Therefore, RACT corrections are not an issue for the Jersey County redesignation.

(5) 

Conformity of federal actions with the SIP. 

Section 176(c) of the Act requires the States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIPs. The requirement
to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under
Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions
(``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by the States
be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided
for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final USEPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I informed
the States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557, April 16, 1992).



The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63214). These conformity regulations require the States to adopt
both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIPs for areas designated nonattainment or subject
to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity
rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Illinois is required to submit a SIP revision containing
transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November
25, 1994. Similarly, the State of Illinois is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria
and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for
these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(V) and,
thus, do not affect approval of the redesignation request. It should be noted, however, that regardless of the attainment
status of Jersey County, Illinois is obligated under the transportation conformity rule and under the general conformity
rule to submit the conformity SIP revisions, including revisions covering Jersey County by the deadlines discussed
here. Therefore, the attainment status of Jersey County should not be an issue in this case. It is further noted that
the Illinois redesignation request for Jersey County indicates that the State of Illinois will submit a SIP revision
to meet USEPA's conformity requirements after Illinois has had sufficient time to review and act on USEPA's final
conformity regulations. 



C. Improvement of Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable Emission Reductions 




The IEPA notes, on the basis of relative emissions and on the basis of the meteorology leading to high ozone concentrations
in Jersey County, that the high ozone concentrations observed in Jersey County in 1988 were due to ozone precursor
emissions in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area. For example, the IEPA notes that the 1990
summertime VOC emissions in Jersey County were only 20 tons per day while the VOC emissions in the St. Louis/Metro-East
St. Louis ozone nonattainment area were 922 tons per day. Given the proximity of the 
St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area, the dominance of ozone precursor emissions from that area
compared to those from Jersey County, and the meteorology of peak ozone days in Jersey County (winds are predominately
from the southeast through southwest on these days placing Jersey County immediately downwind of the St. Louis/Metro-East
St. Louis area), one can see that the ozone precursor emissions in the St. Louis/Metro-East 
St. Louis area are the likely source of the high ozone concentrations in Jersey County. 


Between 1987 and 1990, the following VO emission control measures were implemented in the Metro-East St. Louis area:
(1) reduction in fuel volatility (Reid Vapor Pressure [RVP]) from 11.2 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.0 psi; (2)
continued implementation of the Federal Motor Vehicle Emission Control Program (FMVCP); (3) basic vehicle Inspection
and Maintenance (I/M); and (4) RACT. In Jersey County, the following VOC emission control measures were implemented
between 1987 and 1990: (1) reduction in fuel RVP from 11.2 psi to 9.5 psi; (2) continued implementation of the FMVCP;
and (3) RACT on major sources. These emission control programs produced real and permanent decreases in VOC emissions
and are responsible for the attainment of the ozone NAAQS in Jersey County. 


The largest emission reductions have occurred for mobile sources and gasoline related evaporative emissions, which
are a significant portion of the total VOC emissions for the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis and Jersey County areas.
Mobile source emissions decreased approximately 25 percent between 1987 and 1990, and gasoline evaporative emissions
decreased approximately 10 percent in the same time period. 




D. Maintenance Plan 




The following summarizes Illinois' maintenance plan for Jersey County: 


(1) 

Emission certification and tracking. 

The IEPA will continue to inventory ozone precursor emissions in Jersey County and will make periodic updates in the
emissions inventory consistent with the requirements of the Act. The IEPA will track Jersey County emissions to ensure
that significant increases in emissions are identified and evaluated for possible air quality impacts. If significant
negative air impacts are indicated, appropriate regulatory action will be initiated.

<PARENT> FR941125-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) 

Maintenance of existing control programs. 

The IEPA commits to continue enforcement of all State-adopted emission control measures included in the Illinois
SIP. This will include review and issuance of stationary source permits and inspection of emission sources consistent
with the USEPA-approved Illinois program plan. This commitment insures that future VOC emission levels will not
exceed current levels in Jersey County. 

(3) 

Compliance with Act requirements for the Metro-East St. Louis area. 


The IEPA notes that the Act requires the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area to achieve additional
VOC emission reductions beyond the current emission levels. For example, the area will achieve an additional 15 percent
VOC emission reduction from the 1990 emission level by 1996 as the result of Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) requirements.
Accounting for source growth and emission reductions expected in the Metro-East St. Louis area through 2004, the
IEPA expects an 18 ton per day VOC emission reduction between 1990 and 2004 (ten years after the year in which the USEPA
is expected to approve the redesignation of Jersey County). This emission decrease does not account for the additional
emission reduction that will occur in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis area as a result of the attempt to attain the
ozone standard by 1996. 

(4) 

Contingency measures. 

After Jersey County is redesignated to attainment, the trigger for contingency measures will be a violation of the
ozone standard based on quality assured data and a notice from the USEPA that the State of Illinois has failed to maintain
the ozone NAAQS. After these triggering conditions have occurred, the IEPA will select the appropriate contingency
measure(s) to prevent a violation of the ozone standard from reoccurring. The State commits to apply such a contingency
measure within 18 months after the receipt of the notification from the USEPA of the NAAQS violation (A time schedule
for the actions leading to the implementation of emission control measures was not given in the maintenance plan.
It is assumed that the State will adopt necessary regulations earlier than 18 months, such that the regulations can
be implemented within the 18 month time period). 
The contingency measure(s) to be considered will be selected from the following list or from measures deemed appropriate
and effective at the time the control measure selection is actually made:



a. lower reid vapor pressure for gasoline 
b. reformulated gasoline program 
c. Stage I and breathing controls at gasoline service stations 
d. Stage II vapor recovery controls at gasoline service stations 
e. extended geographic coverage of existing control measures 
f. requirements for RACT for existing source covered by USEPA Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) issued in response
to the amended Act 
g. application of RACT to non-major sources 
h. implementation of one or more transportation control measures sufficient to achieve at least a 0.5 percent reduction
in Jersey County VOC emissions. The transportation control measures will be selected from the following: 


i. trip reduction programs, including but not limited to employer-based transportation management plans, areawide
rideshare programs, work schedule changes, and telecommuting 
ii. transit improvements 
iii. traffic flow improvements 
iv. other transportation control measures in widespread use that the State and local governments deem to be appropriate



i. alternative fuel programs for fleet vehicle operations 
j. controls on consumer products consistent with those adopted elsewhere in the United States 
k. requirements for VOC emission offsets for new and modified major VOC sources

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941125-1-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

l. requirements for VOC emission offsets for new and modified minor VOC sources 
m. increased ratio of emission offsets required for new sources; and 
n. requirements for VOC controls on new minor sources.



The contingency measures may be considered for Jersey County or for upwind areas whose emissions impact the air quality
in Jersey County. The selection of a particular contingency measure for implementation will be based on VOC emission
reduction potential, cost-effectiveness, economic and social considerations, or other factors that the IEPA deems
to be appropriate. 

(5) 

Emission control authority and additional commitments. 

The IEPA certifies that it has the authority to continue the application of existing emission control measures and
additional emission control measures if required. 

The IEPA commits to continue monitoring of ozone in Jersey County for the purposes of tracking continued maintenance
of the ozone standard attainment. Additionally, the IEPA commits to revise the maintenance plan as necessary to comply
with any subsequent USEPA finding that the maintenance plan is inadequate to maintain attainment of the ozone NAAQS
(such a finding would be made by the USEPA if subsequent violations of the ozone standard showed that the maintenance
plan is adequate to maintain attainment of the ozone standard or to further lower emissions after a monitored violation
of the ozone standard) and to revise the maintenance plan in eight years in compliance with section 175A of the Act.


(6) 

Demonstration of maintenance. 

To demonstrate maintenance of the NAAQS, the IEPA has projected VOC, NOx, and CO emissions to 2004, ten years after
USEPA is expected to approve the redesignation of Jersey County. Emission projections were based on methodology
consistent with USEPA guidelines. For stationary point sources, the IEPA used growth factors obtained from Regional
Economic Models, Incorporated (REMI) using Illinois-specific data. Area source and off-highway emissions were
projected using population projections and other factors consistent with the approach used to project emissions
in the State's 15 percent rate of progress plan (currently under development). On-highway emissions were projected
assuming an annual growth rate of 2.5 percent as estimated by the Illinois Department of Transportation. On-highway
emissions were estimated using MOBILE5a. 

Emission estimates for the attainment base year (1990), 2006, and several interim years are given below:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941125-1-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941125-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The IEPA believes the decrease in VOC and CO emissions and relatively constant NO

X

 emissions (the small increase in NO

X

 emissions between 1990 and 2004 is viewed by the IEPA to be inconsequential with respect to ozone concentration changes)
between 1990 and 2004 demonstrates the maintenance of the ozone NAAQS for the required ten year maintenance period.

It should be noted that the interim year emissions above were determined by the USEPA based on discussions with the
IEPA. The USEPA and IEPA agreed that the interim year emission estimates should be based on linear interpolation between
the 1990 and 2004 emission estimates. This is consistent with the source growth estimation procedure used by the State
to estimate the 2004 emission levels, and USEPA believes that this method is appropriate and reasonable for estimating
the interim year emissions. The USEPA believes that this method provides reasonable estimates of the emission levels
in those years and does not underestimate those emissions. The interim year estimates support the IEPA's conclusion
that the ozone NAAQS should be maintained in Jersey County for the period between 1990 and 2004. 


III. USEPA Analysis of Redesignation Request 


1. Monitored Attainment of the NAAQS 


The IEPA has collected quality assured ozone data showing attainment of the ozone standard at all monitoring sites
during the most recent three years of monitoring. These data are recorded in AIRS. 


2. Approved State Implementation Plan 


Jersey County is covered by a SIP approved by the USEPA under section 110 and part D of the Act. Illinois has implemented
this SIP. The implementation of this SIP included the adoption and implementation of USEPA approved RACT regulations
and other required reasonably available control measures required by the pre-1990 Act. 
Illinois has complied with the amended Act. Illinois has submitted a 1990 base year emissions inventory for VOC, CO,
and NO

X

 emissions. This emissions inventory appears to be acceptable, and must be approved in final before the USEPA can approve
the redesignation of Jersey County to attainment for ozone. The emission inventory is the subject of a separate rulemaking
action. Illinois has also submitted a SIP revision requiring annual emission statements from major sources and the
SIP was approved by USEPA on 
September 9, 1993, (See 58 FR 47379). 
As noted above, although Illinois' NSR regulations have not been approved by the USEPA, the USEPA does not consider
this to be reasonable basis for disapproving Illinois' redesignation request since PSD requirements will replace
NSR after Jersey County has been redesignated to attainment. Until such time, addition of major new sources or major
modification of existing ozone precursor sources must be covered NSR permits acceptable to both the State of Illinois
and the USEPA. 
Lack of adopted mobile source conformity regulations is inconsequential since such regulations are required whether
Jersey County is designated as nonattainment or attainment for ozone. 


3. Improvement of Air Quality Due to Permanent Emission Reductions 


Implementation of VOC emission controls in Jersey County and in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment
areas has led to permanent, enforceable emission reductions which can explain the observed improvement in ozone
levels in Jersey County. 


4. Maintenance Plan 


The contingency portion of the maintenance plan was found to be acceptable. In addition, an acceptable demonstration
of maintenance for Jersey County has been made through emission projections to 2004. 
One issue concerning the contingency measures, however, must be noted. As discussed above, Illinois has chosen to
include the implementation of tighter gasoline RVP (requiring lower RVP) requirements as a contingency measure.
At the same time Illinois was finalizing its maintenance plans, the USEPA issued new guidance concerning the use of
lower RVP as contingency measures in maintenance plans. This new guidance was provided in a 
November 8, 1993, memorandum from Michael Horowitz, Office of General Counsel, to Directors of Air and Radiation
Divisions. The guidance indicates that, for States to include lower RVP as a contingency measure in maintenance plans,
the maintenance plan must include several things with respect to this contingency measure. First, the maintenance
plan must indicate that if the former nonattainment area fell back into nonattainment, the State would submit a request
to the USEPA to find under section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act that the lower RVP requirement is necessary for the area to
achieve the ozone NAAQS. Second, since the implementation of a lower RVP would rely upon USEPA's determination of
whether it was necessary to achieve attainment, the State must provide for the possibility that a lower RVP could not
be implemented. To do so, the State would need to provide for a backup measure in the maintenance plan. The maintenance
plan could also include a commitment to adopt, as an alternative to the specified measure, measures identified by
the USEPA as practicable in its denial of the State's request for a lower RVP requirement. If the State chooses to adopt
measures specified by the USEPA and the USEPA has provided several options for acceptable measures, the State must
adopt the requisite number of these measures as is necessary to again achieve the standard. The State would need to
include a schedule for submittal of the section 211(c)(4)(C) request to the USEPA and a schedule for final adoption
and implementation of a lower RVP standard, or the back-up measure(s), or the alternative measures selected by the
USEPA. The schedule would need to be tied to the triggering event for the contingency measure, not to USEPA action on
the 211(c)(4)(C) request. 
Notwithstanding the November 8, 1993, policy discussed above, which was not available to Illinois at the time the
State was finalizing and submitting it maintenance plans to the USEPA, USEPA should approve Illinois' maintenance
plan as it currently exists. This is because Illinois has identified a wide range of contingency measures to choose
from in the maintenance plan and is, therefore, not relying exclusively on lower RVP requirements as a contingency
measure. If Illinois, however, upon the triggering of the need to implement contingency measures, chooses to implement
requirements for lower RVP, Illinois must submit the section 211(c)(4)(C) request in compliance with the Act. 
Based on the above, it is recommended that the USEPA approve Illinois' request for the redesignation of Jersey County
to attainment for ozone as well as Illinois' maintenance plan for this county. 


IV. USEPA's Proposed Rulemaking Action 


The USEPA proposes to approve the redesignation of Jersey County to attainment for ozone because the State of Illinois
has met the requirements of the Act revising the Illinois ozone SIP. 


V. Request for Public Comments 


USEPA is requesting comments on the requested SIP revision and this proposed rule. As indicated at the outset of this
notice, USEPA will consider any comments received by December 27, 1994. 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small
entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction
over populations of less than 50,000. 

The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Revisions are proposed to the monitoring requirements of subpart A and to performance specification 1 (PS-1)
of appendix B. Today's action proposes revisions to clarify and update requirements for source owners and operators
who must install and use continuous stack or duct opacity monitoring equipment. Today's action also proposes amendments
regarding design and performance validation requirements for continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) equipment
in appendix B, PS-1. These amendments to subpart A and PS-1 will not change the affected facilities' applicable
emission standards or requirement to monitor. The amendments will: (1) clarify owner and operator and monitor vendor
obligations, (2) reaffirm and update COMS design and performance requirements, and (3) provide EPA and affected
facilities with equipment assurances for carrying out effective monitoring. 



A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of

I. Introduction 


These revisions to subpart A and PS-1 will apply to all continuous opacity monitors installed for purposes of
monitoring opacity, as required in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). These requirements may also apply to stationary
sources located in a State, District, Reservation, or Territory that has adopted these requirements into its implementation
plan. 

The PS-1, Specifications and Test Procedures for Opacity Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary
Sources, was first promulgated in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 64250) on October 6, 1975. A subsequent revision to this specification was promulgated in the 

Federal Register

 March 30, 1983 (48 FR 13322). These specification revisions for COMS's are based on information obtained by EPA from
additional experience with the procedures since that promulgated revision. Prior to today's action, the proposal
was distributed for comment to a review group of EPA Regional Offices and a State agency. In addition, EPA solicited
input from opacity monitor manufacturers and concerned industries. The EPA considered comments from these sources
and incorporated additional changes. 

The specifications, in total, shall apply to all COMS's installed or replaced after the date of promulgation. All
COMS that have been installed prior to the date of promulgation of these revisions would not be subject to these revisions
unless replaced or specifically required to comply. Following promulgation, a source owner, operator, or manufacturer
will be subject to these PS's if installing a new COMS, relocating a COMS, replacing a COMS, recertifying a COMS that
has undergone substantial refurbishing (in the opinion of the enforcing agency), or has been specifically required
to recertify the COMS with these revisions. 

The COMS, which met PS-1 prior to these revisions, may not meet today's proposed specifications. Alternative
designs or procedural modifications to PS-1, approved by the Administrator prior to the proposal of these revisions,
are not applicable to monitors subject to these revisions. However, source owners and operators, as well as manufacturers,
may apply or reapply per  60.11(i) to the Administrator for alternatives to these PS's. 



II. Summary of Proposed Revisions 



Today's action proposes to restructure and clarify PS-1. The proposal restructures organization of the specification
and delineation of responsibilities to demonstrate conformance with design, location, and performance requirements.


Opacity monitoring system technology works in the following way: light with specific spectral characteristics
is projected from a lamp through the effluent in the stack or duct, and the intensity of the projected light is then measured
by a sensor. The projected light is attenuated because of absorption and scatter by the particulate matter in the effluent;
the percentage of light attenuated is defined as the opacity of the emission. Transparent stack emissions that do
not attenuate light have a transmittance of 100 percent or an opacity of zero percent. Opaque stack emissions that
attenuate all of the light have a transmittance of zero percent or an opacity of 100 percent. The opacity measured at
the location of the COMS is corrected for differences in measurement pathlength from stack or vent exit conditions
and reported as the facility's opacity emission. 



A. Design 



The design requirements, as promulgated March 30, 1983, continue to be required. The following additional and upgraded
requirements are being proposed: 

1. The optical alignment device, used to assure that the system is optically aligned, must clearly indicate misalignment
before the 2 percent opacity shift allowed by the design performance limit occurs. Therefore, systems with subjective
observation indicators, e.g., ``top-dead-center,'' may not comply. Manufacturer evaluations, conducted in 1989
and 1990, found that several manufacturers were revising their alignment devices to clearly indicate misalignment.
However, 1992 evaluations have identified a continuing problem of clearly depicting misalignment. Specifically,
a COMS was placed in zero alignment, yet, the alignment sight directions would have indicated that it was misaligned.
Realignment in this instance could have caused a negative bias in future recordings. 

2. In addition, in 1992, EPA observed COMS responses over different distances for the COMS alignment test and concluded
that the alignment check should be done at the installation pathlength and not at 8 meters, as currently required by
PS-1. This is also a practice of the manufacturers due to specific aperture, objective lens, and installation
pathlength requirements. Because the alignment check and performance test are considered installation pathlength
specific and because of the Agency's need to assure clarity in the misalignment, the optical alignment test is now
required at the site of the installation. This will provide an opportunity for the enforcing agency and source owner
or operator to evaluate and establish clarity in the depiction of misalignment. 

3. The angle of view (AOV) and angle of projection (AOP) specifications have been revised. Defined as the angle that
contains all of the photopic radiation either detected or projected by the COMS, the calumniation of the light beam
has been reduced to a maximum total of 4 degrees. From 1989 to 1992 time period, EPA observed the AOV and AOP testing,
conducted by 10 major manufacturers of COMS sold in the United States, and concluded that the AOV and AOP should be reduced
from the current 5 degrees to 4 degrees. This change also reflects manufacturers' improvement in the instruments.

4. The COMS must provide a means to simulate a zero and 
upscale calibration value in order to check the COMS transmitter/receiver calibration. The calibration checking
system shall 
include, at the same time, all the optical and electromechanical 
equipment used in the normal measurement mode. The checking 
system will measure and provide a permanent record of the COMS 
calibration status. The COMS's, which conduct zero and upscale 
calibration drift (CD) assessments without simultaneously check
ing all the components actively used in normal day-to-day opacity 
measurement, are deemed to deviate from the proposed specifica
tions. The Agency recognizes that some existing dual-path COMS's 
do not include the reflector in the daily zero and span check. 
However, these COMS's have been, and will continue to be, an 
accepted exception to the simultaneous check requirement. 

5. The COMS shall provide operators visual or audible 
alarms for exceeding PS-1, operation specification, equipment 
failures, and effluent opacity standards. 

6. The COMS shall provide an automated means to assess and 
record accumulated automatic zero compensations on a 1-hour and 
24-hour basis. The 1-hour is specifically required only during a 
specific 24-hour period of the operational test period. The 
24-hour assessment and recording of the 24-hour accumulated CD is 
a continual requirement of the system. 

7. The automatic compensation for dirt accumulation on the 
window surfaces of the COMS requires including the compensation 
allowance in the 4 percent opacity tolerance for zero CD adjust
ment. The measurement for determining compensation shall be 
conducted on those surfaces that are directly in line with the 
light beam used to measure the effluent opacity. In addition, 
only those optical surfaces, directly in the light beam path 
under normal operation to measure opacity, may be compensated for 
dust accumulation. The EPA has determined that systems that 
attempt to measure dust accumulation in locations, other than the 
measurement path of the normally transmitted measurement light 
beam or assume equal and uniform dust accumulations on unmeasured 
surfaces (e.g., reflectors), could result in unacceptable nega
tive biases in opacity measurements. Those automatic dust 
compensation systems that meet the optical path assessment 
criteria may demonstrate and petition the Administrator for an 
increase in compensation to 20 percent opacity adjustment. 

8. Providing a means to independently audit the COMS will 
be required of all new and replacement COMS's. Manufacturers of 
COMS's, meeting the March 30, 1983 specifications, have routinely 
incorporated this performance check allowance into their designs. 
In addition, the proposed specifications recognize and allow for 
the use of a ``zero-jig.'' This apparatus, which must have a 
unique serial number specific to the installed COMS, may be used 
to conduct performance check audits as well as for zero calibra
tions of the COMS transmitter/receiver (dual-path systems) during 
installation. 

9. The COMS must automatically correct opacity emissions 
measured at the COMS installation location to the emission outlet 
pathlength. The capability to automatically display and record 
the pathlength correction factor (PLCF) changes must be 
incorporated into the COMS design. 



B. Demonstration of Design 



The proposed demonstration of design conformance 
requirements of PS-1 have evolved from historical observation of 
the current required demonstrations. Such demonstrations have 
customarily been done by COMS manufacturers due to their unique 
capabilities at the manufacturing locations. The EPA believed 
this to be appropriate in 1983 when it allowed the source owner 
or operator to obtain a Manufacturer's Certificate of Conformance 
(MCOC) rather than conducting design performance testing at the 
source. The EPA, then and now, continues to hold the source 
owner and operator responsible for the overall demonstration that 
the COMS meets all of PS-1 requirements. Today's proposed 
specification requires COMS manufacturers to conduct the design 
specification testing required in section 6.0, Design Specific
ation Verification Procedure. However, this does not relieve the 
source owners or operators from demonstrating compliance with 
applicable COMS requirements. Manufacturers of COMS's are 
encouraged, although not required, to seek an EPA evaluation of 
their design specification demonstration procedures for each 
model of COMS marketed as conforming with these specifications. 
The evaluation will provide competitive advantages to successful 
demonstrations as well as providing purchaser assurances of 
initial conformance to regulatory requirements. The activity is 
expected to reduce retrofit and corrective costs potentially 
encountered with nonconforming systems. The evaluation will also 
ensure that COMS's manufactured outside the United States (U.S.), 
for subsequent sale in the U.S., perform testing in the U.S. 
prior to sale.

The design specification testing requirements assume that 
apparatus used to conduct demonstrations is proper. Adequately 
rugged apparatus will assure the accuracy and rigor required at 
the specification frequency. The testing requirements for 
demonstrating conformance with the design specifications assume 
that the testing apparatus, used to conduct such tests, were 
properly chosen, adequately rugged, and sufficiently accurate. 
The 1989-1990 evaluation of procedures, conducted by the COMS 
manufacturers, found a broad spectrum of sophistication in 
demonstration apparatus. The detection limits of some equipment, 
used in the manufacturers' procedures, were found to be a 
limiting factor in the conduct of some tests. If manufacturers' 
operations are not sufficiently precise, accurate, or permanent, 
evaluations may indicate problems in repeatability. 

The 1983 monitor selection process for design demonstration 
testing did not clearly specify how to select a monitor if the 
manufacturing operation was not continuous or did not include 
large inventories. Most COMS manufacturing operations are likely 
to use off-the-shelf or imported components, and the COMS's are 
constructed and shipped as orders are received. Large inven
tories generally do not exist, and production is demand-based. 
Today's proposed monitor selection process revises the 1983 
process to recognize some of these typical manufacturing 
operations. The proposal requires that each COMS installed, 
pursuant to the requirements of an applicable standard, have a 
serial number assigned by the manufacturer. (Note: If a 
zero-jig is manufactured and provided for the COMS model type, a 
unique serial number for the zero-jig, corresponding to the 
installed COMS serial number, is required.) The proposed model 
selection process of section 6, Design Specification Verification 
Procedure, specifies that the COMS (per model) selection will be 
based on a randomly-selected COMS produced during the month or a 
randomly-selected COMS per 20 such monitors produced, whichever 
is more frequent. 

If 20 or more COMS's of a particular model are produced in a 
month, the manufacturer shall randomly select a COMS of that 
model from that month's production for conducting the design 
conformance tests in sections 6.2 through 6.6. Otherwise, the 
manufacturer shall select a COMS with a serial number in a 
distinct lot of 20 monitors of that model produced, or to be 
produced, and shall test that COMS for demonstrating conformance 
with the design specifications. 

The proposed specification does not require additional 
sampling and testing upon the finding of nonconformance with the 
design requirements. Upon such finding, however, the specifica
tion requires the manufacturer to notify all sources who have 
purchased that model of COMS if the COMS was manufactured since 
the model's last successful demonstration of conformance. The 
manufacturer must send a copy of all such notifications to EPA. 

The design specification demonstration incorporates other 
requirements. 

1. An outline of an example of a MCOC is provided to give 
direction on the presentation of supporting documentation for 
performance demonstration tests. 

2. The current specifications do not require verification 
of supporting COMS component conformance documentation, such as 
lamp emissivity, which is used for the construction of a spectral 
response curve. Also, the 1983 specifications did not put any 
limit on the valid time period for certain supporting demonstra
tions such as development of the spectral response curve. As a 
result, some MCOC's now reflect 5-year old data. The 1989-1990 
evaluations of the COMS manufacturers identified incorrect 
calculation procedures as well as inclusion of a component that 
caused an unacceptable COMS response. The manufacturer in the 
latter case, who calculated the response curve, was unaware that 
the component's characteristics had changed. 

The proposed PS's require the manufacturer to measure the 
spectral response curve of the COMS. The specifications will no 
longer allow the manufacturer, or source owner or operator, to 
calculate the spectral response curve from lamp emissivity, 
detector response, and filter characteristics. The EPA has 
identified two acceptable systems and procedures for measuring 
the COMS spectral response curve at 10 nm intervals from 300 to 
800 nm. Information, provided by the manufacturers, indicates 
that this requirement is not overly burdensome. This information 
is necessary because, from this information, both the peak and 
mean spectral response can be accurately determined.

3. The AOV and AOP tests have been clarified and reaffirmed 
in the specification. Note that no alternative procedures have 
been approved for the AOV and AOP, even though manufacturers may 
be using alternatives. The specification clearly states that 
alternative procedures require approval by the Administrator. 
Therefore, source owners and operators must obtain approvals of 
an alternative procedure prior to seeking a site-specific COMS 
approval. 



C. Performance Specifications 



The major change to the PS-1 demonstrations from the 1983 specification occurs in section 7, Performance Specification
Verification Procedures. The proposal requires that testing be conducted at the affected facility. Current practices
have allowed verification tests to be conducted at the COMS manufacturers' facility. However, the 1983 specifications
intended verification testing to be performed at the affected facility to ensure that the entire COMS system was evaluated
for the specific installation. The current practices have resulted in excluding the data recording portion of the
system used at the installation under normal measurement conditions and, thereby, limiting assessment of the COMS
for the specific installation. For this reason, the proposed specification clarifies where the required PS-1
testing of section 7 is to be conducted. 

The proposal also simplifies procedures for calibration 
attenuator selection. The COMS's have been typically required to 
demonstrate a certain degree of calibration error over a range of 
emissions specified as the span value. This span value may or 
may not correspond to the actual instrument range (0 to 100 
percent opacity). The primary concern of COMS data users is the 
capability of the instrument to measure accurately opacities at, 
or near the applicable standard. Once the opacity level exceeds 
the standard, the magnitude of the emissions tends to be of 
lesser concern than the duration of the operation. Therefore, 
the proposal includes selection of appropriate attenuators and 
calibration error test for the applicable opacity emission 
standard. 

The specifications recognize the need to set a surrogate emission limit for purposes of conducting the calibration
error test. This is due to the fact that some authorities set opacity limitations of zero percent, and the specification
must assess calibration accuracy and linearity around the standard. Attenuator opacity values are specified in
terms of optical density (or transmittance) which exhibits a logarithmic relationship to opacity. Because of the
nonlinear nature of this relationship, COMS calibration at high opacity values becomes more difficult. At the low
opacity emission limitations of current regulations, e.g., 20 percent, the nonlinear relationship of opacity and
optical density is not severe and is within the error specification in this proposal. Therefore, a surrogate limit
for purposes of the calibration error test would continue to assure acceptable COMS accuracy, even though the actual
emission limitation was below the surrogate value. Consequently, where emission standards have been set at 10 percent
opacity or less, the proposal specifies a surrogate 10 percent opacity limit for purposes of conducting the calibration
error test. The EPA contacted attenuator manufacturers who indicated that certifiable low opacity, i.e., 2 percent
opacity (98 percent transmittance) attenuators, necessary to comply with the required testing, are available.


Where dual standards are specified, e.g., a 10-percent 
opacity limitation with an allowance for one 6-minute period in 
an hour not to exceed 40 percent opacity, the calibration error 
test must be conducted over the full range of standards. The 
test may be conducted as a three-point calibration error test 
over the range, i.e., 10 to 40 percent opacity, or separate 
three-point calibration error tests around each requirement. 

The proposal describes procedures for setting the instrument 
zero and upscale calibration values and zero alignment. The 
proposal specifies that a check of the adequacy of the zero 
setting with the alignment must be made. If discrepancies 
between measured values exist, they should be resolved prior to 
stack installation. At this time (if part of the system), the 
zero-jig zero setting also should be adjusted to coincide with 
the instrument zero for the monitor pathlength, recorded and 
permanently set. 

The 1983 specifications did not specify the use of secondary 
instruments to establish secondary attenuators for calibration 
error tests. Today's specification provides a procedure for 
qualifying a secondary instrument. The conditioning period has 
been incorporated into the operational test period. The 
operational test period is now a 336-hour test period during 
which the maintenance and operational restrictions, that were 
required of both conditioning and operational periods in the 1983 
specifications, still apply. An additional test has been 
included to address short-term diurnal fluctuations in COMS's 
opacity output readings. This 1-hour drift test and 
specification are designed to assess and limit the amount of zero 
and upscale calibration value drifts due to operational 
conditions occurring during a 24-hour period.

A. Public Hearing 



In accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act as 
amended by Public Law 101-549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 
1990, a public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the 
proposed revisions to subpart A and appendix B. Persons wishing 
to make oral presentations should contact EPA at the address 
given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the 
public may file a written statement with the EPA before, during, 
or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should 
be addressed to the Air Docket Section address given in the 


ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. 

A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements 
will be available for public inspection and copying during normal 
working hours at EPA's Air Docket Section in Washington, D.C. 
(see 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble). 


B. Docket 



The docket is an organized and complete file for all 
information submitted or otherwise considered by EPA in the 
development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes 
of the docket are: (1) to allow interested parties to identify 
and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in 
the rulemaking process, and (2) to serve as the record in case of 
judicial review (except for interagency review materials) [Clean 
Air Act Section 307(d)(7)(A)]. 



C. Office of Management and Budget Review 



Due to the timing of review which was pre-Executive Order 
12866 (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993), this NPRM underwent 
Executive Order 12291 Review. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA 
must judge whether a regulation is ``major'' and, therefore, 
subject to the requirement of a regulatory impact analysis. This 
rulemaking is not major because it will not have an annual effect 
on the economy of $100 million or more; it will not result in a 
major increase in costs or prices; and there will be no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,

productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based 
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic 
or export markets. 



D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule 
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of 
small entities because no additional cost will be incurred by 
such entities. The requirements of the proposal reaffirm the 
existing requirements for demonstrating conformance with the COMS 
PS's. Small entities will be affected to the same degree that 
they are affected under existing requirements. 

This rule does not contain any information collection 
requirements subject to the Office of Management and Budget 
review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501

Monitoring requirements. 


* * * * * 


(d)(1) Owners and operators of continuous emission monitoring 
systems (CEMS's) installed in accordance with the provisions of 
this part, shall automatically check the zero (or low level value 
between 0 and 20 percent of span value) and span (50 to 100 
percent of span value) calibration drifts (CD's) at least once 
daily. For CEMS's used to measure opacity in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, owners and operators shall automatically, intrinsic to the continuous opacity monitoring
system 
(COMS), check the zero and upscale calibration drifts at least 
once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero 
and upscale calibration materials shall be as defined in the 
applicable version of PS-1 in appendix B of this part. Where an 
opacity standard of 10 percent or less, corrected to stack exit 
conditions, has been specified, a surrogate 10 percent opacity 
standard shall be used for determining the daily calibration 
values for the drift assessments required above. The zero and 
upscale value shall, as a minimum, be adjusted whenever either 
the 24-hour zero drift or the 24-hour span drift exceeds two 
times the limit of the applicable PS in appendix B. The system 
must allow the amount of the excess zero and span drift to be 
recorded and quantified whenever specified. For COMS's, the 
optical surfaces, exposed to the effluent gases, shall be cleaned 
prior to performing the zero and span drift adjustments, except 
for systems using automatic zero adjustments. The optical 
surfaces shall be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero 
compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity.

Appendix B to Part 60_Performance Specifications 



* * * * * 



Performance Specification 1_Specifications and Test Procedures 
for Continuous Opacity Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources 



1. Applicability and Principle 



1.1 Applicability. 

1.1.1 This specification contains requirements for the design, performance, and installation of instruments
for continuous opacity monitoring systems (COMS's) and data computation procedures for evaluating the acceptability
of a COMS. Certain design requirements and test procedures, established in this specification, may not apply to all
instrument designs proposed for installation after the effective date of these specifications. In such instances,
approval for the use of alternative design requirements and test procedures shall be obtained from the Administrator
prior to a demonstration of conformance with these specifications. 

1.1.2 Performance Specification 1 (PS-1) applies to COMS's 
installed on or after the effective date which is the date of 
promulgation of these specifications. The COMS's installed prior 
to the effective date are required to comply with the provisions 
and requirements of PS-1 as promulgated on March 30, 1983 
(48 FR 13322). 

1.1.3 A COMS installed before the effective date of these 
specifications need not be re-tested to demonstrate compliance 
with these PS's unless specifically required by regulatory action 
other than the promulgation of PS-1. If a COMS installed prior 
to the effective date is replaced or relocated, this PS-1 shall 
apply to the COMS replacement or as relocated. 

1.2 Principle. 

1.2.1 The opacity of particulate matter in stack emissions is continuously monitored and corrected to a stack
exit pathlength by a measurement system, based upon the principle of transmissometry. Light, having specific spectral
characteristics, is projected from a lamp through the effluent in the stack or duct, and the intensity of the projected
light is measured by a sensor. The projected light is attenuated because of absorption and scatter by the particulate
matter in the effluent; the percentage of visible light energy attenuated is defined as the opacity of the emission.


1.2.2 This specification establishes specific design, performance, and installation criteria for the
COMS. Prior to installation, source owners and operators must provide verification that the COMS has met the design
specifications. Prior to installation, it is recommended that the COMS installation location be reviewed and approved
by the appropriate regulatory authority. Then, the owner and operator calibrates, installs, and operates the COMS
for a specified test period. During this specified test period, the COMS is further evaluated to determine conformance
with PS-1. 



2. Definitions 



2.1 Angle of Projection (AOP). The angle that contains all 
of the radiation projected from the lamp assembly of the analyzer 
at a level of greater than 2.5 percent of the peak illuminance. 

2.2 Angle of View (AOV). The angle that contains all of 
the radiation detected by the photodetector assembly of the 
analyzer at a level greater than 2.5 percent of the peak detector 
response. 

2.3 Calibration Drift (CD). The difference in the COMS 
output readings from the upscale calibration value after a stated 
period of normal continuous operation during which no unscheduled 
maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place. 

2.4 Calibration Error. The difference between the opacity 
values indicated by the COMS and the known values of a series of 
calibration attenuators (filters or screens). 

2.5 Centroid Area. A concentric area that is geometrically 
similar to the stack or duct cross-section and is no greater than 
1 percent of the stack or duct cross-sectional area. 

2.6 Continuous Opacity Monitoring System. The total 
equipment required for the determination of opacity. The system 
consists of the following major subsystems: 

2.6.1 Analyzer. That portion of the installed COMS that 
senses the pollutant and generates an output that is a function 
of the opacity. 

2.6.2 Data Recorder. That portion of the installed COMS 
that provides a permanent record of the analyzer output in terms 
of opacity. The data recorder may include automatic data 
reduction capabilities. 

2.6.3 Sample Interface. That portion of the installed COMS 
that protects the analyzer from the effects of the stack effluent 
and aids in keeping the optical surfaces clean. 

2.7 External Audit Device. The inherent design, equipment, 
or accommodation of the COMS allowing the independent assessment 
of system calibration and operation. An adequate design shall 
permit the use of external (i.e., not intrinsic to the 
instrument) neutral density filters to assess monitor operation. 

2.8 External Zeroing Device (Zero-Jig). An external, 
removable device for simulating or checking the cross-stack zero 
alignment of the COMS.

COMS. For purposes of recordkeeping and reporting, full scale 
shall be greater than 80 percent opacity. 

2.10 Mean Spectral Response. The mean response wavelength 
of the wavelength distribution for the effective spectral 
response curve of the transmissometer. 

2.11 Opacity. The fraction of incident light that is 
attenuated by an optical medium. Opacity (Op) and transmittance 
(Tr) are related by: Op=1-Tr.

2.13 Optical Density. A logarithmic measure of the amount 
of incident light attenuated. Optical Density (OD) is related to 
the transmittance and opacity as follows: 
OD = -log

10

 (1-Op). 

2.14 Pathlength. The depth of effluent in the light beam 
between the receiver and the transmitter of a single-pass trans- 
missometer, or the depth of effluent between the transceiver and 
reflector of a double-pass transmissometer. Three pathlengths 
are referenced by this specification as follows: 

2.14.1 Emission Outlet Pathlength. The pathlength (depth 
of effluent) at the location where emissions are released to the 
atmosphere. For noncircular outlets, D = (2LW)/(L + W), where L 
is the length of the outlet and W is the width of the outlet. 
Note that this definition does not apply to positive pressure 
baghouse outlets with multiple stacks, side discharge vents, 
ridge roof monitors, etc. 

2.14.2 Installation Pathlength. The installation 
flange-to-flange distance. 

2.14.3 Monitoring Pathlength. The effective depth of 
effluent (the distance over which the light beam is actually 
evaluating the stack effluent) measured by the COMS at the 
installation location. Monitoring pathlength is to be used for 
the optical alignment, response, and calibration error tests of 
section 7 and calculation of the pathlength correction factor 
(PLCF). The effective depth of effluent measured by the COMS 
must be equal to or greater than 90 percent of the distance 
between duct or stack walls. 

2.15 Peak Spectral Response. The wavelength of maximum 
sensitivity of the transmissometer.

calibrated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST). 

2.17 Response Time. The amount of time it takes the COMS 
to display on the data recorder 95 percent of a step change in 
opacity. 

2.18 Secondary Attenuators. Secondary attenuators are 
those calibrated against primary attenuators according to 
procedures in section 7.1.3. 

2.19 Transmissometer. That portion of the installed COMS 
that includes the sample interface and the analyzer. 

2.20 Transmittance. The fraction of incident light that is 
transmitted through an optical medium. 

2.21 Upscale Calibration Value. The opacity value at which 
a calibration check of the COMS is performed by simulating an 
upscale opacity condition as viewed by the receiver. An opacity 
value (corrected for pathlength) that is 150 to 190 percent of 
the applicable opacity standard. 

2.22 Zero Calibration Value. A value at which a 
calibration check of the COMS is performed by simulating a zero 
opacity condition as viewed by the receiver. An opacity value 
(corrected for pathlength) that is 0 to 10 percent of the 
applicable opacity standard. 

2.23 Zero Drift. The difference in the COMS output 
readings from the zero calibration value after a stated period of 
normal continuous operation during which no unscheduled 
maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place. 

2.24 Zero and Upscale Calibration Value Attenuator System. 
An inherent system of the COMS which can be an automatic 
electro-mechanical and filter system for simulating both a zero 
and upscale calibration value, providing an assessment and record 
on the calibration of the instrument. Optical filters or screens 
with neutral spectral characteristics, or other device that 
produces a zero or an upscale calibration value shall be used. 



3. Apparatus 



3.1 Continuous Opacity Monitoring System. A COMS that 
meets the design and PS's of PS-1, including a suitable data 
recorder, such as an analog strip chart recorder or other 
suitable device (e.g., digital computer) with an input signal 
range compatible with the analyzer output. 

3.2 Calibration Attenuators. Minimum of three. These 
attenuators must be optical filters with neutral spectral 
characteristics selected and calibrated according to the 
procedures in sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 and of sufficient size to 
attenuate the entire light beam received by the detector of the 
COMS. 

3.3 Calibration Spectrophotometer. A laboratory 
spectrophotometer meeting the following minimum design 
specifications: 



 


3.4 Spectral Response Measurement System. Equipment and procedures capable of providing an accurate evaluation
and recording of the spectral response curve of the COMS. The equipment will include, but is not limited to, a Helium-Neon
laser for calibration, a monochrometer capable of 10 nm incremental changes over a range of 300 to 800 nm, and other
appropriate optical bench requirements. 

3.5 COMS Test Stands and Related Equipment. Equipment 
capable of allowing the accurate conduct of the performance tests 
to the necessary tolerances called for by these specifications. 



4. Installation Specifications 



Install the COMS at a location where the opacity 
measurements are representative of the total emissions from the 
affected facility. This requirement can be met as follows: 

4.1 Measurement Location. Select a measurement location 
that is (a) at least 4 duct diameters downstream from all partic- 
ulate control equipment or flow disturbance, (b) at least 2 duct 
diameters upstream of a flow disturbance, (c) where condensed 
water vapor is not present, (d) free of interference from ambient 
light, and (e) accessible in order to permit maintenance.

4.2 Measurement Location. The primary concern in locating 
a COMS is determining a location of well-mixed stack gas. Two 
factors contribute to complete mixing of emission gases: 
turbulence and sufficient mixing time. The criteria listed below 
define conditions under which well-mixed emissions can be 
expected. Select a light beam path that passes through the 
centroidal area of the stack or duct. Additional requirements or 
modifications must be met for the following locations: 


4.2.1 If the location is in a straight vertical section of 
stack or duct and is less than 4 equivalent diameters downstream 
from a bend, use a light beam path that is in the plane defined 
by the upstream bend (see figure 1-1). 


4.2.2 If the location is in a straight vertical section of 
stack or duct and is less than 4 equivalent stack or duct diameters upstream from a bend, use a light beam path that is
in the 
plane defined by the bend (see figure 1-2). 


4.2.3 If the location is in a straight vertical section of 
stack or duct and is less than 4 equivalent stack or duct diameters downstream and is also less than 1 diameter upstream

from a bend, use a light beam path in the plane defined by the 
upstream bend (see figure 1-3). 


4.2.4 If the location is in a horizontal section of stack 
or duct and is at least 4 equivalent stack or duct diameters 
downstream from a vertical bend, use a light beam path in the 
horizontal plane that is between 1/3 and 1/2 the distance up the 
vertical axis from the bottom of the duct (see figure 1-4). 


4.2.5 If the location is in a horizontal section of duct 
and is less than 4 diameters downstream from a vertical bend, use 
a light beam path in the horizontal plane that is between 1/2 and 
2/3 the distance up the vertical axis from the bottom of the duct 
for upward flow in the vertical section, and is between 1/3 and 1/2 the distance up the vertical axis from the bottom
of the duct for 
downward flow (figure 1-5). 


4.3 Alternative Locations and Light Beam Paths. Locations 
and light beam paths, other than those cited above, may be 
selected by demonstrating, to the Administrator or delegated 
agent, that the average opacity measured at the alternative 
location or path is equivalent to the opacity as measured at a 
location meeting the criteria of section 4.1 or 4.2. The opacity 
at the alternative location is considered equivalent if the 
average opacity value measured at the alternative location is 
within 

#

10 percent of the average opacity value measured at the 
location meeting the installation criteria in section 4.2, and 
the difference between any two average opacity values is less 
than 2 percent opacity (absolute). To conduct this demonstration, simultaneously measure the opacities at the two
locations 
or paths for a minimum period of time (e.g., 180-minutes) 
covering the range of normal operating conditions and compare the 
results. The opacities of the two locations or paths may be 
measured at different times, but must represent the same process operating conditions. Alternative procedures
for determining 
acceptable locations may be used if approved by the 
Administrator. 
4.4 Slotted Tube. For COMS that uses a slotted tube, the 
slotted tube must be of sufficient size and orientation so as not 
to interfere with the free flow of effluent through the entire 
optical volume of the COMS photodetector. The manufacturer must 
also present information in the certificate of conformance that 
the slotted tube minimizes light reflections. As a minimum, this 
demonstration shall consist of laboratory operation of the COMS 
both with, and without the slotted tube in position. The slotted 
portion must meet the monitoring pathlength requirements of 
2.14.3. 




5. Design Specifications 




5.1 Design Specifications. The COMS shall comply with the 
following design specifications: 


5.1.1 Peak and Mean Spectral Responses. The peak and mean 
spectral responses must occur between 500 nm and 600 nm. The 
response at any wavelength below 400 nm or above 700 nm shall be 
less than 10 percent of the peak spectral response. 


5.1.2 Angle of View. The total AOV shall be no greater 
than 4 degrees. 


5.1.3 Angle of Projection. The total AOP shall be no 
greater than 4 degrees.

5.1.4 Optical Alignment Sight. Each analyzer must provide 
some method for visually determining that the instrument is 
optically aligned. The method provided must be capable of 
clearly indicating that the unit is misaligned when an error of 
no greater than 

#

2 percent opacity occurs due to misalignment at 
the installation monitoring pathlength. Instruments that are 
capable of providing a clear path zero check while in operation 
on a stack or duct with effluent present, and while maintaining 
the same optical alignment during measurement and calibration, 
need not meet this requirement (e.g., some ``zero pipe'' units). 
The owner and operator shall insure that the COMS manufacturer's 
written procedures and the certificate of conformance depict the 
correct alignment and the misalignment corresponding to a 


#

2 percent opacity shift as viewed using the alignment sight. 


5.1.5 Simulated Zero and Upscale Calibration System. Each 
analyzer must include a calibration system for simulating a zero 
and upscale calibration value. This calibration system must 
provide, as a minimum, a simultaneous system check of all of the 
active analyzer internal optics, all active electronic circuitry 
including the primary light source (lamp) and photodetector 
assembly, and electro-mechanical systems used during normal 
measurement operation. 


5.1.6 Automatic Zero and Upscale Value Compensation 
Indicator and Alarm. The COMS shall provide an automated means 
for determining and recording the actual amount of 24-hour zero 
compensation on a daily basis. The COMS also shall provide an 
alarm (visual or audible) when a 

#

4 percent opacity zero 
compensation has been exceeded. This indicator shall be at a 
location which can be seen or heard by the operator (e.g., 
process control room) and accessible to the operator (e.g., the 
data output terminal). 


5.1.6.1 During the operational test period, the COMS also 
must provide a means for determining and automatically recording 
the actual amount of upscale calibration value compensation at 
specified 1-hour intervals so that the actual 1-hour upscale 
calibration value shift can be determined (see section 7.2.3). 


5.1.6.2 If the COMS has a feature that provides automatic 
zero compensation for dirt accumulation on exposed optical and 
mechanical surfaces, the compensation allowance for dust may be 
included up to 20 percent opacity. For all other systems, the 
dirt accumulation on exposed optical and mechanical surfaces are 
limited to 4 percent opacity zero compensation allowance of 
section 5.1.6. The determination of dirt accumulation on all 
surfaces exposed to the effluent being measured shall include 
only those surfaces in the direct path of the measuring light 
beam under normal opacity measurement. The dust accumulation 
must actually be measured. 


5.1.7 External Calibration Filter Access. The COMS must be 
designed to accommodate an independent assessment of the total 
systems response to audit filters. An adequate design shall 
permit the use of external (i.e., not intrinsic to the 
instrument) neutral density filters to assess monitor operation. 
This system may include an external audit zero-jig as identified 
in section 3.0. 


5.1.8 Pathlength Correction Factor. The COMS shall display 
and record all opacity values corrected to the emission outlet 
pathlength. Equations 1-7 or 1-8 may be used. The system must 
be capable of independent display of the PLCF and automatically 
record any changes made to the PLCF. 


5.1.9 External Fault Indicator. The installed COMS must 
provide a means to automatically alert the owner or operator when 
a component or performance parameter has failed or been exceeded 
(e.g., projector lamp failure, zero or CD operation, purge air 
blower failure, data recorder failure). Indicator lights or 
alarms must be visible or audible to the operator(s). 


5.1.10 Data recorder resolution. The data recorder and 
data acquisition system shall record and display opacity values 
to 0.5 percent opacity.

6. Design Specifications Verification Procedures 


These procedures apply to all instruments installed for 
purposes of complying with opacity monitoring requirements (see 
section 1.1, Applicability). The source owner or operator is 
responsible for the overall COMS performance demonstration 
required by the applicable standards. As an alternative, the 
COMS manufacturer may conduct the COMS design verification 
procedures called for in this section and provide to the source 
owner or operator a Manufacturer's Certificate of Conformance 
(MCOC). These procedures shall be conducted, detailed, and the 
results submitted in the MCOC (section 9.5) as an integral part 
of each COMS demonstration required by the applicable standards. 
In order to assure that the design and procedures to demonstrate 
conformance with this section coincide with the design procedures 
as stated in the MCOC, the manufacturer is encouraged to seek an 
evaluation by the Administrator of the manufacturer's conformance 
demonstration practices. The procedures to demonstrate 
conformance with this section may require modification to 
accommodate instrument designs. All procedural modifications 
required to demonstrate conformance with the specifications of 
this section must be approved, in writing, by the Administrator. 
The owner and operator or the manufacturer, as appropriate, shall 
obtain any approvals of modifications to the specifications of 
this section before regulatory agency review and acceptance of 
the overall COMS performance evaluations. 
Each analyzer design shall be selected as follows, in order 
to demonstrate conformance with the design specifications of 
sections 5.1.1 to 5.1.10. The MCOC, section 9.5, for all 
instruments subject to this specification shall detail the 
demonstration procedures as follows: 
6.1 Selection of Analyzer. For conducting the performance 
test in sections 6.2 through 6.6, the manufacturer shall randomly 
select (1) a COMS model from each month's production, or (2) a 
COMS model with a serial number in a distinct lot of 20 such 
monitors produced, whichever is more frequent. 
6.2 Spectral Response. The owner and operator, or 
manufacturer, shall conduct a laboratory measurement of the 
instrument's spectral response curve. The procedures of this 
laboratory evaluation are subject to approval of the 
Administrator and shall be provided to the Administrator upon 
request. The owner and operator or manufacturer, shall measure, 
develop, and report the effective spectral response curve of the 
COMS at 10 nm intervals. Determine and report in the MCOC the 
peak spectral response wavelength, the mean spectral response 
wavelength using equation 1-9, and the maximum response at any 
wavelength below 400 nm and above 700 nm expressed as a 
percentage of the peak response. 
6.3 Angle of View. In the laboratory, set up the COMS 
detector as specified by the manufacturer's written instructions. 
Draw a circular arc with the center of the circle located at the 
centroid of a plane described by the COMS photodetector housing 
which the radiation from the nondirectional light source first 
encounters. The arc shall have a radius of 3 meters in the 
horizontal plane of the COMS photodetector housing. Using a 
small (less than 3 cm) nondirectional light source, measure and 
record the COMS receiver response as the light is moved at each 
5-cm interval on the arc for 30 cm on either side of the COMS 
detector centerline. Identify the point on the arc furthest from 
the centerline which corresponds to the point where 2.5 percent 
of the peak COMS detector response is recorded. Repeat the test 
in the vertical direction. Then, for both the horizontal and 
vertical directions, calculate the response of the COMS detector 
as a function of viewing angle (26 cm of arc with a radius of 
3 cm equals 5 degrees), report relative angle of view curves, and 
determine and report the angle of view. 
6.4 Angle of Projection. In the laboratory, set up the 
COMS light source as specified by the manufacturer's written 
instructions. Draw a circular arc with the center of the circle 
located at the centroid of a plane described by the last part of 
the COMS lamp assembly housing encountered by the light radiation 
projected from the light assembly. The arc shall have a radius 
of 3 meters in the horizontal plane of the COMS lamp assembly 
housing. Using a small (less than 3 cm) photoelectric light 
detector, measure and record the COMS light intensity as the 
photoelectric light detector is moved at each 5-cm interval on 
the arc for 30 cm on either side of the centerline of the light 
source projection. Repeat the test in the vertical direction.

Then, for both the horizontal and vertical directions, calculate 
the response of the photoelectric detector as a function of the 
projection angle (26 cm of arc with a radius of 3 m equals 
5 degrees). Identify the point on the arc furthest from the 
centerline at which a light intensity of 2.5 percent of the peak 
light intensity of the COMS light source is recorded, report the 
relative angle of projection curves, and determine and report the 
angle of projection. 
6.5 Unacceptable Findings. Whenever a manufacturer finds 
that a COMS model does not conform to any of the requirements of 
this section, the manufacturer shall notify and provide the 
findings to all source owners or operators that have received or 
installed such nonconforming COMS models manufactured after the 
date of the previous successful conformance demonstration. The 
manufacturer shall also submit copies of such notifications to 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Director, Stationary 
Source Compliance Division (EN-341W), 401 M Street, S.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20460. 


7. Performance Specifications Verification Procedure 


The owner and operator shall perform following procedures 
and tests on each COMS that conforms to the design specifications 
(Table 1-1) to determine conformance with the specifications of 
Table 1-2. The tests described in sections 7.1.1, 7.1.4, and 
7.1.5, shall be conducted at the affected facility, in a dust-free environment, before installing the measurement
portion of 
the COMS system on the stack or duct. These tests are to be 
performed using the entire COMS system, including the data 
recording component normally used during monitoring. 


 

7.1 Preliminary Adjustments and Tests. 
7.1.1 Equipment Preparation. 
7.1.1.1 Set up and calibrate the COMS for the monitoring 
pathlength to be used in the installation as specified by the 
manufacturer's written instructions. For this specification, the 
monitoring pathlength distance (depth of effluent at the 
installation location) specified in engineering drawings must be 
verified. The owner and operator shall, following the manufacturer's instructions, adjust the PLCF signal to yield
opacity 
results based on the emission outlet pathlength. 
7.1.1.2 Under a clear path condition and at the required 
monitoring pathlength, align the instrument using the optical 
sight and set the instrument actual zero response. As part of 
this alignment, include tilting the reflector unit (detector unit 
for single pass instruments) on its axis until the point of 
maximum instrument response is obtained. Check and record the 
instrument alignment with the alignment sight. Deviations in 
alignment must be rectified prior to proceeding with the 
following performance tests. 
7.1.1.3 Optical Alignment Sight. At the monitoring 
pathlength, align, zero, and span the instrument. Insert an 
attenuator of 8 to 15 percent actual opacity into the monitoring 
pathlength. 
7.1.1.3.1 Single Path Monitors. Using the optical 
alignment site, record and report the visual depiction of alignment prior to misalignment. Slowly misalign the COMS
light 
assembly unit by tilting it in the vertical plane until a 

#

2 percent opacity shift is obtained by the data recorder. Then, 
following the manufacturer's written instructions, check the 
alignment. Misalignment should be clearly discernable. Record 
and report the visual depiction of misalignment as viewed using 
the optical alignment sight. Realign the instrument and record 
the visual depiction of alignment. Repeat this test for lateral 
misalignment of the light source unit. Realign the instrument 
and follow the same procedure for checking misalignment of the 
COMS detector unit.

7.1.1.3.2 Dual Path Monitors. Using the optical alignment 
site, record and report the visual depiction of alignment prior 
to misalignment. Slowly misalign the COMS transceiver unit 
(combined light source and detector unit) by tilting it in the 
vertical plane until a 

#

2 percent opacity shift is obtained by 
the data recorder. Then, following the manufacturer's written 
instructions, check the alignment. Misalignment should be 
clearly discernable. Record and report the visual depiction of 
misalignment as viewed using the optical alignment sight. 
Realign the COMS and record and report the visual depiction of 
alignment. Repeat this test for lateral misalignment of the 
transceiver unit. As an alternative to the lateral misalignment 
of the transceiver unit, a lateral misalignment of the reflector 
unit may be performed. 


7.1.1.4 Simulated Zero and Calibration Value Check. 
Adjust, record, and report the COMS zero alignment response so 
that the simulated zero output equals the COMS actual clear path 
zero output established for the monitoring pathlength. Measure 
and record the indicated upscale calibration value. The upscale 
calibration value reading must be within the required opacity 
range (see Definition 2.21). 


7.1.2 Calibration Attenuator Selection. 


7.1.2.1 Based on the required opacity standard, select a 
minimum of three calibration attenuators (low-, mid-, and 
high-level) based on the following formulas in Table 1-3: 









7.1.2.2 Calculate the attenuator values required to obtain 
a system response equivalent to the applicable values in the 
ranges specified in table 1-2 using equation 1-1. Select 
attenuators having the values closest to those calculated by 
equation 1-1. A series of filters with actual opacity values 
relative to the values calculated are commercially available.

  low-, mid-, or high-range calibration 
 attenuators.

7.1.3 Attenuator Calibration. 


7.1.3.1 Primary Attenuators. Attenuators are designated as 
primary in one of two ways:

7.1.3.1.1 They are calibrated by NIST; or 


7.1.3.1.2 They are calibrated on a 6-month frequency 
through the assignment of a luminous transmittance value in the 
following manner: 


7.1.3.1.2.1 Use a spectrophotometer meeting the 
specifications of section 3.6 to calibrate the required filters. 
The spectrophotometer calibration must be verified through use of 
a NIST 930D Standard Reference Material (SRM). The SRM 930D 
consists of three (3) neutral density glass filters and a blank, 
each mounted in a cuvette. The wavelengths and temperature to be 
used in the calibration are listed on the NIST certificate that 
accompanies the reported values. Determine and record a transmittance of the SRM values at the NIST wavelengths (three
filters 
at five wavelengths each for a total of 15 determinations). A 
percent difference shall be calculated between the NIST certified 
values and the spectrophotometer response. At least 12 of the 15 
differences (in percent) shall be within 

#

0.5 percent of the NIST 
SRM values. No one value shall have a difference of 

#

1.0 percent. Failure to achieve these criteria identifies a need to 
recalibrate the SRM or service the spectrophotometer. 


7.1.3.1.2.2 Scan the filter to be tested and the NIST 
blank from wavelength 380 to 780 nm, and record the spectrophotometer percent transmittance responses at 10 nm intervals.
The 
sequence of testing is: blank filter, tested filter, tested 
filter rotated 90 degrees in the plane of the filter, blank 
filter. Calculate the average transmittance at each 10 nm 
interval. If any pair of the tested filter transmittance values 
(for the same filter and wavelength) differ by more than 


#

0.25 percent, rescan the tested filter. Failure to achieve this 
tolerance shall prevent the use of the filter in the calibration 
tests of the COMS. 


7.1.3.1.2.3 Correct the tested filter transmittance values 
by dividing the average tested filter transmittance by the 
average blank filter transmittance at each 10 nm interval. 


7.1.3.1.2.4 Calculate the weighted tested filter 
transmittance by multiplying the transmittance value by the 
corresponding response factor shown in table 1-4, to obtain the 
Source C Human Eye Response.

transmittance value of the filter as follows:

7.1.3.1.3 Recalibrate the Primary Attenuators Used for the 
Required Calibration Error Test Quarterly. Recalibrates semi-annually if the primary attenuators are used only
for quarterly 
calibration of secondary attenuators. 

7.1.3.2 Secondary Attenuators. Calibrate the secondary 
attenuators, if used to conduct COMS calibration error tests, 
monthly. The filter calibration may be conducted using a 
laboratory-based transmissometer calibrated as follows: 

7.1.3.2.1 Use at least three primary filters of nominal 
luminous transmittance 50, 70 and 90 percent, calibrated as 
specified in section 7.1.3.1, to calibrate the laboratory-based 
transmissometer. Using linear regression through zero opacity, 
determine and record the slope of the calibration line. The 
slope of the calibration line shall be between 0.99 and 1.01, and 
the laboratory-based transmissometer reading for each primary 
filter shall not deviate by more than 

#

2 percent from the exact 
linear regression line. If the calibration of the laboratory-based transmissometer yields a slope or individual
readings 
outside the specified ranges, secondary filter calibrations shall 
not be performed. Determine the source of the variations (either 
transmissometer performance or changes in the primary filters) 
and repeat the transmissometer calibration before proceeding with 
the attenuator calibration. 

7.1.3.2.2 Immediately following the laboratory-based 
transmissometer calibration, insert the secondary attenuators and 
determine and record the percent effective opacity value per 
secondary attenuator from the calibration curve (linear 
regression line). 

7.1.4 Calibration Error Test. Insert the calibration 
attenuators (low-, mid-, and high-level) into the light path 
between the transceiver and reflector (or transmitter and 
receiver) at a point where the effluent will be measured; i.e., 
do not place the calibration attenuator in the instrument 
housing. While inserting the attenuator, assure that the entire 
beam received by the detector will pass through the attenuator 
and that the attenuator is inserted in a manner which minimizes 
interference from the reflected light. The placement and removal 
of the attenuator shall be such that an integrated measurement of 
opacity is conducted over the averaging time of the standard 
found in the applicable subpart. Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each filter using the data recording
system 
to be used at the installation. Record the monitoring system 
output readings in percent opacity on the data sheet (see example 
figure 1-6). Subtract the ``path adjusted'' calibration attenuator 
values from the measurement system recorder responses (the ``path 
adjusted'' calibration attenuator values are calculated using 
equation 1-7 or 1-8). Calculate the arithmetic mean difference, 
standard deviation, and confidence coefficient of the five tests 
at each attenuator value using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5 
(sections 8.1 to 8.3). Calculate the sum of the absolute value 
of the mean difference and the absolute value of the confidence 
coefficient for each of the three test attenuators. Report these 
three values as the calibration error. 

7.1.5 System Response Test. Using the high-range 
calibration attenuator, alternately insert the filter five times 
and remove it from the transmissometer light path. For each 
filter insertion and removal, record the amount of time required 
for the COMS to display on the primary data recorder 95 percent 
of the final step change in opacity. Specifically, for a filter 
insertion, the owner or operator shall record the time it takes 
to reach 95 percent of the final, steady upscale reading; for 
filter removal, the time it takes for the display reading to fall 
to 5 percent of the initial upscale opacity reading (see example 
figure 1-7). Calculate the mean time of the five upscale and 
five downscale tests. Report the greater value as the COMS 
response time.

7.1.6 Data Recorder Resolution. Review the output from the 
calibration error test; the COMS data recorder shall provide output 
capable of being resolved into 0.5 percent opacity increments. 

7.2 Preliminary Field Adjustments. Install the COMS on the 
affected facility according to the manufacturer's written 
instructions and the specifications in section 4, and perform the 
following preliminary adjustments: 

7.2.1 Optical and Zero Alignment. When the facility is not 
in operation, optically align the light beam of the transmissometer 
upon the optical surface located across the duct or stack 
(i.e., the reflector or photodetector, as applicable) in 
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; verify the 
alignment with the optical alignment sight. Under clear stack 
conditions, verify the zero alignment (performed in section 
7.1.1) by assuring that the monitoring system zero response for 
the installation zero check coincides with the instrument actual 
zero measured by the COMS as set for the monitor pathlength prior 
to installation. Record these values. Adjust the instrument 
actual zero response, if necessary, and only if a clear stack 
condition exists. Then, after the affected facility has been 
started up and the effluent stream reaches normal operating 
temperature, recheck the optical alignment. If the optical 
alignment has shifted, realign the optics. 

Note:

 Careful 
consideration should be given to whether a ``clear stack'' 
condition exists. The stack shall be monitored and the data 
output (instantaneous real-time basis) examined to determine 
whether fluctuations from zero opacity are occurring before a 
clear stack condition is assumed to exist. Check and record the 
upscale calibration value. 

7.2.2 Optical and Zero Alignment (Alternative Procedure). 
The procedure given in section 7.2.1 is the preferred procedure 
and should be used whenever possible. However, if the facility 
is operating and a zero stack condition cannot practicably be 
obtained, use the zero alignment obtained during the preliminary 
adjustments (section 7.1.1.2) before installing the COMS on the 
stack. After completing all the preliminary adjustments and 
tests required in section 7.1, install the system at the source 
and align the optics, i.e., align the light beam from the transmissometer 
upon the optical surface located across the duct or 
stack in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction. Verify 
the alignment with the optical alignment sight. The zero alignment 
conducted in this manner must be verified and adjusted, if 
necessary, the first time a clear stack condition is obtained 
after the operation test period has been completed. 

7.3 Operational Test Period. Prior to conducting the 
operational testing, the owner and operator, or the manufacturer 
as appropriate, should have successfully completed all prior 
testing of the COMS. After completing all preliminary field 
adjustments (section 7.2), operate the COMS for an initial 
336-hour test period while the source is operating. Except 
during times of instrument zero and upscale calibration checks, 
the owner and operator must ensure that they analyze the effluent 
gas for opacity and produce a permanent record of the COMS 
output. During this period, the owner and operator may not 
perform unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment. The 
owner or operator may perform zero and calibration adjustments, 
exposed optical and other CEMS surface cleaning, and optical 
realignment only at 24-hour intervals. Automatic zero and 
calibration adjustments, made by the COMS without operator 
intervention or initiation, are allowable at any time. During 
the operational test period, record all adjustments, 
realignments, and exposed surface cleaning. At the end of the 
operational test period, verify and record that the COMS optical 
alignment is correct. If the operational test period is 
interrupted because of source breakdown, continue the 336-hour 
period following resumption of source operation. If the test 
period is interrupted because of COMS failure, record the time 
when the failure occurred, after the failure is corrected, the 
336-hour period and tests are restarted. During the operational 
test period, perform the following test procedures: 

7.3.1 Zero Calibration Drift Test. At the outset of the 
336-hour operational test period and at each 24-hour period, 
record the initial (Reference A) zero calibration value and 
upscale calibration value (UC Value), see example format 
figure 1-8. These values are the initial 336-hour value 
established during the optical and zero alignment procedure (see 
section 7.2.1). After each 24-hour interval, check and record 
the COMS zero response reading before any cleaning and adjustment. 
Perform the zero and upscale calibration adjustments, 
exposed optical and other instrument surface cleaning, and 
optical realignment only at 24-hour intervals (or at such shorter 
intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify). 
If shorter intervals of zero and span adjustment are conducted, 
record the drift adjustment. However, adjustments and cleaning 
must be performed when the accumulated zero calibration or 
upscale CD exceeds the 24-hour drift specification (

#

2 percent 
opacity). From the initial and final zero readings, calculate 
the zero drift for each 24-hour period. Then, calculate the 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient 
of the 24-hour zero drift and the 95 percent confidence interval 
using equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the sum of the 
absolute value of the mean and the absolute value of the 
confidence coefficient, and report this value as the 24-hour zero 
drift. At the conclusion of the 336-hour operational test 
period, record and report the 336-hour accumulated drift.

7.3.2 Upscale Calibration Drift Test. At each 24-hour 
interval, after the zero calibration value has been checked and 
any optional or required adjustments have been made, check and 
record the COMS response to the upscale calibration value 
established under the optical and zero alignment procedure of 
section 7.2.1. The upscale calibration value established in 
section 7.2.1 shall be used each 24-hour period. From the 
initial and final upscale readings, calculate the upscale calibration 
value drift for each 24-hour period. Then, calculate the 
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and confidence coefficient 
of the 24-hour CD and the 95 percent confidence interval using 
equations 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5. Calculate the sum of the absolute 
value of the mean and the absolute value of the confidence 
coefficient, and report this value as the 24-hour calibration 
value drift. At the conclusion of the 336-hour operational test 
period, record and report the 336-hour accumulated drift. 

7.3.3 Calibration Stability Test. Immediately following or 
during, the operational test period, conduct a calibration 
stability test over a 24-hour period. During this period, there 
will be no unscheduled maintenance, repair, adjustment, zero and 
calibration adjustments, exposed optical and other instrument 
surface cleaning, or optical realignment performed. Record the 
initial zero and upscale calibration opacity values and operate 
the monitor in a normal manner. After each 1-hour period, record 
the monitor adjusted zero and upscale opacity values. Subtract 
the initial zero and upscale calibration values from each 1-hour 
adjusted value and record the difference. None of these differences 
shall exceed +2 percent opacity. Figure 1-8 may be used 
for the recording of the results of this test. 
7.3.4 Retesting. If the COMS fails to meet the 
specifications for the tests conducted under the operational test 
period, make the necessary corrections and restart the opera- 
tional test period. Depending on the correction made, it may be 
necessary to repeat some or all design and other preliminary 
tests.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Lamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment






<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes an amendment to the Federal motor vehicle standard on lighting to allow the photometric conformance
of center highmounted stop lamps to be determined by a grouping of test points. Such an action would be consistent with
the agency's requirements for other lamps and would lessen the testing burden for manufacturers. This action is taken
in implementation of a grant of a petition for rulemaking.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Dennis Moore of Livermore, California, has petitioned for rulemaking to amend Standard No. 108 to allow ``a `Zonal'
approach * * * for Compliance Photometric Testing of 3rd Brake Lights which has already been adopted
for Tail Lights, Regular Brake Lights and Turn Signals.'' Under S5.1.1.6 of Standard No. 108, taillamps and parking
lamps need not meet the minimum photometric values specified for each of the test points of the relevant SAE Standards
incorporated by reference, provided that the sum of the minimum candlepower measured at the test points is not less
than that specified for each group listed in Figure 1c. In addition, the more recent SAE Standards for stop lamps and
turn signal lamps that have been incorporated into Standard No. 108 no longer specify values for individual test points
(though including them as photometric design guidelines). Instead, they specify required values for ``zones''
only.



In contrast, the applicable photometric values for center highmounted stop lamps (CHMSLs) are those of Figure 10
of Standard No. 108 and are for individual test points. Moore views this as an anomaly. He believes that laboratory
test results vary so greatly that CHMSLs must be overdesigned to ensure compliance at each test point. As a result,
they draw more power and have a shorter life expectancy. He argues that because CHMSL bulbs burn out faster ``and are
generally located in an area that is inconvenient,'' they are not replaced.

NHTSA has granted Mr. Moore's petition and is implementing it through this proposal. While the agency has no information
that indicates the present requirement results in shorter bulb life and failure to replace bulbs, it is sympathetic
to his position that photometric compliance for all stop lamps, including CHMSLs, should be determined on the same
basis, as the agency already allows the zonal method of determining compliance for stop lamps other than CHMSLs. The
agency tentatively concludes that there is no reason why this approach should not be extended to CHMSLs as well. As
with other lamps, adoption of the zonal method will enable compliance to be judged on the suim of the candela at the test
point within a zone (i.e., the overall light output of a zone) rather than on the basis of whether each individual test
point meets the prescribed minimum. This will not derogate from safety, and should make it easier for manufacturers
to design and test lamps that meet Standard No. 108.

In implementation of the grant of the petition, this notice proposes a revised Figure 10 which would establish zonal
photometrics that are the sums of the minimum current photometric test point values.


Request for Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted.

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion.

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR part 512.

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments
on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information
as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to examine the docket for new material.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.



Effective Date





The effective date of the final rule would be December 27, 1994. Because the final rule establishes no additional burden
on any party, it is hereby tentatively found for good cause shown that an effective date for the amendments to Standard
No. 108 that is earlier than 180 days after their issuance would be in the public interest.



Rulemaking Analyses and Notices



Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This action has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 (NRM: We are submitting this notice to OST/OMB for determination
of significance.) It has been determined that the rulemaking action is not significant under Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking action is to simplify compliance with Standard
No. 108. Since the rule does not have any significant cost or other impacts, preparation of a full regulatory evaluation
is not warranted.



National Environmental Policy Act



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. It is not anticipated
that a final rule based on this proposal would have a significant effect upon the environment. The design and compositio
