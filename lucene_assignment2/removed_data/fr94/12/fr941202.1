NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 








Tri-Med Specialties, Inc.; Filing of Petition for Rulemaking 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of receipt of petition for rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is publishing for public comment a notice of receipt of a petition for rulemaking,
dated August 23, 1994, that was filed with the Commission by Tri-Med Specialties, Inc. The 
petition was assigned Docket No. PRM-35-12 on October 6, 1994. The petitioner 
requests that the Commission amend its regulations to permit licensed 
pharmaceutical manufacturers to commercially distribute, under general 
licensing and/or exemption, capsules containing one micro-curie of carbon-14 
(C14) for administration to humans for in vivo diagnostic testing.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Petitioner 


Tri-Med Specialties, Inc., headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, 
maintains a licensed pharmaceutical manufacturing site in Charlottesville, 
Virginia. The petitioner also is licensed by the NRC (

#

45-25215-01) to 
perform research using C14. This research involves manufacture of capsules 
containing 1 micro-curie (

m

Ci) of C14-urea and production of diagnostic breath 
test kits. The test kits are currently transferred only to facilities 
licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (IND

#

42294) and the NRC. 


Petitioner's Request 


Tri-Med Specialties requests that the NRC amend its regulations to allow 
for the general licensing and/or exemption for the commercial distribution by 
licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers of a capsule containing 1 

m

Ci of C14-urea for in vivo diagnostic testing. The petitioner states that the capsules 
would be used to test for the presence of Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium 
that causes peptic ulcers in the stomach. According to the petitioner, the 
capsules would be distributed separately or as part of a diagnostic kit that 
contains supplies to perform the test. The petitioner suggests the maximum 
number of capsules allowed in inventory at an unlicensed facility at any time 
be 150 (150 

m

Ci). 


Grounds for Request 


The petitioner states that recent medical research has found peptic 
ulcers are commonly caused by the H.pylori bacterium that lives in the stomach 
of most ulcer sufferers. According to the petitioner, in the past, doctors 
used the endoscopy and biopsy procedure to detect the stomach ulcers. This 
procedure was uncomfortable and expensive at a cost of $1000. The petitioner 
states that by using a C14-urea tracer, H.pylori can be detected noninvasively 
by having the patient swallow a capsule with 30 milliliters of water. C14-urea is broken down by H.pylori to form labeled
CO

2

, which is expired in the 
breath. The petitioner asserts that the C14-urea test could be performed by 
most doctors for less than $100 cost to the patient. 


Public Impact 


The petitioner notes that the risks from the C14-urea test would be very 
low because the 1 

m

Ci of C14-urea consumed by the patient is rapidly excreted 
as urea in the urine or CO

2

 in the breath. The petitioner states that the 
radiation dose received by the patient would be 0.3 millirem (an amount equal 
to background radiation received in 24 hours). The risk for persons 
administering the test would be immeasurably low and risk to the public would 
be close to zero. 
The petitioner indicates that the Commission's regulations currently 
contain provisions for a general license whereby physicians and veterinarians 
can receive, use, and dispose of byproduct material for in vitro clinical or 
laboratory testing without applying for a specific license. According to the 
petitioner, these recipients are required only to be registered with the NRC. 
The petitioner further asserts that the Commission's regulations permit other 
general licenses that have a greater likelihood of affecting the public than 
the proposed C14-urea test. 


Benefits of the Test 


The petitioner states that under the current regulations, the test is 
95-percent accurate and quite inexpensive because of its simplicity. The test 
would permit doctors to determine easily whether or not ulcer patients have 
been cured of their infection. The benefits to the public, according to the 
petitioner, would be a curative therapy for ulcers that can be made available 
to all people, thus saving the United States an estimated $500 million per 
annum over conventional therapy. 


Conclusion 


The petitioner states that the test may be supplied currently only to 
facilities licensed to receive C14. According to the petitioner, this 
requirement makes the test prohibitively expensive for the great majority of 
doctors. The petitioner states that the test is currently being studied at 
four sites under a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug 
(IND) application accepted by the FDA and is also being used at other sites 
under approved research protocols. The petitioner states that all of these 
sites are using the test under the petitioner's IND and are also licensed by 
the NRC to administer C14 to patients for diagnostic testing. The petitioner 
states that more than 200 tests have been performed at these additional sites 
and that no adverse events from the tests performed as of this date have been 
reported. Therefore, the petitioner believes that licensed pharmaceutical 
manufacturers should be permitted to distribute the capsule containing 1 

m

Ci 
of C14-urea for in vivo diagnostic testing. 


Additional Documents 


The petition includes additional justification and support for the 
requested amendment not included in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Members of 
the public interested in filing comments on PRM-35-12 can obtain a copy of the 
petition and supporting documentation by writing to the address noted above.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</USDEPT>








Truth in Lending 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). The amendments implement
recent changes made to the Truth in Lending Act by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act
of 1994. The law imposes new disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on mortgages bearing high rates
or fees. The amendments would provide greater protections to consumers entering into high-rate, high-fee mortgages.
The law also imposes new disclosure requirements to assist consumers in comparing the cost of reverse mortgage transactions,
which provide periodic payments to primarily elderly homeowners and rely principally on the home's value for repayment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 



The purpose of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring
disclosures about its terms and cost. The act requires creditors to disclose credit terms and the cost of credit as
an annual percentage rate (APR). The act requires additional disclosures for loans secured by a consumer's home,
and permits consumers to cancel certain transactions that involve their principal dwelling. Limitations are imposed
on some credit line plans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation
Z (12 CFR part 226). 



II. Proposed Regulatory Provisions 



The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (Equity Protection Act), contained in the Riegle Community Development
and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Community Development Act), Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160, amends
the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 152 of the Equity Protection Act adds a new section 129 dealing with high-rate,
high-fee mortgages. Section 154 adds a new section 138 dealing with reverse mortgage transactions. The Equity Protection
Act was enacted in September 1994, and directs the Board to issue final regulations within 180 days. It provides that
the statutory provisions and rules adopted by the Board shall apply on the October 1 following six months after the
final regulation is issued. 

The Board is proposing regulations for comment, and expects to adopt final implementing regulations in March 1995.
Compliance with the law would be mandatory by October 1, 1995. Section 156 of the Equity Protection Act states that
the final rule governs all high-rate, high-fee mortgage transactions consummated after the mandatory effective
date. The Board believes that the same compliance rule would apply to reverse mortgage transactions consummated
after the mandatory effective date. 



III. Section-By-Section Analysis 



Section 226.2_Definitions and Rules of Construction 



2(a) Definitions 

2(a)(17) Creditor 



Section 152(c) of the Equity Protection Act states the number of high-rate, high-fee mortgage transactions a lender
may make before becoming a creditor for purposes of the TILA. The proposed regulation parallels the statute. The regulation
provides that persons making occasional home-secured loans_less than five during a calendar year_are not subject
to the act. The proposed regulation provides that a creditor includes a person originating two or more high-rate,
high-fee mortgage loans, or one or more such mortgage loans through a mortgage broker during any 12-month period.
Thus, for example, a person originating one high-rate, high-fee mortgage that soon thereafter enters into two home-secured
loans, one of which was a high-rate, high-fee loan, would be required to comply with TILA for both transactions. 



Subpart B_Open-End Credit 



Section 226.5b_Requirements for Home Equity Plans 



5b(f) Limitations on Home Equity Plans 



The TILA allows creditors to terminate open-end plans and demand repayment in narrowly drawn circumstances such
as when the consumer fails to make payments or takes actions that affect the creditor's security. Section 154(c) of
the Equity Protection Act excludes reverse mortgage transactions from these substantive limitations. The legislative
history states that the amendment is intended to codify the Board's interpretation regarding a creditor's ability
to accelerate an open-end reverse mortgage loan in accordance with the credit contract. The proposed amendment reflects
that intent. 



Subpart C_Closed-end Credit 



Section 226.23_Right of Rescission 



23(a) Consumer's Right to Rescind 



Section 152(b) of the Equity Protection Act provides that high-rate, high-fee mortgage disclosures are ``material''
for purposes of the TILA. Proposed amendments to footnote 48 implement the change. The effect is to give consumers
the right to rescind a high-rate, high-fee mortgage if a creditor fails to furnish the disclosures set forth in proposed
 226.32(c) or provides for a prohibited credit term set forth in proposed  226.32(d).

Subpart D_Miscellaneous 



Section 226.28_Effect on State Laws 



28(b) Equivalent Disclosure Requirements 



Section 152(e) of the Equity Protection Act provides that the procedure for substituting substantially similar
state law disclosures for federal TILA requirements does not apply to state disclosure requirements for high-rate,
high-fee mortgages. The proposed amendments reflect this limitation. 



Subpart E_Certain Mortgage Transactions 



The amendments to the TILA (section 129 dealing with high-rate, high-fee mortgages and section 138 dealing with reverse
mortgage transactions) layer disclosure and timing requirements onto the requirements already imposed for these
consumer credit transactions. The Board proposes to implement these provisions by adding a new subpart E to the regulation:
proposed  226.31 addresses general requirements such as timing and format rules;  226.32 contains rules
relating to high-rate, high-fee mortgages; and  226.32 addresses reverse mortgages. 



Section 226.31_General Disclosure Requirements 



31(a) Relation to Other Subparts 



The proposed regulation explicitly states that the requirements and limitations of Subpart E are in addition to_not
in lieu of_those otherwise provided in other subparts of the regulation. For example, creditors offering closed-end,
variable-rate loans that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater that one year must
generally provide disclosures at the time of application and prior to consummation, according to the requirements
of Subpart C. If these transactions are also high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans, this subpart requires creditors
to provide additional disclosures at least three business days prior to the loan's consummation. 



31(c) Timing of Disclosures 

31(c)(1) High-rate, High-fee Mortgage Disclosures 



Section 129 of the TILA and the proposed regulation require a three-day ``cooling off'' period between the time consumers
are furnished with special disclosures about a high-rate, high-fee mortgage and the time the consumer becomes obligated
under the loan. 

The law also authorizes the Board to identify in the regulation circumstances under which a homeowner may modify or
waive the right to the three-day waiting period to meet bona fide personal financial emergencies. The legislative
history states that the provision is intended to protect consumers from high-pressure sales tactics and to ensure
that consumers understand the terms of loans with high interest rates or up-front fees. The Board is not proposing
regulations regarding waivers of the cooling-off period at this time. Sections 226.15(e) and 226.23(e) of the regulation
discuss waivers of the right to rescind, and the Board solicits comments on whether similar provisions should be incorporated
for high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans. 



31(c)(2) Reverse Mortgage Disclosures 



Besides the other disclosures required by the regulation, section 138 of the TILA requires creditors to furnish additional
disclosures to consumers at least three business days prior to consummation of a reverse mortgage transaction. Timing
requirements for closed-end credit are often tied to the consummation of the transaction, and the regulation parallels
the statute for closed-end reverse mortgage loans. 

However, reverse mortgage loans may also be structured as open-end credit plans. In that case, the proposed regulation
provides that the disclosures must be given at least three business days prior to the first transaction under the open-end
credit plan. 



Conforming Paragraphs 



Proposed paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) mirror provisions in subparts B and C, and provide consistency among the subparts
of the regulation. (See  226.5 and  226.17.) 



Section 226.32_High-Rate, High-Fee Mortgages 



32(a) Coverage 



Section 152 of the Equity Protection Act provides that the high-rate, high-fee mortgage rules do not apply to a residential
mortgage transaction, a reverse mortgage transaction, and an open-end credit plan. The proposed regulation tracks
those exceptions, with two additions for clarification. The Board believes the Congress intended to exempt from
coverage only those reverse mortgage transactions which are part of the new disclosure scheme in proposed  226.33,
and the proposed amendment reflects that limitation. Also, the proposed amendment clarifies that the exception
for open-end credit plans extends to all plans subject to subpart B of the regulation (Open-end Credit).

32(b) Definitions 
32(b)(1) High-Rate, High-Fee Mortgage 


Section 103(aa) of the TILA defines the mortgages covered by new section 129 based on the rates charged and fees paid.
For ease of compliance, the proposed amendments refer to those mortgages as high-rate, high-fee mortgages. 


32(b)(1)(i) 


The statute covers mortgages that charge rates above a specified standard. The rate-based test is tied to Treasury
securities having comparable terms of the loan's maturity. Rate information for Treasury securities is widely available.
For example, the Board's Selected Interest Rates (statistical release H-15) identifies Treasury securities
with maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20 and 30 years. The Board anticipates that for loan maturities that do not match
those of Treasury securities, creditors will use rounding to determine a comparable maturity. For example, the APR
for an eight-year loan would be compared to securities with a seven-year maturity; a nine-year loan would be compared
to a ten-year maturity. 
The Board is required by section 157 of the Equity Protection Act to conduct a study and make recommendations to the
Congress about whether a high-rate mortgage could be defined with a more appropriate interest rate index than Treasury
securities of comparable maturities. The study will begin when the proposed regulation is adopted in final form and
will end 18 months later. As an adjunct to the study, the Board solicits comments on other interest rate indices that
might be more appropriate. 


32(b)(1)(ii) 


The statute also covers mortgages if the total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before loan closing exceed
the greater of $400 or 8 percent of the total loan amount. The $400 dollar amount will be adjusted annually on January
1 by the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index, as reported on June 1 of the previous year. The Board contemplates
that any adjustment will be published at the same time as proposed periodic updates of Regulation Z's official staff
commentary, which are regularly published for public comment in the autumn of each year. 
The Board believes the statute requires creditors to use the principal balance_and not additional costs that may
be incurred at closing_when determining whether the ratio of fees to the total loan amount exceeds 8 percentage points.

The TILA's timing rules for providing disclosures_including those disclosures proposed below_are generally triggered
by the consummation of a closed-end credit transaction. State law determines when consummation occurs, and it often,
but not always, coincides with the loan closing. The statute defines a high-fee mortgage by measuring the amount of
fees paid at or before closing; the proposed amendment reflects that timing rule. 


32(b)(2) Points and Fees 


Section 103(aa) of the TILA defines points and fees as all finance charges (except interest or the time-price differential),
all compensation paid to mortgage brokers, and all items identified in section 106(e) (other than amounts held for
future payment of taxes) unless the charge is reasonable, the creditor receives no direct or indirect compensation
from the charge, and the charge is not paid to an affiliate of the creditor. The proposed amendments replicate the statute,
except that the proposed definition refers to the regulatory provisions implementing section 106(a) (finance charges)
and section 106(e) (closing costs for real estate-related transactions) of the TILA. 
The Board believes the Congress intended a very broad application of the term ``compensation,'' including, for example,
amounts paid to brokers by creditors (in addition to amounts paid by consumers). 
Section 103(aa) also authorizes the Board to identify other charges that would be appropriate to include in the total
fee calculation. The proposed regulation does not identify any such additional charges. The legislative history
includes credit insurance premiums as an example of fees that could be included, if evidence showed that the premiums
were being used to circumvent the statute. The Board solicits comment on charges not captured by the statute that would
be appropriate to include in the test to determine whether a transaction is a high-fee mortgage, and if so, why. 


32(b)(3) Affiliate 


Section 129(k) of the TILA defines ``affiliate'' for purposes of the high-rate, high-fee mortgage rules by a statutory
reference to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. (12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) That act defines affiliate as any company that
controls, is controlled by, or is under the common control with another company. It also defines ``company'' and when
one company is considered to ``control'' another. See 12 U.S.C. 1841(a) and (b). The proposed amendment simply defines
the term by statutory reference.

<TEXT>
 

32(c) Disclosures 


The proposed regulation mirrors the disclosure requirements of section 129(a). The law requires creditors to disclose
a monthly payment based on an interest rate cap required for consumer contracts by a provision in the Competitive Equality
Banking Act of 1987 (CEBA), which is implemented in  226.30. The legislative history provides that in calculating
the maximum payment based on the interest rate cap, creditors should assume the maximum possible increases in rates
in the shortest possible timeframe. To ease compliance, proposed paragraph (c)(4) refers to  226.30 rather
than CEBA. 


32(d) Limitations 


Section 129 of the TILA prohibits high-rate, high-fee mortgage creditors from including several terms in their credit
contracts. 


32(d)(5) Rebates 


Section 129(d) of the TILA restricts how creditors may calculate refunds of interest when a high-rate, high-fee mortgage
loan is accelerated due to a consumer's default. The statute provides that creditors must calculate the refund by
a method no less favorable than the actuarial method, as defined under section 933(d) of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992 (HCDA). That section describes a method of allocating payments so that a payment is first applied
to accumulated finance charges. Any remaining amount is applied to the unpaid balance of the amount financed. The
effect of the actuarial method is to prohibit calculating refunds by the ``rule of 78s.'' The proposed amendment defines
the actuarial method by statutory reference. 


32(d)(6) Prepayment Penalties 


Section 129(c) of the TILA generally bars creditors from including a prepayment penalty in a high-rate, high-fee
mortgage contract. The statute includes as a prepayment penalty, refunds of unearned interest calculated less favorably
than the actuarial method in HCDA's section 933(d). The proposed regulation likewise limits rebate calculations
by a statutory reference to the HCDA. 
The legislative history notes that the ``actuarial method'' has been defined by some states, and that in some jurisdictions
the actuarial method provides a refund that is greater than the refund received under the HCDA definition. The legislative
history states that in those circumstances, creditors should continue to apply state law to determine if a refund
is a prepayment penalty for a high-rate, high-fee mortgage. The legislative history also states that the reference
to the HCDA is not intended to be exclusive, and that penalties based on a percentage of the outstanding balance or on
the number of months of interest are also prohibited. 


32(d)(7) Exception 


Section 129(c)(2) of the TILA allows creditors to provide for a penalty when a consumer prepays a high-rate, high-fee
mortgage under narrowly drawn circumstances. The proposed amendment follows the statute, except that in discussing
permissible refund calculation methods, the proposed amendment incorporates the heading of HCDA's section 933(b)_prohibiting
the rule of 78s_rather than referring to the actuarial method. 


32(e) Prohibited Acts and Practices 


Section 129(l)(2) of the TILA authorizes the Board to prohibit acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans
that the Board finds to be unfair, deceptive or designed to evade the high-rate, high-fee mortgage rules. The Board
also may prohibit acts or practices related to refinancing mortgage loans that the Board finds are associated with
abusive lending practices or that are not in the borrower's interest. 
The Board believes a study and hearing required by the Equity Protection Act will assist the Board in its determination
of whether certain acts or practices should be prohibited. Section 157 of the Equity Protection Act requires the Board
to conduct a study and make recommendations to the Congress regarding, in part, the adequacy of federal laws protecting
consumers with open-end credit plans secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The statutory timeframe for
the study is eighteen months, beginning after the amendments are adopted. Section 158 of the Equity Protection Act
requires the Board (in consultation with its Consumer Advisory Council) to conduct public hearings that examine
home equity loans in the marketplace and the adequacy of federal laws (including the new rules affecting high-rate,
high-fee mortgages and reverse mortgage transactions) in protecting consumers_particularly low-income consumers.
The statute provides that the first hearing must be held prior to September 1997, and the Board contemplates the initial
hearing will occur sometime in 1996, so that the impact of the new rules can be evaluated. Thus, the Board is not proposing
to prohibit a particular act or practice at this time.

32(e)(1) Repayment Ability 



Section 129(h) of the TILA prohibits creditors extending high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans from engaging in a pattern
or practice of extending such credit to consumers based on the consumer's collateral without regard to the consumer's
repayment ability, including the consumer's current and expected income, current obligations, and employment.
The Board believes that the information provided by the consumer in connection with paragraph (d)(7) can be relied
on when considering a consumer's ability to repay the debt. 



32(e)(2) Home Improvement Contracts 



Section 129(i) of the TILA restricts how creditors may disburse proceeds to contractors under a home improvement
contract secured by a high-rate, high-fee mortgage. The proposed regulation reflects the statutory requirement
that the creditor must disburse the proceeds by an instrument payable to the consumer or jointly to the consumer and
the contractor. 

Alternatively, at the election of the consumer, the creditor could disburse the proceeds through an escrow agent
in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the consumer, the creditor, and the contractor
prior to the disbursement. The Board solicits comment on whether further guidance is needed regarding the use of a
third party escrow agent. For example, comment is solicited on whether an affiliate of the creditor could act as a disbursing
agent. The Board believes the Congress contemplated that both the consumer and the creditor would make a good-faith
effort to agree to a mutually acceptable third party. 

The statutory provision on check disbursements is technical and narrowly drawn. Its limitations are imposed only
on ``creditors''_the person to whom a note is intially made payable. The consumer protections of this provision would
not apply to the disbursement of funds by a lender such as a bank or finance company that purchases a high-rate, high-fee
mortgage note made payable to a home improvement contractor, because the lender is not the ``creditor.'' 



Exemptions 



Section 129(l)(1) of the TILA authorizes the Board to create exemptions to the limitations set forth in proposed paragraph
(d) and paragraph (e) of this section, upon a finding that the exemption is in the interest of the borrowing public and
will apply only to mortgage products or categories of products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity
protection. The legislative history expresses the Congress' concern that the legislation might inappropriately
apply to some government loans or short-term ``bridge'' construction loans. It also states that in granting the exemption
authority to the Board, the Congress intended that the Board consider exemptions on a product-by-product basis.


The Board has not proposed any exemptions at this time. Comment is solicited on whether the Board should exercise its
exemption authority for a product. And if a product is identified, the Board requests comment on the potential for
abusive lending practices to be used for the products, and how the product is used to facilitate homeownership and
strengthen the homeowner's equity interest.

Section 226.33_Reverse Mortgages 
33(a) Definition 


Section 154 of the Equity Protection Act defines a ``reverse mortgage'' as a nonrecourse transaction that is secured
by the consumer's principal dwelling and that ties repayment (other than upon default) to the homeowner's death or
the permanent move from or transfer of the home. The proposed regulation tracks the statute.

A nonrecourse transaction limits the homeowner's liability to no more than the proceeds of the sale of the home (unless
a lesser amount is provided for in the credit obligation such as by an equity reservation or an equity conservation
agreement between the consumer and creditor). Neither the statute nor the proposed regulation defines ``nonrecourse
transactions.'' Similarly, specific acts of default for purposes of the reverse mortgage rules are not defined.
Neither the act nor the legislative history identifies such acts, and the Board believes that the determination of
``default'' is most appropriately left to the legal obligation between the parties and state or other law. However,
the Board notes that further guidance could be given if such an approach results in creditors defining default in a
way that circumvents the protections for consumers entering into reverse mortgage transactions.



33(b) Content of Disclosures



Section 138 of the TILA establishes a new standard to measure the cost of reverse mortgage credit. The statute requires
reverse mortgage creditors to disclose a good faith estimate of the projected total cost of the credit to the consumer,
expressed as a table of annual interest rates. The legislative history states that the Congress contemplated a disclosure
scheme modeled after the matrix disclosure currently required by section 255 of the National Housing Act and implemented
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. The
proposed regulation reflects that approach, except as noted below.

The regulation requires creditors to use the term ``total annual loan cost rate'' rather than ``annual interest rate''
in complying with this section. The statute does not mandate the use of the term ``annual interest rate,'' and the Board
believes that using a different term will avoid possible confusion between the disclosure of an ``annual interest
rate'' and the ``annual percentage rate,'' which is required by other parts of the regulation. The term ``total annual
loan cost rate'' is unlikely to be confused with the more frequently used APR. Furthermore, the Board believes ``total
annual loan cost rate'' is a more accurate description of the percentage cost of reverse mortgages than ``annual interest
rate.'' For example, the rate may reflect costs other than interest, such as annuity premiums, appraisal fees and
a percentage of any appreciation in the consumer's home.

Section 138(a)(1) of the TILA requires creditors to disclose total annual loan cost rates for not less than three projected
appreciation rates and not less than three credit transaction periods, as determined by the Board. HUD's HECM matrix
similarly discloses nine ``average annual percentage rates'' based on three assumed annual home appreciation rates
and three assumed loan terms. The proposed regulation would require the tabular disclosure of nine total annual loan
cost rates.

The HECM matrix is accompanied by a listing of the basic factors used in calculating the projected total cost of credit,
such as the age of the borrower, the value of the consumer's home, etc., and a brief discussion of some assumptions used
in calculating the rates in the matrix. The proposed regulation would require that the matrix be accompanied by a listing
of key factors used in calculating the total annual loan cost rates, along with a brief narrative that helps consumers
to interpret the rates disclosed in the matrix. (See the supplementary material accompanying proposed Appendix
K for further discussion of the model disclosure.)



33(c) Projected Total Cost of Credit



Section 138(a) and 138(b) of the TILA identify factors creditors must consider when calculating the projected total
cost of credit and the corresponding total annual loan cost rates. The proposed regulation lists those requirements
in paragraph (c) of this section. (The mathematical formulas for determining the total annual loan cost rate is contained
in Appendix K.)



33(c)(1) Costs to Consumer



Section 138(b)(2) of the TILA includes in the projected total cost of credit all costs and charges to the consumer,
including the costs of any associated annuity that the consumer elects or is required to purchase as part of the reverse
mortgage transaction. The proposed regulation parallels the statute, except that the term ``associated'' has been
deleted.

The Board believes the Congress intended a very broad application of the terms ``costs and charges.'' For example,
the Board believes all costs and charges connected with the reverse mortgage transaction must be included in the projected
total cost of credit, whether or not the charge is deemed to be a finance charge under Subpart A of the regulation.

Some creditors require or permit consumers to purchase an annuity as part of the transaction that at some future time
supplements or replaces the creditor's payments. The law and regulation require the amount paid by the consumer for
the annuity to be included as a cost to the consumer. This is the case whether the purchase is made through the creditor
or a third party, or whether the purchase is mandatory or voluntary.

The HECM program does not include disposition costs as a part of the total annual loan cost rate, and the proposed regulation
follows that approach. The Board solicits comment on the treatment of disposition costs that may be incurred when
the loan is repaid.



33(c)(2) Payments to Consumer



Section 138(b)(3) of the TILA requires creditors to consider in the projected total cost of credit all payments to
and for the benefit of the consumer, including annuity payments received by the consumer from an annuity purchased
as part of the reverse mortgage transaction. The regulation would generally track the statute, with slight modifications
for clarity.



33(c)(3) Additional Creditor Compensation



Section 138(b)(1) of the TILA includes in the total cost of a reverse mortgage loan any shared appreciation or equity
that the creditor is entitled to receive pursuant to the credit contract. For example, creditors sometimes offer
a reduced interest rate in exchange for a portion of the appreciation or equity that may be realized when the dwelling
is sold.



33(c)(4) Limitations on Consumer Liability



Section 138(b)(4) of the TILA requires creditors to consider in the projected total cost of credit any limitation
on the consumer's liability under the reverse mortgage loan. This would include, for example, equity conservation
agreements. These agreements protect a portion of the equity in the dwelling for the consumer or the consumer's estate.

This paragraph would also apply to the nonrecourse provision that is a part of any credit contract meeting the definition
of a reverse mortgage transaction. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) Some reverse mortgage transactions provide
that a consumer's liability will not exceed a specific percentage of the projected home value, say 75 percent. Other
reverse mortgages set the consumer's maximum liability at the ``net proceeds'' available from the sale of the home.
That is, if a consumer sells the home for $100,000 and brokerage commissions and other incidental selling costs were
$7,000, the creditor would receive no more than $93,000_the net proceeds of the sale. 
The Board believes that the purposes of the reverse mortgage disclosures would be enhanced if the calculations of
projected total costs for ``net proceeds'' recourse limitations were based on uniform assumptions about the costs
associated with the sale of the home. Thus, if a contract does not otherwise specify a percentage for net proceeds,
creditors must assume closing costs of 7 percent, which approximates the amounts paid for typical brokerage fees
and other incidental costs. The Board solicits comment on this approach. If another amount is more appropriate, commenters
should provide the rationale for the alternative approach. 


33(c)(5) Assumed Annual Appreciation Rates


Section 138(a)(1) of the TILA requires each total annual loan cost rate to be based on one of (at least) three projected
appreciation rates for the consumer's dwelling. The proposed regulation tracks the appreciation rates used in HUD's
HECM program. That is, the total annual loan cost rates are based on assumed annual home appreciation rates of 0 percent,
4 percent and 8 percent. The Board believes these appreciation rates are appropriate estimates for reverse mortgage
transactions. For example, HUD's program based the 4 percent annual appreciation rate on its assessment of long-term
averages of historical housing appreciation rates. The 0 percent and 8 percent rates help consumers understand the
potential costs and benefits of the loan if their dwelling does not appreciate in value at all, or if its value appreciated
at a rate double the 4 percent rate. The Board solicits comment on other appreciation rates that might be used in lieu
of the proposed rates; and if alternative rates are suggested, commenters should provide the rationale for why those
rates would be a more appropriate measure for calculating the total annual loan cost rate.


33(c)(6) Assumed Loan Period


Section 138(a)(1) of the TILA also requires each total annual loan cost rate to be based on one of (at least) three credit
transaction periods, as determined by the Board, including a short-term reverse mortgage, a term equaling the actuarial
life expectancy of the consumer, and ``such longer term as the Board deems appropriate.'' The proposed regulation
tracks the assumed loan periods required under the HECM program: a period of two years, a period equal to the consumer's
life expectancy, and a period equal to approximately 1.4 times the consumer's life expectancy (the creditor would
use the life expectancy of the youngest consumer in transactions involving multiple borrowers). 
The Board believes these proposed loan periods produce total annual loan cost rates that will assist consumers in
understanding the costs of the reverse mortgage transaction in the event that, for example, they move permanently
from the dwelling either sooner or later than anticipated. (See the supplementary material accompanying proposed
Appendix L for further discussion of the life expectancy data used to derive two of the assumed loan periods.) 
The statute authorizes the Board to require total annual loan cost rates for more than three assumed loan periods.
The Board notes that, depending on the age of the borrower, a significant time interval could exist between the shortest
loan period (two years) and the consumer's life expectancy. Accordingly, the Board solicits comment on whether other
assumed loan periods, such as an assumed loan period of one-half of the life expectancy figure, should be added to the
regulation; and if so, whether calculations based on the additional assumed loan periods should be required (which
promotes uniformity), or optional.


Appendix K_Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse Mortgage Transactions


The proposed regulation bases the calculation of total annual loan cost rates on a commonly used computation tool,
an internal rate of return formula. The formula uses the estimation or ``iteration'' procedure required to compute
APRs under Appendix J of this part. However, Appendix J is written in the context of forward (not reverse) mortgages.
The proposed formulas are similar to those in Appendix J; however, to ease compliance and avoid confusion about terminology,
definitions and instructions appropriate for reverse mortgages are placed in Appendix K.

(b) Instructions and Equations for the Total Annual Loan Cost Rate
(b)(5) Number of Unit-Periods Between Two Given Dates



The proposed total annual loan cost rates are based on a proposed assumption that the reverse mortgage transaction
begins on the first day of the month in which consummation is estimated to occur. The total annual loan cost rates are
good faith estimates based on a number of assumptions. The Board believes that using fractional unit-periods required
under Appendix J for calculating APRs is unnecessary for these disclosures, and has not incorporated many definitions
relating to time intervals. 



(b)(8) Solution of General Equation by Iteration Process



Rather than restate the iteration process required to be used in determining total annual loan cost rates under the
appendix, the Board has referred lenders to Appendix J of this regulation for the procedures to be followed. The Board
solicits comment on whether this is sufficient guidance to reverse mortgage lenders.



(b)(9) Assumption for Discretionary Cash Advances



Some reverse mortgage transactions permit consumers to control when advances are received. The proposed regulation
requires creditors to use a special assumption for calculating the total annual loan cost rate in this case. Creditors
must assume that 50 percent of the amount of the credit line is advanced when the consumer becomes obligated under the
transaction (at the interest rate then in effect) and that no further advances are made during the remaining term.
The Board believes this assumption is appropriate for reverse mortgage credit lines, given that the amount and timing
of advances (thus, the estimated interest owed) are within the consumer's control. The proposal also is consistent
with Appendix D's requirements for an estimated interest figure when the amount and timing of construction loan advances
are unknown, as well as with HUD's HECM program. 

Creditors would follow this approach for estimating interest on open-end reverse mortgage credit lines. Once the
interest figure is determined, creditors would use the general equation in section (b)(8) of this appendix to calculate
the total annual loan cost rate.



(b)(10) Assumption for Variable-Rate Reverse Mortgage Transactions



Regulation Z provides that to calculate the APR, creditors offering variable-rate transactions must base disclosures
on the initial interest rate and not assume the rate will increase. The Board proposes to adopt the same convention
for calculating total annual loan cost rates. The Board notes, however, that HUD's HECM program requires creditors
to assume an ``expected average mortgage interest rate'' or ``expected interest rate'' instead of the initial rate.
The convention required by HUD reflects an average of long-term U.S. Treasury securities and results in a rate that
is generally higher than the initial rate. The Board solicits comments on the benefits to consumers and burdens to
creditors if creditors offering variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions were required to use both HUD's and
the proposed assumptions to compute total annual loan cost rates. 



(b)(11) Assumption for Closing Costs



The proposed regulation requires creditors to assume all closing and other consumer costs are financed by the creditor.
These costs are generally financed as a part of the transaction, and the Board believes the proposed assumption provides
uniformity.



(c) Examples of Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations



Three examples are provided to assist creditors in calculating the total annual loan cost rate. The Board solicits
comment on whether other examples should be provided, and if so, what should be illustrated.



(d) Reverse Mortgage Model Form and Sample Form



The proposed regulation requires that the matrix be accompanied by a disclosure substantially similar to the model
form in this paragraph. Reverse mortgages are complicated transactions, and the Board believes a uniform disclosure
would enhance consumer understanding of the proposed transaction and promote informed comparison shopping.

The proposed model form and sample form are placed in this appendix, because they apply to both open-end and closed-end
reverse mortgage transactions. This avoids publishing the forms twice, in Appendix G (Open-end model forms and clauses)
and Appendix H (Closed-end model forms and clauses).



Appendix L_Assumed Loan Periods for Calculation of Total Annual Loan Cost Rates



As stated previously, the law requires the total annual loan cost rate disclosures for reverse mortgage transactions
to be based on three assumed loan periods, as determined by the Board. The proposed regulation tracks the assumed loan
period requirements of HUD's HECM program (two years, a period equal to the youngest consumer's life expectancy,
and a period 1.4 times that consumer's life expectancy).

The Board proposes to use the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for the life expectancy figures. These tables are published
by the Department of Health and Human Services and are widely available to the public. The figures in the proposed appendix
are based on data currently available, that is, on tables for 1979-1981, as rounded to the nearest whole year.
The Board contemplates updating the figures as data are published periodically. The Board solicits comment on other
sources of life expectancy data that are also widely available and would be appropriate for determining the total
annual loan cost rate for reverse mortgage transactions. 
The proposed regulation also tracks the HECM program's use of female life expectancy figures for calculating total
annual loan cost rates for all borrowers, as women are estimated to comprise the majority of borrowers under existing
reverse mortgage programs. 


IV. Form of Comment Letters 


Comment letters should refer to Docket No. R-0858, and, when possible, should use a standard Courier typeface
with a type size of 10 or 12 characters per inch. This will enable the Board to convert the text in machine-readable form
through electronic scanning, and will facilitate automated retrieval of comments for review. Also, if accompanied
by an original document in paper form, comments may be submitted on 31/2 inch or 51/4 inch computer diskettes in any
IBM-compatible DOS-based format. 
The comment period ends on January 18, 1995, a period slightly less than the 60 days normally called for in the Board's
policy statement on rulemaking (44 FR 3957, January 19, 1979). The law provides for a short timeframe to issue implementing
amendments in final form, and the Board believes an abbreviated comment period is desirable to ensure that a final
rule is in place as soon as possible to provide guidance to creditors affected by the new rules. 


V. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


The Board's Office of the Secretary has prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed amendments to Regulation
Z. A copy of the analysis may be obtained from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
Washington, D.C. 20551, at (202) 452-3245. 


VI. Paperwork Reduction Act 


In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions
will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after
consideration of comments received during the public comment period. 
The proposal requires creditors offering high-rate, high-fee mortgages and creditors offering reverse mortgage
transactions to furnish to consumers at least three days prior to consummation a one-time notice disclosing costs
of the loan and reminding consumers that signing an application or receiving disclosures does not require the consumer
to complete the transaction. A model form in Appendix K is proposed to ease compliance for creditors furnishing reverse
mortgage disclosures. 
The Board believes that the types of mortgage products that would trigger these additional disclosures are not typically
offered by state member banks; thus, the proposed requirements would have only a negligible impact on the paperwork
burden for state member banks. Any estimates of paperwork burden for institutions other than state member banks that
would be affected by the proposed amendments would be provided by the federal agency or agencies that supervise these
lenders. 


VII. Indexing Terms 


The Code of Federal Regulations publishes a list of subjects identifying common research terms that are intended
to assist laypersons with the use of the Code of Federal Regulations. The list of subjects under which 12 CFR part 226
is listed would be expanded as listed below. 


List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 226 


Advertising, Banks, banking, Consumer protection, Credit, Federal Reserve System, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping
requirements, Truth in lending. 
Certain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions to the regulation. New language is shown inside
bold-faced arrows, while language that would be deleted is set off with bold-faced brackets. 



For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR part 226 as follows: 


PART 226_TRUTH IN LENDING (REGULATION Z) 


1. The authority citation for part 226 continues to read as follows:

(ii) 

Telephone disclosures. 

A creditor may provide new disclosures by telephone if the consumer initiates the change, and if, at consummation_
(A) The creditor provides new written disclosures; and 
(B) The consumer and creditor sign a statement that the new disclosures were provided by telephone at least three days
prior to consummation. 
(2) 

Reverse mortgage disclosures. 

The creditor shall furnish the disclosures required by  226.33 at least three business days prior to: 
(i) Consummation of a closed-end credit transaction; or 
(ii) The first transaction under an open-end credit plan. 
(d) 

Basis of disclosures and use of estimates. 

Disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties. If any information necessary for
accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on the best information
reasonably available and shall state clearly that the disclosure is an estimate. 
(e) 

Multiple creditors; multiple consumers. 

If a transaction involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be given and the creditors shall
agree among themselves which creditor must comply with the requirements that this regulation imposes on any or all
of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the
obligation. If the transaction is rescindable under  226.15 or  226.23, however, the disclosures shall
be made to each consumer who has the right to rescind. 
(f) 

Effect of subsequent events. 

If a disclosure becomes inaccurate because of an event that occurs after the creditor delivers the required disclosures,
the inaccuracy is not a violation of this regulation, although new disclosures may be required under paragraph (c)
of this section,  226.9(c),  226.19, or  226.20. 


 226.32 

High-rate, high-fee mortgages. 


(a) 

Coverage. 

This section does not apply to the following:

(2) A reverse mortgage transaction subject to  226.33. 
(3) An open-end credit plan subject to subpart B of this part. 
(b) 

Definitions. 

For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply: 
(1) 

High-rate, high fee mortgage

(i) The annual percentage rate at consummation will exceed by more than 10 percentage points the yield on Treasury
securities having comparable periods of maturity on the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the month
in which the application for the extension of credit is received by the creditor; or 
(ii) The total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before loan closing will exceed the greater of 8 percent
of the total loan amount, or $400; the $400 figure shall be adjusted annually on January 1 by the annual percentage change
in the Consumer Price Index that was reported on the preceding June 1. 
(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 

points and fees 

mean:

(d) 

Limitations. 

A high-rate, high-fee mortgage transaction may not provide for the following terms: 

(1) 

Balloon payment. 

A payment schedule with regular periodic payments that do not repay the full amount of interest.

Act of 1992. 

(7) 

Exception. 

A high-rate, high-fee mortgage transaction may contain a prepayment penalty otherwise permitted by law (including
a refund calculated according to the rule of 78s) if: 

(i) The penalty can be exercised only for the first five years following consummation;

(ii) The source of the prepayment funds is not a refinancing by the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor; and 

(iii) At consummation, the consumer's total monthly debts (including amounts owed under the high-rate, high-fee
mortgage) do not exceed 50 percent of the consumer's monthly gross income, as verified by the consumer's signed financial

(e) 

Prohibited acts and practices. 

A creditor extending high-rate, high-fee mortgage credit may not: 

(1) 

Repayment ability. 

Engage in a pattern or practice of extending such credit to a consumer based on the consumer's collateral if, considering

the scheduled payments. 

(2) 

Home improvement contracts. 

Pay a contractor under a home improvement contract from the proceeds of a high-rate, high-fee mortgage, other than:


(i) By an instrument payable to the consumer or jointly to the consumer and the contractor; or

written agreement signed by the consumer, the creditor, and the contractor prior to the disbursement. 

(3) 

Notice to assignee. 

Sell or otherwise assign a high-rate, high-fee mortgage without furnishing the following statement to the purchaser
or assignee: ``Notice: Purchasers or assignees of this mortgage could be liable for all claims and defenses with respect
to the mortgage that the borrower could assert against the creditor.'' 



 226.33 


Reverse mortgages. 



(a) 

Definition. 

For purposes of this subpart, reverse mortgage transaction means a nonrecourse consumer credit obligation in which:


(1) A mortgage, deed of trust, or equivalent consensual security interest securing one or more advances is created
in the consumer's principal dwelling; and 

(2) Any principal, interest, or shared appreciation or equity is due and payable (other than in the case of default)
only after: 

(i) The consumer dies;

(ii) The dwelling is transferred; or 

(iii) The consumer ceases to occupy the dwelling as a principal dwelling.

(b) 

Content of disclosures. 

In addition to other disclosures required by this part, for each reverse mortgage transaction, the creditor shall
provide the following disclosures in a form substantially similar to the model form found in paragraph (d) of Appendix
K of this part: 

(1) 

Notice. 

A statement that the consumer is not obligated to complete the reverse mortgage transaction merely because the consumer

Appendix K to Part 226_Total Annual Loan Cost Rate Computations for Reverse Mortgage Transactions 



(a) 

Introduction. 

Creditors are required to disclose a series of total annual loan cost rates for each reverse mortgage transaction.
This appendix contains the equations creditors must use in computing the total annual loan cost rate for various transactions,
as well as instructions, explanations, and examples for various transactions. This appendix is modeled after Appendix
J of this part (Annual Percentage Rates Computations for Closed-end Credit Transactions); creditors should consult
Appendix J of this part for additional guidance in using the formulas for reverse mortgages. 

(b) 

Instructions and equations for the total annual loan cost rate. 

(1) General rule. 

The total annual loan cost rate shall be the nominal total annual loan cost rate determined by multiplying the unit-period
rate by the number of unit-periods in a year. 

(2) 

Term of the transaction. 

For purposes of total loan cost disclosures, the term of a reverse mortgage transaction is assumed to begin on the first
of the month in which consummation is expected to occur. If a loan cost or any portion of a loan cost is initially incurred
beginning on a date later than consummation, the term of the transaction is assumed to begin on the first of the month
in which that loan cost is incurred. For purposes of total loan cost disclosures, the term ends on each of the assumed
loan periods specified in 
 226.33(c)(6). 

(3) 

Definitions of time intervals. 

(i) A period 

is the interval of time between advances. 

(ii) A 

common period 

is any period that occurs more than once in a transaction. 

(iii) A 

standard interval of time 

is a day, week, semimonth, month, or a multiple of a week or a month up to, but not exceeding, 1 year. 

(iv) All months shall be considered equal. 

(4) 

Unit-period.

<TEXT>
 

(i) In all transactions other than a single-advance, single-payment transaction, the unit-period shall be that
common period, not to exceed one year, that occurs most frequently in the transaction, except that: 
(A) If two or more common periods occur with equal frequency, the smaller of such common periods shall be the unit-period;
or 
(B) If there is no common period in the transaction, the unit-period shall be that period which is the average of all
periods rounded to the nearest whole standard interval of time. If the average is equally near two standard intervals
of time, the lower shall be the unit-period. 
(ii) In a single-advance, single-payment transaction, the unit-period shall be the term of the transaction, but
shall not exceed one year. 
(5) Number of unit-periods between two given dates. 
(i) The number of days between two dates shall be the number of 24-hour intervals between any point in time on the first
date to the same point in time on the second date. 
(ii) If the unit-period is a month, the number of full unit-periods between two dates shall be the number of months.
If the unit-period is a month, the number of unit-periods per year shall be 12. 
(iii) If the unit-period is a semimonth or a multiple of a month not exceeding 11 months, the number of days between two
dates shall be 30 times the number of full months. The number of full unit-periods shall be determined by dividing the
number of days by 15 in the case of a semimonthly unit-period or by the appropriate multiple of 30 in the case of a multimonthly
unit-period. If the unit-period is a semimonth, the number of unit-periods per year shall be 24. If the number of unit-periods
is a multiple of a month, the number of unit-periods per year shall be 12 divided by the number of months per unit-period.

(iv) If the unit-period is a day, a week, or a multiple of a week, the number of full unit-periods shall be determined
by dividing the number of days between the two given dates by the number of days per unit-period. If the unit-period
is a day, the number of unit-periods per year shall be 365. If the unit-period is a week or a multiple of a week, the number
of unit-periods per year shall be 52 divided by the number of weeks per unit-period. 
(v) If the unit-period is a year, the number of full unit-periods between two dates shall be the number of full years
(each equal to 12 months). 
(6) Symbols. 

The symbols used to express the terms of a transaction in the equation set forth in paragraph (b)(8) of this appendix
are defined as follows:

 

A

j

 = The amount of each periodic or lump-sum advance to the consumer under the reverse mortgage transaction. 
i = Percentage rate of the total loan cost per unit-period, expressed as a decimal equivalent. 
j = The number of unit-periods until the jth advance. 
n = The number of unit-periods between consummation and repayment of the debt. 
P

n

 = Min (Bal

n

, Val

n

). This is the maximum amount that the creditor can be repaid at the specified loan term. 
Bal

n

 = Loan balance at time of repayment, including all costs and fees incurred by the consumer (including any shared appreciation
or shared equity amount) compounded to time n at the creditor's contract rate of interest. 
Val

n

 = Val

0

 (1 + 

s

)

y

, where Val

0

 is the property value at consummation, is the assumed annual rate of appreciation for the dwelling, and y is the number
of years in the assumed term. Val

n

 must be reduced by the amount of any equity reserved for the consumer by agreement between the parties, or by 7 percent
(or the amount or percentage specified in the credit agreement), if the amount required to be repaid is limited to the
net proceeds of sale.



S

 = The summation operator.



Symbols used in the examples shown in this appendix are defined as follows: 



FV

x   

i = The future value of 1 per unit-period for x unit periods, first advance due immediately (at time = 0, which is consummation).










I = wi x 100 = the nominal total annual loan cost rate. 


(7) 

General equation. 

The total annual loan cost rate for a reverse mortgage transaction must be determined by first solving the following
formula, which sets forth the relationship between the advances to the consumer and the amount owed to the creditor
under the terms of the reverse mortgage agreement for the loan cost rate per unit-period (the loan cost rate per unit-period
is then multiplied by the number of unit-periods per year to obtain the total annual loan cost rate I; that is I = wi):











(8) 

Solution of general equation by iteration process.

 (i) The general equation in paragraph (b)(7) of this appendix, when applied to a simple transaction for a reverse mortgage
loan of equal monthly advances of $350 each, and with a total amount owed of $14,313.08 at an assumed repayment period
of two years, takes the special form: 










Using the iteration procedures found in steps 1 through 4 of (b)(9)(i) of Appendix J of this part, the total annual loan
cost rate, correct to two decimals, is 48.53%. 
(ii) In using these iteration procedures, it is expected that calculators or computers will be programmed to carry
all available decimals throughout the calculation and that enough iterations will be performed to make virtually
certain that the total annual loan cost rate obtained, when rounded to two decimals, is correct. Total annual loan
cost rates in the examples below were obtained by using a 10-digit programmable calculator and the iteration procedure
described in Appendix J to this part.

(9) 

Assumption for discretionary cash advances. 

If the consumer controls the timing of advances made after consummation (such as in a credit line arrangement), creditors
must use the general formula in paragraph (b)(7) of this appendix. The total annual loan cost rate shall be based on
the assumption that 50 percent of the principal loan amount is advanced at closing, or in the case of an open-end transaction,
at the time the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. Creditors shall assume the advances are made at the interest
rate then in effect and that no further advances are made to, or repayments made by, the consumer during the term of the
transaction or plan. 
(10) 

Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions. 

If the interest rate for a reverse mortgage transaction may increase during the loan term and the amount or timing is
not known at consummation, creditors shall base the disclosures on the initial interest rate in effect at the time
the disclosures are provided. 
(11) 

Assumption for closing costs. 

In calculating the total annual loan cost rate, creditors shall assume all closing and other consumer costs are financed
by the creditor. 
(c) 

Examples of total annual loan cost rate computations. 
(1) Lump-sum advance at consummation. 



Lump-sum advance to consumer at consummation: $30,000 
Total of consumer's loan costs financed at consummation: $4,500 
Estimated time of repayment (based on life expectancy of a consumer of age 78): 10 years 
Appraised value of dwelling at consummation: $100,000 
Assumed annual dwelling appreciation rate: 4% 



P

120

 = Min (109,441.32, 148,024.43) 










i = .010843293 
Total annual loan cost rate (100(.010843293 x 12)) = 13.01% 



(2) 

Monthly advance beginning at consummation. 



Monthly advance to consumer, beginning at consummation: $481.43 
Total of consumer's loan costs financed at consummation: $4,500 
Estimated time of repayment (based on life expectancy of a consumer of age 78): 10 years 
Appraised value of dwelling at consummation: $100,000 
Assumed annual dwelling appreciation rate: 8% 



P

120

 = Min (107,054.49, 215,892.50) 









i = .009383333 
Total annual loan cost rate (100(.009383333 x 12) = 11.26% 





(3) Lump sum advance at consummation and monthly advances thereafter. 



Lump sum advance to consumer at consummation: $10,725 
Monthly advance to consumer, beginning one month after consummation: $725.00 
Total of consumer's loan costs financed at consummation: $4,500 
Estimated time of repayment (based on life expectancy of a consumer of age 75): 12 years 
Appraised value of dwelling at consummation: $100,000 
Assumed annual dwelling appreciation rate: 8% 



P

144

 = Min (229,382.85, 251,817.01) 











i = .00806917958 
Total annual loan cost rate (100(.00806917958 x 12) = 9.68%

The cost of any reverse mortgage loan depends on how long you keep the loan and how much your house appreciates in value.
Generally, the longer you keep a reverse mortgage, the lower the cost of the loan is for you. 

This table shows the estimated cost of your reverse mortgage loan, expressed as an annual rate. It illustrates the
cost for three loan terms: 2 years, life expectancy for someone your age, and 1.4 times that life expectancy. The table
also shows the cost of the loan, assuming the value of your home appreciates at three different rates: 0%, 4% and 8%.


The total annual loan cost rates in this table are based on the total charges associated with this loan. These charges
typically include principal, interest, closing costs, mortgage insurance premiums, annuity costs, and servicing
costs (but not disposition costs_costs when you sell the home). 

The rates in this table are estimates. Your actual cost may differ if, for example, the amount of your loan advances
varies or the interest rate on your mortgage changes.

Securities and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Publication of list of rules scheduled for review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Securities and Exchange Commission is today publishing a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to Section 610 of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The list is published to provide the public with notice that these rules are scheduled
for review by the agency and to invite public comment on them.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') (Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1165 (September 19, 1980)) requires
that each agency review every ten years each of its rules that has a significant economic impact upon a substantial
number of small entities. The purpose of the review is ``to determine whether such rules should be continued without
change, or should be amended or rescinded * * * to minimize any significant economic impact of the rules
upon a substantial number of such small entities'' (5 USC 610(a)).




The RFA stipulates the following specific considerations that must be addressed in the review of each rule: (1) The
continued need for the rule; (2) the nature of complaints or comments received concerning the rule from the public;
(3) the complexity of the rule; (4) the extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates or conflicts with other Federal
rules, and, to the extent feasible, with State and local governmental rules; and (5) the length of time since the rule
has been evaluated or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area
affected by the rule (5 USC 610(c)).

<ACTION>

 Amendments to proposed regulations. 

 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains amendments to the proposed regulations under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (Code), relating to the disallowance of deductions for employee remuneration in excess of $1,000,000. The
proposed regulations, as amended, will provide guidance to taxpayers who must comply with section 162(m), which
was added to the Code by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Background 

 

This document contains amendments to the proposed Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code (Code). The proposed regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 20, 1993, at 58 FR 66310, with a correction published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 14, 1994, at 59 FR 5370. Additional guidance was provided under Notice 94-2, 1994-2 I.R.B.
25, and Notice 94-68, 1994-26 I.R.B. 1. In Notice 94-2, the IRS provided transition relief relating
to the requirement that a performance goal based on a period of service be ``preestablished.'' In Notice 94-68,
the IRS announced that the final regulations would provide similar relief on a permanent basis. Notice 94-68
also extended the transition period during which a corporation can treat disinterested directors as outside directors
until the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs on or after January 1, 1995.
Section 1.162-27(h)(2) of the proposed regulations defines a disinterested director as a director who is disinterested
within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(c)(2)(i) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (including the provisions
of Rule 16b-3(d)(3), as in effect on April 30, 1991). Under  1.162-27(h)(2), the transition rule
for disinterested directors originally was scheduled to expire upon the first meeting of shareholders at which directors
were to be elected that occurred after July 1, 1994. 

 These amendments provide guidance on the definition of the term ``outside director.'' The amendments also extend
the transition relief provided in Notice 94-68 until the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are
to be elected that occurs on or after January 1, 1996. Thus, corporations can treat disinterested directors as outside
directors until that first meeting of shareholders. Other modifications are also included that reflect a number
of the comments received on the December 1993 proposed regulations. The IRS and Treasury will continue to consider
comments previously received on the December 1993 proposed regulations on issues other than those addressed by these
amendments. 

 The December 1993 proposed regulations, as amended by these amendments, are generally intended to address broad
issues that are important to most taxpayers in complying with section 162(m) and, thus, are not comprehensive. To
the extent that an issue is not covered by the proposed regulations, as amended, taxpayers should follow a reasonable,
good faith interpretation of the statutory provisions.

Overview of Amendments 



Definition of Publicly Held Corporation 



Section 1.162-27(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed regulations defines a publicly held corporation to include an
affiliated group of corporations, as defined in section 1504 of the Code (determined without regard to section 1504(b)).
Because a subsidiary that is itself publicly held is subject to reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC),  1.162-27(c)(1)(ii) is amended to make clear that any publicly held subsidiary is
excluded from the affiliated group of its parent. Such a publicly held subsidiary, and its subsidiaries (if any),
are separately subject to section 162(m) and may comprise one or more separate affiliated groups of corporations.



 Thus, for example, if 85 percent of the stock of a subsidiary (S1) is owned by a parent (P) that is publicly held, and 15
percent is publicly traded, S1 is not considered a member of P's affiliated group for purposes of section 162(m). In
this case, S1 is treated as a separate publicly held corporation. If, in turn, S1 owns, for example, 100 percent of the
stock of another corporation, S2, then S2 is considered a member of S1's affiliated group, and not a member of P's affiliated
group. Conversely, P (and, for example, a 100 percent subsidiary of P) are not considered members of S1's affiliated
group. Thus, if P and S1 both pay compensation to the same covered employee, the compensation paid to the employee by
each is not aggregated with the compensation paid to the employee by the other. 



Definition of Compensation Committee 

 

Section 1.162-27(c)(4) provides that a compensation committee must have the authority to establish and administer
a ``performance-based compensation arrangement described in paragraph (e)(2).'' In order to clarify that, for
example, the entire board of directors may establish a plan, this section is amended to state more narrowly that a compensation
committee must have the authority to establish and administer ``performance goals described in paragraph (e)(2).''


 

Preestablished Performance Goal 

 

Section 1.162-27(e)(2)(i) and 

Example 1

 under  1.162-27(e)(2)(vii) are amended to conform to the definition of ``preestablished'' provided
in Notice 94-68. As amended,  1.162-27(e)(2)(i) now provides that a performance goal is considered
preestablished if it is established in writing by the compensation committee not later than 90 days after the commencement
of the period of service to which the performance goal relates, provided that the outcome is substantially uncertain.
However, in no event will a performance goal be considered preestablished if it is established after 25 percent of
the period of service (as scheduled in good faith at the time the goal is established) has elapsed. 

 

The ``Substantially Uncertain'' Requirement 

 

Commentators have requested additional guidance as to when a performance goal is ``substantially uncertain.''
While this determination remains essentially factual in nature, two examples have been added to the proposed regulations
under  1.162-27(e)(2)(vii). Under new 

Example 2,

 it is concluded that a performance goal based on a percentage of total sales is not substantially uncertain because
some sales are a virtual certainty. New 

Example 3,

 however, illustrates that a performance goal based on corporate profitability is substantially uncertain, even
for companies with a history of profitability.

Awards Based on a Percentage of Salary 



Commentators have raised the question whether a compensation formula based on a percentage of salary or base pay involves
impermissible discretion to increase the amount payable under the formula upon attainment of the goal because, by
increasing salary, the amount payable may be increased after the goal has been established. Section 1.162-27(e)(2)(iii)
has been amended to provide that, if the terms of an objective formula or standard fail to preclude discretion merely
because the amount of compensation to be paid upon the attainment of the performance goal is based, in whole or in part,
on a percentage of salary or base pay, the objective formula or standard will not be considered discretionary (and
thus  1.162-27(e)(2)(iii) will not be violated) if the maximum dollar amount to be paid is fixed at the
time the performance goal is established. 

Of course, a formula or standard based on salary or base pay might fail to meet the requirements of  1.162-27(e)(2)(iii)
for reasons other than the fact that the formula or standard is based on salary or base pay. If that is the case, the relief
described in the preceding paragraph will not prevent the performance goal from failing to meet the requirements
of  1.162-27(e)(2). A conforming amendment has been made to  1.162-27(e)(4)(i) to provide
that, when the amount to be paid is based on a percentage of salary or base pay, the material terms of a performance goal
that must be disclosed to shareholders include the maximum dollar amount that could be paid. 



Earnings on Deferred Performance-Based Compensation 



In the case of a deferral of a payment of compensation beyond the date on which it would otherwise be payable,  1.162-27(e)(2)(iii)(B)
provides that an increase in the amount of the compensation is not treated as an increase in the amount payable under
the performance goal if the increase in compensation is based on a reasonable rate of interest. (Of course, this rule
assumes there is no constructive receipt of the compensation at the time it is deferred.) Commentators have asked
whether this deferral rule also applies to increases in compensation that are determined on reasonable bases other
than by reference to a rate of interest. The purpose of the rule is generally to permit a reasonable adjustment in the
amount of compensation to account for the delay in payment. Consequently, the rule is amended to permit the adjustment
to be based on the actual rate of return on a predetermined investment (including any decrease as well as any increase
in the value of an investment) during the deferral period (whether or not assets associated with the amount originally
owed are actually invested therein). New Examples 14, 15, and 16 have been added to illustrate the application of this
rule. 



Impact of Corporate Transactions on Performance Goals 



Section 1.162-27(e)(2)(vi) provides that compensation attributable to a stock option or stock appreciation
right does not fail to be performance-based to the extent that a change in the grant or award is made to reflect changes
in corporate capitalization. In response to commentators' suggestions that this relief for changes in corporate
capitalization be expanded, the current provision has been expanded to apply to all stock-based compensation, not
only to stock options and stock appreciation rights. Thus, the provision has been moved to new  1.162-27(e)(2)(iii)(C).
In addition, new Example 13 in  1.162-27(e)(2)(vii) indicates that the adjustment of a performance goal
to reflect a change in accounting standards will not be considered an exercise of impermissible discretion, provided
that the adjustment is made pursuant to the terms of the plan or arrangement. 



Clarification of Rule Viewing All Plans and Agreements in the Aggregate 



Section 1.162-27(e)(2)(iv) provides that all plans, arrangements, and agreements that provide for compensation
to an employee will be taken into account for purposes of determining whether, under the facts and circumstances,
compensation is only nominally or partially contingent on attainment of a performance goal. Compensation is only
nominally or partially contingent on attainment of a performance goal if the employee will receive all or part of the
compensation regardless of whether the performance goal is attained. Section 1.162-27(e)(2)(v) provides
that the determination of whether compensation satisfies the requirements of  1.162-27(e)(2), and
thus is performance-based, is made on a grant-by-grant basis.

In order to clarify how these two provisions apply and work together, the sequence of the two provisions has been reversed
and minor revisions have been made. These changes are intended to clarify that the grant-by-grant rule is the general
rule under which compensation arrangements are tested for purposes of determining whether they are performance-based.
Thus, whether a compensation arrangement is performance-based is generally determined without regard to other
compensation arrangements. The changes make clear that the aggregation rule requiring all plans, arrangements,
and agreements providing compensation to an employee to be taken into account is a limited exception to the general
grant-by-grant rule, and applies only for the purpose of determining whether the employee would receive, regardless
of whether the performance goal is attained, compensation that purports to be performance-based. Thus, for example,
if payment under a nonperformance-based compensation arrangement is contingent upon the failure to attain a performance
goal under an otherwise performance-based arrangement, neither arrangement provides for compensation that is
performance-based. 

The amendments also provide that, if a plan providing for performance-based restricted stock also provides for the
payment of dividends on the stock prior to the attainment of the performance goal, the restricted stock and the dividends
will be considered separate grants, and the payment of dividends will not ``taint'' the performance-based character
of the restricted stock. 



Outside Directors 



Under  1.162-27(e)(3)(i)(D), an outside director is one who does not receive remuneration, either directly
or indirectly, in any capacity other than as a director. Remuneration for this purpose includes any payment in exchange
for goods or services. Remuneration is deemed to be paid to a director if it is paid to the director personally, to an
entity in which the director has a beneficial ownership interest of greater than 50 percent, or (if more than de minimis
remuneration) to an entity by which the director is employed or in which the director has a beneficial ownership interest
of at least five percent but not more than 50 percent. See  1.162-27(e)(3)(ii). 

Remuneration is de minimis for this purpose if, during the publicly held corporation's preceding taxable year, payments
to the entity did not exceed the lesser of $60,000 or five percent of the entity's gross income for the entity's taxable
year ending with or within the publicly held corporation's taxable year. See  1.162-27(e)(3)(iii).


Commentators have asserted that the $60,000 limit of the de minimis rule may be unrealistically low in cases where
goods or certain types of services are purchased from entities that employ their directors. Thus, under the proposed
amendments, the $60,000 de minimis limit applies only if the payment to the entity employing the director is remuneration
for personal services or if the director is a five-percent-or-more owner of the entity. In addition, the proposed
amendments clarify that a director of an entity will not be considered employed or self-employed by that entity solely
on account of services as a director of the entity. 

Under new  1.162-27(e)(3)(iv), remuneration is not for personal services unless two requirements are
satisfied. First, the remuneration must be paid to an entity for personal or professional services, consisting of
legal, accounting, investment banking, and management consulting services (and other similar services that may
be specified by the Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue
Bulletin), performed for the publicly held corporation. For this purpose, remuneration for personal services that
are incidental to the purchase of goods or nonpersonal services are not taken into account. Second, the director must
perform significant services (whether or not as an employee) for the corporation, division, or similar organization
(within the entity) that actually provides the personal services described above to the publicly held corporation,
or more than 50 percent of the entity's gross revenues must be derived from the personal-service-providing organization.

New 

Examples 5, 6, 

and 

7 

are added to  1.162-27(e)(3)(ix) to clarify the revised rules on de minimis remuneration. Other clarifying
amendments have been made to the outside director rules. New  1.162-27(e)(3)(v) clarifies the definition
of the term ``entity.'' Section 1.162-27(e)(3)(ii)(A) and new Examples 3 and 4 under  1.162-27(e)(3)(ix)
make clear that directors are not outside directors if they receive any indirect personal remuneration from the publicly
held corporation. 
Section 1.162-27(e)(3)(ii)(A) further provides that remuneration described in that section is considered
paid when actually paid (and throughout the remainder of that taxable year of the publicly held corporation) and,
if earlier, throughout the period when a contract or agreement to pay remuneration is outstanding. New 

Example 4

 illustrates this rule. By contrast,  1.162-27(e)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) are amended to provide that remuneration
described in those sections is considered paid when it is actually paid or, if earlier, when the publicly held corporation
becomes liable to pay it. Thus, for example, if a publicly held corporation becomes liable in 1998 to pay more than de
minimis remuneration to an entity, but agrees with the entity to defer payment of that remuneration until 1999, the
remuneration would be taken into account for purposes of  1.162-27(e)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) only in 1998
when the corporation became liable to pay it. Also, under  1.162-27(e)(3)(iii), the five percent de minimis
rule is amended to focus on the entity's gross revenue instead of its gross income. Finally, in order to clarify the
application of the outside director rules to affiliated groups, new  1.162-27(e)(3)(viii) provides
that the outside directors of the publicly held member of an affiliated group are treated as the outside directors
of all members of the affiliated group. 


``Key Employees'' as a Description of a Class of Eligible Employees


Section 1.162-27(e)(4)(ii) provides a nonexclusive list of classes of employees that constitute sufficient
disclosure of employees eligible to receive performance-based compensation. The proposed regulations are amended
to add ``key employees'' to the list. 


Shareholder Approval


Under  1.162-27(e)(4)(i), the material terms of the performance goal under which compensation is to
be paid must be disclosed to and subsequently approved by shareholders. The proposed amendments make explicit the
requirement that disclosure and shareholder approval must occur before the compensation is paid. Of course, disclosure
and shareholder approval need not occur during the period within which the compensation committee is required to
establish the performance goal. 
Under  1.162-27(e)(4)(vii), the material terms of a performance goal are considered approved by shareholders
if, in a separate vote, affirmative votes are cast by a majority of the voting shares. In order to reflect the fact that
certain shares may have more than one vote, and to properly deal with abstentions, that section is amended to provide
that the material terms of a performance goal are considered approved by shareholders if, in a separate vote, a majority
of the votes cast on the issue (including abstentions to the extent abstentions are counted as voting under applicable
state law) are cast in favor of approval. 
In addition, in order to clarify the application of the shareholder approval requirements to affiliated groups,
new  1.162-27(e)(4)(viii) provides that the shareholders of the publicly held member of an affiliated
group are treated as the shareholders of all members of the affiliated group. For example, if one of the five covered
employees of an affiliated group is an employee of a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly held parent corporation,
the shareholders of the parent would be required to approve the performance-based compensation of that covered employee
along with that of the four covered employees who are employees of the publicly held parent. 


Private to Public Exception 


Under  1.162-27(f), the $1 million deduction limit does not apply to any compensation plan or agreement
that existed during a period in which a corporation was not publicly held, to the extent that the prospectus accompanying
the initial public offering disclosed information concerning those plans or agreements that satisfied all applicable
securities laws then in effect. Several commentators have asked whether the exemption should apply in perpetuity
to plans or agreements that existed before the corporation became public. Other comments have suggested that the
exemption be extended to corporations that are spun off from publicly held corporations.

The IRS and Treasury believe that abuse could occur if the ``private to public'' exemption from the normally applicable
rules were of unlimited duration. Accordingly, new  1.162-27(f)(2) provides that the exemption will
apply for the duration of a reliance period that lasts until the earliest of the expiration or material modification
of the plan or agreement; the issuance of all employer stock or other compensation that has been allocated under the
plan; or the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected that occurs after the close of the third calendar
year following the calendar year in which the initial public offering occurs. A taxpayer may rely on this exemption
for any compensation received pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right, or the substantial
vesting of restricted property, if the grant (as opposed to the exercise or the substantial vesting) occurs before
the close of the reliance period. 
The IRS and Treasury have decided that the ``private to public'' exemption should not apply to a subsidiary of a publicly
held corporation, where the subsidiary has been spun off or has otherwise become a separate publicly held corporation.
This is because those subsidiary corporations are considered to be publicly held before the spinoff under the affiliated
group rule of  1.162-27(c)(ii). However, the IRS and Treasury recognize that it may be difficult to obtain
shareholder approval of otherwise performance-based compensation in some of these situations. 
Accordingly, new  1.162-27(f)(3) provides alternative rules for satisfying the requirements for performance-based
compensation in the context of a spinoff or similar situations. The first alternative prescribes the method for applying
the existing rules to satisfy the performance-based compensation requirements for compensation paid after a spinoff
(or similar transaction) pursuant to a plan or arrangement established before the spinoff (or similar transaction).
The second alternative provides relief from the shareholder approval requirement during a transition period that
ends with the first regularly scheduled meeting of the shareholders of the new publicly held corporation that occurs
more than 12 months after the date on which the corporation becomes a separate publicly held corporation. This alternative
may be necessary where shareholder approval of compensation is not obtained before the spinoff. 


Earnings on Deferred Compensation Payable Under a Binding Written Contract


Section 1.162-27(h)(1)(iii)(B) is amended to conform to changes made to  1.162-27(e)(2)(iii)(B)
(with respect to permissible increases in the amount of compensation where payment of compensation has been deferred).



Special Transition Rule for Outside Directors


Section 1.162-27(h)(2) is amended to extend the transition relief for the treatment of disinterested directors
(as defined in  1.162-27(h)(2)) as outside directors until the first meeting of shareholders at which
directors are to be elected that occurs on or after January 1, 1996. Thus, for example, if disinterested directors
establish a bonus plan (that satisfies the performance-based compensation requirements of  1.162-27(e)(2))
for 1996 before that first shareholders meeting, and the plan is approved by shareholders at that meeting, payments
under the plan will satisfy the performance-based-compensation requirements if the compensation committee comprised
of the new outside directors certifies that the performance goals have been satisfied prior to payment of the bonuses.

Special Transition Rule for Previously-Approved Plans 



The proposed amendments modify  1.162-27(h)(3)(i) to clarify that, in order for a plan to qualify under
the special transition rule for previously-approved plans, the disinterested directors need only administer the
plan (and need not also establish it). 



Reliance Period for Special Transition Rule for Previously-Approved Plans 



Section 1.162-27(h)(3)(ii) provides that the reliance period that applies to the transition rule for previously-approved
plans under  1.162-27(h)(3)(i) ends upon the earliest of the expiration or material modification of
the plan or agreement, the issuance of all employer stock or other compensation that has been allocated under the plan,
or the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs after December 31, 1996. Questions
have been raised as to whether, under this provision, and under the example provided, the deductions attributable
to stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted property must be taken within the paragraph (h)(3)(ii)
reliance period in order to take advantage of the transition relief. This was not the intention of the IRS or Treasury.
Accordingly, this provision and the related example are amended to provide that stock options, stock appreciation
rights, and restricted property need only be granted before the end of the reliance period. 



Proposed Effective Date 



Except as otherwise provided, these amendments are proposed to be effective for any payment that would be deductible
for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Later effective dates are proposed for several of the amendments
under  1.162-27(i)(2). 



Special Analysis 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5)
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking
will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact
on small business. 



Comments and Requests for Public Hearing 



Before adopting these amendments to the proposed regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
that are submitted timely (preferably 8 copies) to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be held upon written request to the Commissioner by any person
who has submitted written comments. If a public hearing is held, notice of the time and place will be published in the


Federal Register

. 



Drafting information 



The principal authors of the amendments to the proposed regulations are Charles T. Deliee and Robert Misner, Office
of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from
IRS and the Treasury Department participated in their development.

(4) 

Compensation Committee. 

The 

compensation committee 

means the committee of directors (including any subcommittee of directors) of the publicly held corporation that
has the authority to establish and administer performance goals described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and
to certify that performance goals are attained, as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. A committee of directors
is not treated as failing to have the authority to establish performance goals merely because the goals are ratified
by the board of directors of the publicly held corporation or, if applicable, any other committee of the board of directors.
See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules concerning the composition of the compensation committee. 



* * * * * 



(e) * * * 

(2) * * * (i) * * * A performance goal is considered preestablished if it is established
in writing by the compensation committee not later than 90 days after the commencement of the period of service to which
the performance goal relates, provided that the outcome is substantially uncertain at the time the compensation
committee actually establishes the goal. However, in no event will a performance goal be considered to be preestablished
if it is established after 25 percent of the period of service (as scheduled in good faith at the time the goal is established)
has elapsed. * * * 



* * * * * 



(iii) * * * (A) * * * If the terms of an objective formula or standard fail to preclude
discretion to increase the amount of compensation merely because the amount of compensation to be paid upon attainment
of the performance goal is based, in whole or in part, on a percentage of salary or base pay, the objective formula or
standard will not be considered discretionary for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) if the maximum dollar amount
to be paid is fixed at the time the performance goal is established. 

(B) If compensation is payable upon or after the attainment of a performance goal, and a change is made to accelerate
the payment of compensation to an earlier date after the attainment of the goal, the change will be treated as an increase
in the amount of compensation, unless the amount of compensation paid is discounted to reasonably reflect the time
value of money. If compensation is payable upon or after the attainment of a performance goal, and a change is made to
defer the payment of compensation to a later date, any amount paid in excess of the amount that was originally owed to
the employee will not be treated as an increase in the amount of compensation if the additional amount is based either
on a reasonable rate of interest or on one or more predetermined actual investments (whether or not assets associated
with the amount originally owed are actually invested therein) such that the amount payable by the employer at the
later date will be based on the actual rate of return of a specific investment (including any decrease as well as any
increase in the value of an investment). If compensation is payable in the form of property, a change in the timing of
the transfer of that property after the attainment of the goal will not be treated as an increase in the amount of compensation
for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii). Thus, for example, if the terms of a stock grant provide for stock to be
transferred after the attainment of a performance goal and the transfer of the stock also is subject to a vesting schedule,
a change in the vesting schedule that either accelerates or defers the transfer of stock will not be treated as an increase
in the amount of compensation payable under the performance goal. 

(C) Compensation attributable to a stock option, stock appreciation right, or other stock-based compensation does
not fail to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) to the extent that a change in the grant or award is made
to reflect a change in corporate capitalization, such as a stock split or dividend, or a corporate transaction, such
as any merger of a corporation into another corporation, any consolidation of two or more corporations into another
corporation, any separation of a corporation (including a spinoff or other distribution of stock or property by a
corporation), any reorganization of a corporation (whether or not such reorganization comes within the definition
of such term in section 368), or any partial or complete liquidation by a corporation.

(iv) 

Grant-by-grant determination. 

The determination of whether compensation satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) generally shall
be made on a grant-by-grant basis. Thus, for example, whether compensation attributable to a stock option grant satisfies
the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) generally is determined on the basis of the particular grant made and without
regard to the terms of any other option grant, or other grant of compensation, to the same or another employee. In addition,
whether a restricted stock grant satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) is determined without regard
to whether dividends on the restricted stock are payable prior to the attainment of the performance goal. 

(v) 

Compensation contingent upon attainment of performance goal. 

Compensation does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) if the facts and circumstances indicate
that the employee would receive all or part of the compensation regardless of whether the performance goal is attained.
Thus, if the payment of compensation under a grant or award is only nominally or partially contingent on attaining
a performance goal, none of the compensation payable under the grant or award will be considered performance-based.
For example, if an employee is entitled to a bonus under either of two arrangements, where payment under a nonperformance-based
arrangement is contingent upon the failure to attain the performance goals under an otherwise performance-based
arrangement, then neither arrangement provides for compensation that satisfies the requirements of this paragraph
(e)(2). Compensation does not fail to be qualified performance-based compensation merely because the plan allows
the compensation to be payable upon death, disability, or change of ownership or control, although compensation
actually paid on account of those events prior to the attainment of the performance goal would not satisfy the requirements
of this paragraph (e)(2). As an exception to the general rule set forth in the first sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(iv)
of this section, the facts-and-circumstances determination referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
(e)(2)(v) is made taking into account all plans, arrangements, and agreements that provide for compensation to the
employee. 


* * * * * 


(vii) * * * 





Example 1. 

No later than 90 days after the start of a fiscal year, but while the outcome is substantially uncertain, Corporation
S establishes a bonus plan under which A, the chief executive officer, will receive a cash bonus of $500,000, if year-end
corporate sales are increased by at least 5 percent. * * * 


Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1, 

except that the bonus is based on a percentage of the Corporation's total sales for the fiscal year. Because Corporation
S is virtually certain to have some sales for the fiscal year, the outcome of the performance goal is not substantially
uncertain, and therefore the bonus does not meet the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2). 


Example 3. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1, 

except that the bonus is based on a percentage of the Corporation's total profits for the fiscal year. Although some
sales are virtually certain for virtually all public companies, it is substantially uncertain whether a company
will have profits for a specified future period even if the company has a history of profitability. Therefore, the
bonus will meet the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2).

Example 6. 

* * * If both the earnings-per-share goal and the stock-price goal are preestablished, the compensation
committee's discretion to choose to pay a bonus under either of the two goals does not cause any bonus paid under the
plan to fail to meet the requirement of this paragraph (e)(2) because each goal independently meets the requirements
of this paragraph (e)(2). * * * 


* * * * * 




Example 13. 

Corporation W adopts a plan under which a bonus will be paid to the CEO only if there is a 10% increase in earnings per share
during the performance period. The plan provides that earnings per share will be calculated without regard to any
change in accounting standards that may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board after the goal is
established. After the goal is established, such a change in accounting standards occurs. Corporation W's reported
earnings, for purposes of determining earnings per share under the plan, are adjusted pursuant to this plan provision
to factor out this change in standards. This adjustment will not be considered an exercise of impermissible discretion
because it is made pursuant to the plan provision. 


Example 14. 

Corporation X adopts a performance-based incentive pay plan with a four-year performance period. Bonuses under
the plan are scheduled to be paid in the first year after the end of the performance period (year 5). However, in the second
year of the performance period, the compensation committee determines that any bonuses payable in year 5 will instead,
for bona fide business reasons, be paid in year 10. The compensation committee also determines that any compensation
that would have been payable in year 5 will be adjusted to reflect the delay in payment. The adjustment will be based
on the greater of the future rate of return of a specified mutual fund that invests in blue chip stocks or of a specified
venture capital investment over the five-year deferral period. Each of these investments, considered by itself,
is a predetermined actual investment because it is based on the future rate of return of an actual investment. However,
the adjustment in this case is not based on predetermined actual investments within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B)
of this section because the amount payable by Corporation X in year 10 will be based on the greater of the two investment
returns and, thus, will not be based on the actual rate of return on either specific investment. 


Example 15. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 14, 

except that the increase will be based on the rate of return of Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield over the five-year
deferral period. Because this index reflects a reasonable rate of interest, the increase in the compensation payable
that is based on the index's rate of return is not considered an impermissible increase in the amount of compensation
payable under the formula. 



Example 16. 

The facts are the same as in Example 14, except that the increase will be based on the rate of return for the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index. This index does not measure interest rates and thus does not represent a reasonable rate of interest.
In addition, this index does not represent an actual investment. Therefore, any additional compensation payable
based on the rate of return of this index will result in an impermissible increase in the amount payable under the formula.
If, in contrast, the increase were based on the rate of return of an existing mutual fund that is invested in a manner
that seeks to approximate the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the increase would be based on a predetermined actual
investment within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section and thus would not result in an impermissible
increase in the amount payable under the formula. 



(3) * * * (i) * * * 
(D) Does not receive remuneration from the publicly held corporation, either directly or indirectly, in any capacity
other than as a director. For this purpose, remuneration includes any payment in exchange for goods or services. 
(ii) 

Remuneration received. 

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), remuneration is received, directly or indirectly, by a director in each of
the following circumstances: 
(A) If remuneration is paid, directly or indirectly, to the director personally or to an entity in which the director
has a beneficial ownership interest of greater than 50 percent. For this purpose, remuneration is considered paid
when actually paid (and throughout the remainder of that taxable year of the corporation) and, if earlier, throughout
the period when a contract or agreement to pay remuneration is outstanding. 
(B) If remuneration, other than de minimis remuneration, was paid by the publicly held corporation in its preceding
taxable year to an entity in which the director has a beneficial ownership interest of at least 5 percent but not more
than 50 percent. For this purpose, remuneration is considered paid when actually paid or, if earlier, when the publicly
held corporation becomes liable to pay it. 
(C) If remuneration, other than de minimis remuneration, was paid by the publicly held corporation in its preceding
taxable year to an entity by which the director is employed or self-employed other than as a director. For this purpose,
remuneration is considered paid when actually paid or, if earlier, when the publicly held corporation becomes liable
to pay it. 
(iii) 

De minimis remuneration_

(A) 

In general. 

For purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, remuneration that was paid by the publicly held
corporation in its preceding taxable year to an entity is de minimis if payments to the entity did not exceed 5 percent
of the gross revenue of the entity for its taxable year ending with or within that preceding taxable year of the publicly
held corporation. 
(B) 

Remuneration for personal services and substantial owners. 

Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, remuneration in excess of $60,000 is not de minimis if
the remuneration is paid to an entity described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, or is paid for personal
services to an entity described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.

(iv) 

Remuneration for personal services. 

For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, remuneration from a publicly held corporation is for personal
services if_
(A) The remuneration is paid to an entity for personal or professional services, consisting of legal, accounting,
investment banking, and management consulting services (and other similar services that may be specified by the
Commissioner in revenue rulings, notices, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin), performed
for the publicly held corporation, and the remuneration is not for services that are incidental to the purchase of
goods or to the purchase of services that are not personal services; and 
(B) The director performs significant services (whether or not as an employee) for the corporation, division, or
similar organization (within the entity) that actually provides the services described in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A)
of this section to the publicly held corporation, or more than 50 percent of the entity's gross revenues (for the entity's
preceding taxable year) are derived from that corporation, subsidiary, or similar organization. 
(v) 

Entity defined. 

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the term entity means an organization that is a sole proprietorship, trust,
estate, partnership, or corporation. The term entity also includes an affiliated group of corporations as defined
in section 1504 (determined without regard to section 1504(b)) and a group of organizations that would be an affiliated
group but for the fact that one or more of the organizations are not incorporated. However, the aggregation rules referred
to in the preceding sentence do not apply for purposes of determining whether a director has a beneficial ownership
interest of at least 5 percent or greater than 50 percent. 


* * * * * 


(viii) 

Members of affiliated groups. 

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the outside directors of the publicly held member of an affiliated group are
treated as the outside directors of all members of the affiliated group. 
(ix) * * * 





Example 2. 

Corporation Z, a calendar-year taxpayer, uses the services of a law firm by which B is employed, but in which B has a less-than-5-percent
ownership interest. The law firm reports income on a July 1 to June 30 basis. Corporation Z appoints B to serve on its
compensation committee for calendar year 1998 after determining that, in calendar year 1997, it did not become liable
to the law firm for remuneration exceeding the lesser of $60,000 or five percent of the law firm's gross revenue (calculated
for the year ending June 30, 1997). On October 1, 1998, Corporation Z becomes liable to pay remuneration of $50,000
to the law firm on June 30, 1999. For the year ending June 30, 1998, the law firm's gross revenue was less than $1 million.
Thus, in calendar year 1999, B is not an outside director. However, B may satisfy the requirements for an outside director
in calendar year 2000, if, in calendar year 1999, Corporation Z does not become liable to the law firm for additional
remuneration. This is because the remuneration actually paid on June 30, 1999 was considered paid on October 1, 1998
under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. 


Example 3. 

Corporation Z, a publicly held corporation, purchases goods from Corporation A. D, an executive and less-than-5-percent
owner of Corporation A, sits on the board of directors of Corporation Z and on its compensation committee. For 1997,
Corporation Z obtains representations to the effect that D is not eligible for any commission for D's sales to Corporation
Z and that, for purposes of determining D's compensation for 1997, Corporation A's sales to Corporation Z are not otherwise
treated differently than sales to other customers of Corporation A (including its affiliates, if any) or are irrelevant.
In addition, Corporation Z has no reason to believe that these representations are inaccurate or that it is otherwise
paying remuneration indirectly to D personally. Thus, in 1997, no remuneration is considered paid by Corporation
Z indirectly to D personally under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. 


Example 4. 

(i) Corporation W, a publicly held corporation, purchases goods from Corporation T. C, an executive and less-than-5-percent
owner of Corporation T, sits on the board of directors of Corporation W and on its compensation committee. Corporation
T develops a new product and agrees on January 1, 1998 to pay C a bonus of $500,000 if Corporation W contracts to purchase
the product. Even if Corporation W purchases the new product, sales to Corporation W will represent less than 5 percent
of Corporation T's gross revenues. In 1999, Corporation W contracts to purchase the new product and, in 2000, C receives
the $500,000 bonus from Corporation T. In 1998, 1999, and 2000, Corporation W does not obtain any representations
relating to indirect remuneration to C personally (such as the representations described in Example 3). 
(ii) Thus, in 1998, 1999, and 2000, remuneration is considered paid by Corporation W indirectly to C personally under
paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, in 1998, 1999, and 2000, C is not an outside director of Corporation
W. The result would have been the same if Corporation W had obtained appropriate representations but nevertheless
had reason to believe that it was paying remuneration indirectly to C personally.

Example 5. 

Corporation R, a publicly held corporation, purchases utility service from Corporation Q, a public utility. The
chief executive officer, and less-than-5-percent owner, of Corporation Q is a director of Corporation R. Corporation
R pays Corporation Q more than $60,000 per year for the utility service, but less than 5 percent of Corporation Q's gross
revenues. Because utility services are not personal services, the fees paid are not subject to the $60,000 de minimis
rule for remuneration for personal services within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Thus,
the chief executive officer qualifies as an outside director of Corporation R, unless disqualified on some other
basis. 


Example 6. 

Corporation A, a publicly held corporation, purchases management consulting services from Division S of Conglomerate
P. The chief financial officer of Division S is a director of Corporation A. Corporation A pays more than $60,000 per
year for the management consulting services, but less than 5 percent of Conglomerate P's gross revenues. Because
management consulting services are personal services within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section,
and the chief financial officer performs significant services for Division S, the fees paid are subject to the $60,000
de minimis rule as remuneration for personal services. Thus, the chief financial officer does not qualify as an outside
director of Corporation A. 


Example 7. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 6

, except that the chief executive officer, and less-than-5-percent owner, of the parent company of Conglomerate
P is a director of Corporation A and does not perform significant services for Division S. If the gross revenues of Division
S do not constitute more than 50 percent of the gross revenues of Conglomerate P for P's preceding taxable year, the
chief executive officer will qualify as an outside director of Corporation A, unless disqualified on some other basis.




(4) 

Shareholder approval requirement

_(i) 

General rule. 

The material terms of the performance goal under which the compensation is to be paid must be disclosed to and subsequently
approved by the shareholders of the publicly held corporation before the compensation is paid. The requirements
of this paragraph (e)(4) are not satisfied if the compensation would be paid regardless of whether the material terms
are approved by shareholders. The material terms include the employees eligible to receive compensation; a description
of the business criteria on which the performance goal is based; and either the maximum amount of compensation that
could be paid to any employee or the formula used to calculate the amount of compensation to be paid to the employee if
the performance goal is attained (except that, in the case of a formula based, in whole or in part, on a percentage of
salary or base pay, the maximum dollar amount of compensation that could be paid to the employee must be disclosed).

(ii) * * * A general description of the class of eligible employees by title or class is sufficient, such as 

the chief executive officer and vice presidents, 

or 

all salaried employees, all executive officers, 

or 

all key employees. 


* * * * * 


(vii) Shareholder vote. 

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the material terms of a performance goal are approved by shareholders if, in
a separate vote, a majority of the votes cast on the issue (including abstentions to the extent abstentions are counted
as voting under applicable state law) are cast in favor of approval. 
(viii) 

Members of affiliated group. 

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the shareholders of the publicly held member of the affiliated group are treated
as the shareholders of all members of the affiliated group. 


* * * * * 


(f) 

Companies that become publicly held, spinoffs, and similar transactions_

(1) 

In general. 

In the case of a corporation that was not a publicly held corporation and then becomes a publicly held corporation,
the deduction limit of paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to any remuneration paid pursuant to a compensation
plan or agreement that existed during the period in which the corporation was not publicly held, to the extent that
the prospectus accompanying the initial public offering disclosed information concerning those plans or agreements
that satisfied all applicable securities laws then in effect. In accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section,
a corporation that is a member of an affiliated group that includes a publicly held corporation is considered publicly
held and, therefore, cannot rely on this paragraph (f)(1).

(2) 

Reliance period.

 Paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be relied upon until the earliest of_ 


 (i) The expiration of the plan or agreement; 


 (ii) The material modification of the plan or agreement, within the meaning of paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section;



 (iii) The issuance of all employer stock or other compensation that has been allocated under the plan; or 


 (iv) The first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs after the close of the third
calendar year following the calendar year in which the initial public offering occurs. 


 (3) 

Stock-based compensation.

 Paragraph (f)(1) of this section will apply to any compensation received pursuant to the exercise of a stock option
or stock appreciation right, or the substantial vesting of restricted property, granted under a plan or agreement
described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section if the grant occurs before the earliest of the dates specified in paragraph
(f)(2) of this section. 


 (4) 

Subsidiaries that become separate publicly held corporations

_(i) 

In general.

 If a subsidiary that is a member of the affiliated group described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section becomes
a separate publicly held corporation (whether by spinoff or otherwise), any remuneration paid to covered employees
of the new publicly held corporation will satisfy the exception for performance-based compensation described in
paragraph (e) of this section if the conditions in either paragraph (f)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section are satisfied.



 (ii) 

Prior establishment and approval.

 The remuneration satisfies the requirements for performance-based compensation set forth in paragraphs (e)(2),
(3), and (4) of this section (by application of paragraphs (e)(3)(viii) and (e)(4)(viii) of this section) before
the corporation becomes a separate publicly held corporation, and the certification required by paragraph (e)(5)
of this section is made by the compensation committee of the new publicly held corporation (but if the performance
goals are attained before the corporation becomes a separate publicly held corporation, the certification may be
made before it becomes a separate publicly held corporation by the compensation committee referred to in paragraph
(e)(3)(viii) of this section). Thus, this paragraph (f)(4)(ii) requires that the outside directors and shareholders
(within the meaning of paragraphs (e)(3)(viii) and (e)(4)(viii) of this section) of the corporation before it becomes
a separate publicly held corporation establish and approve, respectively, the performance-based compensation
for the covered employees of the new publicly held corporation in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this
section. 


 (iii) 

Transition period.

 The remuneration satisfies all of the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2), (3), and (5) of this section. The outside
directors (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section) of the corporation before it becomes a separate
publicly held corporation, or the outside directors of the new publicly held corporation, may establish and administer
the performance goals for the covered employees of the new publicly held corporation for purposes of satisfying the
requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section. The certification required by paragraph (e)(5) of this
section must be made by the compensation committee of the new publicly held corporation. However, a taxpayer may rely
on this paragraph (f)(4)(iii) to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section only for compensation
paid, or stock options, stock appreciation rights, or restricted property granted, prior to the first regularly
scheduled meeting of the shareholders of the new publicly held corporation that occurs more than 12 months after the
date the corporation becomes a separate publicly held corporation. Compensation paid, or stock options, stock appreciation
rights, or restricted property granted, on or after the date of that meeting of shareholders must satisfy all requirements
of paragraph (e) of this section, including the shareholder approval requirement of paragraph (e)(4) of this section,
in order to satisfy the requirements for performance-based compensation. 


 (5) 

Example.

 The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section:

 


 


Example.

 Corporation P, which is publicly held, decides to spin off Corporation S, a wholly owned subsidiary of Corporation
P. After the spinoff, Corporation S will be a separate publicly held corporation. Before the spinoff, the compensation
committee of Corporation P, pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section, establishes a bonus plan for the
executives of Corporation S that provides for bonuses payable after the spinoff and that satisfies the requirements
of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If, pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(viii) of this section, the shareholders of
Corporation P approve the plan prior to the spinoff, that approval will satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(4)
of this section with respect to compensation paid pursuant to the bonus plan after the spinoff. However, the compensation
committee of Corporation S will be required to certify that the goals are satisfied prior to the payment of the bonuses
in order for the bonuses to be considered performance-based compensation.

(whether or not assets associated with the amount originally owed are actually invested therein) such that the amount
payable by the employer at the later date will be based on the actual rate of return of a specific investment (including
any decrease as well as any increase in the value of an investment). 



* * * * * 


 

(2) 

Special transition rule for outside directors.

 A director who is a disinterested director is treated as satisfying the requirements of an outside director under
paragraph (e)(3) of this section until the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that
occurs on or after January 1, 1996. *

In general.

 Any compensation paid under a plan or agreement approved by shareholders before December 20, 1993, is treated as satisfying
the requirements of paragraphs (e) (3) and (4) of this section, provided that the directors administering the plan
or agreement are disinterested directors and the plan was approved by shareholders in a manner consistent with Rule
16b-3(b), 17 CFR 240.16b-3(b), under the Exchange Act or Rule 16b-3(a) (17 CFR 240.16b-3(a)
as contained in 17 CFR Part 240 to End, revised April 1, 1990). In addition, for purposes of satisfying the requirements
of paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section, a plan or agreement is treated as stating a maximum number of shares with respect
to which an option or right may be granted to any employee if the plan or agreement that was approved by the shareholders
provided for an aggregate limit, consistent with Rule 16b-3(b), 17 CFR 250.16b-3(b), on the shares of
employer stock with respect to which awards may be made under the plan or agreement.

right, or the substantial vesting of restricted property, granted under a plan or agreement described in paragraph
(h)(3)(i) of this section if the grant occurs before the earliest of the dates specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of
this section.

Example.

 Corporation Z adopted a stock option plan in 1991. Pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, the stock option
plan has been administered by disinterested directors and was approved by Corporation Z shareholders. Under the
terms of the plan, shareholder approval is not required again until 2001. In addition, the terms of the stock option
plan include an aggregate limit on the number of shares available under the plan. Option grants under the Corporation
Z plan are made with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of Corporation Z stock. Compensation
attributable to the exercise of options that are granted under the plan before the earliest of the dates specified
in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section will be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section
for qualified performance-based compensation, regardless of when the options are exercised.

In general.

 (2) 

Delayed effective date for certain provisions_

(i) 

Date on which remuneration is considered paid.

 Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the rules in the second sentence of each of paragraphs (e)(3)(ii)
(A), (B), and (C) of this section for determining the date or dates on which remuneration is considered paid to a director
are effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. Prior to those taxable years, taxpayers must
follow the rules in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) (A), (B), and (C) of this section or another reasonable, good faith interpretation
of section 162(m) with respect to the date or dates on which remuneration is considered paid to a director. 


 (ii) 

Separate treatment of publicly held subsidiaries.

 Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section that treats publicly
held subsidiaries as separately subject to section 162(m) is effective as of the first regularly scheduled meeting
of the shareholders of the publicly held subsidiary that occurs more than 12 months after December 2, 1994. The rule
for stock-based compensation set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section will apply for this purpose, except that
the grant must occur before the shareholder meeting specified in this paragraph (i)(2)(ii). Taxpayers may choose
to rely on the rule referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (i)(2)(ii) for the period prior to the effective
date of the rule. 


 (iii) 

Subsidiaries that become separate publicly held corporations.

 Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if a subsidiary of a publicly held corporation becomes a separate
publicly held corporation as described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, then, for the duration of the reliance
period described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section do not apply to
remuneration paid to covered employees of that new publicly held corporation pursuant to a plan or agreement that
existed prior to December 2, 1994 provided that the treatment of that remuneration as performance-based is in accordance
with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 162(m). However, if remuneration is paid to covered employees
of that new publicly held corporation pursuant to a plan or agreement that existed prior to December 2, 1994, but that
remuneration is not performance-based under a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 162(m), then the
rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section apply as of the first regularly scheduled meeting of shareholders that occurs
more than 12 months after December 2, 1994. The rule for stock-based compensation set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of
this section will apply for purposes of this paragraph (i)(2)(iii), except that the grant must occur before the shareholder
meeting specified in the preceding sentence if the remuneration is not performance-based under a reasonable, good
faith interpretation of section 162(m). Taxpayers may choose to rely on the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section
for the period prior to the applicable effective date referred to in the first or second sentence of this paragraph
(i)(2)(iii).

Cucamonga Valley Viticultural Area (94F-011P) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), 
Department of the Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) 
is considering the establishment of a viticultural area 
located in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, 
California, to be known as ``Cucamonga Valley.'' This 
proposal is the result of a petition filed by Gino L. 
Filippi of J. Filippi Vintage Co. on behalf of himself and 
other growers and wineries in the area. 


ATF believes that the establishment of viticultural 
areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as 
appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising 
allows wineries to designate the specific areas where the 
grapes used to make the wine were grown and enables 
consumers to better identify the wines they purchase.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR 
part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of 
definite American viticultural areas. The regulations also 
allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used 
as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising 
of wine. 
On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 
ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 
providing for the listing of approved American viticultural 
areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27, CFR, defines an 
American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the

boundaries of which have been delineated in subpart C of 
part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for 
proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested 
person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region 
as a viticultural area. The petition should include: 
(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed 
viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as 
referring to the area specified in the petition; 
(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries 
of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
(c) Evidence relating to the geographical features 
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which

from surrounding areas;

Petition 


ATF has received a petition from Gino L. Filippi of 
J. Filippi Vintage Co. proposing to establish a 
viticultural area in San Bernardino County, California, to 
be known as ``Cucamonga Valley.'' The proposed viticultural area is located in southern California, about 45 miles
east 
of the city of Los Angeles. It contains approximately 
109,400 acres. The petitioner states that wine grapes, 
probably the mission variety, were first planted in the 
Cucamonga Valley in 1839 or 1840, ``undoubtedly one of the 
first large plantings of grapes in California.'' According 
to the petitioner the wine industry in the Cucamonga Valley 
grew during the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, reaching ``its peak in the 1940's and 1950's with 
over 60 wineries producing from approximately 35,000 
acres.'' Today, there are five bonded wineries within the 
proposed area, and approximately 2,000 acres are planted to 
wine grapes. The petitioner notes ``the area's great 
history and heritage of wine growing and winemaking is 
truly more impressive than the number of acres currently 
farmed.'' 
The petition was also signed by Philo Biane of Rancho 
de Philo Winery, Ren&eacute; Biane of Guasti Plaza, Don Galleano 
of Galleano Winery, Paul Hofer III of Hofer Ranch, LeAnn 
Smothers of the City of Rancho Cucamonga, and Jeff Wilson, 
of Inland Empire West Resource Conservation District. 


Evidence of Name 


Evidence that the name of the proposed area is locally 
and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified 
in the petition includes:

(a) Leon D. Adams, in 

The Wines of America, 

describes 
the Cucamonga Valley as follows:

 

The Cucamonga Valley, forty-five miles east of Los 
Angeles, has grown the bulk of Southern California 
wine during the present century. The vineyard area 
extends from Ontario east to Fontana and from the 
base of the San Gabriel Mountains southward to the 
Jurupa Hills in Riverside County. The climate, 
though tempered by winds from the ocean, is as warm 
as the northern San Joaquin Valley and is classed 
as Region IV.

 

(b) The petitioner provided a copy of an article 
published in 

The Sun, 

a San Bernardino, California, 
newspaper, on March 30, 1994. The article, titled ``Fontana 
winery soaks up more awards,'' described awards won by two 
wines from J. Filippi Vintage Co. at a recent competition 
and stated that the ``Ruby Port is produced from Cucamonga 
Valley grapes, renowned for sherry and port wines.'' 
(c) The petitioner also provided an excerpt of a 
letter dated August 20, 1991, from the San Bernardino 
County Archives to the Riverside County Historical 
Commission discussing designation of the Galleano Winery as 
a landmark. The excerpt makes several references to the 
Cucamonga Valley, mentioning locations within the proposed 
area such as Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana, Ontario and Mira 
Loma. 


Evidence of Boundaries 


As evidence that the proposed boundaries for the area 
are as specified in the petition, the previously cited 
excerpt from 

The Wines of America, 

by Leon D. Adams, states 
that the vineyard area of the Cucamonga Valley ``extends 
from Ontario east to Fontana and from the base of the San 
Gabriel Mountains southward to the Jurupa Hills in 
Riverside County.'' The San Gabriel Mountains form the 
northern boundary of the proposed area, and the Jurupa 
Hills form the eastern part of the southern boundary. The 
towns of Fontana and Ontario are both within the proposed 
area. 
The petitioner proposes using the 560
' elevation line 
as the western portion of the southern boundary. He states 
the area south of that elevation has poor drainage and is 
mainly used for dairy farming. 
In support of Euclid Avenue as the western boundary for 
the proposed viticultural area, the petitioner gave 
historical information. He stated that the area west of 
Euclid Avenue ``was subjected to flooding from the San 
Antonio Canyon. In the 1940's several flood control 
construction projects began to solve the problem. 
Historically, agriculture in this area (Upland, CA) was 
citrus (lemons and oranges).'' He stated that citrus trees 
were grown there because there was a good water source and better drainage than within the proposed viticultural area

to the east of Euclid Avenue. 
The eastern boundary, made up of Lytle Creek Wash, Warm 
River, and the Santa Ana River, marks a shift in the type 
of soil and the ability of the soils to drain. These 
characteristics will be discussed in detail in the section 
of the background material on soils. 


Geographical Features 


The petitioner describes the proposed viticultural area 
as follows:

 

Cucamonga Valley is an east-west oriented valley. 
The San Gabriel mountains form the valley's northern 
boundary. The San Antonio Creek, Cucamonga Creek, 
Deer Creek, Day Creek, San Sevaine Creeks, from west 
to east respectively, spread out to form alluvial 
fans as they descend the foothills and emerge in the 
Cucamonga Plain. These fans contain sand and silt 
deposits that create a rich mixture of fertile soil.

 

The petitioner seeks viticultural area designation for 
the area described above and the valley drained by the 
Cucamonga Creek to the south of this alluvial fan. 
According to the petitioner, these areas share 
characteristics of topography, soil composition and climate 
which distinguish the proposed viticultural area from the 
surrounding areas. The petitioner provided the following 
evidence to support his claims:

Topography 



The U.S.G.S. topographic maps submitted by the 
petitioner show the proposed area slopes gradually from 2,000 feet at the northern boundary to 560 feet at the 
southern boundary. The petitioner describes the San 
Gabriel mountains to the north of the proposed area as ``a 
great wall, from 8,000 to 10,000 feet high.'' The Jurupa 
Mountains to the southeast of the proposed area offer 
another contrast as they rise steeply from the valley floor 
to form part of the southern boundary. The balance of the 
southern boundary, the 560 foot contour line, was chosen 
because the area at lower elevations was poorly drained and 
was traditionally used for dairy farming; furthermore, the 
nearby Prado Dam is scheduled to be raised, so the area to 
the south of the 560 foot contour line will be flooded. 



Soil 



The petitioner describes the soil in the proposed area 
as ``alluvial valley floors, fans and terraces . . . derived 
from granitic rock from the San Gabriel formation in the 
north.'' He further states that the wine grape vineyards in 
the region are ``found to be located on Delhi, Hanford, 
Tujunga, Gorgonio and Hilmar soil series'' and ``most 
vineyards are nearly level to moderately sloping (0-15

O

).'' 

The General Soil Map for southwestern San Bernardino 
County describes these associations as very deep, 
``dominantly brownish soils that are coarse textured 
throughout'' and ``somewhat excessively drained to 
excessively drained.'' On this map, the proposed eastern 
boundary in particular is distinguished by a change in the soil composition to the Hanford-Greenfield-San Emigdio

association, finer textured and less well drained than the 
soils within the proposed area. The mountainous areas to 
the north and southeast of the proposed area have shallower 
soils over granite, schist and sandstone. 



Climate 



The petitioner states that the climate in the proposed 
area is ``well-suited for viticulture. * * * There are 
relatively few nights below freezing in the winter and 
summer days can be very hot, reaching temperatures over 
100 degrees Fahrenheit.'' According to the petitioner, the 
climate is classed as Region IV, with a heat summation in 
the 3,501 to 4,000 degree F. range. He states this 
corresponds to the Ukiah, Davis and Lodi areas of 
California, and is warmer than the Santa Barbara, Santa 
Rosa and Santa Maria areas to the north and the Temecula 
and Rancho California areas to the south. 



Proposed Boundary 



The boundary of the proposed Cucamonga Valley 
viticultural area may be found on ten United States 
Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps with a scale of 1:24000. 
The boundary is described in  9.150.

Executive Order 12866 



It has been determined that this proposed regulation is 
not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive 
Order 12866. Accordingly, this proposal is not subject to 
the analysis required by this Executive Order. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It is hereby certified that this regulation will not 
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities. Any benefit derived from the use of a 
viticultural area name is the result of the proprietor's 
own efforts and consumer acceptance of wines from a 
particular area. No new recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements are proposed. Accordingly, a regulatory 
flexibility analysis is not required. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 
Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to 
this notice of proposed rulemaking because no requirement 
to collect information is proposed. 



Public Participation 



ATF requests comments from all interested parties. We 
are particularly interested in comments concerning the 
proposed western boundary, Euclid Avenue. Comments 
received on or before the closing date will be carefully 
considered. Comments received after that date will be given the same consideration if it is practical to do so, 
but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to 
comments received on or before the closing date. 

ATF will not recognize any comment as confidential. 
Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any material 
which a commenter considers to be confidential or 
inappropriate for disclosure to the public should not 
be included in the comment. The name of the person 
submitting a comment is not exempt from disclosure. During 
the comment period, any person may request an opportunity 
to present oral testimony at a public hearing. However,

The provisions of the Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) that Utah proposed to revise and add were: Utah Admin.
R. 645-301-553. 200, spoil and waste; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.252, refuse piles; Utah
Admin. R. 645-301-553.500 to read, previously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.520,
continuously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.523, applying the stability criteria of proposed
Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.523 to the AOC criteria at Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.650; Utah
Admin. R. 654-301-553.600 and .620, AOC variances for incomplete elimination of highwalls in previously
mined areas or continuously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 654-301-553.650 applying the stability requirements
of Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.523 and the AOC criteria of Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.651 through
.655 to retained highwalls; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-651, height restrictions for retained highwalls;
Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.652, the applicability date of Utah's AOC standards at Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.651
through .655; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.653, the restoration of retained highwalls to cliff-type habitats
required by the flora and fauna existing prior to mining; and Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.654, compatibility
of retained highwalls with both the approved postmining land use and the visual attributes of the area.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the December 8, 1993, 

Federal Register 

(58 FR 64529), provided an opportunity for a public hearing of meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT-879). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period ended on January 7, 1994.

During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.110,
backfilling and grading of disturbed areas; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.500 and .600, the organization
of Utah's rules pertaining to retained highwalls; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.510 and .522, general backfilling
and grading requirements; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.522, slope stability and drainage; Utah Admin.
R. 645-301-553.500 and .523, stability criteria for retained highwalls; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.620,
AOC variances; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.650, AOC and stability requirements of highwall retention;
Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.651, height and length of retained highwalls; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.652,
the applicability date of Utah's AOC alternative; and various editorial comments concerning Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.120,
.631, .650, and .655. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter dated March 31, 1994 (administrative record No. UT-908).

Utah responded in a letter dated April 18, 1994, by requesting a meeting between the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining
(Division) and OSM for the purpose of addressing the issues set forth by OSM in the March 31, 1994, letter (administrative
record No. UT-918). On May 12, 1994, an executive session between the Division and OSM was held at the Western
Support Center in Denver, Colorado to discuss Utah's revised program amendment regarding highwall retention. Notice
of the executive session was posted in the Western Support Center (administrative record No. UT-925). A summary
of the executive session was recorded by OSM and entered into the administrative record (administrative record UT-942).

Utah responded to the concerns identified in OSM's March 31, 1994, letter and the issues discussed at the May 12, 1994,
meeting by submitting a revised amendment dated June 28, 1994 (administrative record No. UT-941).

OSM announced receipt of the proposed revised amendment in the July 14, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (39 FR 35871) and reopened and extended the public comment period (administrative record No. UT-951). The public
comment period ended on July 29, 1994.

During its review of the revised amendment, OSM identified additional concerns relating to the provisions of Utah
Admin. R. 645-100-200, the definition of ``continuously mined areas;'' Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553,
general provisions on highwalls and backfilling and grading; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.110, backfilling
and grading of disturbed areas; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.120, backfilling and grading of spoil and
waste; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.130, slope stability requirements; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.510,
remining operations on previously mined areas, continuously mined areas and areas with remaining highwalls subject
to AOC provisions; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.550, .551, and .552, AOC exceptions; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.650,
highwall management under the AOC provisions; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.651, non-mountaintop removal
mining on steep slopes; and Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.653, the applicability date. OSM notified Utah
of the concerns by letter dated August 24, 1994 (administrative record No. UT-967).

Utah responded by telephone conversation and requested a meeting between the Division and OSM for the purpose of addressing
the applicability date issue set forth by OSM in the August 24, 1994, letter. On September 7, 1994, an executive session
between the Division and OSM was held at the Western Support Center in Denver, Colorado to discuss the applicability
date issue. Notice of the executive session was posted in the Western Support Center (administrative record No. UT-969).
A summary of the executive session was recorded by OSM and entered into the administrative record (administrative
record No. UT-970).

By letter dated November 3, 1994, Utah responded to the concerns identified in OSM's August 24, 1994, letter by submitting
the revised amendment that is the subject of this notice (administrative record No. UT-990). The provisions
of Utah Admin. R. that Utah proposes to revise and add are: Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200, concerning continuously
mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553 and 553.110 through 553.130, concerning general backfilling
and grading requirements; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.510, 553.550, 553.552, 553.611 and 553.612, concerning
previously and continuously mined areas; Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.650 and 553.651, concerning Utah's
AOC provisions; and Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553-663 concerning the applicability date of Utah's
AOC provisions.

Specifically, Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-100-200 by limiting its definition of the term
``continuously mined areas'' to underground mining operations.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553 by deleting a paragraph that was intended to be a general
provision regarding the exceptions approved in the Utah program for complete highwall elimination.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.110, concerning the approved exceptions to the requirements
that disturbed areas be backfilled and graded to achieve AOC, by adding cross-referenced provisions regarding non-mountaintop
removal mining operations on steep slopes, mountaintop removal mining operations, and mining operations on areas
with thin and thick overburden.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.120, concerning the requirement for highwall elimination,
by cross-referencing provisions containing requirements that apply to previously and continuously mined areas
and areas subject to AOC provisions.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.130, concerning the requirement that disturbed areas
achieve an allowable postmining slope, be deleting the phrase following a cross-reference to Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.530
that reads ``which addresses alternative criteria for stability and the protection of the environment and the public
health and safety.''

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.510, by requiring that, in addition to remaining operations
on continuously mined and previously mined areas, remining operations on areas with remaining highwalls subject
to the AOC provisions also comply with other cross-referenced program requirements.

Utah proposes to delete existing Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.550, 553.551, and 553.552, concerning references
to mountaintop removal mining operations, and thin and thick overburden standards, by inserting the cross-references
at Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.110.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.611 and 553.612 by referring to the phrase ``continuously
mined areas'' as ``CMA.''

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.650, concerning highwall management under the AOC
provisions, by deleting introductory language that reads ``coal mining and reclamation operations which are not
located on PMA's or CMA's and are located on areas which are subject to the approximate original contour provisions
which include.''

Utah proposes to delete existing Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.651, concerning highwall management under
the Utah AOC provisions, by inserting the cross-reference to non-mountaintop removal mining operations on steep
slopes at Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.110.

Utah proposes to create new Utah Admin. R. 645-301-553.651, regarding the applicability date of Utah's
AOC provisions, by requiring that where final backfilling and grading was completed and the phase I bond was released
prior to June 2, 1992, no redisturbance of a reclaimed highwall will be required. Highwalls which were approved under
R645-301-553.652, the rule commonly referred to as the ``AOC alternative,'' after December 13, 1982,
are subject to the retroactive application of current rule R645-301-552.650, providing the subject
highwall has not been reclaimed and phase I bond was not released prior to June 2, 1992.



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Utah program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to
reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h) OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program.

IV. Procedural Determinations



1. Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning
and Review).



2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have significant economic effect upon
a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated
by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant
economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Revocation of Folpet Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to revoke the tolerances for residues of the fungicide folpet (

N

-(trichloromethylthio)phthalimide) in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: apples, blackberries,
blueberries, boysenberries, celery, cherries, citrus fruits, crabapples, cranberries, cucumbers, currants,
dewberries, garlic, gooseberries, grapes, huckleberries, leeks, lettuce, loganberries, melons, onions (dry
bulb), onions (green), pumpkins, raspberries, shallots, strawberries, summer squash, tomatoes, and winter squash.
EPA is revoking the tolerances because it does not have adequate data to make a finding that the tolerances will protect
the public health. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Introduction


Folpet is a broad-spectrum fungicide that is registered for industrial use in paints, stains, coatings, and plastics.
In addition, two folpet products are registered for food use. One product is actively registered for use on avocados
in Florida only; the other is a suspended registration for all folpet food uses, which include the food uses subject
to this document.


Legal Background


The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] authorizes the establishment of tolerances
(maximum legal residue levels) and exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of pesticide chemicals
in or on raw agricultural commodities pursuant to section 408 (21 U.S.C. 346a, 348). Without such tolerances or exemptions,
a food containing pesticide residues is considered to be ``adulterated'' under section 402 of the FFDCA, and hence
may not legally be moved in interstate commerce (21 U.S.C. 342). To establish a tolerance or an exemption under section
408 of the FFDCA, EPA must make a finding that the promulgation of the rule would ``protect the public health'' (21 U.S.C.
346a(b)). For a pesticide to be sold and used in the production of a food crop or food animal, the pesticide must not only
have appropriate tolerances under the FFDCA, but must be registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.). FIFRA requires the registration of pesticides that are sold and distributed
in the United States.


Regulatory Background


EPA issued a Registration Standard under FIFRA for folpet in June 1987. At that time, folpet was registered for industrial
use on paints, stains, coatings, and plastics, as well as for use on a variety of food and terrestrial crops. The Registration
Standard states that EPA classifies folpet as a B2 (probable) human carcinogen. In November 1987, EPA issued a Notice
of Intent to Suspend (NOIS) letter for all nonindustrial uses of folpet, because no data had been submitted_including
residue data for the food uses identified in this document_to support folpet's nonindustrial uses.
Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc., the folpet registrant, and Chevron Chemical Co. formed a task force to share the
development of data identified as data gaps in the folpet Registration Standard. The Folpet Task Force indicated
that it would only support folpet's industrial uses. At this point, the NOIS became a final order of suspension, and
the only remaining folpet registrations with food uses, EPA Reg. Nos. 11678-51 and 11678-52, were suspended. In 1990,
Makhteshim purchased these suspended registrations, which had on their labels the commodities subject to this document.
Makhteshim subsequently provided data to support the avocado use and deleted all food uses except avocados from EPA
Reg. No. 11678-51. In 1992, EPA Reg. No. 11678-51 was changed to EPA Reg. No. 66222-7 (the avocado only label), and EPA
Reg. No. 11678-52 was changed to EPA Reg. No. 66222-8 (the suspended label containing all food uses).
In a 1993 letter to EPA, Makhteshim indicated that it desired import tolerances for some of the uses for which the suspended
product number 66222-8 is registered, stating that folpet is an important pesticide product in many countries. To
date, however, EPA has not received adequate data to support any folpet tolerances_imported or domestic_for the
raw agricultural commodities subject to this document.


Current Proposal


This document proposes the revocation of all folpet tolerances_except the avocado tolerance_established under
section 408 of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a, for residues of the fungicide folpet (

N

-(trichloromethylthio)phthalimide) in or on the following commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.191:



50 parts per million in or on celery, cherries, leeks, lettuce, onions (green), and shallots; 25 parts per million
in or on apples, blackberries, blueberries, boysenberries, crabapples, cranberries, currants, dewberries, gooseberries,
grapes, huckleberries, loganberries, raspberries, strawberries, and tomatoes; and 15 parts per million in or on
citrus fruits, cucumbers, garlic, melons, onions (dry bulb), pumpkins, summer squash, and winter squash.




EPA is proposing this action because the establishment of a tolerance under section 408 of FFDCA requires a finding
that the tolerance will protect the public health. EPA does not have adequate data to make such a finding. The registrant
has not submitted the following residue chemistry data, which, according to the June 1987 folpet registration standard,
are needed to make a public-health finding on folpet for the commodities subject to this document:


Nature of the residues (metabolism) studies (guideline no. 171-4a) for representative crops; storage stability
studies (guideline no. 171-4e) for representative crops; analytical method validation; crop field trials (guideline
no. 171-4k) for the subject commodities; and processing studies (guideline no. 171-4l) for applicable commodities.



These studies, which are important to assessing the health risks posed by folpet use, have not been submitted to EPA.
Makhteshim indicated in 1987 that it would not provide the necessary data to support the commodities subject to this
document, and Makhteshim has not attempted to provide any such data since that time, except for data to support the
avocado use.



Domestically produced commodities subject to this proposal should no longer contain folpet residues following
revocation of the tolerances. In the absence of folpet tolerances, any agricultural commodity or processed food
domestically produced and/or imported into the United States found to contain folpet residues is adulterated under
section 402 of the FFDCA.
There is no expectation of a residue problem due to environmental contamination. Consequently, EPA will not recommend
action levels to replace the tolerances upon their revocation.


Other Regulatory Requirements


Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory
action,'' because over the past few years there has been only very minor domestic usage of folpet on the suspended use
sites. The time elapsed since suspension of the food uses, along with the recent usage data showing a very limited amount
of usage, indicate that the loss of the tolerances subject to this document should not cause a significant economic
impact on domestic users. Although overseas usage of folpet on grapes_one of the commodities subject to this document_is
substantial, U.S. imports of grapes are relatively small and mostly from Chile, which does not use folpet. Thus, this
action was not submitted to OMB for review.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and EPA has determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations.
Accordingly, I certify that this proposed rule does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

Paperwork Reduction Act


This proposed regulatory action does not contain any information collection requirements subject to review by OMB
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. 


Public Comment Procedures


Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, information, or data in response to this proposed rule.
Comments must be submitted by (

insert date 30 days after date of publication in the 

Federal Register

). Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number. Three copies of the comments should be submitted
to either location listed under ADDRESSES above in this document.
Information submitted as a comment concerning this document may be claimed confidential by marking any or all of that
information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except
in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of a comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted
for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without
prior notice.
Documents considered and relied upon by EPA pertaining to this action, and all written comments filed pursuant to
this Notice, will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington,
VA 22202, between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except public holidays. Any person who has registered,
or who has submitted an application for registration of folpet under FIFRA, may request that this proposal be referred
to an advisory committee. Such a request must be made within 30 days of the publication of this proposal. To satisfy
requirements for analysis specified by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA has analyzed
the impacts of this proposal. This analysis is available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the Virginia address
given above.

Rules of Procedure of the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Board of Contract Appeals, General Services Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains revisions to the rules of procedure of the GSA Board of Contract Appeals (Board), which will
govern all proceedings before the Board. The revisions are intended to implement certain provisions of the Federal
Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-355) (FASA or Act) which have amended the Brooks Automatic
Data Processing Act, under which the Board hears and decides protests of procurements involving automatic data processing
(ADP) equipment, and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, under which the Board hears and decides contract disputes.
The revisions are intended to conform the Board's rules of procedure to the amendments made to its two jurisdictional
statutes. The Board intends to issue final, revised rules after considering all comments on the proposed revisions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 

A. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The General Services Administration certifies that these revisions will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).



B. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed revisions do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or the collection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public
which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.



C. Background



The Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act (40 U.S.C. 759(f)) provides that protests involving ADP procurements may
be filed with the Board. That Act also provides that the Board is to adopt and issue rules and procedures necessary for
the expeditious resolution of such protests. In addition, the Administrator of General Services has delegated to
the Board the authority to adopt and issue rules necessary for the resolution of contract disputes under the Contract
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601-613). The proposed rules have been approved by majority vote of the Board's
members.



D. Effective Dates



Pursuant to Sections 10001 and 10002 of the FASA, the Board proposes to make the final revised rules, as well as sections
1432-1434, 1436-1438, and 2351(c)-(d) of the Act, applicable to all proceedings filed on or after
a date to be specified in the final rules. Section 1435 of the Act shall be applicable to cost applications where the
underlying protest is filed on or after such date. The date specified in the final rules shall be at least thirty days
after the publication of such rules.

E. Highlights of Proposed Changes



Subtitle D of Title I of the FASA names and amends the Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act (40 U.S.C. 759(f)), under
which the Board hears and decides protests. Subtitle D of Title II of the FASA amends the Contract Disputes Act of 1978
(41 U.S.C. 601-613), which gives the Board jurisdiction to hear and decide contract disputes. The proposed
revisions to the Board's rules contain changes necessitated by the amendment of both the Brooks Act and the Contract
Disputes Act. In addition, Section 155 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 8287) authorized the Board to review
decisions regarding the qualification of firms to enter into energy savings contracts. The Foreword to the rules
now includes a statement that, in conducting such reviews, the Board will apply the rules pertinent to protests to
the extent practicable.



Definitions



A definition of ``prevailing party'' ( 6101.1(b)(12)) has been added to the rules to conform to section 1435(b)
of the FASA. In a protest, a ``prevailing party'' is one who has demonstrated that a challenged action of a Federal agency
violates a statute or regulation or the conditions of a delegation of procurement authority. Similarly, the definition
of ``protest'' ( 6101.1(b)(13)) has been changed to that specified in section 1438 of the Act. Finally, in order
to conform to the language prescribed in section 1437 of the Act, the term ``working day'' ( 6101.1(b)(16))
is now defined as any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or ``legal'' (rather than ``Federal'') holiday.



Computing Time



Section 6101.2(c) has been revised to parallel the changes required by section 1433 of the FASA. This section provides
that when a period of time prescribed or allowed in the rules is less than 11 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays are not counted; in other words, only working days are counted. When the time period is 11 days or
more, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are counted, i.e., all calendar days are counted. The revision
states that the only exceptions are the 5-day period after a debriefing date and the 10-day period after contract award
for filing a protest that requests a suspension hearing; for these, all calendar days are counted. This computation
change affects three other sections of the current rules: (1) Section 6101.19(a)(2) has been amended to provided
that a protest which requests a suspension hearing must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after contract award
or 5 calendar days after the debriefing date; (2) Section 6101.19(a)(3) has been amended to provide that the hearing
on the merits of a protest shall commence no later than 35 calendar days after the protest is filed (rather than 25 working
days); and (3) Section 6101.29(b) now provides that a decision on the merits of a protest shall be decided no later than
65 calendar days after the protest is filed (rather than 45 working days).



Small Claims and Accelerated Procedures



The small claims dollar threshold has been changed from $100,000 to $50,000 ( 6101.13(a)), and the accelerated
procedure dollar threshold has been changed from $50,000 to $10,000 ( 6101.14(a)). These changes parallel
the amendments to sections 608(a) and 607(f) of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 by subsections 2351 (c) and (d) of
the FASA.



Dismissals; Sanctions



Section 6101.28(a)(2) has been added to conform to the language specified in Section 1434 of the FASA. The proposed
rule provides that the Board may dismiss a protest that it determines is frivolous; has been brought or pursued in bad
faith; or does not state on its face a valid basis for protest. Section 6101.18(b) has been amended to provide that the
Board may impose appropriate sanctions if it expressly finds that (1) a protest or portion of a protest is frivolous
or has been brought or pursued in bad faith; or (2) that any person has willfully abused the Board's process during the
course of a protest.

Suspension Hearing and Decision


Section 6101.19(a)(2) has been amended to change the timing of a protest suspension hearing in order to conform to
Section 1433(a)(2) of the FASA. A protest suspension hearing is one in which the Board determines whether to suspend
the Administrator's procurement authority or delegation of procurement authority until the protest can be decided.
An interested party may request a suspension hearing if the underlying protest if filed on the later of (1) the tenth
day after the date of contract award; or (2) the fifth day after the debriefing date for any debriefing that is requested
and required. The Board must hold the suspension hearing within 5 days after the date the protest was filed, or in the
case of a request for debriefing, within 5 days after the later of the date of the filing of the protest or the date of the
debriefing.
Section 6101.19(d) (Suspension decision) has been amended to include language specified by Section 1433(a)(1)(C)
of the FASA. If a contract award has not been made, a suspension shall not preclude the Federal agency whose procurement
authority has been suspended from continuing the procurement process up to but not including contract award, unless
the Board determines such action is not in the best interests of the United States.


Settlement Agreements


A new paragraph has been added to Section 6101.28 (Dismissals) which incorporates the language specified by Section
1436 of the FASA. Section 6101.28(d) provides that any settlement agreement that dismisses a protest and involves
a direct or indirect expenditure of appropriated funds shall be submitted to the Board and made part of the public record,
subject to any protective order considered appropriate by the Board. If a Federal agency is a party to the agreement,
the submission of the agreement to the Board must include a memorandum signed by the contracting officer that describes
in detail the procurement, the grounds for protest, the Government's position regarding those grounds, the terms
of the settlement, and the agency's position regarding the propriety of the award or proposed award of the contract
at issue in the protest.
