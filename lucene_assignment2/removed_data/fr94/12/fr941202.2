Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service

[Docket No. 94-121-1] 



Receipt of Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status for Genetically Engineered Potato Lines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received a petition from the Monsanto
Company seeking a determination of nonregulated status for certain potato lines genetically engineered for resistance
to the Colorado potato beetle. The petition has been submitted in accordance with our regulations concerning the
introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms and products. In accordance with those regulations,
we are soliciting public comments on whether these potato lines present a plant pest risk.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' regulate, among other things, the introduction
(importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of organisms and products altered or produced
through genetic engineering that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests. Such genetically
engineered organisms and products are considered ``regulated articles.'' 


 

The regulations in  340.6(a) provide that any person may submit a petition to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) seeking a determination that an article should not be regulated under 7 CFR part 340. Paragraphs (b)
and (c) of  340.6 describe the form that a petition for determination of nonregulated status must take and the
information that must be included in the petition.

On September 14, 1994, APHIS received a petition (APHIS Petition No. 94-257-01p) from the Monsanto Company
(Monsanto) of St. Louis, MO, requesting a determination of nonregulated status under 7 CFR part 340 for seven Russet
Burbank potato lines (BT6, BT10, BT12, BT16, BT17, BT18, and BT23) genetically engineered with the plasmid vector
PV-STBT02, which confers resistance to the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) (

Leptinotarsa decemlineata

). The Monsanto petition states that the subject potato lines should not be regulated by APHIS because they do not present
a plant pest risk. 


 As described in the petition, the subject potato lines were genetically engineered to produce an insect control protein
derived from the common soil bacterium 

Bacillus thuringiensis

 subsp. 

tenebrionis (Btt).

 This insect control protein is identical in amino acid sequence to one of the proteins (band 3 protein encoded by the


cryIIIA

 gene) naturally produced by 

Btt

 and found in commercial microbial 

Btt

 formulations registered as pesticides with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). According to Monsanto,
the protein is highly selective in controlling CPB and is expressed at a consistently effective level in the potato
foliage throughout the growing season. The expression of this insect control protein in the subject lines is regulated
by an enhanced 35S promoter derived from the plant pathogen Cauliflower mosaic virus, and by the nontranslated region
of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase referred to as E9 3
' derived from pea. The subject potato lines also express an 

nptII 

gene derived from the prokaryotic transposon Tn5 encoding the enzyme neomycin phosphotransferase II. The expression
of this gene in the subject potato lines is regulated by the 35S promoter (as described above) and the nontranslated
3
' region of the nopaline synthase gene derived from the plant pathogen 

Agrobacterium.

 The expression of neomycin phosphotransferase II in the subject potato lines allows for selective growth of transgenic
plant cells on the antibiotic kanamycin during plant tissue culture. These genes were stably transferred into the
genome of potato plants through an 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens

-mediated transformation utilizing a binary, double-border plant expression vector, PV-STBT02. 


 Monsanto's subject CPB-resistant potato lines are currently considered regulated articles under the regulations
in 7 CFR part 340 because they contain gene sequences (vectors, promoters, and terminators) derived from plant pathogenic
sources. The subject potato lines were evaluated at a total of 34 locations under nine APHIS permits issued between
1991 and 1993. In the process of reviewing Monsanto's permit applications for field trials of the subject potato lines,
APHIS determined that the vectors and other elements were disarmed and that the trials, which were conducted under
conditions of reproductive and physical containment or isolation, would not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination. 


 In the Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa 

et seq.

), ``plant pest'' is defined as ``any living stage of: Any insects, mites, nematodes, slugs, snails, protozoa, or
other invertebrate animals, bacteria, fungi, other parasitic plants or reproductive parts thereof, viruses, or
any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing, or any infectious substances, which can directly or indirectly
injure or cause disease or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured or other products
of plants.'' APHIS views this definition very broadly. The definition covers direct or indirect injury, disease
or damage not just to agricultural crops, but also to plants in general, for example, native species, as well as to organisms
that may be beneficial to plants, for example, honeybees, rhizobia, etc. 


 These genetically engineered potato lines are also currently subject to regulation by other agencies. The EPA is
responsible for the regulation of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 

et seq.

). FIFRA requires that all pesticides, including insecticides, be registered prior to distribution or sale, unless
exempt by EPA regulation. Accordingly, Monsanto has submitted to EPA an application to register this plant-pesticide,
i.e. the 

Btt

 CPB control protein as produced by the 

cryIIIA

 gene and its controlling sequences in these genetically engineered potato lines. On December 8, 1993, EPA announced
receipt of this application (EPA File Symbol 524-UTU) in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 64582-64583). This is the first application for registration of a transgenic plant pesticide under section
3(c) of FIFRA, as amended, in which a plant has been genetically altered to produce a pesticide.

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.

), pesticides added to raw agricultural commodities generally are considered to be unsafe unless a tolerance or exemption
from tolerance has been established. Foods containing unsafe pesticides are deemed to be adulterated. Residue tolerances
for pesticides are established by EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) enforces the tolerances set by the EPA. Monsanto has also submitted to the EPA a pesticide petition (PP 3F4273)
proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 to establish a tolerance exemption for residues of the plant pesticide active ingredient


Btt 

CPB control protein as expressed in plant cells. On December 8, 1993, EPA announced receipt of this petition [58 FR
64583-64584]. Consistent with the ``Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology'' (51 FR 23302-23350,
June 26, 1986), APHIS and the EPA are coordinating their review of these genetically engineered potato lines to avoid
duplication and assure that all relevant issues are addressed. 
FDA's policy statement concerning regulation of plants derived from new plant varieties was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 29, 1992, and appears at 57 FR 22984-23005. Monsanto has notified the FDA that they have completed their food
safety and nutritional assessment as required under this FDA policy statement. 
In accordance with  340.6(d) of the regulations, we are publishing this notice to inform the public that APHIS
will accept written comments regarding the Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status from any interested
person for a period of 60 days from the date of this notice. The petition and any comments received are available for
public review, and copies of the petition may be ordered (see the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice). 
After the comment period closes, APHIS will review the data submitted by the petitioner, all written comments received
during the comment period, and any other relevant information. Based on the available information, APHIS will furnish
a response to the petitioner, either approving the petition in whole or in part, or denying the petition. APHIS will
then publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the regulatory status of Monsanto's CPB-resistant potato lines BT6, BT10, BT12, BT16, BT17, BT18, and
BT23 and the availability of APHIS' written decision.

In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address our designation of the PRC as an NME
and provide relevant information and argument related to the issues of the PRC's NME status and granting of separate
rates to individual exporters. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation to submit comments
on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the PRC consistent with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act. See 

Amendment to Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Amendment to Antidumping Duty Order: Chrome-Plated
Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 

57 FR 15052 (April 24, 1992). 


Conforming with Department practice, the petitioners calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of the factors
of production and, claiming that their production process is similar to the Chinese production process, based the
factors of production on their own experience. The factors of production were valued, where possible, on publicly
available published information pertaining to India. The petitioners argue that India is both a country at a comparable
level of economic development to the PRC and a significant producer of comparable merchandise, thus meeting the requirements
of section 773(c)(4) of the Act. For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted India as an appropriate surrogate
country selection. 

Where Indian values were not available, the petitioners valued the factors of production using either a ratio based
on their own experience or their own costs. 
In accordance with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act, the petitioners' FMV consisted of the sum of values assigned to
materials, labor, energy, overhead and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Certain of these
factor values were adjusted for inflation. Pursuant to section 773(e)(1) of the Act, the petitioners added to the
cost of manufacturing (COM), overhead and SG&A expenses, the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit.


Based on our analysis of the petition and the subsequent supplement to the petition, we have made certain adjustments
to the petitioners' FMV calculation as follows: 



(1) we disallowed all factors valued by using the petitioners' own costs; 
(2) we recalculated factory overhead and depreciation expenses using the statistics in the December 1992 

Reserve Bank of India Bulletin. 

This source is publicly available and has been used to value factory overhead in other investigations of imports from
the PRC; 
(3) for the purpose of initiating this investigation, we recalculated the valuation of several process chemicals,
using data from the 

Chemical Marketing Reporter. 

This information was supplied by the petitioners in their November 22, 1994, supplement to the petition. We accepted
this surrogate information for the purpose of initiating the investigation because it is information that is reasonably
available to the petitioners for supporting their allegations, within the meaning of section 732(b) of the Act. 
(4) we recalculated electrical consumption using the industrial rate for electricity in Indonesia, an appropriate
surrogate country at a comparable level of economic development to the PRC. In our recent investigations of magnesium
from the PRC, we found that the Indian rate for electricity was inappropriate. See 

Preliminary Determinations of Sales at Less than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determinations: Pure Magnesium
and Alloy Magnesium from the People's Republic of China, 

59 FR 55424, 55426, November 7, 1994. 


Fair Value Comparisons 


Based on a comparison of USP and FMV, the petitioners' alleged dumping margins, as revised by the Department, range
from 104.77 percent to 143.32 percent. 


Initiation of Investigation 



Pursuant to section 732(c) of the Act, the Department must determine, within 20 days after a petition is filed, whether
a petition alleges the elements necessary for the imposition of a duty under section 731 of the Act and whether the petition
contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations. 


We have examined the petition for manganese metal from the PRC, as amended, and have found that it meets the requirements
of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether
imports of manganese metal from the PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.
If this 
investigation proceeds normally, we will make our preliminary determination by April 27, 1995. 


International Trade Commission (ITC) Notification 


Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of this action and we have done so. 


Preliminary Determination by the ITC 


The ITC will determine by December 23, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of manganese metal
from the PRC are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry. Pursuant to section 733(a)
of the Act, a negative ITC determination will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 
This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

Case History


Since the publication of the notice of initiation in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 37028, July 20, 1994), the following events have occurred.
On August 1, 1994, we issued countervailing duty questionnaires to the Government of Italy (``GOI'') and the Commission
of the European Communities (``EC''), in Washington, D.C., concerning petitioner's allegations. On August 8, 1994,
the GOI responded to the first section of our questionnaire informing us that Dalmine S.p.A. (``Dalmine''), an Italian
OCTG producer, accounted for more than 85 percent of the Italian exports of the subject merchandise to the United States
during the POI. The GOI, the EC, and Dalmine submitted questionnaire responses on October 7, 1994. On October 18, 1994,
we issued deficiency questionnaires to these parties. We received responses from the GOI, Dalmine, and the EC on November
7, 1994.
On August 24, 1994, we postponed the preliminary determination in this investigation until November 23, 1994 (59
FR 43554, August 24, 1994).


Scope of Investigation


The products covered by this investigation are OCTG, which are hollow steel products of circular cross-section.
These products include oil well casing, tubing, and drill pipe, of iron (other than cast iron) or steel (both carbon
and allow), whether or not conforming to American Petroleum Institute (``API'') or non-API specifications, whether
finished or unfinished (including green tubes). These investigations do not cover casing, tubing, or drill pipe
containing 10.5 percent or more of chromium. The OCTG subject to these investigations are currently classified in
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS'') under these item numbers:








Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.

Injury Test 



Because Italy is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, the U.S. International
Trade Commission (``ITC'') is required to determine whether imports of OCTG from Italy materially injure, or threaten
material injury to, a U.S. industry. On August 3, 1994, the ITC preliminarily determined that there is a reasonable
indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured or threatened with material injury by
reason of imports from Italy of the subject merchandise (59 FR 42286, August 17, 1994). 



Petitioner 



The petition in this investigation was filed by IPSCO Steel, Inc., Maverick Tube Corporation, Koppel Steel Corporation,
North Star Steel Ohio, and USS/Steel Group. 



Corporate History of Respondent Dalmine 



Prior to its liquidation in 1988, Finsider S.p.A. (``Finsider'') was the holding company for all state-owned steel
companies in Italy. Dalmine was an operating company wholly owned by Finsider. After Finsider's liquidation, a new
government-owned holding company, ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), was created. ILVA took over the former Finsider companies,
among them Dalmine, which became a subsidiary of ILVA in 1989, when Finsider's shareholding in Dalmine was transferred
to ILVA. 

Between 1990 and 1993, Dalmine itself was restructured. Dalmine became a financial holding company, with industrial,
trading, and service shareholdings. As part of its restructuring, Dalmien made several asset purchases, sold two
of its subsidiaries to private parties, and closed several manufacturing facilities. As of December 31, 1993, the
Dalmine Group consisted of a holding company (Dalmine S.p.A.), four wholly-owned, and one majority-owned, manufacturing
companies, and a number of sales and service subsidiaries. 

During the POI, ILVA was owned by the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (``IRI''), a holding company which
was wholly-owned by the GOI. 



Spin-Offs 



In its questionnaire response, Dalmine reported that between 1990 and 1991, as part of its overall restructuring
process, the company sold two ``productive units'' to private buyers. According to Dalmine, these sales involved
assets that do not produce the subject merchandise. Based on our analysis of Dalmine's response with respect to the
productive units sold, we preliminarily determine that the amount of potentially spun-off benefits is insignificant.
Therefore, we have not evaluated whether these benefits are attributable to sales of the subject merchandise for
purposes of this preliminary determination. (

See 

Final Concurrence Memorandum dated November 23, 1994.) 



Equityworthiness 



Petitioner has alleged that Dalmine was unequityworthy in 1989, the year it received an indirect equity infusion
from the GOI, through ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), and that the equity infusion was, therefore, inconsistent with commercial
considerations. 

In its questionnaire response, Dalmine has provided evidence that private investors, unrelated to Dalmine or the
GOI, purchased a significant percentage of the 1989 equity offering, on the same terms as ILVA. Therefore, the Department
preliminarily determines that ILVA's purchase of Dalmine's shares was consistent with commercial considerations.
(

See

 section 355.44(e)(1)(i) of the 

Proposed Regulations

 published on May 31, 1989, at 54 FR 23366.) 



Creditworthiness 



Petitioner has alleged that Dalmine was uncreditworthy in every year between 1979 and 1993. In accordance with section
355.44 of the 

Proposed Regulations,

 we examined Dalmine's current, quick, times interest earned, and debt-to-equity ratios, in addition to its profit
margin. Based on this analysis, we preliminarily determine that Dalmine was creditworthy from 1979 through 1993.
(

See

 Creditworthy Memorandum, November 23, 1994). Specifically, although a number of the financial indicators are weak
for certain years, none of the indicators are weak over the medium or long term, and when examined together on a yearly
basis, the indicators support the determination that Dalmine was creditworthy in every year examined. In addition,
Dalmine received comparable long-term, commercial loans from private lenders in several of the years examined.
While we have based our preliminary creditworthiness determination on the company's financial indicators, the
fact that Dalmine received a number of long-term commercial loans during this period supports our finding.

Benchmarks and Discount Rates



Dalmine did not take out any long-term fixed rate lira denominated loans or other debt obligations in any of the years
of the government loans under investigation. Therefore, in accordance with section 355.44(b)(4) of the 

Proposed Regulations,

 we used, as the benchmark interest rate, the Bank of Italy reference rate. We have determined that this rate constitutes
the best approximation of the cost of long-term borrowing in Italy and the only long-term fixed interest rate commonly
available in Italy. (

See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from Italy (``Certain Steel
from Italy''

), 58 FR, 37327 (July 9, 1993).)

We have also used this rate as the discount rate for allocating over time the benefit from non-recurring grants for
the same reasons as explained in 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Spain,

 58 FR 37374, 37376 (July 9, 1993).

For long-term loans denominated in other currencies, we used, as the benchmark interest rate, the average long-term
fixed interest rate denominated in the same currency. (

See

 section E_Article 54 Loans below.)



Calculation Methodology



For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which we are measuring subsidies (the POI) is calendar
year 1993. In determining the benefits received under the various programs described below, we used the following
calculation methodology. We first calculated the benefit attributable to the POI for each countervailable program,
using the methodologies described in each program section below. For each program, we then divided the benefit attributable
to Dalmine in the POI by Dalmine's total sales revenue, as none of the programs was limited to either certain subsidiaries
or products of Dalmine. Next, we added the benefits for all programs, including the benefits for programs which were
not allocated over time, to arrive at Dalmine's total subsidy rate. Because Dalmine is the only respondent company
in this investigation, this rate is also the country-wide rate.

Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a response to an allegation denies the existence
of a program, receipt of benefits under a program, or eligibility of a company or industry under a program, and the Department
has no persuasive evidence showing that the response is incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary
determination. All such responses, however, are subject to verification. If the response cannot be supported at
verification, and the program is otherwise countervailable, the program will be considered a subsidy in the final
determination.

Based upon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaires, we preliminarily determine the following:



I. Programs Preliminarily Determined To Be Countervailable



A. Benefits Provided Under Law 675/77 



Law 675/77 was enacted in 1977 to bring about restructuring and reconversion in the following industrial sectors:
(1) electronic technology; (2) the manufacturing industry; (3) the agro-food industry; (4) the chemical industry;
(5) the steel industry; (6) the pulp and paper industry; (7) the fashion sector; and (8) the automobile and aviation
sectors. Law 675/77 also sought to promote optimal exploitation of energy resources, and ecological and environmental
recovery.

A primary goal of this legislation was to bring all government industrial assistance programs under a single law.
Other goals were (1) to reorganize and develop the industrial sector as a whole; (2) to increase employment in the South;
and (3) to maintain employment in depressed areas. Among other measures taken, the Interministerial Committee for
the Coordination of Industrial Policy (''CIPI'') was created as a result of Law 675/77. CIPI approves individual
projects in each of the industrial sectors listed above.

Six main programs were provided under Law 675/77: (1) Interest contributions on bank loans; (2) mortgage loans provided
by the Ministry of Industry at subsidized interest rates; (3) interest contributions on funds raised by bond issues;
(4) capital grants for projects in the South; (5) personnel retraining grants; and (6) VAT reductions on purchases
of capital goods by companies in the South. Dalmine reported that it received benefits under items (1), (2), and (5)
above.

<TEXT>
 

In its response, the GOI asserts that the steel and automobile industries did not receive a ``disproportionate''
share of benefits associated with interest contributions when the extent of government investment in those industries
is compared to the extent of investment in other industries. However, in keeping with past practice, we did not consider
the level of investment in the individual industries receiving benefits under Law 675/77. Instead, we followed the
analysis outlined in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel 

and 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Brazil, 

58 FR 37295, 37295 (July 9, 1993), of comparing the share of benefits received by the steel industry to the collective
share of benefits provided to other users of the programs. 

According to the information provided by the GOI, the two dominant users of the interest contribution program were
(1) the Italian steel industry which accounted for 33 percent of the benefits, and (2) the auto industry which accounted
for 34 percent of the benefits. Likewise, with respect to the mortgage loans, the two dominant users were the auto and
steel industries which received 45 percent and 31 percent of the benefits, respectively. 

In light of the above evidence, we preliminarily determine that the steel industry was a dominant user of both the interest
contribution and the mortgage loan programs under Law 675/77 because the steel industry has been a dominant user of
these programs. (

See 

section 355.43(b)(2)(iii) of the 

Proposed Regulations.

) Therefore, we preliminarily determine that benefits received by Dalmine under these programs are being provided
to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. On this basis, we preliminarily find Law
675/77 financing to be countervailable. 

Under the interest contribution program, Italian commercial banks provided loans to industries designated under
Law 675/77. According to the responses of the GOI and Dalmine, the interest owed by the recipient companies was partially
offset by interest contributions from the GOI. Dalmine received bank loans with interest contributions under Law
675/77 which were outstanding in the POI. 

Because Dalmine knew that it would receive the GOI interest contributions over the life of the loan when it obtained
the loans, we consider the contributions to constitute reductions in the interest rates charged rather than grants
(

see Certain Steel from Italy 

at 37335). 

Under the mortgage loan program, the GOI provides long-term loans at subsidized interest rates. Dalmine received
financing under this program which was outstanding in the POI. 

To determine whether these programs conferred a benefit, we compared the effective interest rate paid by Dalmine
to the benchmark interest rate, discussed above. Based on this comparison, we preliminarily determine that the financing
provided under these programs is inconsistent with commercial considerations, 

i.e., 

on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing. 

To calculate the benefit from these programs, we used our standard long-term loan methodology as described in section
355.49(c)(1) of the 

Proposed Regulations. 

We then divided the benefit allocated to the POI for each program by Dalmine's total sales in 1993. On this basis, we
determine the net subsidy from these programs to be 0.47 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 

With respect to retraining grants provided to Dalmine under Law 675/77, it is the Department's practice to treat training
benefits as recurring grants. (

See Certain Steel General Issues Appendix 

at 37226). Since the only grant reported under this program was received by Dalmine in 1986, any benefit to Dalmine
as a result of this grant cannot be attributed to the POI. Therefore, we determine that retraining benefits provided
under Law 675/77 conferred no benefit to Dalmine during the POI. 



B. Grants Under Law 193/84 



According to the GOI, Articles 2, 3, and 4 of Law 193/84 provide for subsidies to close steel plants. As stated in Art.
20 of Law N. 46 of 17/2/1982, steel enterprises producing seamless pipes, welded pipes, conduits and welded pipes
for water and gas are the recipients of these subsidies. As benefits under this program are limited to the steel industry,
we preliminarily determine that Law 193/84 is 

de jure 

specific and, therefore, countervailable. In this investigation, information provided by Dalmine indicates that
the company received grants under Law 193/84. 

To calculate the benefit during the POI, we used our standard grant methodology (

see 

section 355.49(b) of the 

Proposed Regulations

). We then divided the benefits attributable to Dalmine under Law 193/84 in the POI by Dalmine's total sales. On this
basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.75 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.

C. Exchange Rate Guarantee Program



This program, which was enacted by Law 796/76, provides exchange rate guarantees on foreign currency loans from the
European Coal and Steel Community (``ECSC) and 

The Council of European Resettlement Fund (``CER''). 

Under the program, repayment amounts are calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect at the time the loan
is agreed upon. The program sets a ceiling and a floor on repayment to limit the effect on the borrower of exchange rate
changes over time. For example, if the lire depreciates five percent against the DM (the currency in which the loan
is taken out), borrowers would normally find that they would have to repay five percent more (in lire terms). However,
under the Exchange Rate Guarantee Program, the ceiling would act to limit the increased repayment amount to two percent.
There is also a floor in the program which would apply if the lire appreciated against the DM. The floor would limit any
windfall to the borrower.
In 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, 

the Department found this program to be not countervailable because of incomplete information regarding the specificity
of the program. The Department stated that, because the determination was reached while lacking certain important
information, the finding of non-countervailability would not carry over to future investigations.
In this investigation, information provided by the GOI shows that the steel industry received 25% of the benefits
under the program. Based on this information, the Department preliminarily determines that the steel industry was
a dominant user of exchange rate guarantees under Law 796/76 and, thus, that benefits received by Dalmine under the
law are being provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. (

See 

section 355.43(b)(2)(iii) of the 

Proposed Regulations.

) Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the exchange rate guarantees offered under the program are countervailable
to the extent they are provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.
Dalmine provided information that it could have purchased an exchange rate guarantee from commercial sources. However,
Dalmine's information pertained to 1993, not to the period when the government-provided guarantees were taken out.
The GOI's response indicates that commercial exchange rate guarantees were not available in 1986, the year in which
the loan and the guarantee were received. Therefore, we preliminarily determine the benefit to Dalmine to be the total
amount of GOI payments on these loans made during the POI by the GOI. (Because the amount the government will pay in any
given year will not be known until that year, benefits can only be calculated on a year-by-year basis.) We divided the
GOI's payments in 1993 by Dalmine's 1993 total sales. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy from this
program to be 0.20 percent 

ad valorem 

for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.


II. Programs Preliminarily Determined to be not Countervailable 


A. 1988/89 Equity Infusion


In November 1989, Dalmine completed an equity rights offering which allowed existing shareholders to purchase seven
new shares for every ten shares they already owned. The new shares were offered at a price of LIT 300 per share. At that
time, ILVA owned 81.7 percent of Dalmine's equity, with the remaining 18.3 percent owned by private investors. Pursuant
to the rights offering, ILVA subscribed to its full allotment of the new shares. The remainder of the new shares were
purchased by private shareholders. All shares were purchased at LIT 300 per share.

<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Petitioner argues that although Dalmine's shares were nominally publicly traded, the vast majority of Dalmine shares
were indirectly owned by the GOI and, therefore, shares were not purchased in adequate volume by private investors
to establish a valid benchmark. Specifically, petitioner contends that in 1991 ILVA owned 99.9 percent of Dalmine
and, therefore, Dalmine's shares were in fact not publicly traded. Consequently, because essentially no private
purchases were being made, the market price at the time of the equity infusion cannot serve as a valid benchmark. Furthermore,
petitioner asserts that it is highly likely that the remaining shares not purchased by ILVA were purchased indirectly
by the GOI through other holding companies.
In response to our questionnaire, Dalmine provided a list of all purchasers of shares in the 1989 offering. There is
not evidence to indicate that the shares not purchased by ILVA were purchased by other government controlled or owned
entities, as petitioner suggests. Moreover, the extent of ILVA's ownership in 1991 is not relevant to the choice of
a benchmark for the equity investment in 1989.
We have preliminarily determined that, because 18.3 percent of the equity infusion was purchased by private shareholders,
the sale of these shares provides the market-determined price for Dalmine's equity. Furthermore, in accordance
with section 355.44 (e)(1) of the Department's Proposed Regulations, we preliminarily determine that the equity
infusion is not countervailable because the market-determined price for Dalmine's shares is not less than the price
paid by ILVA for those shares.


B. European Social Fund (``ESF'') Grants


The ESF was established by the 1957 European Economic Community Treaty to increase employment and help raise worker
living standards.
As described in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, 

the ESF receives its funds from the EC's general budget whose main revenue sources are customs duties, agricultural
levies, value-added taxes collected by the member states, and other member state contributions.
The member states are responsible for selecting the projects to be funded by the EC. The EC then disburses the grants
to the member states which manage the funds and implement the projects. According to the EC, ESF grants are available
to (1) people over 25 who have been unemployed for more than 12 months; (2) people under 25 who have reached the minimum
school-leaving age and who are seeking a job; and (3) certain workers in rural areas and regions characterized by industrial
decline or lagging development.
The GOI has stated that the ESF grants received by Italy have been used for vocational training. Certain regions in
the South are also eligible for private sector re-entry and retraining schemes. Since 1990, the vocational training
grants have been available to unemployed youths and long-term unemployed adults all over Italy, according to the
GOI. Before 1990, however, the GOI gave preference to certain regions in Italy.
In 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, 

we determined that this program was not regionally specific and not otherwise limited to a specific enterprise or
industry, or group of enterprises or industries. Furthermore, we noted that to the extent there is a regional preference
(

i.e., 

southern Italy) in the distribution of ESF benefits, it has not resulted in a countervailable benefit to the production
of the subject merchandise, which is produced in northern Italy.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The GOI's response in this investigation is consistent with the information provided in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel. 

Therefore, we preliminarily determine that this program is not limited to a specific enterprise or industry, or group
of enterprises or industries and, therefore, is not countervailable.



C. ECSC Article 54 Loans



Under Article 54 of the 1951 ECSC Treaty, the European Commission provides loans directly to iron and steel companies
for modernization and the purchase of new equipment. The loans finance up to 50 percent of an investment project. The
remaining financing needs must be met from other sources. The Article 54 loan program is financed by loans taken by
the Commission, which are then re-lent to iron and steel companies in the member states at a slightly higher interest
rate than that at which the Commission obtained them.

Consistent with the Department's finding in 

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, 

we preliminarily determine that this program is limited to the iron and steel industry. As a result, loans under this
program are specific.

Of the Article 54 loans Dalmine had outstanding during the POI, some were denominated in U.S. dollars and others were
in Dutch guilders (``NLG''). To determine whether the loans were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial
considerations, we used benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the loans were denominated. That is,
for the U.S. dollar loans we used the average interest rate on long-term fixed-rate U.S. dollar loans obtained in the
United States, as reported by the Federal Reserve. For the NLG denominated loan, we used the average long-term bond
rate for private borrowers in the Netherlands, as reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(``OECD'').

Because the interest rate spaid on Dalmine's Article 54 loans are higher than the benchmark interest rates, the Department
preliminarily determines that loans provided under this program are not preferential and, therefore, not countervailable.



D. 1989 Provisional Payment in Connection With 1989 Equity Infusion



In March 1989, ILVA made a payment to Dalmine in anticipation of purchasing new shares in Dalmine. The payment was provisional
in nature because EC authorization of the capital increase was necessary, and if authorization was not granted, the
money would have been repaid to ILVA. The capital increase was not finalized until November 1989, due to delays in EC
approval. At that time, the payment became equity capital.

Consistent with the Department's position in 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from Italy 

(

Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel

), 59 FR 18357 (April 18, 1994), we preliminarily determine that the funds provided by ILVA to Dalmine are countervailable.

During the period March-November 1989, Dalmine had use of the money and paid no interest on it.

Therefore, we have treated the funds provided by ILVA to Dalmine as an interest-free short-term loan from March 1989
to November 1989.

Because any benefit from this interest-free loan would be allocable entirely to 1989, no benefit is attributable
to the POI.



III. Programs Preliminarily Determined to be Not Used



Based on the information provided in the responses, we preliminarily determine that the following programs were
not used. This determination is subject to verification.




1. 

Preferential IMI Export Financing Under Law 227/77

2. Preferential Insurance Under Law 227/77

3. Retraining Grants under Law 181/89

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Allocation of Community Development Quota percentages of sablefish fixed gear allocation and the halibut quota
to approved Community Development Plan applicants for the years 1995-97. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the approval of Community Development Plans (CDPs) for the 1995-97 halibut and sablefish Community
Development Quota (CDQ) program in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management areas, as recommended by the Governor
for the State of Alaska (Governor). This action is necessary to notify interested persons of the decision of the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary) that these CDPs are approved. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The halibut and sablefish Community Development Quota (CDQ) program in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management
areas was developed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) as Amendment 15 to the Fishery Management
Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, Amendment 20 to the FMP for Groundfish
of the Gulf of Alaska, and a regulatory amendment affecting the fishery for Pacific halibut under the International
Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) in and off the State of Alaska and approved by the Secretary (58 FR 59375, November
9, 1993). 



Seven CDQ groups, representing eligible western Alaska communities submitted eight Community Development Plan
(CDP) applications requesting allocations of the available sablefish and halibut reserve pursuant to regulations
at 50 CFR part 676. Amounts of the sablefish and halibut reserve are calculated using the following percentages times
the appropriate annual halibut or sablefish quotas: 

For halibut, 



(1) In IPHC regulatory area 4B, 20 percent; 
(2) In IPHC regulatory area 4C, 50 percent; 
(3) In IPHC regulatory area 4D, 30 percent; and 
(4) In IPHC regulatory area 4E, 100 percent.

For sablefish, 20 percent of the fixed gear allocation of sablefish in each Bering Sea (BS) and Aleutian Islands (AI)
subarea, as provided under 50 CFR 675.24(c). 

As required by  676.24(e) and by state regulations at Title 6 Alaska Administrative Code 93, the Governor held
a public hearing on September 7, 1994, to receive comments on CDQ applications and CDPs. The Governor made available
for public review all State of Alaska materials pertinent to the hearing at the time the hearing was announced. 


The Governor consulted the Council concerning the CDP recommendations during the Council's September 27-October
5, 1994 meeting. Copies of the CDP executive summaries, summary sheets, and the Governor's recommended allocations
were reviewed by the Council, which then unanimously concurred with the Governor's recommendations. The seven CDQ
groups and the Governor's recommended proportions of available halibut and sablefish to each group are summarized
in the attached table below. 


Upon receiving the Governor's recommendations on October 7, 1994, the Secretary commenced a review of the record
to determine whether the community eligibility criteria and the evaluation criteria set forth in regulations implementing
the CDQ program have been met. The Secretary has found that the Governor's recommendations for CDPs are consistent
with the community eligibility conditions and evaluation criteria and other applicable law. 



As required by  676.24(e)(1), the Secretary publishes this notice of the approval of the Governor's recommendations,
including the percentages of the CDQ fixed gear allocation and the halibut quota allocated to each approved CDP (see
table below), and announces the availability of the Secretary's findings regarding this decision (see

 Notice of public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) will hold a 2-day public meeting on December 7-8, 1994,
to consider actions affecting the New England fisheries in the exclusive economic zone.


The meeting will be held at the King's Grant Inn, Route 128 and Trask Lane, Danvers, MA 01923; telephone: (508) 774-6800.
The meeting will begin on December 7, at 10:00 a.m. and on December 8, at 8:30 a.m.
The Council meeting on December 7 will begin with a report from the Interspecies Committee. Subjects scheduled for
discussion include a review of consolidation alternatives and the potential use of Special Management Areas in the
context of several proposals before the Council, involving aquaculture or similar projects.
The Lobster Committee will report in the afternoon on the management proposals forwarded by the Council's Effort
Management Teams. In addition, it will discuss any recommendations concerning a change in the qualifications for
limited access permits. There will be an update on the outcome of the recent International Commission for the Conservation
of Atlantic Tunas Advisory Committee meeting. This will be followed by a recommendation from the Monkfish Committee
to approve a control date for the limited access monkfish fishery.
On December 8, the Groundfish Committee will review the results of Committee discussions about the use of time and
area closures to address the decline of key groundfish stocks and about the timetable for Amendment #7 to the Northeast
Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). During the afternoon session, the Sea Scallop Committee will recommend
initiation of the scoping process in preparation for a possible plan amendment to address consolidation in the scallop
fishery. The day will conclude with reports from the Council Chairman and Vice Chairman, Council Executive Director,
NMFS Regional Director, Northeast Fisheries Science Center liaison, Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council
liaison, and Coast Guard.


Abbreviated Rulemaking Action_Northeast Multispecies


The Council will consider final action on an adjustment to the Multispecies FMP under the framework for abbreviated
rulemaking contained in 50 CFR 651.40. The Council will accept comments on a framework adjustment that would exempt
from the permit-splitting prohibition those vessels subject to having multispecies permits cancelled that were
acquired prior to the implementation date of Amendment #5. This measure would retain the permit-splitting prohibition
from being implemented retroactively. This would be the second and final Council meeting under the process for framework
adjustments. If the Regional Director for the Northeast Region concurs with the Council's recommendation, NMFS
will publish them as a final rule in the 

Federal Register

.


Abbreviated Rulemaking Action_Atlantic Sea Scallops


The Council will consider initial action on two adjustments to the Sea Scallop FMP under the framework for abbreviated
rulemaking contained in 59 CFR 650.40. The Council will accept comments on a framework adjustment that would extend
indefinitely the maximum crew size limit of seven people for sea scallop vessels. The purpose of the measure is to supplement
other efforts to reduce the catch of small scallops and protect aggregations of small scallops in the Mid-Atlantic
region.
The second framework adjustment would prohibit any limited-access scallop vessel from fishing with nets, unless
the vessel has not used a scallop dredge since 1987, and also prohibit the use of twine tops. The intended effect is to
prevent scallop dredge vessels from using nets to catch sea scallops.
The Council meeting will conclude after a discussion about the structure of the effective use of advisory committees.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Issuance of Modification 3 to Scientific Research Permit 818 (P211C).





On September 8, 1994, an application was filed by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for a Modification
to their scientific research Permit 818. ODFW requested an increase in the number of their authorized take of endangered
Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (

Oncorhynchus

 

tshawytscha

), for the period 1994-95 only, as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)
and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). ODFW requested an increase
in the take of listed fish, because an unexpectedly high production of juveniles in 1994, partially attributed to
recent progeny production from listed Rapid River Hatchery adults passed above the hatchery to spawn, is resulting
in greater capture numbers and associated indirect mortality. The juvenile salmon's larger than expected escapement
in the spring of 1995 allows ODFW to increase the sample size for their research.
Notice is hereby given that on November 16, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification
3 to Permit 818 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein.
Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith;
(2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent
with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is
subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.
The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following
offices, by appointment:
Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, NOAA, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3226 (301-713-1401);
and

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the
Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on
December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Export Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes dated September 20, 1993
and June 8, 1994, between the Governments of the United States and Qatar; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive
Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on January 1, 1995, entry into the
Customs territory of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico) for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend
and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in Categories 200-239, 300-369, 400-469,
600-670 and 800-899, including part categories and merged categories 338/339/638/639, produced or
manufactured in Qatar and exported from Qatar on and after January 1, 1995 for which the Government of Qatar has not
issued an appropriate export visa fully described below. Should additional categories, merged categories or part
categories be added to the bilateral agreement, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the
coverage of this arrangement on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period January 1, 1995 through
January 31, 1995 shall not be denied entry for lack of a visa.

A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking
in blue ink will appear on the front of the original commercial invoice. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate
copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into
the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose.

Each visa stamp shall include the following information:

1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical
digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for Qatar is ``QA''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying
the shipment; e.g., 5QA123456.

2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued.

3. The signature of the issuing official.

4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment
as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation (e.g., ``Cat. 340-510 DOZ'').

Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise
may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the
actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise,
the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348'').

U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature,
category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in
any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the
quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered
shall be charged to any applicable quota.

The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered
by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document.

If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of Qatar, or a visa waiver may be issued
by the U.S. Department of Commerce at the request of the Government of Qatar, and presented to the U.S. Customs Service
before any portion of the shipment will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa
with the shipment. It does not waive the quota requirement.

If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct
category limit. If a shipment from Qatar has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United States with either an
incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall charge the shipment to
the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided.

Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked
commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry.

A facsimile of the visa stamp is enclosed with this letter.

The actions taken concerning the Government of Qatar with respect to imports of textiles and textile products in the
foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements to involve
foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the Commissioner of Customs, which
are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs exception to the rulemaking
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the 

Federal Register

Notice of public hearing on draft environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), in cooperation with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as the state lead agency, will hold a public hearing on a draft environmental
impact statement/environmental impact report EIS/EIR) for the California Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate
(ATOC) Project and its associated Marine Mammal Research Program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 3, 1994 notice was published in the 

Federal Register 

(49 FR 22822) that the ARPA, in cooperation with the NMFS, intended to prepare an EIS, pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), on an application for a scientific research permit to allow harassment of marine mammals and sea
turtles by a low frequency sound source associated with the ATOC program in California waters, and to monitor the effects
thereof. The ATOC project is a basin scale research effort to determine long-term ocean climate changes by using acoustic
sound paths in the sea's deep ``sound channel'' to precisely measure average ocean temperatures. A two-year research
program is proposed to be carried out to study any potential effects of the ATOC sound transmissions on marine mammals
and sea turtles. Two sound sources are currently proposed; one offshore California near Point Sur (which is the subject
of this Draft EIS/EIR) and the other off the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii (the subject of a separate draft EIS).

Garbage Discharges From Navy Ships in MARPOL Annex V Special Areas



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Defense.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under Section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law 103-160, the Secretary
of Defense must report annually in years 1994 through 2000 on the amount and nature of garbage discharges from Navy
ships operating in special areas, when such discharges are not otherwise authorized under Annex V of the International
Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). This notice is published to comply with the act and
is the first annual report.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from ships (MARPOL), 1973, as amended by the MARPOL Protocol
of 1978, protects the ocean environment by prohibiting some discharges altogether, restricting other discharges
to particular distances from land, and establishing ``special areas'' within which additional discharge limitations
apply. Special areas are particular bodies of water which, because of their oceanographic characteristics and ecological
significance, require protective measures more strict than other areas of the ocean. Within special areas that are
in effect internationally, except under emergency circumstances the only authorized garbage discharge from vessels
is food waste. At present, three special areas are in effect: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Antarctic Region.




Section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law 103-160, 107 Stat. 1745,
established deadlines for compliance by U.S. Navy ships with the Annex V special area requirements. Surface ships
must comply with the special area requirements by December 31st of the year 2000. Submarines must comply with the special
area requirements by December 31st of the year 2008. The Act further requires the Secretary of Defense to report in
the 

Federal Register

 the amount and nature of Navy ship discharges in special areas, not otherwise authorized under MARPOL Annex V. Such
reports are to be submitted on October 1 of the years 1994 through 2000.

This 

Federal Register

 notice is the first of the required annual reports. This report covers the period between November 30th 1993 (the date
on which the National Defense Authorization Act was enacted), and July 31st 1994. The end date of July 31st is necessary
to allow time for data collection and report preparation. Subsequent year reports will cover the period from August
1st through July 31st. During the period of November 30, 1993 through July 31, 1994, there were no garbage discharges
from Navy ships into MARPOL Annex V special areas that were not authorized under MARPOL Annex V.

<DOCTITLE>State of California, Division of Oil and Gas Tight Formation Area Determination FERC No. JD93-00528T (California-2);
Notice of Preliminary Finding</DOCTITLE>


Issued November 18, 1994


On October 26, 1992, the State of California, Division of Oil and Gas (California) determined that three zones (the
Lower Reef Ridge, Antelope and McDonald Zones) in the Lost Hills Field, in Kern County, California, qualify as tight
formations under Section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).
 Chevron USA Inc. (Chevron) is the applicant before California.




By letter dated December 10, 1992, staff tolled the Commission's 45-day review period and requested additional support
for California's conclusion that the three zones meet the Commission's tight formation guidelines in  271.703(c)(2)
of the Commission's regulations.
 Staff requested additional information, in part, because an article entitled ``

Diagenetically Enhanced Entrapment of Hydrocarbons_Southeastern Lost Hills Fractured Shale Pool, Kern County,
California

'' indicates that part of the recommended area is considered to be the productive heart of both the Upper Antelope shale
and Lower Reef Ridge shale pools, and that wells in this area exhibit excellent prestimulation oil and gas production
rates (and/or oil and gas shows) that are indicative of effective permeability due natural fractures.
 Staff also stated that, since Commission records indicate that the Antelope and McDonald Zones in the Lost Hills Field
have been water flooded, staff is unable to ascertain whether the current oil and gas flow rates represent the initial


in situ

 permeability and prestimulation flow rare characteristics of the subject zones, or represent conditions resulting
from the production and partial depletion of undersaturated oil reservoirs in the Lost Hills Field.





California responded to the tolling letter on June 29, 1993. However, the response did not include all the information
requested in the December 10, 1992 tolling letter and did not contain some enclosures that Chevron submitted to California.
In addition, staff review showed several discrepancies between California's response and the history of the development
of the Lost Hills Field, as described in the 1983 Article. Accordingly, staff's August 13, 1993 letter requested the
missing enclosures, plus additional information to resolve the discrepancies and retolled the Commission's 45-day
review.
To date, neither California nor Chevron has responded to the August 13, 1993 letter. Without the requested information,
we are unable to find that California's determination is supported by substantial evidence. Under  275.202(a)
of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination becomes final, that
the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Therefore, the Commission hereby makes
a preliminary finding that California's determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record upon
which it was made.
 California or Chevron may, within 30 days from the date of this preliminary finding, submit written comments and request
an informal conference with the Commission, pursuant to  275.202(f) of the regulations. A final Commission
order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance of this preliminary finding.




By Direction of the Commission.

pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>






Office of Research and Development; Ambient Air Monitoring Reference and Equivalent Methods; Reference Method
Designation




Notice is hereby given that EPA, in accordance with 40 CFR part 53, has designated another reference method for the
measurement of ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. The new reference method is an automated method (analyzer)
which utilizes the measurement principle (gas phase chemiluminescence) and calibration procedure specified in
appendix F of 40 CFR part 50. The new designated method is identified as follows:




RFNA-1194-099, ``Advanced Pollution Instrumentation, Inc. Model 200A Nitrogen Oxides Analyzer,''
operated on any full scale range between 0-0.05 ppm and 0-1.0 ppm, at any temperature in the range of 5
 C to 40
 C, with a 5-micron TFE filter element installed in the filter assembly, with either a user- or vendor-supplied
vacuum pump capable of providing an absolute pressure no greater than 10 inches mercury at 1 slpm, with the following
software settings: Dynamic Zero: OFF; Dynamic Span: OFF; Cal-on-NO

2

: OFF; Dilution factor: 1.0; AutoCal: ON or OFF; Independent Range: ON or OFF; AutoRange: ON or OFF; Temp/Pres Compensation:
ON; and with or without any of the following options:




Rack Mount with Slides

Rack Mount without Slides, Ears Only

Rack Mount for External Pump without Slide Tray

Stainless Steel Zero/Span Valves

Internal Zero/Span with Valves (IZS)

Permeation Tubes for IZS

4-20 mA Isolated Outputs

Digital Status Outputs

RS-232 Outputs






Note:

 In addition to the U.S. electrical power voltage and frequency, this analyzer is approved for use, with proper factory
configuration, on 50 Hertz line frequency and any of the following voltage ranges: 200-242 Vac (220 volts nominal);
216-264 Vac (240 volts nominal).




This method is available from Advanced Pollution Instrumentation, Inc., 8815 Production Avenue, San Diego, California
92121-2219. A notice of receipt of application for this method appeared in the 

Federal Register

, Volume 59, August 23, 1994, page 43342.

A test analyzer representative of this method has been tested by the applicant, in accordance with the test procedures
specified in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submitted by the applicant,
EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this method should be designated as a reference method. The information
submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with
40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act).

As a designated reference method, this method is acceptable for use by States and other air monitoring agencies under
requirements of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes, the method must be used in strict
accordance with the operation or instruction manual associated with the method and subject to any limitations (e.g.,
operating range) specified in the applicable designation (see description of the method above). Vendor modifications
of a designated method used for purposes of part 58 are permitted only with prior approval of EPA, as provided in part
53. Provisions concerning modification of such methods by users are specified under section 2.8 of appendix C to 40
CFR part 58 (Modifications of Methods by Users).

In general, this designation applies to any analyzer which is identical to the analyzer described in the designation.
In many cases, similar analyzers manufactured prior to the designation may be upgraded (e.g., by minor modification
or by substitution of a new operation or instruction manual) so as to be identical to the designated method and thus
achieve designation status at a modest cost. The manufacturer should be consulted to determine the feasibility of
such upgrading.

Part 53 requires that sellers of designated methods comply with certain conditions. These conditions are given in
40 CFR 53.9 and are summarized below:

(1) A copy of the approved operation or instruction manual must accompany the analyzer when it is delivered to the ultimate
purchaser.

(2) The analyzer must not generate any unreasonable hazard to operators or to the environment.

(3) The analyzer must function within the limits of the performance specifications given in table B-1 of part
53 for at least one year after delivery when maintained and operated in accordance with the operation manual.

(4) Any analyzer offered for sale as a reference or equivalent method must bear a label or sticker indicating that it
has been designated as a reference or equivalent method in accordance with part 53.

(5) If such an analyzer has two or more selectable ranges, the label or sticker must be placed in close proximity to the
range selector and indicate which range or ranges have been included in the reference or equivalent method designation.

(6) An applicant who offers analyzers for sale as reference or equivalent and to notify them within 30 days if a reference
or equivalent method designation methods is required to maintain a list of ultimate purchasers of such analyzers
applicable to the analyzer has been canceled or if adjustment of the analyzers is necessary under 40 CFR 53.11(b) to
avoid a cancellation.

(7) An applicant who modifies an analyzer previously designated as a reference or equivalent method is not permitted
to sell the analyzer (as modified) as a reference or equivalent method (although he may choose to sell it without such
representation), nor to attach a label or sticker to the analyzer (as modified) under the provisions described above,
until he has received notice under 40 CFR 53.14(c) that the original designation or a new designation applies to the
method as modified or until he has applied for and received notice under 40 CFR 53.8(b) of a new reference or equivalent
method determination for the analyzer as modified.

Aside from occasional breakdowns or malfunctions, consistent or repeated noncompliance with any of these conditions
should be reported to: Director, Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Department E (MD-77),
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711.

Designation of this reference method will provide assistance to the States in establishing and operating their air
quality surveillance systems under part 58. Technical questions concerning the method should be directed to the
manufacturer. Additional information concerning this action may be obtained from Frank F. McElroy, Methods Research
and Development Division (MD-77), Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, (919) 541-2622.

 This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless

 v. 

Veterans Administration,

 No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).


Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed by Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to William
Molster at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.
For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e.,

 acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: U.S. Navy: John J. Kane, Deputy Division Director, Dept. of Navy,

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 



The National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701-1749aaa-5) (the Act) authorizes and governs the Department's
mortgage insurance program. Section 221 of the Act permits certain HUD-insured mortgagees to assign the original
credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument to the Secretary of HUD. Section 221(g)(4)(A)
sets forth the two requirements for mortgage assignment. The commitment to insure must have been entered into prior
to November 30, 1983. Secondly, the mortgage must not be ``in default at the expiration of twenty years from the date
the mortgage was endorsed for insurance.'' 

Section 221(g)(4)(C), which was added by section 336 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-625,
approved November 28, 1990), authorizes the Secretary to conduct a multifamily project mortgage auction in lieu
of accepting the mortgage assignments. Section 221(g)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) of the Act states that the Secretary ``[s]hall
accept the lowest interest rate bid for purchase that the Secretary deems acceptable.'' Section 221(g)(4)(C)(ii)(IV)
also mandates that ``[t]he 
Secretary shall cause the accepted bid to be published in the 

Federal Register

.'' 

On October 20, 1994, the Department conducted the fourth multifamily project mortgage auction. All 111 projects
mortgages in the auction were sold to one bidder. In accordance with section 221(g)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) of the Act, the
Department is publishing details concerning the accepted bid, as follows:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on a 
mining Plan of Operations for Newmont Gold Company in Eureka and Elko 
Counties, Nevada; and notice of scoping period and public meetings. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 and 43 CFR Part 3809, the Bureau of Land Management will be 
directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third-party contractor 
on the impacts of a proposed Plan of Operations for gold mining by Newmont 
Gold Company, in Eureka and Elko Counties, Nevada. The Bureau invites 
comments on the scope of the analysis.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Newmont Gold Company of Carlin, Nevada, has 
submitted a Plan of Operations to re-open their Bootstrap open pit mine and 
initiate mining at the Tara open pit mine, located 1,500 feet south of 
Bootstrap. The proposed mines and associated facilities are located in 
portions of Sections 2, 3, 10, 11, 14, and 15 of Township 36 North, Range 49 
East, MDM; approximately 30 air miles northwest of Carlin, Nevada. Newmont 
developed the Bootstrap open pit mine in 1974, and the heap leach facility in 
1977. Operations were conducted through 1984. Newmont performed closure and 
reclamation procedures on the leach facility during 1987 and 1988. The 
proposal is to re-open the Bootstrap pit and develop the new Tara pit, create 
two new waste dumps, develop a new heap leach facility, and reroute and 
upgrade the existing access and haulage roads. Following public notice and 
comment, Newmont acquired a permit from the Army Corp of Engineers to divert 
Boulder Creek around the planned mining activities. Diversion construction 
has commenced on private land and is expected to be completed in early 1995. 
Previous surface disturbance was to 121 acres of public land and 153 acres of 
private land. Part of the proposed operation would be confined to previously 
disturbed areas. Additional surface disturbance is anticipated on 
approximately 802 acres of public land and 288 acres of private land. 



The issues expected to be analyzed in the EIS include potential impacts to 
cultural resources, wildlife, pit water quality, air quality, soils, 
vegetation, hazardous materials, paleontology, and social and economic values. 
Cumulative impacts will also be addressed. In addition, the following 
resources will be analyzed: recreation and wilderness, geology, range 
management, lands and realty, visual resources, and land use planning. The 
analysis will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team. 

A range of alternatives (including but not limited to alternative reclamation 
measures and the no-action alternative) will be developed to address the 
issues. Mitigating measures will be considered to minimize environmental 
impacts and to assure that the proposed action does not result in undue or 
unnecessary degradation of public lands. 

Federal, state and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who 
may be interested in or affected by the Bureau's decision on the Plan of 
Operations are invited to participate in the scoping process with respect to 
this environmental impact analysis. These entities and individuals are also 
invited to submit comments on the DEIS. 

It is important that those interested in the Plan of Operations participate in 
the scoping and commenting process. Comments should be as specific as 
possible. 



The tentative project schedule is as follows: 




Begin Public Comment Period_December 1994 
Issuance of Draft Environmental Impact Statement_Summer of 1995 
File Final Environmental Impact Statement_Winter of 1995/1996 
Record of Decision_Winter of 1995/1996 
Begin Construction of Operation_Spring of 1996 




The Bureau of Land Management's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) 
Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable 
alternatives; (3) Notification of interested groups, individuals and agencies 
so that additional information concerning these issues, or other additional 
issues, can be obtained.

 Bureau of Land Management, Klamath Falls Resource Area.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability of Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Klamath
Falls Resource Area of the Lakeview District, Oregon.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, section 202(f) of the Federal Land
Policy and Management Act of 1976, and 43 CFR part 1610, a proposed final resource management plan/environmental
impact statement (RMP/EIS) for the Klamath Falls Resource Area of the Lakeview District, Oregon, has been prepared
and is available to the public. The RMP/EIS describes and analyzes future options for managing approximately 212,000
acres of partially forested public land and 21,000 acres of non-federal surface ownership with federal mineral estate
administered by the Bureau of Land Management in Klamath County, just east of the Cascade Range in southern Oregon.






PUBLIC PARTICIPATION: 

The draft RMP/EIS was available for public review from August 21, 1992 to December 15, 1992. Written comments were
received from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Oral comments were also heard in four public meetings,
and at numerous meetings with interested groups, organizations, and individuals. The four public meetings were
held in Klamath Falls, Keno, and Bonanza, Oregon. In addition, numerous meetings and formal briefings were held by
Oregon BLM State Office personnel. All comments provided were considered during the preparation of the proposed
final RMP/EIS. 


Copies of the proposed final RMP/EIS and a summary of it may be obtained from the Klamath Falls Resource Area office.
Public reading copies will be available for review at the public libraries in Klamath Falls (Oregon) and Redding (California),
the Klamath County Office Building, all government document depository libraries, all BLM State Offices, most BLM
District Offices, and at the following BLM locations:






Office of External Affairs, Main Interior Building, Room 5600, 18th and C Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20240 
Public Room, Oregon State Office, 1515 S.W. 5th, Portland, Oregon 97201






The Klamath Falls Resource Area BLM will host an open house for the public on Wednesday, November 30, 1994 from 4 to 7
p.m. and Thursday December 1, 1994 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Staff will be available to answer questions, clarify confusing
points, explain rationales, discuss points of concern, and generally assist the public in understanding the proposed
plan. The open house will be held at the Klamath Falls Resource Area BLM office at 2795 Anderson Avenue, Building 25,
Klamath Falls, Oregon. 
Protests should be sent to the Director (760), Bureau of Land Management, 18th Street, N.W., Washington D.C. 20240,
within the 30 day protest period. The period for filing a plan protest begins when the Environmental Protection Agency
publishes in the 

Federal Register

 its Notice of Availability of the final environmental impact statement concerning the proposed resource management
plan or amendment. The protest and comment period will end 30 days after the Environmental Protection Agency publishes
its Notice of Availability in the 

Federal Register

, or on December 27, 1994, whichever is later. There are some restrictions on the protest process, so anyone wishing
to protest needs to carefully read the introductory letter to the document. To be considered complete, your protest
must contain, at a minimum, the following information:






The name, mailing address, telephone number, and interest of the person filing the protest. 
A statement of the issue or issues being protested. 
A statement of the part or parts of the plan being protested. 
A copy of all documents addressing the issue or issues that were submitted during the planning process, or a reference
to the date the issue or issues were discussed for the record. 
A concise statement explaining why the BLM State Director's decision is believed to be incorrect.






At the end of the 30-day protest period, the BLM may issue a Record of Decision approving implementation of any portions
of the proposed plan not under protest. Approval will be withheld on any portion of the plan under protest, until the
protest has been resolved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed final RMP/EIS describes and analyzes seven alternatives to resolve the following issues: (1) Timber
production practices, (2) old growth forests and habitat diversity, (3) threatened and endangered and other special
status species habitat (including habitat for the northern spotted owl), (4) special management areas, (5) visual
resources, (6) stream/riparian/water quality, (7) recreation resources, (8) wild and scenic rivers, (9) land tenure,
(10) rural interface areas, (11) range management, and (12) proposed hydroelectric or alternative energy projects.
The issues are analyzed in seven distinct alternatives that range from high resource production to high resource
protection. 


The overall objective of the plan is to manage the resources in the Klamath Falls Resource Area on an ecosystem basis.
Within that ecosystem management framework, the proposed final resource management plan would maintain or improve
water quality through a system of Riparian Reserves and best management practices. 
Approximately 51,400 acres would be managed for timber production, with restrictions to protect or enhance other
resource values. The annual probable timber sale quantity would be 1.11 million cubic feet or 6.31 million boardfeet
(1.03 mmcf or 5.91 MMBF west of Highway 97 and 0.08 mmcf or 0.40 MMBF east of Highway 97). To contribute to biological
diversity, standing trees, snags, and dead and down woody material would be retained. 
Management would provide 12,978 animal unit months in the livestock grazing program. 
In addition to protecting listed or proposed threatened and endangered species as required by the Endangered Species
Act, the BLM would manage habitats of federal candidate, state listed, and Bureau sensitive species to maintain their
populations at a level that would avoid federal listing. 
Management would provide for a wide variety of recreation opportunities, with particular emphasis on enhancement
of opportunities for dispersed recreation activities including hunting, fishing, and hiking, as well as providing
outdoor recreation activities in areas that 
are both close to population centers and accessible by vehicles. 
Most BLM-administered lands would remain available for mineral leasing and location, but 300 acres would be closed
to leasing for oil and gas and geothermal resources, and 6,400 acres would be closed to location of mining claims. 
The proposed final RMP/EIS proposes designation of four new areas of critical environmental concern with the noted
restrictions. 






The Miller Creek area would be designated an area of critical environmental concern to maintain, protect, and/or
restore natural processes, wildlife, and scenic values. The area would not be available to planned timber harvest.
Livestock grazing would be restricted. Mineral leasing would be subject to no surface occupancy. The area would be
closed to off-highway vehicle use (except Round Valley Road area).

The upper Klamath River area, from rim to rim, would be designated an area of critical environmental concern to maintain,
protect, and/or restore historic, cultural, scenic, fisheries, and wildlife populations and habitat. The area
would not be available for planned timber harvest. Off-highway vehicle use would be limited to designated roads.
Grazing would continue at or near current levels. Mineral leasing would be subject to no surface occupancy. The area
would not be available for hydroelectric development. The area would be managed for semi-primitive motorized recreation
opportunities.

The Yainax Butte area would be designated an area of critical environmental concern to maintain, protect, and/or
restore natural process and systems. The area would not be available for planned timber harvest. The area would be
open to livestock grazing, but could be fenced if necessary to protect plant communities. Off-highway vehicle use
would be limited to existing roads. Mineral leasing would be subject to no surface occupancy. The area would be managed
for semi-primitive motorized recreation opportunities.

The Old Baldy area would be designated an area of critical environmental concern/research natural area to preserve,
protect, and/or restore natural processes or systems. The area would not be available for timber harvest, firewood,
or salvage sales. The area would be closed to off-highway vehicle use. The area would remain free of cattle use. Mineral
leasing would be subject to no surface occupancy and closed to mineral entry. The area would be managed for semi-primitive
motorized recreation opportunities.

There were five potential areas of critical environmental concern identified that met the Bureau area of critical
environmental concern criteria of relevance and importance that are not included in the proposed final resource
management plan for various reasons. They include: Surveyor Forest Area, 150 acres; Tunnel Creek, 280 acres; Spencer
Creek, 320 acres; The Bumpheads, 50 acres; and Pacific Crest Trail, 620 acres.

One river segment covering 11.0 miles was found suitable for designation under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act, and 23.2 miles of rivers that were found eligible for designation and studied by the BLM were found not suitable
for designation in the proposed final resource management plan. After the proposed resource management plan went
to press, the Secretary of the Interior designated the 11.0 miles of the upper Klamath River as scenic under section
2(a)(ii) of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This designation was signed by the Secretary of the Interior on
September 22, 1994. Designation of the upper Klamath River is not protestable in the RMP protest period as the Oregon
State Director of the BLM does not have the authority to overturn a decision made by the Secretary of the Interior.

Public participation has occurred throughout the planning process. A Notice of Intent was filed in the 

Federal Register

, in September 1992. Since that time, several public meetings, mailings, and briefings were conducted to solicit
comments and ideas. The comments provided throughout the process have been considered.

This Notice meets the requirements of 43 CFR 1610.7-2 for designation of areas of critical environmental concern
and the requirements of the final revised Department of the Interior_Department of Agriculture Guidelines for Eligibility,
Classification, and Management of Rivers (FR Vol. 47, No. 173, pg. 39454).

AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc., Houston, TX; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration



The Department is revising its initial denial of eligibility for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) for workers of
the subject firm as a result of a voluntary remand from the U.S. Court of International Trade in 

Former Employees of AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc

., v. 

Secretary of Labor

 (USCIT 94-01-00025).

Investigation findings show AGIP Petroleum produced crude oil and natural gas in approximately the same dollar amount
during the relevant period.

The workers were denied TAA because the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements
of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally determined through a survey of the workers' firm's major declining
customers.

On reconsideration the Department obtained information not previously available regarding a major crude oil customer.
The customer was a major importer of crude oil in 1993 who substantially increased its import purchases of crude oil
in 1993 compared to 1992 while decreasing its purchases from AGIP Petroleum Company.

U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in 1993 compared
to 1992 and in the latest 12-month period ending in June 1994.

Investigation findings show that AGIP Petroleum had declining sales in the first six months of 1993 compared to the
same period in 1992. Substantial worker separations occurred in 1993.



Conclusion



After careful review of the additional facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that increased imports
of articles like or directly competitive with the crude oil and natural gas produced at AGIP Petroleum Company contributed
importantly to the decline in sales and to the total or partial separation of workers at AGIP Petroleum Company in Houston,
Texas. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination:




``All workers of AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc., Houston, Texas who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after August 20, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

<DOCTITLE>James River Corp.; Old Town, ME; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On October 7, 1994, after being granted a filing extension, the company requested administrative reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment
Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 8, 1993 (59 FR 40370).

The company, stated among other things, that it is losing its market share of wood pulp to imported wood pulp. The company
also submitted information showing decreased sales, in value, during the relevant period.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Vought Aircraft Company A/K/A LTV Aerospace & Defense Company Dallas, TX; Notice of Revised Determination on
Reopening </DOCTITLE>



On November 9, 1994, the Department, at the request of the company reopened its investigation for the workers and former
workers of the subject firm in Dallas, Texas. The initial investigation resulted in a negative determination on February
24, 1994 and was published in the Federal Register 

on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11326). 

Findings on reopening show that a sufficient amount of aircraft subassembly work has been offloaded overseas and
imported back to the subject firm. Sales at the subject firm decreased in 1993 compared to 1992. Substantial worker
separations occurred at the subject firm in 1993 and 1994. 

Further, several appropriate subdivisions (job families at Vought Aircraft, a/k/a LTV Aerospace & Defense
Company in Dallas) have already been certified to TAA under petitions TA-W-30,166, TA-W-30-167,
TA-W-30,202, TA-W-30,249 and TA-W-29,856. These certifications will be terminated
and the workers will be covered under TA-W-29,206. Vought Aircraft workers certified under TA-W-28,470
are not affected by this notice. 



Conclusion 



After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, its is concluded that increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with the aircraft subassemblies contributed importantly to the decline in sales or
production and to the total or partial separation of workers at the subject facility. In accordance with the provisions
of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination:

 


All workers and former workers of Vought Aircraft Company, Dallas, Texas, except workers certified under TA-W-28,470,
who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after October 6, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. The following certifications are terminated TA-W-30,166;
TA-W-30,167; TA-W-30,202; TA-W-30,249 and TA-W-29,856 effective
November 16, 1994. Certification TA-W-28,470 is not affected by this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

notice. Also, consistent with 29 CFR 1.6(c)(2)(i)(A), when the opening of bids is less than ten (10) days from the date

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station); Exemption



I



The Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-36,
which authorizes operation of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station (the facility). The license provides, among other
things, that the facility is subject to all the rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The facility is a pressurized water reactor located on the licensee's
site in Lincoln County, Maine.



II



The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR part 73, appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a), ``Vision,'' specifies in part
that: For each individual (security officer), distant visual acuity in each eye shall be correctable to 20/30 (Snellen
or equivalent) in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with eyeglasses or contact lenses. At the time of their employment
in 1989 and 1990, the two security officers, who are the subject of the licensee's exemption request dated August 5,
1994, were screened using a licensee-generated form that was based on the requirements of Appendix B to 10 CFR part
73. However, the form did not properly reflect the correct distance visual acuity requirements of the ``other eye.''
On July 28, 1994, the discrepancy between the licensee's form and the requirements of 10 CFR part 73, Appendix B, Section
I.B.b.(1)(a) was noted for the first officer. A review of the visual examination records for all security officers
found a second instance in which the distant visual acuity requirement was not met for another security officer.

The licensee's letter of August 5, 1994, requested an exemption from the distant visual acuity requirement of 10 CFR
part 73, appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a) for two security officers who do not meet this requirement in one eye.



III



Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant an exemption from the requirements of this part as it determines is authorized by
law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest.
The licensee has provided expert professional medical opinions asserting that each officer has normal peripheral
vision, normal peripheral depth perception, and normal binocular acuity. Further, each security officer uses the
right eye for firearms siting and each currently tests 20/20 in the right eye. Finally, the licensee has committed
to have each security officer's vision tested by its optometrist every 6 months to ensure no significant visual deterioration
occurs. The criteria to establish that no significant visual deterioration has occurred will be:

1. Vision in the better eye will be at least 20/30 corrected or uncorrected.
2. Vision in the other eye will be monitored. If eyesight in the other eye should worsen, immediate testing will be performed
to demonstrate that the individual is physically capable of meeting all the requirements of the Maine Yankee Security
Training and Qualification Plan prior to being reassigned duties of an armed security officer. (This testing will
include the complete firearms qualification course.)

3. The remaining vision criteria of 10 CFR part 73, appendix B will be met or exceeded.



IV



For the foregoing reasons, Commission has determined that the proposed vision examination and criteria to establish
that no significant visual deterioration has occurred, would not result in a reduction in the physical protection
capabilities for the protection of special nuclear material_either on site or in transit_or of Maine Yankee Atomic
Power Station.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, this exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest.

Therefore, the Commission hereby grants the following exemption: The requirement of 10 CFR part 73, appendix B, Section
I.B.b(1)(a) that each individual (security officer) have distant visual acuity in each eye correctable to 20/30
(Snellen or equivalent) in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with eyeglasses or contact lenses, is no longer
necessary for the two subject security officers. Thus, these two security officers may be returned to duties of an
armed security officer at Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station, subject to the vision testing commitment and criteria
of Section III. above.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 56096 dated November 10, 1994).
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NUREG-1122, ``Knowledge and Abilities Catalog for Nuclear Power Plant Operators: Pressurized Water Reactors,''
and NUREG-1123, ``Knowledge and Abilities Catalog for Nuclear Power Plant Operators: Boiling Water Reactors,''
were developed in 1985 to assist operator licensing examiners in the development of content valid written and operating
examinations to administer to reactor plant operators and senior operators.



The Knowledge and Abilities (K/A) catalogs have been revised to resolve inconsistencies between the two catalogs
and inconsistencies in content within the K/A catalogs. The revision also incorporates evolutionary changes in
the operator licensing program and revised definition of operator's tasks within facility licensee's organizations.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held public workshops on August 2-5, 1994, and conducted discussions
regarding the draft revisions to the K/A catalogs. The results of the workshops have been incorporated into a draft
revision to the K/A catalogs. 

The Commission believes that it would be beneficial to obtain public comment on this revision from all interested
parties. After considering public comments, the NRC staff expects to issue the revised K/A catalogs for use in operator
licensing examinations.

National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of change of proficiency testing standard.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department
of Commerce, began a joint effort in 1981 through an Interagency Agreement to provide an accreditation program for
processors of personnel dosimeters, now known as the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP)
for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry. The purpose of this notice is to acknowledge publication of a revised proficiency
testing standard for the NVLAP, to inform the public and dosimetry processors of this action, to provide an effective
date for use of the revised standard, to identify significant changes in the standard and request public comments
on use of the standard.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The NRC's regulations ( 20.1501), require that all personnel dosimeters that require processing must be processed
and evaluated by a dosimetry processor holding current personnel dosimetry accreditation from the National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Proficiency
testing, required as part of the NVLAP accreditation process for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry, is based upon American
National Standard ANSI N13.11-1983, ``Personnel Dosimetry Performance_Criteria for Testing'' as specified
in NIST Handbook 150-4. A revision to this ANSI standard was approved by the American National Standards Institute,
Inc., in September 1993, and published as ANSI N13.11-1993 in July 1994. The revision embodies changes in the
following irradiation categories: Category III, low energy photons; Category V, beta particles; Category VIII,
neutron-photon mixtures; and adds a new Category IX, angle of incidence.



Accreditation under the NVLAP for Ionizing Radiation Dosimetry is renewed annually, with proficiency testing taking
place every 2 years after the initial test. To prevent the possible loss of accreditation that could occur as a result
of changing from the original test standard ANSI N13.11-1983, to the revised standard ANSI N13.11-1993,
the NRC and NIST/NVLAP intend to institute a phase-in period of testing against the revised standard, beginning January
1, 1995. During this phase-in period, dosimetry processing laboratories will be tested against the revised standard
when their normal accreditation proficiency testing date comes due. Any laboratory that fails the proficiency test
due to changes made in the revised standard will not have their current accreditation suspended, but will be required
to retest and pass those failed categories before January 31, 1997, in order to maintain accredited status.

Any failure of proficiency testing during this phase-in period that is not attributable to changes in the test standard,
however, could affect the processing laboratory's accreditation status.

The revised standard, ANSI N13.11-1993, will be implemented as published with the following exceptions:

(1) Categories III(a), III(b) and VI. The requirement for choosing a primary low energy source and at least one other
source from Category III as described in the standard will not be used. For each group of dosimeters tested, the source
used will be randomly selected from the five sources listed in Category III(a) or the three sources listed in Category
III(b), with the stipulation that for at least one of the groups, the source chosen will be either M150 or H150.

(2) Category VIIIB testing will not be provided initially because a suitable source with traceability to NIST is not
available at the present time.

(3) Category IX testing will be required only once for each dosimeter model that is to be tested in Category III or IV.
A retest will be required whenever the dosimeter design is hanged or the dose algorithm is modified.

<DOCTITLE>Draft NUREG: Issuance Availability</DOCTITLE>



On November 4, 1994 (59 FR 55299), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission published for public comment a draft report entitled
``Revised Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station'' (NUREG/CR-6174).
The draft report, prepared for the NRC by Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories (PNL), presented the results of
a review and reevaluation of the 1980 boiling water reactor (BWR) decommissioning study which addressed technology,
safety and cost issues associated with decommissioning a large nuclear power plant.

A request has been made by the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), which is an organization responsible for establishing
unified nuclear industry policy on matters affecting the nuclear energy industry, to extend the comment period because
of the importance of the decommissioning funding criteria. The NRC has no objections to this request and has agreed
to extend the comment period from December 23, 1994 to January 20, 1995.

As noted in the initial 

Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 55299), draft NUREG/CR-6174 should be viewed as a first step in developing a more parametric approach
to estimating decommissioning costs and comments on the usefulness of such an approach are requested.

Comments and suggestions on the draft NUREG/CR-6174 should be sent to the Rules Review and Directives Branch,
Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room
at 2120 L Street, NW., (Lower Level), Washington, DC.

Copies of draft NUREG/CR-6174 may be purchased from the Government Printing Office, P.O. Box 37082, Washington,
DC 20013-7082, telephone (202) 512-2249 or (202) 512-2171. Copies are also available from the National

<DOCTITLE>Draft Report: Availability</DOCTITLE>


The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is providing the public an opportunity to comment on a draft report entitled ``Estimated
Non-Radioactive Demolition and Site Restoration Costs for the Reference PWR Power Station.'' This draft report
was prepared for the NRC under subcontract to Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL). The report provides information
on the estimated cost to restore a reference PWR to a ``green field'' status.
This report should be viewed as a supplement to a previously published draft NUREG/CR-5884 entitled ``Revised
Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Pressurized Water Reactor Power Station.'' The staff plans to include
this draft report in the finalized version of NUREG/CR-5884 after all public comments are resolved. A similar
analysis was prepared and included in a recently released (59 FR 55299) draft NUREG/CR-6174 entitled ``Revised
Analyses of Decommissioning for the Reference Boiling Water Reactor Power Station'' which is out for public comment.
Single copies of the draft report may be obtained by written request from RPHEB Secretary, Office of Nuclear Regulatory
Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. A copy of the draft report is also available
for inspection and/or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company, et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1; Notice of Consideration
of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination,
and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-41, issued to the Arizona Public Service Company (APS or the licensee), for operation of the
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1, located in Maricopa County, Arizona.

The proposed amendment would add a note to the Palo Verde Unit 1 Technical Specification Table 3.7-2. The note
would allow continued operation of Unit 1 during Cycle 5 at 100 percent maximum steady state power level with one main
steam safety valve (MSSV) inoperable per steam generator. This note applies only during the current fuel cycle (Cycle
5) for Unit 1.

This amendment is being requested on an exigent basis to return Unit 1 to 100% power because the current condition (one
inoperable MSSV per SG), is limiting Unit 1 to 98.2% power until the next refueling outage (the next Unit 1 refueling,
Cycle 6, is scheduled for April 1995).

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:






Standard 1

_Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?

The proposed technical specification (TS) amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The primary pressure peaking events [loss of condenser vacuum
(LOCV), feedwater line break (FLB), and control element assembly (CEA) ejection events] were analyzed to provide
a comparison of pressure response using a base case with a moderator temperature coefficient (MTC) of 0.0 [delta
 K/K]/
 F and ten operable main steam safety valves (MSSVs) per steam generator (SG) and a second case using an MTC of ^1.0
E^4 [delta K/K]/
 F and nine operable MSSVs per SG. The analyses performed confirmed that the existing safety analysis (i.e.,
the analysis of record) for PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5 will remain valid for 102% rated thermal power operation with one MSSV
inoperable in each SG. That is, the reactor coolant system (RCS) and secondary system design pressure limits will
not be exceeded.

The analysis of the pressure peaking events was conservative and included the following:

(1) The actual MTC expected for full power operation for the remainder of PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5 is more negative, and
thus more beneficial, than the ^1.0 E^4 [delta K/K]/
 F used in the reanalysis (actual MTC measured on October 20, 1994 was ^2.039 E^4 [delta K/K]/
 F). Thus, the mitigating affect on peak system pressures would be expected to be even greater then those reported
herein.

(2) The core parameters used in the reanalysis (other than MTC) are generic and selected in the most adverse direction.
Less adverse cycle specific or time-in-cycle specific values were not used in the reanalysis of PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle
5.

(3) The inoperable MSSVs are assumed to be in the first bank of MSSVs which have the lowest lift setpoint pressure (i.e.,
1303 psia). In fact, one of the two MSSVs currently inoperable is from the third bank of MSSVs (with a higher lift setpoint
of 1370 psia) and the other MSSV is in the first bank. If the actual MSSV lift setpoint pressures had been simulated,
the results would be less adverse since there would be more relief capacity near the beginning of the event to reduce
the pressure peak.



Standard 2

_Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?

The proposed TS amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The analyses performed demonstrates that the current licensing basis analyses results remain valid
at 102% rated thermal power with one MSSV inoperable in each SG and that all safety system settings will remain unchanged.
The PVNGS TS currently allows operation at 98.2% Maximum Steady State Power Level (ACTION a. of Limiting Condition
for Operation 3.7.1.1) with one inoperable MSSV per SG. The analysis shows that for the current Unit 1 fuel cycle, operation
at 102% Maximum Steady State Power Level with one inoperable MSSV per SG is acceptable.



Standard 3

_Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed TS amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is no reduction in the
margin of safety since the analysis performed, crediting the remaining operable MSSVs, shows the results of the analysis
of record remain valid. That is, the RCS and secondary system design pressure limits will not be exceeded at 102% rated
thermal power with one MSSV inoperable in each SG. In addition, all other safety limits and safety system settings
remain unchanged. The actual MTC expected for full power operation for the remainder of PVNGS Unit 1, Cycle 5 is more
negative, and thus more beneficial, than the ^1.0 E^4 [delta
 K/K]/
 F used in the reanalysis study (actual MTC measured on October 20, 1994, was ^2.039 E^4 [delta K/K]/
 F).




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NR staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15-days
after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications, Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.
The filing of requests for hearing the petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By December 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona
85004. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Theodore R. Quay: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of the 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nancy C. Loftin, Esq., Corporate Secretary and Counsel, Arizona Public Service Company,
P.O. Box 53999, Mail Station 9068, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 22, 1994, which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,

<USDEPT>PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Request for Extension of Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Collection of Information Under 29 CFR Part

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for extension of OMB approval.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has requested extension of approval
by the Office of Management and Budget for a currently approved collection of information (1212-0035) contained
in its regulation on Allocating Unfunded Vested Benefits (29 CFR Part 2642). Current approval of the collection of
information expires on December 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This collection of information is contained in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (``PBGC's'') regulation
on Allocating Unfunded Vested Benefits (29 CFR Part 2642).



Section 4211(c)(5)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') requires the PBGC to prescribe
by regulation a procedure whereby multiemployer pension plans can change the way they allocate unfunded vested benefits
to withdrawing employers, subject to PBGC approval. Approval of a change is to be based on a determination that the
change will not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants or the PBGC. The regulation on Allocating
Unfunded Vested Benefits is issued pursuant to this statutory requirement.

Section 2642.12 of the regulation prescribes the information that must be submitted to the PBGC under the regulation
by a plan seeking PBGC approval for an amendment to its allocation method. This information is used by the PBGC to determine
whether the proposed amendment satisfies the statutory standard.

The PBGC estimates that 10 multiemployer plans per year submit information under the regulation and that it takes
3 hours to prepare a submission, for a total annual burden of 30 hours.




Issued at Washington, D.C., this 23rd day of November 1994.

Form N-8B-3_File No. 270-179

Form N-8B-4_File No. 270-180




Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) (``the Act''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has submitted for OMB approval amendments
to Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, N-5, N-8B-2, N-8B-3, and N-8B-4
(the ``Forms'') under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act'') and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act'').

The Forms are used by management investment companies (``funds'') to register their securities under the 1993 Act
and/or register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The proposed amendments will add a requirement to the
Forms to disclose legal proceedings involving directors, executive officers, and ``managerial persons'' (

i.e.,

 person affiliated with the investment adviser to the fund who are engaged in the management, direction, supervision,
or performance of any activities related to the fund).

Form N-1A is the registration statement form used by open-end funds, other than small business investment companies
and insurance company separate accounts, to register their securities under the 1933 Act and to register as an investment
company under the 1940 Act. The average additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-1A is
estimated to be 1 hour per registrant. The total annual burden for Form N-1A per registrant would be 1,063 burden
hours per registrant and the total for all registrants would be 2,976,497 hours.

Form N-2 is the registration statement form used by closed-end investment companies to register their securities
under the 1933 Act and to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. The average additional burden imposed
by the proposed amendments to Form N-2 is estimated to be 1 hour per registrant. The total annual burden for Form
N-2 per registrant would be 1,632 burden hours per registrant and the total for all registrants would be 204,018
hours.

Form N-3 is the registration statement form for insurance company separate accounts organized as management
investment companies. The average additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-3 is estimated
to be 1 hour per registrant. The total annual burden for Form N-3 would be 517 burden hours per registrant and the
total for all registrants would be 27,425 hours.

Form N-4 is the registration statement form for insurance company separate accounts organized as unit investment
trusts. The average additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-4 is estimated to be 1 hour
per registrant. The total annual burden for Form N-4 would be 140 burden hours per registrant and the total for
all registrants would be 40,448 hours.

Form N-5 is the registration statement form for small business investment companies. The average additional
burden imposed by amendments to Form N-5 is estimated to be 1 hour per registrant. The total annual burden for
Form N-5 would be 351 burden hours per registrant and the total for all registrants would be 702 hours.

Form N-8B-2 is the registration statement form used by unit investment trust currently issuing securities
to register under the 1940 Act. The average additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-8B-2
is estimated to be 1 hour per registrant. An average of 22 filers file Form N-8b-2 and the total annual burden
hours per registrant would be 1,627 hours. The total burden for all registrants filing Form N-8B-2 would
be 35,794 hours.

Form N-8B-3 is used by unincorporated management investment companies currently issuing periodic plan
certificates to register under the 1940 Act. Approximately 2 filers file Form N-8b-3 annually. The average
additional burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-8B-3 is estimated to be 1 hour per registrant.
The total burden for all registrants filing Form N-8B-3 will be 342 hours.

Form N-8B-4 is used by face-amount certificate companies to register under the 1940 Act. The average additional
burden imposed by the proposed amendments to Form N-8B-4 is estimated to be 1 hour per registrant. Approximately
1 filer will file Form N-8B-4 annually. The total annual burden hours per registrant would be 171 hours.

Direct general comments to the Clearance Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission at the address below.
Direct any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with Commission
rules and forms to Richard T. Redfearn, Acting Director, Office of Information Technology, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, and Clearance Officer for the SEC, Office of Management

Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), that the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') has requested approval of proposed revisions
to the following rules:

Regulations S-K and S-B provide the itemized disclosure requirements used in connection with the integrated
disclosure system. These regulations have been designated as imposing an administrative burden of one hour, because
the actual regulatory burdens are established by the individual forms that refer to the items in the regulations.
No change in the burden hours assigned to Regulations S-K and S-B will result as a consequence of the revisions.

Regulations 13D and 13G govern the disclosure of information relating to beneficial ownership of securities issued
by public companies. An estimated annual average of 6,536 respondents file documents pursuant to these regulations.
If the revisions to Regulation 13D are adopted as proposed, the estimated burden hours per submission will increase
from 13.75 hours to 14.75 hours, for a total annual burden of 96,406 hours.

Rule 13e-3 governs the disclosure of information by an issuer that is going private. An estimated annual average
of 221 Schedules 13E-3 are filed pursuant to Rule 13e-3. If the proposals are adopted, the estimated burden
hours per filing will increase from 139.25 hours to 140.25 hours, for a total annual burden of 30,996 hours.

Regulation 14A sets out the requirements for disclosure documents relating to proxy solicitations. An estimated
annual average of 7,980 filers file proxy materials pursuant to this regulation. If the changes are adopted as proposed,
the estimated burden hours per filing will increase from 85 hours to 86 hours, for a total annual burden of 686,280 hours.

Regulation 14D contains the disclosure requirements associated with tender offer transactions. An average of 366
documents are filed pursuant to this regulation each year. If the proposed changes to this regulation are adopted,
the estimated burden hours will increase from 353.25 hours per submission to 354.25 hours per filing, for a total annual
burden of 129,656 hours.

Regulation A sets out the disclosure obligations of designated issuers who rely on certain exemptions from registration
of securities. An estimated average of 201 issuers file documents pursuant Regulation A. If the revisions to this
regulation are adopted, the estimated burden hours per filing would increase from 620 hours to 621 hours, for a total
annual burden of 124,821 hours.

General comments regarding the estimated burden hours should be directed to the Clearance Officer for the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the address below. Any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden
hours for compliance with Commission rules and forms should be directed to Richard T. Redfearn, Acting Director,
Office of Information Technology, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 by the American Stock
Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Listing and Trading of Commodity Linked Notes</DOCTITLE>



November 23, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C.  78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on August 22, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Amex proposes to approve for listing and trading under Section 107 of the Amex Company Guide intermediate term
notes whose value will be linked in part to changes in the levels of either the J.P. Morgan Commodity Excess Return Index
(``JPMCIX'') or the J.P. Morgan Commodity Return Index (``JPMCI,'' together with JPMCIX, ``Indexes'').
 According to the Amex, both Indexes measure the return from an investment in the same 11 liquid industrial futures
contracts.




The text of the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C
below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



Under Section 107 of the Amex Company Guide (``Section 107''), the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities
which cannot be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures,
and warrants. The Amex now proposes to list for trading under Section 107 intermediate term notes the value of which
can be expected to fluctuate based on changes in the level of an index consisting of base metals, precious metals and
energy related commodities. These securities will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107 which provide
that such issues have: (1) A public distribution of one million trading units; (2) 400 holders; and (3) a market value
of not less than $20 million. The Exchange also will require that the issuer have a minimum tangible net worth of $150
million. In addition, the Exchange will require that the total original issue price of the security (when combined
with all of the issuer's commodity linked notes which are listed on a national securities exchange or traded through
the facilities of NASDAQ), shall not be greater than 25% of the issuer's tangible net worth at the time of issuance.

Such notes will have a term of one to three years and will not pay interest. Upon maturity, holders will receive not less
than 75% of the original issue price plus an amount in U.S. dollars equal to a participation rate (

i.e.

, a specified percentage) multiplied by any positive difference between the level of the appropriate index at the
time of the offering and the average of the closing index level on the five business days preceding maturity. The notes
may not be redeemed prior to maturity, and holders of the notes have no claim to the physical commodities in the linked
index.

The proposed notes will be linked to either the J.P. Morgan Commodity Index or the J.P. Morgan Commodity Excess Return
Index. Both indexes measure the return from an investment in the same 11 liquid industrial futures contracts.
 The Exchange states that the JPMCI and JPMCIX are identical in all respects except for the incorporation of ``collateral
return,'' as more fully described below, into the JPMCI.
 Both Indexes are constructed as an arithmetic average of commodity returns, and will be rebalanced monthly to maintain
constant dollar weights. Because the Exchange and the underwriter believe the Indexes are identical in all respects
(with the exception of incorporating collateral return), they desire the flexibility to determine at the time of
offering, based upon investor demand and market conditions, which of the Indexes it will utilize for valuing the notes.





The JPMCIX and JPMCI are designed to capture both ``price'' return and ``roll'' return from an investment in commodities.
Price return, or ``spot'' return, is the component of return that arises from changes in constant maturity nearby
prices. Roll return is the component of return that arises from rolling a long position through time in a sloping forward
price curve environment. When nearby futures contracts are more expensive than longer dated contracts, roll return
is positive. When the reverse applies, roll return is negative.
Due to price fluctuations, the relative weights of the Index components will be rebalanced monthly to maintain the
appropriate dollar weighting. In addition, due to the periodic expiration of the futures contracts used to compute
the Index value, it also is necessary to ``roll'' out of expiring contracts and into the new nearby contracts. To minimize
possible pricing volatility arising from conducting the ``roll'' on a single business day, the substitution of the
new contract for the old is accomplished with 20% of the roll volume transacted on each of the five subsequent business
days after the rebalance date. The futures contract to be used for monthly rebalancing and rolling of each commodity
will be the nearest designated futures contract to be used in the appropriate Index, with a termination of trading
date not earlier than ten business days into the following month.





The JPMCI is a ``total return'' index based upon the same eleven commodities as the JPMCIX which, in addition to measuring
price return and roll return, is also comprised of collateral return. The Amex states that collateral return is the
risk free component of commodity returns afforded by full collateralization of the notional value of futures positions
with Treasury bills. It measures the return that an investor would receive if the investor were to fully margin a futures
position (

i.e.,

 post 100% margin) with Treasury bills. According to the underwriter, some investors may choose not to fully collateralize
commodity investments, but because stocks and bonds are collateralized investments, it is useful to treat commodities
on the same basis to compare risk-return performance. Therefore, the underwriter believes that collateralization
permits meaningful comparison with traditional assets in a portfolio allocation framework.

It is intended that the composition, relative weights and manner of calculation for both Indexes will remain constant.
It is conceivable, however, that market developments may eventually necessitate changes in the weighting, composition
or calculation methodology of an Index. Such developments could include, among other things, changing liquidity
conditions or the discontinuation of existing contracts, the emergence of new contracts on relevant commodities,
or major progress in substitution technology that renders obsolete industrial processes that make use of a certain
commodity.
Decisions relating to changes in index weighting, composition or calculation methodology will be determined on
the basis of advice from a neutral business committee, the JPMCI Policy Committee. This committee is composed of senior
employees in the commodities and research areas of J.P. Morgan as well as independent industry and academic experts.
Commodity Group personnel of J.P. Morgan are restricted to an advisory, non-voting membership on the JPMCI Policy
Committee. The issuer will immediately notify the Exchange and vendors of financial information that report the
Index values in the event that there is a change in the relative weightings, calculation methodology or composition.
Prices utilized in the Indexes will be based on New York Mercantile Exchange (``NYMEX'') prices for platinum and energy
related commodities; Commodity Exchange (``Comex'') prices for other precious metals (Comex is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of NYMEX); and London Metal Exchange (``LME'') prices for base metals. These prices are widely reported
by vendors of financial information and the press. Index values will be calculated at least once each trading day by
the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer and disseminated to vendors of financial information by the issuer.
 Members of the JPMCI Policy Committee and employees of the calculation agent who are involved in the calculation of,
or data collection for, any of the commodities underlying the notes or the aggregate value of the commodity index underlying
the notes will be expressly prohibited from trading the notes. The calculation agent will adopt and maintain such
reasonable and appropriate procedures as to ensure that the calculation agent, its agents, affiliates and employees,
do not take advantage of or communicate to any other person any knowledge concerning changes in the value of the notes
or commodities underlying the note before such information is made publicly available.




The Amex is able to obtain market surveillance information, including customer identity information, with respect
to transactions occurring on the LME pursuant to its information sharing arrangements with the Securities and Futures
Authority through the Intermarket Surveillance Group. The Exchange also is able to obtain market surveillance information,
including customer identity information, with respect to transactions occurring on NYMEX and Comex pursuant to
its information sharing agreement with NYMEX.
The notes will provide for payment at maturity of not less than 75% of the offering price and the Exchange will require
that only accounts approved for options trading under Amex Rule 921 shall be permitted to engage in the purchase and/or
sale of such notes. In addition, the Amex will require recommendations in the notes to comply with the suitability
standards set forth in Rule 923. Additionally, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership prior to
trading such notes providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability
recommendations) when handling transactions in such notes and highlighting the special risks and characteristics
thereof. Specifically, the Exchange will provide an Information Circular regarding the proposed commodity linked
notes that substantially incorporates the suitability language contained in Rule 923.





The notes will be subject to the equity margin and trading rules of the Exchange.


2. Statutory Basis


The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange believes the proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; MBS Clearing Corporation; Order Temporarily Approving Proposed Rule Change Establishing
the Electronic Pool Notification Service</DOCTITLE>


November 25, 1994.


On May 6, 1994, the MBS Clearing Corporation (``MBS'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MBS-94-02) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The proposed rule change establishes the electronic pool notification (``EPN'') service. The Commission published
notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on May 20, 1994.
 No comments were received as a result of the 

Federal Register

 notice.
 On May 25, 1994, and on November 10, 1994, MBS filed Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, respectively, to the proposed
rule change.
 Both amendments were technical in nature and did not require republication of notice of filing.








For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is temporarily approving the proposed rule change through November
30, 1995.



I. Description



The proposed rule change adds Articles VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X to MBS's rules in order to establish the EPN service.
EPN was developed by MBS in response to a Public Securities Association (``PSA'') initiative to automate the pool
notification process with the ultimate goal of supplementing and/or replacing the current manually intensive telephone
and fax environment. EPN is an electronic, post-trade communication system for mortgage-backed securities. EPN
provides an electronic communications network through which EPN users will be able to transmit quickly and efficiently
mortgage-backed securities pool allocation information regarding deliveries of securities for settlement. EPN
was designed for use by organizations actively engaged in the allocation and notification process associated with
mortgage-backed securities and derivative securities. EPN user firms may be acting as principal to the underlying
trade activity or as agent on behalf of another EPN user in a fully disclosed capacity.
An EPN message will be required to contain (1) the lot-sequence of ``good delivery millions'' (i.e., 

the number of million dollar lots delivered in accordance with PSA guidelines), (2) a pool number that references
a specific pool of mortgages, (3) the principal amount at date of issue, (4) the coupon rate, and (5) a termination code.
In addition, an EPN message may contain, among other things, additional information such as the maturity date, CUSIP
number, current outstanding principal amount, an MBS trade number, internal control number, and interest accrued.
MBS decided that a complete stand-alone set of rules for EPN was preferable to trying to integrate the EPN rules into
existing MBS rules. As a result, many of the EPN rules mirror the language of existing MBS rules in order to make the provisions
of those rules applicable to the EPN service. There has been an attempt to use the same terms and definitions that MBS
uses in its current rules wherever possible. The EPN rules do differ, however, from existing MBS rules in several respects.
First, the EPN rules describe EPN and define new terms related to EPN such as ``EPN Eligible Security,''
 ``EPN User,'' ``EPN User Fund,'' ``Message Detail Report,'' ``Message Purge Report,'' and ``Message Recovery Report.''
These terms reflect applicable names for existing functions and for new services and concepts. For example, because
users of the EPN service will not necessarily be full participants of MBS, they are called ``EPN Users.''

<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Another change from existing rules concerns who can become an EPN user. Because EPN is essentially a sophisticated
e-mail/database system that does not involve traditional clearance or settlement functions, the risk to MBS from
defaulting EPN users is limited to their fees. As a result, the standards for applicants to become EPN users are significantly
less demanding than those which are applicable to applicants that wish to become full participants of MBS. It is anticipated
that some applicants that do not qualify as full participants of MBS may still qualify and be able to become EPN users.

Because the EPN service will time stamp messages, the new rules provide that this time stamp will be valid, binding,
and enforceable as a determination of good delivery of the message. Under EPN, when a seller initiates a pool notification
message and EPN receives and redelivers the message to the buyer, this action will represents the good delivery of
the message because it is made available to the buyer whether or not the buyer physically retrieves the message. The
buyer's retrieval of the physical message is not part of the good delivery process.

The rules also provide that several reports will be issued to EPN users.
 In addition, the new EPN rules provide for an EPN user fund. This is intended to be similar in purpose to but smaller in
scope than the existing MBS participants fund. The EPN user fund is intended to protect MBS in the event that any EPN
user defaults in payments of fees.





II. Discussion



The Commission believes that MBS's proposed rule change is consistent with Section 7A of the Act
 and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. The Commission believes that MBS's proposal to establish the electronic pool notification service
is consistent with this obligation.






Currently, in order for participants in the mortgage-backed securities market to notify other participants of pool
information, they must manually telephone or fax the information to other participants. Historically, billions
of dollars of fails have occurred and continue to occur each month because sellers are not able to communicate with
buyers because of the buyer's telephone and fax limitations (

e.g.

, busy signals preventing the exchange of information). The establishment of the EPN service should help to significantly
prevent fails in the mortgage-backed securities market by making the notification process more efficient and more
reliable by replacing a manually intensive communication system with an electronic communication system.

MBS received two comment letters generally supporting the proposed rule change.
 Both commenters, however, raised concerns regarding MBS's use of message information sent or received by the EPN
user. Under the proposed rule change, MBS will have the right to use message information to assist MBS in its operation
of the clearing system or EPN service or for other purposes as MBS may determine from time to time.
 The commenters were concerned that the language of the rule allowed MBS to use sensitive information relating to a
firm's proprietary trading which may be contained in EPN messages. In response, MBS stated that it will only use the
information contained in EPN messages for internal business purposes and the information will otherwise be confidential.
 The Commission agrees that the information contained in EPN messages can facilitate MBS's assessment of the volume
and concentration of trading done by participants and believes that this, in turn, can help MBS fulfill its safeguarding
obligations.







During the temporary approval period, MBS will continue to test the EPN service and will begin to run the service on
a pilot basis.
 In addition, MBS will create a disaster recovery program for the EPN service in case of emergency and will keep the Commission
informed on the progress of the disaster recovery program's development.





III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, in particular
with Section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MBS-94-02) be, and hereby is, temporarily approved through
November 30, 1995.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to a Post Primary Trading Session</DOCTITLE>


November 25, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On November 25, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No.
1 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested
persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx, pursuant to rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to extend the close of trading on the Exchange's equity trading
floor from 4:00 to 4:15 P.M., creating a new Post Primary session (``PPS''). The PPS would take place each trading day
from 4:00 to 4:15 P.M. Exchange rules applicable to floor trading during the Exchange's regular trading hours (

i.e.

, 9:30 a.m.-4:00 p.m.) would continue to apply to floor trading during the PPS, except that during the PPS, orders
that are designated ``PPS'' are eligible for execution. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to amend the following
Phlx rules: Rule 101, adding Commentary .02 to specify equity floor trading hours; Rule 229, Commentary .17, adding
reference to implementing the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communication and Execution System (``PACE'')
as a routing system only, with Floor Procedure Committee approval; Rule 232 to add the PPS as well as opening before
the primary market; and Equity Floor Procedure Advice EF-1, which provides the procedures for the designation
and execution of orders in instances where the primary market is not open in an issue for which the Phlx is open, to change
the eligibility designation from use of the yellow copy of the order ticket to the designator ``EXP'' and to make several
clarifications. The text of the proposed rule change is available in full at the Commission Public Reference Room.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Currently, Rule 232 governs after-hours trading (crossing session) of GTX orders.
 At this time, the Phlx is proposing to add to that rule a PPS on the equity trading floor from 4:00 to 4:15 p.m. each trading
day. Rather than assigning PPS a new rule number, the applicable PPS provision is being added to Rule 232 in order to
group into a single rule the three Exchange provisions relating to trading on the Phlx during periods when the primary
market is not open for free trading.
 Accordingly, the Exchange is amending Rule 232 to encompass two situations in addition to GTX orders: (1) The PPS;
and (2) opening for trading on the Phlx before the primary market is open for trading. The GTX provisions would be renumbered
as paragraph (c).





First, the Phlx proposes to implement a PPS for extended trading on the equity floor of the Exchange. During the PPS,
pursuant to proposed Rule 232(b), orders designated PPS would be eligible for execution during the 4:00-4:15
p.m. trading session. PACE would not provide automatic executions during the PPS, but could be available as a routing
system only if permitted by the Floor Procedure Committee.
 Unlike the GTX session, the PPS is an extension of the auction market, whereby bids and offers are dynamically updated
for trading under normal auction market principles. As such, Exchange rules applicable to floor trading during the
Exchange's regular session, as established by Rule 101, would continue to apply. Orders must be designated PPS in
order to be eligible for the PPS. Market, limit and contingent order types currently acceptable under Exchange rules
would be accepted for PPS if so designated. For example, pursuant to Rule 207, a ``GTC PPS''
 order would be eligible for PPS execution, and, if not executed, would be eligible for execution during ensuing days
because of the GTC designation.





Second, the situation where the Phlx is open for trading before the primary market is open, or during a non-regulatory
halt in trading on the primary market, is proposed to be codified into Rule 232(a). Currently, these provisions appear
in Equity Floor Procedure Advice EF-1, Designating Orders for Execution in Instances Where the Primary Market
Is Not Open in an Issue for Which the Phlx is Open for Free Trading.
 The Phlx now proposes to codify this Advice into Phlx rules. In addition, the use of the yellow ticket, to designate
orders eligible for execution when the Phlx is open for trading in an issue not open on the primary market, would be replaced
with the use of the designator ``EXP,'' meaning ex-primary, to parallel the designators ``PPS'' and ``GTX'' in Rule
232. The Exchange is also proposing a corresponding amendment to the Advice to incorporate the ``EXP'' designator,
reword the three-year cycle for imposing fines,
 and explain that the primary market may not be open for free trading due to a delay or a halt in trading.

2. Statutory Basis




The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular,
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and
a national market system, as well as to protect investors and the public interest by extending equity trading hours.
The Exchange believes that the proposed PPS should provide an important opportunity for traders and investors to
hedge option positions, as the options markets continue to trade 10-15 minutes after Phlx equity trading hours.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-46
and should be submitted by December 23, 1994.

System Energy Resources, Inc., et al. (70-8511)



System Energy Resources, Inc. (``SERI''), Echelon One, 1340 Echelon Parkway, Jackson, Mississippi 39213, Arkansas
Power & Light Company (``AP&L''), 425 West Capitol, 40th Floor, Little Rock, Arkansas 72201, Louisiana
Power & Light Company (``LP&L''), 639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, Mississippi Power &
Light Company (``MP&L''), 308 East Pearl Street, Jackson, Mississippi 39201, New Orleans Public Service Inc.
(``NOPSI'' and together with AP&L, LP&L and MP&L, ``Operating Subsidiaries''), 639 Loyola Avenue,
New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, and Entergy Corporation (``Entergy''), 225 Baronne Street, New Orleans, Louisiana
70112, a registered holding company, have filed an application-declaration with this Commission pursuant to Sections
6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(d) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (``Act'') and Rule 44 thereunder.

SERI proposes from time to time through December 31, 1996 (a) to issue and sell one or more series of its First Mortgage
Bonds (``Bonds'') in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $265 million and (b) to enter into arrangements for
the issuance and sale of tax-exempt revenue bonds (``Tax-Exempt Bonds'') in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $235 million. Additionally, SERI requests authority through that period of time to issue and pledge one or
more new series of its first mortgage bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $251 million (``Collateral
Bonds'') as security for the Tax-Exempt Bonds.

<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00099 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

Each series of Bonds will have such interest rate, maturity date, redemption and sinking fund provisions, be secured
by such means and sold in such manner and at such price and have such other terms and conditions as shall be determined
at the time of sale.

In order to provide additional security for its obligations with respect to the Bonds, SERI may assign for the benefit
of the holders of the Bonds certain of its rights under the Availability Agreement, dated as of June 21, 1974, as amended.
Pursuant to this agreement, the Operating Subsidiaries have agreed to pay SERI certain amounts for expenses incurred
by SERI in connection with the operation of a nuclear-powered electric generating station in Mississippi.

As further security for its obligations with respect to the Bonds, SERI may assign certain of its rights under the Capital
Fund Agreement dated as of June 21, 1974. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, Entergy has agreed to provide SERI,
among other things, capital sufficient to enable SERI to maintain a 35% equity ratio, as defined in that agreement.

SERI proposes to use the net proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of the Bonds for general corporate purposes,
including, but not limited to, (i) the acquisition and retirement, by means of tender offer, or open market, negotiated
or other forms of purchases, or redemption in whole or in part, prior to their respective maturities, of one or more
series of SERI's outstanding first mortgage bonds, (ii) the payment of construction costs and nuclear fuel costs,
(iii) the repayment of long- and short-term borrowings and/or (iv) other working capital needs.

SERI also requests authority to enter into arrangements for the issuance of Tax-Exempt Bonds by governmental authorities
(each an ``Issuer'') in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $235 million. Each series of Tax-Exempt Bonds
will have such interest rate, maturity date, redemption and sinking fund provisions, be secured by such means, be
sold in such manner and at such price, and have such other terms and conditions as shall be determined at the time of sale.
However, it is proposed that each series of the Tax-Exempt Bonds mature not earlier than five years from the first day
of the month of issuance nor later than forty years from the date of issuance.

Under the proposed arrangements, SERI would enter into one or more installment purchase, refunding or other facilities
agreements (each a ``Facilities Agreement'') or one or more supplements and/or amendments thereto with one or more
Issuers. Pursuant to the terms of each Facilities Agreement, the Issuer will pay to or provide for the benefit of SERI
the total amount of the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds and SERI will agree to pay amounts sufficient to pay the principal
or redemption price of, premium, if any, and interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds.

In order to obtain a more favorable rating on any series of Tax-Exempt Bonds, SERI may arrange for one or more irrevocable
letter(s) of credit (each a ``Letter of Credit'') for an aggregate amount up to $285 million from one or more banks (each
a ``Bank''). In connection with any such letter of Credit, SERI would enter into a Reimbursement Agreement (``Reimbursement
Agreement'') with the Bank. Pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement, SERI would agree to reimburse the Bank party thereto
immediately or within a specified period (not to exceed 60 months) after the date of the draw for all amounts drawn under
Letter of Credit, together with accrued interest. The rate of such interest would not exceed the New York prime rate
as published in The Wall Street Journal plus 200 basis points. Additionally, it is anticipated that each Reimbursement
Agreement would require the payment by SERI to the Bank of up-front fees not to exceed $100,000 and annual fees not to
exceed 11/4% of the face amount of the related Letter of Credit.

In addition or as an alternative to the security provided by a Letter of Credit, SERI may pledge one or more new series
of its first mortgage bonds (``Collateral Bonds'') under the Mortgage, as it may be supplemented. These Collateral
Bonds may be interest-bearing or non-interest bearing. Such Collateral Bonds would be non-interest bearing of the
principal amount issued were the same as the principal of the underlying Tax-Exempt Bonds plus accumulated interest
for a specified period. The rate on interest-bearing Collateral Bonds may be less than or equal to the interest rate
on the underlying Tax-Exempt Bonds.

SERI proposes to use the proceeds of the sale of Tax-Empt Bonds to refinance certain pollution control revenue bonds
that were previously issued to finance pollution control facilities at the Grand Gulf nuclear state.

Bureau of Consular Affairs; Registration for the Diversity Immigrant (DV-96) Visa Program 




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of registration for the second year of the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program.

 



This public notice provides information on the application procedures for the 55,000 immigrant visas to be made available
in the DV category during Fiscal Year 1996. This notice is issued pursuant to 22 CFR 42.33 which implements Sections
201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c) and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, (8 U.S.C. 1151, 1153,
and 1154). The Department published regulations related to this Notice in the 

Federal Register

 on March 31, 1994 [59 FR 15303.] 




Information on the Application Procedures for the 55,000 Immigrant Visas To Be Made Available in the DV Category During
Fiscal Year 1996 




Sections 201(a)(3), 201(e), 203(c) and 204(a)(1)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, taken together
establish, effective for Fiscal Year 1996 and thereafter, an annual numerical limitation of 55,000 for diversity
immigrants. Aliens who are natives of countries determined by the Attorney General according to a mathematical formula
specified by the law will be able to compete for immigration under this limitation. This program for Fiscal Year 1996
is identified by the visa symbol DV-96 and is informally known as the ``visa lottery.'' The law specifies that
there must be a separate registration for each year's DV visas. This information concerns the application period
during 1995 for visas to be issued during Fiscal Year 1996. 




Qualifying Countries and Areas Under the DV-96 Program 





The law apportions immigrant visa issuance among six geographic regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America_other
than Mexico, Oceania, and South America including Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean) according to a formula
based on total immigrant admissions over the most recent five-year period. The formula identifies both high and low
admission regions and high admission foreign states. A greater share of the available visa numbers go to low admission
regions than to high admission regions. High admission states are excluded entirely from the program. No single country
may receive more than 7 percent (3,850) of the world-wide total of visa numbers. 



The U.S. Attorney General has determined as follows the countries whose natives (term is explained in question 1)
are entitled to apply for DV visas for Fiscal Year 1996. According to the law, countries are grouped by region (see list
at the end of this notice). The allotment of visa numbers for each region is shown in parentheses below: 




Africa: (20,426) All countries. 

Asia: (7,087) All countries EXCEPT the following: China_mainland born and Taiwan born, India, Philippines,
Vietnam, and South Korea. (Hong Kong is eligible.) 


Europe: (24,257) All countries Including Turkey EXCEPT the following: United Kingdom and its dependent
territories. (Northern Ireland is eligible.) 



North America: (8) Canada is not eligible. The Bahamas is the ONLY eligible country included in the North American
region. 



South America, Central America, and the Caribbean: (2,407) All countries EXCEPT Mexico, Jamaica, El Salvador,
the Dominican Republic and Colombia. 



Oceania: (815) All Countries.

How and When to Apply for DV-96 Status 




The application period for registration for the visas to be issued during Fiscal Year 1996 (i.e. from October 1995
through September 1996) will begin at 12:01 a.m. (Eastern Time) on Tuesday, January 31, 1995, and will end at midnight
on Wednesday, March 1, 1995. Applications must be typed or clearly printed and mailed to one of the six following addresses,
depending upon the region of the applicant's native country: 


Note Carefully the Importance of Using the Correct Postal Zip Code for Each Region.

 


Asia: DV-96 Program, National Visa Center, Portsmouth, NH 00210, U.S.A. 


South America: DV-96 Program, National Visa Center, Portsmouth, NH 00211, U.S.A. 


Europe: DV-96 Program, National Visa Center, Portsmouth, NH 00212, U.S.A. 


Africa: DV-96 Program, National Visa Center, Portsmouth, NH 00213, U.S.A. 


Oceania: DV-96 Program, National Visa Center, Portsmouth, NH 00214, U.S.A. 


North America: DV-96 Program, National Visa Center, Portsmouth, NH 00215, U.S.A. 






Typed or clearly printed in the Roman alphabet in the upper left hand corner of the front of the envelope must be the country
or area of which the applicant is a native. Typed or clearly printed below the country must be the same name and mailing
address of the applicant as are shown on the application form contained therein. Failure to include this information
will disqualify the application. 





Example: Pakistan, George Q. Public, 1234 Any Street, Apt. 5, Center City, CA 90001. 






Only one application may be submitted by or for each applicant during this registration period. (Submission of more
than one application will disqualify the person from registration.) Applications for registration will be grouped
by region and will be selected strictly in a random order from among all those received during the application period.
Every application received will have an equal chance of being selected. The names of all SELECTED applicants will
be chosen by July 1, 1995. 


Applications must be sent to the addresses above by regular mail or air mail only, and may be mailed from within the United
States or abroad. The information required on the envelope must be typed or clearly printed. Any applications submitted
by hand, telegram, FAX, or by any means requiring any form of special handling or acknowledgement of receipt, such
as registered mail, express mail, or certified mail will not be eligible for the visa lottery. 


Applications received at the post office either before or after the application period, or delivered to any other
address will not be processed for registration. Only one application may be included in each envelope. An application
returned to sender, for whatever reason, will not be considered unless the returned application is received during
the application period.

Size of Envelope 


The envelope in which each application is mailed must be BETWEEN 6 inches and 10 inches (15 cm to 25 cm) IN LENGTH, and
BETWEEN 31/2 inches and 41/2 inches (9 cm to 11 cm) IN WIDTH. This is necessary to assist the automated processing of
the mail. 


Information Which Must be Included With Application for Registration 


There is no application fee or special application form. The request for registration in the lottery must furnish
the following information on a plain sheet of paper. All answers must be typed or clearly printed in the Roman alphabet.

Each application must be in the following format:

 

1. Applicant's Full Name 


Last Name, First Name and Middle Name 
(Underline Last Name/Surname/Family name) 
Example: 

Public

, George Quincy 


2. Applicant's Date and Place of Birth 


Date of birth: Day, Month, Year 
Example: 15 November 1961 
Place of birth: City/Town, District/County/Province, Country 
Example: Munich, Bavaria, Germany 


3. Name, Date and Place of Birth of Applicant's Spouse and Children, if any 


The spouse and child(ren) of an applicant who is registered for DV-96 status are automatically entitled to the
same status. To obtain a visa on the basis of this derivative status, a child must be under 21 years of age and unmarried.
Note: Do NOT list parents as they are not entitled to derivative status. 


4. Applicant's Mailing Address 


The mailing address must be clear and complete, since it will be to that address that the notification letter for the
persons who are registered will be sent. A telephone number is optional. 


5. Applicant's Native Country if Different from Country of Birth 


See the answer to Question 1 in this notice regarding the meaning of ``native'' for the purposes of the DV-96 program.



Frequently Asked Questions About DV-96 Registration 


1. How is the Term ``Native'' Defined? Are There Any Bases Upon Which Persons Who Have Not Been Born in a Qualifying Country
May Qualify for Registration? 


Native means BOTH someone born within one of the qualifying countries AND someone entitled to be ``charged'' to such
country under the provisions of Section 202(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Applicants for DV-96
registration may be charged to the country of birth of a spouse; a minor dependent child can be charged to the country
of birth of a parent; and an applicant born in a country of which neither parent was a native or a resident at the time of
his/her birth may be charged to the country of birth of either parent. An applicant who claims the benefit of alternate
chargeability must include a statement to that effect on the application for registration, and must show the country
of chargeability on the upper left hand corner of the envelope in which the registration request is mailed. 


2. May Persons who Are in the U.S. Apply for Registration? 


Yes, an applicant may be in the U.S. or in another country, and the application may be mailed in the U.S. or abroad. 


3. Is Each Applicant Limited to Only one Application During This DV-96 Registration Period? 


Yes, the law allows only ONE application BY OR FOR each person; submission of more than one application will disqualify
the person from registration. Applicants will be disqualified if more than one entry is detected, regardless of where
they are in the application process or whether the visa has already been issued; disqualification may occur, for example,
at the time of registration, at the time of visa interview, or at any other time. 


4. May a Husband and a Wife Each Submit a Separate Application? 


Yes, if otherwise qualified, a husband and a wife may each submit one application for registration; if either is registered,
the other would be entitled to derivative status. 


5. Must Each Applicant Submit His/Her own Request, or may Someone act on Behalf of an Applicant?

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Applicants may prepare and submit their own request for registration, or have someone act on their behalf. Regardless
of whether an application is submitted by the applicant directly, or is assisted by an attorney, friend, relative,
etc., only one application may be submitted in the name of each person. Only one notification letter will be sent for
each case registered, to the address provided on the application. 


6. What Are the Requirements for Education or Work Experience? 


The law and regulations require that every applicant must have at least a high school education or its equivalent or,
within the past five years, have two years of work experience in an occupation requiring at least two years training
or experience. A ``high school education or equivalent'' is defined as successful completion of a twelve-year course
of elementary and secondary education comparable to that of a high school degree in the United States. Qualifying
work experience shall be based upon the most recent edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles published by
the Employment and Training Administration of the United States Department of Labor. 
Documentary proof of education or work experience should NOT be submitted with the application, but must be presented
to the consular officer at the time of formal immigrant visa application. 


7. How Will Cases be Registered? 


At the National Visa Center all mail received will be separated into one of six geographic regions and individually
numbered. After the end of the application period, a computer will randomly select cases from among all the mail received
for each geographic region. Within each region, the first letter randomly selected will be the first case registered,
the second letter selected the second registration, etc. It makes no difference whether an application is received
early or late in the application period; all applications received within the mail-in period will have an equal chance
of being selected within each region. When a case has been registered, the applicant will immediately be sent a notification
letter, which will provide appropriate visa application instructions. The names of all selected applicants will
be chosen by July 1, 1995. The National Visa Center will continue to process the case until those who are registered
are instructed to make formal application at a U.S. consular office or at an INS office in the United States in the case
of those who are entitled to apply for change of status. The National Visa Center will provide additional instructions
on what steps to take to pursue their applications for DV-96 visas. 


8. May Applicants Adjust Their Status With the INS? 


Yes, provided you are otherwise eligible to adjust status, if you are physically present in the United States you may
apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for adjustment. Applicants who adjust, however, must
first mail completed forms OF-230, Part I, and DSP-122 to the National Visa Center. Applicants should
ensure that INS can complete action on their cases before September 30, 1996, since on that date registrations in the
Fiscal Year 1996 DV-96 program terminate. 


9. Will Applicants Who Are Not Registered Be Informed? 


No, applicants who are not registered will receive no response to their registration request. Only those who are registered
will be informed. All notification letters are expected to be sent within about three months of the end of the application
period. Anyone who does NOT receive a letter will know that his/her application has not been registered. 


10. How Many Applicants Will be Registered? 


There are only 55,000 visas available for Fiscal Year 1996 but more than that number of individuals will be registered.
It is likely that some of the first 55,000 persons who are registered will not pursue their cases to visa issuance. Registering
more people than there are visa numbers should ensure that all DV-96 numbers will be used, even though it also
risks some registrants being left out. All applicants who are registered will be informed promptly of their place
on the list. Each month visas will be issued, according to registration lottery rank order, to those applicants who
are ready for visa issuance during that month. Once all of the fiscal year 1996 visas have been issued, the program for
the year will end. Registered applicants who wish to receive visas must be prepared to ACT PROMPTLY on their cases.

11. Is There a Minimum Age for Applicants for Registration Under the DV-96 Program? 


There is NO minimum age for submission of an application for registration, but the requirement of a high school education
or work experience for each principal applicant at the time of visa issuance will effectively disqualify most persons
who are under age 18. 


12. Will There be Any Special Fee for Registration in the DV-96 Category? 


There is NO FEE FOR SUBMITTING A REQUEST FOR REGISTRATION, and NO FEE should be included with the letter sent to the post
office box indicated above. Furthermore, there is no special fee for applicants who come to be registered through
the lottery. Registered applicants who pursue applications for immigrant visas will, however, be required to pay
all normal immigrant visa fees. 


13. Are There Any Countries That Were Eligible to Participate in the DV-1 Visa Lottery That Are not Eligible to
Participate in the DV-96 Visa Lottery? 


Yes, Colombia has been added to the list of countries ineligible to participate in the DV-96 visa lottery. With
the addition of Colombia there are now thirteen countries excluded from participation in the diversity visa lottery
due to high admissions of immigrants in the preceding 5 years. 



14. Are DV-96 Applicants Exempted From Any of the Grounds of Visa Ineligibility? 


No. Applicants are subject to all grounds of ineligibility specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act and there
is no special provision for the waiver of any grounds of visa ineligibility other than those provided for in the Act.



15. May Applicants Who Are Already Registered for an Immigrant Visa in Another Category Apply in This Registration
for the DV-96 Category? 


Yes, such persons may seek DV-96 status through this registration as well. 


16. How Long do Applicants Who Are Registered on the Basis of This Application Period Remain Entitled to Apply for Visas
in the DV-96 Category? 


Under the law, persons registered following this DV-96 application period are entitled to apply for visa issuance
ONLY DURING Fiscal Year 1996 i.e., from October 1995 through September 1996. There is no carry-over of benefit into
another year for persons who are registered but who do not obtain visas during FY-1996. 
There is absolutely no advantage to mailing early, or mailing from any particular locale. Every application received
during the mail-in period will have an equal chance of being selected at random within its region. However more than
one application from a person will disqualify the person from registration. Also, failure to include the applicant's
native country and full name and address on the envelope will disqualify the application.

Highway Safety Programs; Conforming Products List of Screening Devices To Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice publishes the first Conforming Products List (CPL) of devices that conform to the Model Specifications
for Screening Devices that measure alcohol in bodily fluids (59 FR 39382). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:

 On August 2, 1994, Model Specifications for Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids were published
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 39382). In these model specifications, NHTSA recognized industry efforts to develop new technologies. These
specifications establish performance criteria and methods for testing alcohol screening devices using either
breath or other bodily fluids to measure alcohol content. NHTSA established these specifications to support State
laws that target youthful offenders (i.e., ``zero tolerance'' laws) and 
the Department of Transportation's initiative to prevent alcohol misuse. Employers are reminded that evidential
breath testing devices are still required for screening under DOT's regulation on Alcohol Misuse Prevention, 49
CFR Part 40. Screening devices are not authorized for use under Part 40 until DOT amends its regulation. 



Alcohol screening devices have been submitted to NHTSA for testing and were evaluated at the Volpe National Transportation
System Center in Cambridge, MA. This first publication of a Conforming Products List for alcohol screening devices
reports on five (5) devices that were evaluated and found to meet the model specifications for alcohol screening devices
cited above. Three of these five devices are sold under two different names (see CPL below). The Conforming Products
List, which lists models that were submitted and determined to meet the model specifications, and the manufacturers
who submitted them to NHTSA for testing, appears below:

Note that devices 1 through 4 are breath alcohol testers that use semiconductor type sensors. Device 

#

5 is a saliva alcohol tester that uses an enzymatic technique to measure the alcohol concentration in a saliva sample.
All of the devices provide a direct read-out of test results.

Survey of Foreign Portfolio Investment in the United States as of December 30, 1994


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Departmental Offices, Department of the Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of reporting requirements.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

By this Notice, the Department of the Treasury is informing the public that it is conducting a mandatory survey of foreign
holdings of United States securities as of December 30, 1994. This Notice constitutes legal notification to all United
States persons (defined below) who meet the reporting requirements set forth in this Notice that they must respond
to, and comply with, this survey. United States persons who meet the reporting requirements but who do not receive
a set of the survey forms and instructions should contact the Department of the Treasury at (202) 622-8064 to
obtain a copy.



DEFINITION: 

A U.S. person is any individual, branch, partnership, associated group, association, estate, trust, corporation,
or other organization (whether or not organized under the laws of any State), and any government (including a foreign
government, the United States Government, a state, provincial, or local government, and any agency, corporation,
financial institution, or other entity or instrumentality thereof, including a government-sponsored agency),
who resides in the United States or is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.



WHO MUST REPORT: 

The following U.S. persons must report on this survey:



_U.S. persons who manage the safekeeping of U.S. securities (as specified below) for foreign persons. These U.S.
persons, who include the affiliates in the United States of foreign entities, and are henceforth referred to as U.S.
custodians, must report on this survey if the total market value of the U.S. securities whose safekeeping they manage
on behalf of foreigners_aggregated over all accounts and for all branches and affiliates of their firm_is $10 million
or more as of December 30, 1994.
_U.S. persons who issue securities, if the total market value of their securities owned directly by foreigners_aggregated
over all securities issued by all subsidiaries and affiliates of the firm, including investment companies, trusts,
and other legal entities created by the firm_is $10 million or more as of December 30, 1994. U.S. issuers should report
only foreign holdings of their securities which are directly known to them; i.e., where issuer ownership records
reflect a foreign owner directly. Securities held by U.S. nominees, such as bank or broker custody departments, should
be considered to be U.S.-held securities as far as the issuer is concerned.



WHAT TO REPORT: 

The survey will measure foreign holdings of all equity securities, all debt securities with an original term-to-maturity
in excess of one year, and all options and warrants to purchase or sell equity or long-term debt securities.



HOW TO REPORT: 

Copies of the survey forms and instructions, which contain complete information on reporting procedures, can be
obtained by contacting the survey staff at (202) 622-8064.



WHEN TO REPORT: 

Data should be submitted to the Department of the Treasury by March 31, 1995.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS


Notice of Vote to Close Meeting


By telephone vote on November 28, 1994, a majority of the members contacted and voting, the Board of Governors voted
to close to public observation its meeting scheduled for December 12, 1994, in Washington, D.C. The members will consider
the Postal Rate Commission's Opinion and Recommended Decision in Docket No. R94-1.
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace, and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary to the Board
Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(3) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(c) of Title
39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government
in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection with proceedings
under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification and changes
in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States
Code.
The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section
7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern
participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination on the record after
opportunity for a hearing. The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's
discussion of the matter be open to the public.
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c) (3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code;
section 410(c)(4) of Title 39 United States Code; and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202)
268-4800.

National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Conference and Availability of Standards.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency will hold a conference on national environmental laboratory accreditation,
to discuss all aspects of accreditation for laboratories performing analyses to demonstrate compliance with EPA
regulations. The conference is open to the public. The constitution and the draft standards are being published to
allow time for review before the conference.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Laboratories, the regulated community, laboratory clients and the regulatory agencies have experienced difficulty
under the current system of laboratory accreditation. In response to complaints received in 1990, EPA has been working
in a cooperative venture with the states and the public to develop a system which would surmount many of the existing
problems. 



In 1991, the Committee on National Accreditation of Environmental Laboratories (CNAEL) was chartered at the request
of EPA's Deputy Administrator. The CNAEL was charged with determining the need and advisability of a national environmental
laboratory accreditation program, alternatives to such a program, and the role of EPA in any program. CNAEL was composed
of members from the laboratory and regulated industry communities, academia, other federal agencies, the states,
public environmental interest 
groups, and private accrediting bodies.

<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00143 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

CNAEL identified and prioritized numerous issues which were of concern to each of the affected parties and reached
agreement on an overall problem statement: to achieve data of needed quality in a cost effective manner. Fifteen alternative
solutions were proposed and evaluated in relation to the problem statement. Multiple options for operation of a program
were identified and ranked. In addition, the scope of a program was defined in terms of environmental regulations,
which laboratories should be included, and which activities/tests would be included. Finally CNAEL identified
the elements of 
a national environmental laboratory accreditation program for purposes of clarity. At the conclusion of its deliberations
CNAEL recommended that a national program for accreditation of environmental laboratories, which includes the
key elements of on-site audits, performance evaluation testing, and data audits, be implemented by enlisting states
and/or third parties to perform the accrediting function with oversight of the accrediting bodies by a federal agency.


In order to act upon the recommendations of CNAEL, EPA convened the 
State/EPA Focus Group, which is composed of ten states (California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, Texas) and eight EPA Offices (Office of Air and Radiation, Office of
Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, Office of Research
and Development, Office of Regional Operations and State/Local Relations, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response,
Office of Water, Region 4). The Focus Group has developed a set of draft standards based on the ISO 25 Guidelines, as
proposed by CNAEL, and a constitution for operation of the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference
(NELAC). This set of standards and the constitution will form the basis for the discussions at the NELAC as discussed
below. 

The NELAC is a key step in implementing the solution proposed by CNAEL and has the potential to influence the entire
environmental laboratory community. States and federal agencies will function as the decision making (voting)
members of the conference. The proposed process is to modify and refine the set of draft standards. Additions and modifications
are expected to be made during the NELAC committee meetings where the comments and suggestions of all sectors of the
laboratory community will be solicited to ensure that the standards are responsive to the needs of the public, are
practical to implement, are scientifically sound, and are as cost efficient as possible. For those unable to participate
directly in the NELAC, written comments can be submitted to Jeanne Mourrain. 

Once agreement is reached on the standards, the states may voluntarily adopt the standards and would have responsibility
for ensuring conformance with the standards. Any laboratory which performs analyses to demonstrate compliance
with federal environmental regulations in a participating state would be required to be accredited under the state
regulations and would be deemed accredited in all other participating states. EPA would provide oversight of state
accreditation programs and inspections of state and 
federal laboratories. In most cases the states would accredit laboratories only within their own state. However,
laboratories located in states which do not participate in the national program could seek accreditation from another
state which has adopted the national standards. 

The goal of the program is to accredit all laboratories which perform 
environmental analyses for compliance with regulations. The information and status of these laboratories would
be readily available to regulators, clients, and the general public. Reciprocity would be easily obtained and would
be granted on a state-by-state basis. Reciprocity would eliminate duplicate on-site inspections and performance
evaluation sample testing. Some states may have supplemental requirements required by state law which exceed the
national standards, e.g. some states have regulated additional compounds for drinking water, which might require
analysis of additional performance 
evaluation samples. 

A fully operational national environmental laboratory accreditation program would enable a laboratory to conduct
business in any of the states or territories, with minimal disruption of operations and lower costs. International
acceptance of national accreditation should be greatly facilitated. The capacity of laboratories for all types
of environmental analyses would be included in the scope of a national program, enabling clients of laboratories
to readily identify the laboratories which could perform the needed analyses.

The NELAC will provide the opportunity for the entire laboratory community to voice their concerns, provide advice
based on their professional experience and effect positive changes in the current accreditation process. Among
those who are encouraged to attend are state and federal accrediting and laboratory agencies, private sector laboratories,
the regulated industry, environmental interest groups, accrediting bodies, academia, and the general public.

1.0 Policy and Structure



1.1 Introduction



The Committee on National Accreditation of Environmental Laboratories (CNAEL) in its final report of September
1992 recommended the establishment of a national environmental laboratory accreditation program (NELAP). The
States function as the primary accrediting authorities and may contract with a third party as the accrediting body
for purposes of carrying out some parts of the accrediting functions, e.g. on-site inspections. As accrediting authorities,
the states would maintain the authority to grant accreditation, enforce compliance, etc. EPA shall oversee and approve
the state's compliance with all standards applicable to an accrediting authority. The recommended key elements
for NELAP include on-site assessments, performance evaluation testing, and data audits. To achieve the stated goals
of the CNAEL report, it is proposed to establish a National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC),
which is modeled after the National Conference on Weights and Measures. NELAC membership shall be voluntary and shall
be open to environmental laboratory accrediting authorities. The NELAC shall serve as the organization that shall
establish and modify the accreditation standards. Broad participation in NELAC shall identify laboratories which
are capable of providing reliable, uniform laboratory data which are acceptable to both Federal and State environmental
programs. National accreditation standards and procedures shall provide a level playing field where reciprocity
among the States in environmental laboratory accreditation shall be practicable. The creation of a National Environmental
Laboratory Accreditation Program allows coordination of the current accreditation activities of different States
or other governmental agencies, and reduces the number of on-site inspections, performance evaluation tests, and
related requirements with which the accredited organizations must comply. It is intended that NELAP function in
a manner which minimizes negative effects on the current accreditation operations of the States, requires minimum
outlay of State and Federal funds to implement, and that is self supporting.



1.2 Purpose of the Conference



The National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference shall be a standards setting body. NELAC shall,
through the process described, establish consensus uniform standards on which the national accreditation program
shall be based. These uniform standards shall include, but are not limited to, quality systems, performance evaluation,
audit programs, and other key elements as established by the standing committees of NELAC. It is NOT the purpose of
NELAC to function as an accrediting body, oversee or approve accrediting bodies, or administer any of the main elements
of the accreditation program.



1.3 Structure of the Conference



The structure of the Conference is shown in Figure 1-1. The Board of Directors shall assume the overall supervisory,
administrative, and procedural duties. The Standing Committees and Administrative Committees are overseen by
the Board of Directors. The Standing Committees shall receive input regarding standards and test procedures, then
process this input into resolutions which shall be put before the Membership at the Annual Conference. These resolutions
shall be voted on by Active Members. The non-voting Contributors shall also have the opportunity to make presentations
and comments on the resolutions throughout the process and at the Annual Conference. The NELAC may also take into consideration
advice and comment provided to the Environmental Protection Agency through the Environmental Laboratory Advisory
Board (ELAB) chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The composition and relationships of these
bodies is described below.



1.3.1 The Board of Directors

<TEXT>
 

The Board of Directors consists of the Conference Chair, the Chair-Elect, the most recent still active Past Chair,
the Treasurer, six members elected at large from the active membership (to serve 3-year staggered terms), an EPA official
to be appointed by the EPA Administrator as the NELAP Director (see section 1.4.1), and an Executive Secretary to be
named by the Director. The Board of Directors serves as a policy and coordinating body in matters of national and international
significance. The Board of Directors also makes interim policy decisions when necessary before the Voting Delegates
have an opportunity to vote on the issues in question.



1.3.2 The Environmental Laboratory Advisory Board



The ELAB consists of nine members composed of eight nongovernmental representatives and chaired by an EPA representative.
The members may be selected from a slate of nominees prepared by the Contributors' Committee. This FACA board advises
the EPA on matters affecting the interests of the contributors and other interested parties.



1.3.3 The Committees



The committees are the Standing Committees and the Administrative Committees. Both are overseen by the Board of Directors.



1.3.3.1 The Standing Committees



These committees each consist of five members elected from the Active Membership of the Conference. They serve five
years and one new member is elected each year. The committee elects a chair. The committees shall generate standards
and policies for which they have responsibility to be presented at the annual Conference for vote. The committees
shall receive input via comments and presentations at the interim and annual conferences. The committees shall draft
resolutions which shall be published by EPA in the 

Federal Register

. The committees shall prepare and arrange timely agendas for Interim Meetings and Annual Conferences.



The Program Structure Committee.

 This committee shall develop modifications to the scope, structure, and requirements to the tiers and fields of testing.



The Accrediting Authority Committee.

 This committee provides the standards used by EPA to approve state authorities.



The Quality System Committee.

 This committee shall establish and keep current the key elements of a quality system including record keeping and
staffing requirements. The Committee shall also define uniform standard criteria for each of the elements of the
quality system.

officially designated State Representative from each State or 
Territory, two representatives from each of seven EPA 
Assistant/Associate Administrators (OSWER, OAR, ORD, OW, 
OPPTS, OECA, and OROSLR), and one officially designated 
Federal Representative from each other participating federal 
program. The state representative should be the director of 
the state environmental laboratory accreditation, or a high 
level technically competent scientist who is knowledgeable 
about environmental laboratory analysis and accreditation 
programs, or his or her designee. The Federal Representative 
is designated by the appropriate person in charge of the 
federal program. All other State and Federal Officials are 
grouped as a body known as the House of Delegates. 



Contributors. 

The contributors are all other interested 
parties and groups. They include, but are not limited to, 
laboratory personnel, industry representatives, environmental 
groups, the general public, laboratory associations, industry 
associations, accreditation associations, and retired active 
members. The Contributors may not vote, but can make 
presentations, comments or input at all stages of the 
standards and procedures making process. 



1.3.5 The Generation of Standards 



The standards for the accreditation of laboratories begin in 
the various committees (see Figure 1-2). Draft standards 
proposed by the committees are published in the 

Federal 
Register 

by EPA. After providing an appropriate time for 
review, an Interim Meeting is held and presentations, comments 
and other input are received. The draft proposals are 
processed and either presented at the Annual Conference or 
returned to committee for further work. These resolutions 
presented at the Annual Conference are voted upon by the 
Active Membership. (See Constitution and Bylaws for voting 
procedures.) If rejected, they go back to committee for 
reassessment or shelving. If approved, they are presented in 
the 

Federal Register

 in final form by EPA. 



1.3.6 Adoption of Standards 



Participating States must adopt the standards to maintain 
status as a NELAP accreditor. If a State chooses not to 
participate in all or part of the accreditation program, 
laboratories in that State may obtain certification from a 
participating State that is approved under NELAP. 



1.4 Roles and Responsibilities of the Federal Government, the States, and Other Parties 



1.4.1 Federal Government (USEPA) 



The role of the federal government, as represented by the 
USEPA (the Agency), shall be that of oversight and evaluation 
of the accrediting authorities and that of administration of 
NELAP program elements which require a high degree of 
standardization between different accrediting authorities. In 
addition, the USEPA shall provide staff support to the 
Conference as provided for in the Bylaws and agreed to by the 
Agency. The EPA shall assist the Conference by publishing in 
the 

Federal Register

 all proposed and final standards. The 
EPA will also evaluate state and federal laboratories to 
assure compliance with NELAC standards. The EPA Administrator 
will appoint a Director of the National Environmental 
Laboratory Program. The Director shall serve as an ex officio 
member of the Board of Directors. He or she shall select a 
senior member of EPA with laboratory accreditation experience 
as the Executive Secretary of the Conference (a full time 
position). The Director's Office shall establish a program 
which evaluates, approves, and reports on the accreditation 
programs implemented by the state accrediting authorities. In 
these reports, state accreditation programs shall be evaluated 
against the national standard as established by the 
Conference. The EPA shall evaluate, inspect, and approve state 
and federal laboratories as complying with NELAC standards. 
In addition, the Agency shall establish a five member board, 
the Accrediting Authority Review Board, composed of 
representatives from the states, EPA, and other federal 
agencies, to review the process and procedures used by EPA to 
approve State and Federal laboratories and accrediting 
authorities. It is recommended that the Agency provide 
administrative support to a performance evaluation sample 
program so as to ensure uniformity of sample composition and 
performance evaluation standards. 



1.4.2 State Governments

<TEXT>
 

State governments shall be the primary accrediting authority. The state's Laboratory Accreditation Program will
be audited and approved by the Director's Office. As the accrediting authority, states will have full responsibility
for ensuring conformance with the national standard established by NELAC. States will be responsible for accrediting
applicant organizations through approving applications, performing on-site assessments and maintaining performance
evaluation sample programs. States are responsible for ensuring that on-site inspectors are trained in accordance
with NELAP requirements. States shall submit the names, and appropriate accreditation material, to the EPA for inclusion
in the National Laboratory Database. States may choose to contract accreditation activities to a third party (non-government)
agency. If contracted to a third party, states remain the accrediting authority and retain responsibility for ensuring
compliance with the standards established by NELAC. 




1.4.3 Joint Federal and State Roles 




The NELAC (Conference) shall be the joint responsibility of the Federal Government (Agency) and the state accrediting
authorities. As provided in the following section on structure of the Conference and the Conference Bylaws, state
accrediting authorities and the Agency share responsibilities of governance, analysis and establishment of policy,
and analysis and establishment of technical standards as they apply to the NELAP. 



1.4.4 Other Parties 




All other interested parties including, but not limited to, the laboratory industry, clients of the laboratory industry,
environmental or other public interest groups, and the general public, shall function as contributors to the Conference.
In this role, these other parties shall bring technical and policy issues to the attention of the Conference, its managing
Board, or its subcommittees. It is anticipated that these issues shall be brought to the Conference in the form of reports,
presentations, discussion material, or other forms of documentation for presentation at the annual Conference,
committee, or subcommittee meetings. 



1.5 Scope of the Program 




The scope of the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program shall encompass the necessary scientific
testing to serve all U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring, compliance or other functions mandated
by statutes and pursuant regulations. Some of the statutes are the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA); the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA): the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean
Water Act); the Clean Air Act (CAA); and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In addition, the program shall also
include provisions to permit special requirements or fields of testing promulgated by any of the States and/or Territories.



However, the program shall not be implemented or administered in a way which limits the ability of local, state or federal
agencies to investigate and prosecute enforcement cases. Specifically, when engaged in the collection and analysis
of forensic evidence to support litigation those agencies may use any procedure that is appropriate given the nature
of the investigation, subject only to the bounds of sound scientific practice. This program shall not apply to those
government laboratories engaged solely in the analysis of forensic evidence.

1.6 Structure of the Accreditation Requirements 



The structure of the NELAP shall be based on the field of testing (see Figure 1-3). It shall consist of a set of general
requirements that all applicants must satisfy. Applicants for a particular field of testing must also meet the necessary
number of additional levels of specific requirements or functions that are linked to the general requirements. The
number and the degree of difficulty of the required additional levels shall depend on the complexity of the test procedures
in question. 


It is proposed that the different fields of laboratory testing be structured into groupings based on parameter, group
of parameters, or method. In addition, a category of supplemental accreditation will be designated. A ``supplemental''
accreditation means accreditation of a laboratory which has met additional methods or parameters required by a state
accrediting authority.
``Supplemental'' accreditation shall be needed only for those few methods and/or parameters which are unique to
a particular state. These supplemental requirements shall be limited in number and scope. 




1.6.1 General Requirements 



The general requirements are applicable to all applicants regardless of their size, volume of business, or field
of testing. The organizational structure, or procedures used by applicant organizations to meet these general requirements
may differ as a function of size or scope of testing of an organization. The general requirements shall include all
the elements outlined in 

General Requirements for the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories,

 ISO/IEC Guide 25: 1990 (E). 


General requirements shall include Health and Safety, and Waste Management Programs. Applicant organizations
shall be required to be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations covering
environmental, and occupational health and safety. Responsibility for the evaluation of compliance with these
rules and regulations shall remain with the appropriate regulatory body. 

The relevant elements listed in the document are as follows: 




1.6.1.1 Organization and Management 




The organization shall be legally identifiable; the organization shall have managerial staff with the authority
and resources needed to discharge their duties; this includes technical management with overall responsibility
for the technical operations, and quality management with responsibility for the quality system and its implementation.





1.6.1.2 Quality System, Audit and Review 




The organization shall establish and maintain a quality system appropriate to the type, range and volume of calibration
and testing activities it undertakes; the quality manual, and related quality documentation, shall state the organization's
policies and operational procedures; the organization shall arrange for audits of its activities at appropriate
intervals to verify that its operations continue to comply with the requirements of the quality system. 




1.6.1.3 Personnel 



The organization shall have sufficient personnel, having the necessary education, training, technical knowledge
and experience for their assigned functions. 




1.6.1.4 Accommodation and Environment 




Organization facilities shall have suitable space, energy sources, lighting, heating and ventilation for proper
performance of calibrations or tests. 



1.6.1.5 Equipment and Reference Materials 



The organization shall be furnished with all items of equipment (including reference materials) required for the
correct performance of calibrations and tests. 



1.6.1.6 Measurement Traceability and Calibration 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00164 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Standards used for calibration must be traceable. 



1.6.1.7 Calibration and Test Methods 



The organization must document instructions on the use and 
operation of all relevant equipment. 



1.6.1.8 Handling of Calibration and Test Items 



The organization must document a system used to identify the 
items to be calibrated or tested. 



1.6.1.9 Records
 


The organization shall maintain a record system to suit its 
particular circumstances and comply with any applicable 
regulations. 



1.6.1.10 Certificates and Reports 



The organization certifies and reports the calibration and/or 
test results. 



1.6.1.11 Sub-Contracting of Calibration or Testing 



The organization shall sub-contract work only to organizations 
that are accredited by a NELAC accrediting authority. 
Subcontractors must be clearly identified. 



1.6.1.12 Outside Support Services and Supplies 



The organization must use only those outside support services 
and supplies that are of adequate quality. 



1.6.1.13 Complaints 



The organization shall have documented policy and procedures 
for the resolution of complaints received from clients or 
other parties about the organization's activities with records 
maintained of all complaints and of the actions taken by the 
organization; where a complaint, or any other circumstance, 
raised doubt concerning the procedures, or other requirements 
or otherwise concerning the quality of the organization's 
calibrations or tests, the organization involved is promptly 
audited in accordance with pre-established procedures. 



1.6.2 Specific Requirements Linkage 



Additional tiers of requirements can be linked to the general 
requirements. To illustrate the tiered approach, a schematic 
representing the accreditation scope and structure by field of 
testing is given in Figure 1-3. It indicates that all NELAP 
applicants must meet the basic requirements. Additional 
specific tiers of requirements are linked to the basic 
requirements for a particular test or activity. An 
organization seeking accreditation in hazardous waste organic 
testing must meet all the requirements listed in basic 
requirements, general laboratory, organic, and hazardous 
waste. The specific and detailed requirements under this 
scheme have not been developed at this time. The appropriate 
and necessary requirements of the various tiers and fields of 
testing will be developed by the Program Structure Committee. 



1.6.3 Discussion 



The field of testing structure proposed for the national 
environmental laboratory accreditation program provides 
flexibility. This allows for the incorporation of new methods 
or new instrumentation without the applicants repeatedly 
demonstrating the basic requirements that the accreditation 
applicants have previously satisfied. Redundancy of 
qualification assessment is avoided. Avoidance of redundant 
reviews and assessments shall significantly expedite the 
processing of applications which cover different fields of 
testing. Such a scheme provides a structure whereby 
appropriate and specific accreditation requirements can be 
established to meet the prevailing needs of environmental laws 
and regulations. Regulators are thus provided with 
environmental sample testing results generated by laboratories 
according to specified or equivalent methods and quality 
assurance protocols. 

Additionally, the adoption of parameter, method specific and 
supplemental classifications allows for the design of 
accreditation to suit needs of individual laboratories and 
states. This flexibility shall promote reciprocity among all 
the participating States. The field of testing approach 
proposed shall also allow for the future incorporation of 
performance based methods (PBM) by substituting an approved 
PBM for the specified analytical methods. Any supplemental 
requirements essential to meet state needs would be added at 
the parameter or method specific level. 



1.7 Funding of the Program 



Funding shall be needed to cover the costs arising from at 
least three areas: the administration and functions of NELAC; 
expenses incurred by EPA through its oversight and related 
administrative duties; and expenses incurred by the States 
because of accreditation functions including on-site visits, 
performance evaluation samples, processing applications, and 
other duties. Funding mechanisms for each of these cost areas 
is proposed below:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00165 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1.7.1 Self Supported NELAC 



The NELAC should be self-sustaining financially insofar as 
possible. The Interim meetings and Annual Conferences 
expenses should be financed by registration fees and annual 
dues for Members and Contributors. These dues and 
registration fees should be set by the Conference Management 
and Funding Committee. Other expenses of committee members 
shall be paid by their organizations. 



1.7.2 EPA Program Support
 


The EPA should provide support for the National Environmental 
Laboratory Accreditation Program. This program includes 
oversight and evaluation of accreditation authorities, 
evaluation and approval of state and federal laboratories, 
administrative support for the Conference, and publications in 
the 

Federal Register

. 



1.7.3 Fee Supported State Programs 



All costs of state accreditation programs may be covered 
through the collection of application fees from the applicant 
organizations. Such fees would cover the cost of application 
and processing, performance evaluation, site assessments, 
staff training, Conference membership and participation, and 
other appropriate activities, whether such activities were 
carried out directly by the state accrediting authority or by 
contract to a third party. It is recommended that a dual fee 
structure be implemented by the state authorities. A full fee 
should be charged applicants for which the state is the 
primary accreditor. A reduced fee should be charged 
applicants for which the state is the secondary accreditor. 
This fee structure is based on the principle that fees shall 
cover the actual cost of an accreditation. The primary 
accrediting authority shall incur the full cost of 
accreditation. The secondary accrediting authority, having 
accepted the accreditation of another authority through 
reciprocity, shall only incur the cost of registration of the 
accredited organization. Costs incurred by a secondary 
accrediting authority related to supplemental requirements, as 
described in section 1.8.2, should be reflected in 
supplemental fees. 



1.8 Reciprocity 



All member accrediting authorities shall grant reciprocity to 
all other member accrediting authorities which have met the 
national standard. This principle of reciprocity is an 
element of the national accreditation standard, to which all 
member accrediting authorities are held. 

Reciprocity among the environmental laboratory accrediting 
authorities is essential to the success of a national program. 
The principal accrediting authorities shall be the states. 
The states or federal agencies which act as accrediting 
authorities, must accept accreditation from other accrediting 
authorities in order for a national uniform program to 
succeed. Three policy issues are presented which are key to 
acceptance of the reciprocity principle by accrediting 
authorities. 



1.8.1 Fair Representation of Accrediting Authorities 



The accrediting authorities must have a fair and 
representative voice in the National Environmental Laboratory 
Accreditation Conference. NELAC shall establish the basic 
scope, structure, and standards of the national program. 
Acceptance of the national program, in lieu of state programs, 
shall be significantly enhanced by fair and meaningful 
participation of state accrediting authorities in the 
establishment of the national program. 



1.8.2 Scope and Essential Quality Standards 



The national program (the national consensus standard) adopted 
by NELAC shall have a scope and essential quality standards 
which meet or exceed the requirements of the existing state 
accrediting authorities. NELAC must consider the range of 
scope and quality systems requirements of the state 
accrediting authorities in the adoption of a national program. 
A national program which falls significantly short of the 
existing state program requirements, shall either not be 
accepted by state authorities, or shall require such extensive 
state supplementary requirements as to make the national 
program irrelevant. It is recognized that certain state 
authorities shall have special requirements which arise from 
a unique statutory, economic, or ecological situation. 
Reciprocity shall be possible if state mandated supplementary 
requirements are limited in number and complementary to the 
national program.

1.8.3 Fee Structures 



NELAC shall adopt a policy which recommends that all 
accrediting authorities institute a fee structure which 
reflects the cost of operation of the accreditation program. 
NELAC requires that laboratories apply for accreditation in 
the state of their primary operation.

2.0 Performance Evaluation Testing Program 



2.1 Enrollment in PE Testing Program 



Each laboratory must enroll in a performance evaluation (PE) testing program that meets the criteria detailed by
the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP). The laboratory must participate in an approved
program or programs for each field of testing for which it seeks accreditation. Participation shall mean the analysis
and reporting of all test samples. Laboratories shall participate in PE testing for all fields of testing at a frequency
determined by the NELAC standards. 

The laboratory must notify the accreditation agency of the NELAP-approved program or programs in which it chooses
to participate to meet PE testing requirements. For those tests performed by the laboratory for which PE testing is
not currently available, the laboratory must establish and maintain the accuracy and reliability of its testing
procedures by a system of internal quality management. 

For each field of testing for which the laboratory seeks accreditation, it must participate in the designated, NELAP-
approved PE testing program for at least twelve months before designating a different program. The laboratory must
notify the primary accreditor before any change in designation. 

Laboratories shall bear the cost of any subscription to a PE testing program required by NELAP. 

Each participant must authorize the PE testing program to release to the primary accreditor all data required to determine
the laboratory's compliance with the criteria. The primary accreditor shall make individual performance results
available to all requesters. 



2.2 Approval of PE Testing Programs 



In order for a PE testing program to receive approval, the program must be offered by a Federal or State agency, or entity
acting as a designated agent for the Federal or State agency. A Federal or State program seeking approval or renewal
for its PE program for the next calendar year must submit an application to the NELAP director providing the required
information by July 1 of the current year. The program must provide technical assistance to resolve problems that
the participants experience such as anomalies during analysis of the samples, lost samples, or receipt of broken
sample containers, etc. In addition, the PE testing program must, 

(a) Assure the quality of test samples, appropriately evaluate and score the PE test results, and identify performance
problems in a timely manner; 

(b) Demonstrate to the primary accreditor (or NELAP) that it has: 

(1) The technical ability required to: 

i. Either prepare samples or evaluate samples purchased from manufacturers, who prepare the samples in conformance
with the appropriate good manufacturing practices; and 

ii. Distribute samples with at least two levels of analytes. Rigorous quality control must assure that samples mimic
actual environmental samples when possible and that samples are homogeneous and remain stable over the period of
testing. Stability shall be verified by routine testing on stored samples, within the time frame for analysis by PE
test participants. Samples shall be maintained by the PE testing program to retest laboratories with unsatisfactory
performance, or which have significant changes in accreditation status;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00168 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) A scientifically defensible process for determining the correct result for each challenge offered by the program;

(3) A program of sufficient challenge, with a frequency of no less than two times per year, to establish that a laboratory
has met performance requirements; 
(4) The resources needed to distribute, analyze and interpret individual laboratory performance. The PE program
will provide:
i. Individual results to the laboratories, 
ii. Statewide and nationwide reports to regulatory agencies on individual laboratory performance on PE test events,

iii. Cumulative reports and scores for each laboratory, and 
iv. Reports of specific laboratory failures using grading criteria acceptable to NELAP,which must be provided on
a timely basis. 
(5) Provisions on each PE report form used by the laboratory to record PE results, an attestation statement that PE
test samples were tested in the same manner as routine samples, with a signature block to be completed by the individual
performing the test as well as by the laboratory management; 
(6) A mechanism for notifying participants of the PE shipping schedule and for participants to notify the PE testing
program within three days of the expected date of receipt of the shipment that samples have not arrived or are unacceptable
for testing. The program must have provisions for replacement of samples that are lost in transit or are received in
a condition that is unacceptable for testing; and 
(7) A process to resolve technical, administrative, and scientific problems about program operations; 
(c) Provide and maintain the following documentation as described: 
(1) Reports of PE test results and all scores for each laboratory's performance (an electronic or a hard copy, or both)
must be provided to the primary accreditor, NELAP, and the participating laboratory in the format required by NELAP
within 60 days after the date by which the laboratory must report PE test results to the PE testing program; 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00169 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Records of each laboratory's performance must be maintained for a period of five years or such time as may be necessary
for any legal proceedings; and 
(3) An annual report must be provided to the primary accreditor and NELAP with, if needed, an interim report, which
identifies any previously unrecognized sources of variability in kits, instruments, methods, or PE samples, which
may adversely affect the ability of the primary accreditor or NELAP to evaluate laboratory performance. 
If a PE testing program is determined by NELAP to fail to meet any criteria for acceptance as an approved performance
evaluation testing program, NELAP will notify the PE testing program and the primary accreditor. The PE program must
notify all laboratories enrolled in their PE program of the nonapproval and the reasons for nonapproval, within 30
days of the notification. 


2.3 Testing of Samples 


The laboratory must examine or test, as applicable, the PE samples it receives from the PE testing program in the same
manner as it tests environmental samples, and return the results by the deadline stated in the sample package. The
analyst testing or examining the samples and the laboratory management must attest to the routine integration of
the samples into the workload using the laboratory's routine methods. The laboratory must test samples the same number
of times that it routinely tests environmental samples. 
Laboratories that perform tests on PE samples must comply with the following restrictions and limitations on communications
and sample transfer: 
(a) Laboratories must not engage in any interlaboratory communications pertaining to the results of PE sample(s)
until after the date by which the laboratory must report the results to the PE program for the PE test event in which the
samples were sent; 
(b) Laboratories with multiple testing sites or separate locations must not participate in any communications or
discussions across sites/locations concerning PE sample results until after the date by which the laboratory must
report the PE test results to the program; and 
(c) The laboratory must not send PE samples or portions of samples to another laboratory for any analysis for which
they seek accreditation. 
Any laboratory that the primary accreditor or NELAP determines intentionally referred its PE samples to another
laboratory for analysis and submits the other laboratory's results as their own, will have its certification revoked
for a minimum period of one year. Any laboratory that receives PE samples from another laboratory for testing must
notify the accreditation program of the receipt of those samples. Laboratories not doing so may have their accreditation
suspended for a period not to exceed one year. This policy is not intended to prevent interlaboratory testing designed
as part of a methods development or evaluation study, and applies only to PE samples. 
The laboratory shall initiate chain of custody procedures upon receipt of all PE samples. The laboratory must maintain
a copy of all records, including analytical worksheets, for a minimum of five years. This record must include a copy
of the PE program report forms used by the laboratory to record PE results, and an attestation statement signed by the
analyst and the laboratory management stating that PE samples were tested in the same manner as routine samples. 


2.4 Scoring 




Option I: 

Pre-established pass/fail range set by calculating 95% confidence interval determined by previous studies. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00170 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Option II: 

Statistical evaluation of data from all participants in the current study. Calculation of 95% and 99% confidence
intervals to set marginal and unsatisfactory performance. 




Option III: 

Pre-established pass/fail intervals as established in 40 CFR 136, appendix B. 



Option IV: 

The following scoring protocol applies to: All chemical analytes; bacteriology samples that require quantitation
(total and fecal coliform in non-potable water); fibers in air determined by phase contrast microscopy; asbestos
in friable solid material by polarized light microscopy; and asbestos in air and potable water by transmission electron
microscopy. 


The true values may be established through robust statistical analysis of the results reported by all laboratories,
in order to reject gross outliers and establish a mean result and standard deviation, or through results obtained
by a panel of 12 reference laboratories (this is done for asbestos in friable material). A laboratory's result on a
given sample is then assessed as: 




Good 

if it is within the 95% confidence interval about the mean, or reported as ``less than'' the method detection limit
if the sample is a blank; 




Marginal 

if it is outside the 95% confidence interval, but within the 99% confidence interval about the mean, or reported as
``less than'' twice the method detection limit; or 




Unsatisfactory 

if it is any other result. 


For each test, a laboratory receives 2 PE samples for each certified analyte. On two consecutive tests, a laboratory
must obtain a passing score of at least 75% on the 4 samples analyzed, calculated by applying the following formula.











Hence, the laboratory must obtain at least two good results plus two marginal results, or three good results plus one
unsatisfactory result, over two consecutive tests. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00171 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In response to the accreditation program guidelines, certain chemistry analytes are scored by taking fixed intervals
about the known target value, where good performance is defined as a result within those fixed target intervals, and
unsatisfactory performance is any other result. 


For the potable water total coliforms, where qualitative analysis is required (i.e., presence/absence), a laboratory
is required to maintain an average passing score of 90% on two consecutive tests. 


Laboratories being tested for the determination of radon in air are required to submit 5 sampling devices to the PE
testing program. Four of these are exposed to a known concentration in a standard atmosphere exposure chamber, and
the remaining device is left unexposed as a ``blank''. The devices are then returned to the laboratories for analysis,
and they are required to report results within 25% of the target value on at least 4 of the 5 devices. 




2.5 Successful Participation 




Each laboratory must successfully participate in a PE testing program approved by NELAP for each field of testing
in which the laboratory is accredited. If a laboratory's accreditation is suspended or revoked because it fails to
participate in PE testing for one or more fields of testing, or voluntarily withdraws its accreditation for the failed
field of testing, the laboratory must then demonstrate satisfactory performance on two consecutive PE test events,
one of which may be onsite, before the primary accreditor will consider it for reinstatement. 


Laboratories shall agree to test additional samples at the option of the primary accreditor for the following situations:



(a) A major change in ownership or supervision of the laboratory; 


(b) Complaints by users or employees; 


(c) Unsatisfactory performance on most recent PE test event; or 


(d) Request by the laboratory to be reinstated in a field of testing. 


Failure to participate in a PE test event shall result in an automatic rating of unsuccessful performance and results
in a score of zero for the PE test event. Consideration may be given to those laboratories failing to participate in
a PE test event only if: 


(a) Routine testing was suspended during the time frame allotted for testing and reporting PE test results; and 


(b) The laboratory notifies the primary accreditor and the PE testing program within the time frame for submitting
PE test results of the suspension of routine testing and the circumstances associated with failure to perform tests
on PE samples. 


Failure to return PE test results to the PE program within the time frame specified by the program is unsuccessful performance
and results in a score of zero for the PE test event. The PE testing program will specify the conditions and procedures
for late submissions, e.g., lost or broken samples. For those late submission categories, the participant will be
allowed to test the samples on an alternate schedule. 


For any unsatisfactory PE test event for reasons other than a failure to participate, the laboratory must undertake
appropriate training and employ the technical assistance necessary to correct problems associated with a PE test
failure.

<TEXT>
 

Remedial action must be taken and documented, and the 
documentation must be maintained by the laboratory for five 
years from the date of participation in the PE test event. 
Failure to achieve an overall PE test event passing score for 
two consecutive PE test events or two out of three consecutive 
PE test events is unsuccessful performance. 


3.0 On-Site Assessment 


3.1 Introduction 


The on-site assessment is an integral part of a lab 
accreditation program and will be one of the primary means of 
determining a laboratory's capabilities and qualifications. 
During the on-site assessment, the assessment team will 
collect information and make observations which will be used 
to evaluate the laboratory's conformance with established 
accreditation criteria. It is essential that the on-site 
assessment be conducted in a uniform, consistent manner 
throughout the nation to facilitate reciprocity among States, 
and for the laboratory community to accept the accreditation 
process. This section contains proposals and recommendations 
for conducting on-site assessments. 


3.2 On-Site Assessment Personnel 


3.2.1 Training 


The National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference 
(NELAC) will specify the minimum level of education and 
training for assessors, including refresher/update training. 
The NELAC will also develop criteria for training 
requirements. The assessor training course will be developed 
and implemented by EPA, NIST, or a non-Federal entity with 
oversight by EPA. A state may develop and implement it's own 
assessor training program, subject to EPA oversight, if the 
state program can meet the NELAC standards. 


3.2.2 Qualifications 


A laboratory assessor may work for a Federal, State, or a 
third party accrediting body. An assessor, including each 
member of an inspection team, must be an experienced 
professional and hold at least a B.S. degree, or equivalent 
education and experience, in the specific discipline being 
evaluated. Each assessor must also have satisfactorily 
completed a laboratory accreditation training course and a 
health and safety training course, and take periodic 
update/refresher training, as specified by NELAC. Each new 
candidate assessor must undergo on-the-job training during one 
or more inspections until judged proficient. 


3.2.3 Additional Qualifications 


In addition, the assessors must: 
(a) Be familiar with the relevant legal regulations, 
accreditation procedures, and accreditation requirements; 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00173 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Have a thorough knowledge of the relevant assessment 
methods and assessment documents; 
(c) Be technically conversant with the specific tests or 
types of tests for which the accreditation is sought and, 
where relevant, with the associated sampling procedures; 
(d) Be able to communicate effectively, both orally and in 
writing; and 
(e) Be free of any commercial interest that might cause the 
assessor to act in other than an impartial or nondiscriminatory manner. 


3.2.4 Assessor Certification 


Before an assessor can conduct on-site inspections, the 
individual must be certified to do so, in writing, by either 
the NELAP or State in which the individual will assess 
laboratories. For each laboratory inspection performed by a 
state-designated third party assessor (i.e. non-EPA, non-State), the assessor must sign a statement before the

inspection, certifying that no conflict of interest exists. 


3.3 Frequency of On-Site Assessments 


3.3.1 Frequency 


Accreditors should perform a routine on-site assessment at 
least annually. Assessments may be more frequent at 
laboratories where a problem exists, including complaints 
about laboratory quality, questions of fraud, or recurring 
failure on performance evaluation samples. 


3.3.2 Follow-Up Evaluations 


In addition to routine evaluations, assessors may need to 
conduct one-time follow-up evaluations at laboratories where 
a significant deficiency was identified by the previous 
evaluation. These evaluations may be limited to determining 
whether a laboratory has corrected its deficiency(ies), or 
determining the merit of a formal appeal from the laboratory. 
When deficiencies may result in downgrading of accreditation 
status, follow-up evaluations should occur as soon as possible 
but no later than 60 days after the original evaluation. 


3.3.3 Changes in Laboratory Capabilities 


The accrediting authority may also deem necessary a limited 
one-time evaluation when a major change occurs at a laboratory 
in personnel, equipment, or a laboratory location that might 
impair analytical/biological capability and quality. A major 
change in personnel is defined as the loss or replacement of 
the laboratory management staff, or loss of a trained and 
experienced individual who performs a particular test for 
which accreditation has been granted. 


3.3.4 Announced and Unannounced Visits 


The accrediting authority is not required to provide advance 
notice of an assessment. However, the policy is to provide 
such notification, based on the circumstances of the 
particular assessment and laboratory. Since these highly 
technical assessments may involve sensitive information and 
because there is a need to ensure that appropriate personnel 
and records are available for assessment, the testing 
laboratory usually is notified in advance of a planned 
assessment. The accrediting authority, at its discretion, may 
conduct unannounced evaluations for cause (e.g., questions of 
fraud, tips, complaints, or problems with performance 
evaluation samples) or as part of a routine practice. 


3.4 Pre-Assessment Procedures 


3.4.1 Introduction 


A good assessment begins with planning, which should commence 
well before the assessment team visits the laboratory. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00174 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Planning is the means by which the lead assessor identifies 
all the required activities to be completed during the 
assessment process. These activities include obtaining 
records before the assessment, conducting the assessment, 
writing reports and following up. 
Pre-assessment activities include: deciding the scope of the 
assessment (Section 3.4.2); assessment planning (Section 
3.4.3); reviewing NELAP/State information (Section 3.4.4); 
providing advance notification of the assessment to the 
laboratory (Section 3.4.5); coordinating the assessment team 
(Section 3.4.6); and gathering assessment documents and 
equipment (Section 3.4.7). Section 3.4.8 discusses 
Confidential Business Information issues. 


3.4.2 Scope of the Assessment 


The first step in the assessment planning process is deciding 
what type of assessment will be conducted. The assessments 
usually include a laboratory evaluation and a records review. 



3.4.2.1 Laboratory Evaluations 


A laboratory assessment obtains a ``snapshot in time'' at a 
testing laboratory by evaluating what activities are being 
conducted when the assessment takes place. During a 
laboratory evaluation, the assessment team may identify a 
number of samples or a recently completed or on-going project 
and evaluate to what extent the tests are being conducted 
according to NELAP or client requirements. 


3.4.2.2 Records Review 


The purpose of a records review is to learn if the testing 
laboratory has maintained data and other information necessary 
to support reports previously issued. During a records 
review, team members will conduct an overall audit of data, 
and will compare data with submitted reports to determine 
whether the data were generated or collected following the 
proper procedures in the NELAP/State, EPA, or client 
requirements. 


3.4.3 Assessment Planning 


Planning includes conducting a thorough review, prior to the 
assessment, of NELAP and/or State records pertaining to the 
laboratory to be inspected. This will save time because 
familiarity with the operation, history, and compliance status 
of the laboratory increases the efficiency and focus of an 
on-site visit. Planning also promotes a better relationship 
with the laboratory community because the lead assessor will 
be better able to answer questions concerning the application 
of NELAP/State requirements to a particular laboratory. It also 
enhances the laboratory's confidence in the lead assessor and 
aids in establishing good relationships with laboratory 
representatives. 
Another important benefit of planning is to enhance the lead 
assessor's ability to identify and document potential problems 
and plan to collect necessary information to assist the 
accrediting authority in their subsequent decisions concerning 
the laboratory. Planning an assessment will result in an 
efficient and productive assessment overall. 


3.4.4 Reviewing NELAP/State Information 


The lead assessor's responsibilities start with receipt of the 
Assessment Assignment. For a records review, copies of all 
appropriate documents related to the laboratory will be 
forwarded by the accrediting authority to the lead assessor or 
directly to a team member, if appropriate, ideally at least 
six weeks prior to the start of the assessment. The lead 
assessor should request any other information that will be 
useful in preparing for the assessment. Such information may 
include: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00175 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Copies of previous assessment reports and PE sample 
results; 
(b) General laboratory information such as laboratory 
submitted self-assessment forms, SOPs and Quality 
Assurance plan; 
(c) Correspondence with laboratory personnel; 
(d) Discussion with appropriate NELAP/State staff; 
(e) Available documents from recipients of reports from the 
laboratory; and 
(f) Relevant program documents such as NELAP/State 
guidelines or SOPs. 


3.4.5 Providing Advance Notification 


No fewer than two weeks prior to an announced assessment, the 
accrediting body will contact the responsible management 
official at the laboratory to schedule the assessment. The 
initial telephone notification will be confirmed by a 
notification letter. A copy of the notification letter also 
will be given to the lead assessor. An assessment assignment 
that gives the name and telephone number of the laboratory 
contact person and of each assessment team member, as well as 
other available information necessary to the planning and 
conduct of the assessment will also be provided to the lead 
assessor. 
Once the laboratory has been notified by the accrediting 
authority that an assessment will be conducted, the primary 
responsibility for the conduct of the assessment passes to the 
lead assessor. Any further communications with the laboratory 
personnel should be made by the lead assessor. The lead 
assessor should keep his/her supervisory personnel informed of 
the status of the assessment, and should consult with them on 
any substantive problems that may arise or changes that may be 
required. 
There are several items to be addressed in the advanced 
notification. The lead assessor should make note of when and 
to whom advance notification was provided. Written advance 
notification should do the following: 
(a) Introduce the lead assessor and team members to the 
laboratory; 
(b) Schedule the assessment, including establishing time of 
arrival; 
(c) Obtain verbal agreement for entry; 
(d) Confirm the appropriate address for the assessment, 
including identifying the location of necessary records, 
as specified in the assessment plan; 
(e) Ensure that laboratory personnel are available to 
accompany assessors during the assessment; 
(f) Encourage the laboratory to transfer all records to the 
assessment site before the assessment; 
(g) Obtain directions to the laboratory; and 
(h) Allow discussion of problems, concerns, or questions 
about the assessment or any other issues. 
Especially when the laboratory has not previously been 
assessed by the accrediting authority, the lead assessor 
should be certain that laboratory personnel are aware of what 
an assessment involves, what data and records should be made 
available and what personnel should be present. If the 
laboratory representative does not cooperate, the lead 
assessor's supervisor and the accrediting authority management 
should be consulted for instructions on how to proceed.

3.4.6 Assessment Team Coordination 


When the identity of the assessment team is known, the lead 
assessor should contact each person and begin planning the 
conduct of the assessment. As early as possible the lead 
assessor should: 
(a) Coordinate travel plans, including the hotel and 
transportation arrangements; 
(b) Notify each team member of the dates of the assessment 
and pre-assessment team meeting; 
(c) Ensure that each team member has been briefed on specific 
procedures for the assessment; 
(d) Define the time allotted for the assessment. The lead 
assessor should be careful not to underestimate the time 
needed to conduct the assessment; and 
(e) Confirm for those individuals who will be conducting the 
records review, their familiarity with the records to be 
reviewed. Each member of the assessment team should be 
aware of their responsibilities during the assessment. 
The lead assessor should also arrange to provide copies of 
applicable NELAP/State standard operating procedures (SOPs) to 
team members who do not already possess these documents. In 
addition, the lead assessor may need to assure that the 
assessment team is aware of proper procedures for receipt and 
handling of confidential business information (CBI). The lead 
assessor should determine the level of experience of each team 
member in conducting laboratory evaluations or records reviews 
under NELAP/State requirements. The lead assessor may need 
to guide less experienced team members, both prior to and 
during the assessment as well as with report preparation. The 
lead assessor should assemble the team just prior to the 
assessment to attend to last minute details. 


3.4.7 Gathering Assessment Documents and Equipment 


Besides preparing the assessment plan and reviewing 
accrediting body records and laboratory submissions prior to 
conducting the assessment, the lead assessor should gather and 
prepare the necessary documents and equipment to be used 
during the assessment. No single list of documents and 
equipment can be appropriate for all assessments. The lead 
assessor's experience in the field and information obtained 
during pre-assessment planning should assist in preparing 
lists tailored to specific assessment sites and needs. 
Specific needs will be determined by the requirements of the 
assessment, the availability of equipment, conditions at the 
laboratory, NELAP/State policies, and whether advance 
notification of an assessment is given. 


3.4.7.1 Types of Documents 


Documents necessary for the assessment should be prepared 
before the assessment, whenever possible. The lead assessor 
should obtain copies of the required assessment forms. 
Several spare copies of each form should always be carried. 
Assessments may require:



_Notice of assessment; 
_Assessment confidentiality notice; 
_Conflict of interest form; 
_Assessor credentials; 
_Assessment assignment; 
_Assessment notification letter; 
_Attendance sheet, opening and closing conference; 
and 
_assessment appraisal form.



In addition, the lead assessor should be certain to take the 
following documents and materials on an assessment: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00177 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Copies of NELAP/State requirements.

 Lead assessors 
should have copies of the applicable NELAP/State 
requirements available upon request. Having such data 
available can help improve the relationship between 
NELAP/State and the laboratory community, which can 
foster better laboratory compliance; 
(b) 

NELAP/State checklists

 for evaluations; 
(c) 

NELAP/State outreach materials.

 Lead assessors should 
provide current, relevant educational, and/or guidance 
information to laboratory officials upon request or as 
deemed appropriate by the lead assessor; and 
(d) 

Administrative information.

 Travel authorizations and 
telephone numbers of travel and procurement personnel who 
may need to be contacted should be taken by the lead 
assessor when on travel. 


3.4.7.2 Assessment Equipment 


The types of equipment that a lead assessor takes to an 
assessment site will vary from assessment to assessment, 
depending upon the nature and extent of the assessment and the 
type of testing laboratory to be inspected. Therefore, prior 
to each assessment, the lead assessor should check the 
equipment to make sure that it is in good working condition. 
Since each assessment is unique, no single list of equipment 
or forms can be devised that will fit every assessment 
situation. 


3.4.8 Confidential Business Information Considerations 


NELAP/State SOPs protect Confidential Business Information 
(CBI) from disclosure. CBI includes trade secrets (including 
process, formulation, or production data) and certain 
financial information, the uncontrolled disclosure of which 
could cause damage to a laboratory's competitive position. In 
general, disclosure of CBI is prohibited, except in certain 
limited situations. 
The lead assessor should keep in mind that information 
obtained from a laboratory during an assessment can, for the 
most part, be disclosed in response to a request from the 
public, or other requesting party, under Federal or State 
Freedom of Information requirements. However, if the data has 
been properly claimed as CBI, it may not generally be 
disclosed under these requirements. 
A lead assessor must present notice to laboratory 
representatives of their right to claim data at the laboratory 
as CBI and such claims are frequently made. Because the lead 
assessor is very likely to require access to CBI before (i.e., 
while preparing for an assessment), during, and after an 
assessment, the lead assessor must be knowledgeable of 
NELAP/State procedures governing access to, handling of, and 
disclosure of CBI. The lead assessor and others who may use 
the information must have CBI access authorization, since only 
authorized individuals may have access to CBI. A CBI-cleared 
lead assessor may obtain access to CBI documents from the 
accrediting authority by requesting access to the information 
from the appropriate official. 
Whether or not it is anticipated that CBI documents will be 
collected during an assessment, the lead assessor must provide 
a NELAP/State assessment confidentiality notice to the 
responsible laboratory official at the beginning of the 
assessment. This notice informs laboratory officials of their 
right to claim part of the assessment data as CBI. The lead 
assessor should be familiar with the procedures for asserting 
a CBI claim, and the criteria that the claimed information 
must meet. 
The lead assessor must take custody of all CBI documents 
before leaving the laboratory, and must maintain them in 
custody, using all proper procedures and safeguards, until 
they can be received by the accrediting authority.

3.5.1 Length of Evaluation



The length of an on-site assessment will depend upon a number of factors, such as the number of tests evaluated, the
number of assessors available, the size of the laboratory, the number of problems encountered during the assessment,
and the cooperativeness of the laboratory staff. The accrediting body should assign an adequate number of assessors
to complete the evaluation within a reasonable period of time. Assessors must strike a balance between thoroughness
and practicality, assuring that the assessment covers all aspects of the laboratory operation.



3.5.2 Opening Conference



Arrival at the facility should occur during normal working hours. The facility representative should be located
as soon as the assessment team arrives on the premises. A laboratory's refusal to admit the assessment team for an evaluation
may result in an automatic failure or loss of accreditation on the part of the laboratory, unless there are extenuating
circumstances that are accepted by the accreditation body. The team leader should notify the accrediting body as
soon as possible after refusal of entry.

When the appropriate official has been located, the team leader should introduce the team and should present credentials.
Many companies require that the assessment team sign a visitor's sheet that contains the name, time, reason for visit,
organization, etc., which should be signed. However, any request for any assessment team member to sign a ``visitor's
release'' or ``waiver'' that would relieve the company of responsibility for injury or that would limit the rights
of the accrediting body to use the data obtained should not be signed. If such a waiver or release is presented, the team
leader should politely explain that they cannot sign and request a blank sign-in sheet. The assessment team leader
should brief the appropriate responsible official(s) of the facility to introduce team members, explain areas to
be evaluated and verify application information.

The assessment team leader should request relevant documents for review that were not part of the application materials,
such as standard operating procedures, chain-of-custody forms, report forms, etc.

The assessment appraisal form should be presented to the appropriate laboratory official with a request that the
form be completed and returned to the accrediting authority after the assessment. This form will allow feedback from
the laboratory on the manner in which the assessment was conducted.



3.5.3 Records Review



The records requested during the opening conference will be reviewed by assessment team members for accuracy, completeness
and proper methodology for each area to be evaluated.

Trade secrets and confidential business information are protected from public disclosure. The type of information
that may be considered confidential business information is defined in 

Title 40, Code of Federal Regulation, Part 2.

 All financial and trade information should be kept confidential, if so requested by the laboratory. All other information
for all aspects of application, assessment and accreditation of laboratories is considered public information.
If the laboratory requests that information other than that noted above is confidential, the information should
be treated as confidential until a ruling can be made by the accreditation body.

The team leader must mark all confidential information received and handle it as required by appropriate laws and
regulations.

<TEXT>
 

3.5.4 Staff Interviews



The assessment team will evaluate a test by having the individual that normally conducts the specific procedure walk
through the procedure, including a step-by-step description of exactly what is done and what equipment and supplies
are employed. The assessor will note and record the procedure on the standardized checklists for that particular
test and application. Any deficiencies shall also be noted and discussed with the individual.

The assessment team members shall have the authority to conduct interviews with any/all staff and, if necessary,
conduct private interviews. Calculations, data transfers, calibration procedures, quality control/assurance
practices and adherence to SOP's shall be assessed for each test.

During the evaluation, sufficient information may become available to indicate that a particular person has violated
an environmental law or regulation, such as knowingly making a false statement on a report. This information should
be carefully documented, since it may be used in a legal action. When the possibility of additional legal investigation
exists, the assessor should not discuss the legal implications of the suspected violation with the individual or
any laboratory representative. However, the assessor should continue to gather the information necessary to complete
the accreditation assessment.



3.5.5 Closing Conference



The assessment team should meet with representatives following the evaluation of the laboratory for an informal
debriefing and discussion of findings.

In the event the laboratory disagrees with the findings of the assessor(s), and the team leader adheres to the original
findings, the area(s) protested shall be documented by the team leader and included in the report to the accreditation
body for consideration. The accrediting authority will make the final determination.

The assessment team should provide the accreditation body with an assessment report encompassing all relevant information
concerning the ability of the applicant laboratory to comply with the accreditation requirements. If data is available
from performance evaluation testing, this should be included in the final report.



3.5.6 Follow-Up Procedures



The accrediting authority will issue the assessment to the applicant laboratory that outlines any areas of deficiencies.
The applicant laboratory should then submit a plan of corrective action, if necessary, and provide any missing documentation
required within 45 days from the date of report receipt.

After reviewing documentation and corrective actions, the accrediting authority will make the decision to pass,
fail or provide interim accreditation for a laboratory. If the deficiencies listed are substantial or numerous,
an additional assessment (possibly unannounced) may be conducted before a final decision for accreditation can
be made.



3.6 Criteria for Assessment



3.6.1 Assessor's Manual



The NELAC will develop a manual(s) for on-site assessors to assure that on-site assessments are performed in a uniform,
consistent manner. The manual(s) will be provided when assessors take the NELAC required training (section 3.2.1)
and will serve as guidance for on-site assessment personnel.

The manual(s) provided to on-site assessors should include instructions for evaluating the following items:




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00180 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Size, appearance, adequacy of the laboratory facility;
(b) Organization and management of the laboratory;
(c) Qualifications and experience of laboratory personnel;
(d) Receipt, tracking and handling of samples;
(e) Quantity, condition, performance of laboratory instrumentation and equipment;
(f) Preparation and traceability of calibration standards;
(g) Analytical and biological methodology (including the laboratory's standard operating procedures as well as
confirmation of individuals' adherence to SOPs, and the individual's proficiency with the methodology);
(h) Data reduction procedures, including an examination of raw data and confirmation that final reported results
can be traced to the raw data/original observations;
(i) Quality assurance/quality control procedures, including adherence to the laboratory's quality assurance
plan and adequacy of the plan;
(j) General health and safety procedures as they relate to good scientific practices;
(k) Laboratory waste disposal procedures;
(l) Environmental and toxicological test methods and SOPs; and
(m) Care, use, and maintenance of test organisms.


3.6.2 Assessors Role


When performing an on-site laboratory evaluation, the assessor must appraise each of the areas listed in section
3.6.1. The on-site assessor should use a variety of tools in the evaluation process. The experience of the assessor,
his/her observations, interviews with laboratory staff, and examination of SOPs, raw data, and the laboratory's
documentation will all play an important role in the assessment. The role of the on-site assessor is a critical one
in the entire laboratory accreditation process. The accreditation of a particular laboratory will depend to a large
extent on the assessor's recommendation. While much of the on-site assessment will depend upon the assessor's judgement,
the recommendation not to accredit a laboratory must be based on factual information, not on opinions or suppositions.
Therefore it is crucial that the on-site assessor have a clear understanding of the laboratory's procedures and policies,
and that the assessor document any deficiencies. Also the assessor should discuss any deficiencies with the laboratory's
management in order to allow them to provide additional information which might affect the assessor's recommendations.


3.6.3 Checklists


Standardized checklists for the on-site assessment must be used. The use of checklists does not discourage the need
for additional observations and staff interviews, but is merely another tool in the assessor's inventory which assists
in conducting a thorough and efficient evaluation. Using a checklist as a substitute for assessor training and experience
must not occur.





Note: 

It is anticipated that standardized checklists will be developed or adopted by NELAC's On-Site Assessment Committee
for the assessor's review of analytical and biological methodology.


3.6.4 Evaluation Criteria

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00181 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The following considerations should be taken into account by on-site assessors when evaluating the areas listed
in section 3.6.1:


3.6.4.1 Facility Assessment


The assessor(s) should tour the laboratory facility with the laboratory management representative. Usually the
tour will occur during the initial phase of the on-site visit, perhaps after the opening conference. During the tour,
the assessor should visually inspect the facility with respect to general housekeeping, cleanliness, lighting,
bench space and continuous temperature monitoring (if required). The assessor should note whether the appropriate
laboratory services (e.g., vacuum system, compressed air, gases, etc.) are available. It may be necessary to have
the laboratory representative demonstrate that certain pieces of equipment are working properly, for example,
a fume hood may be turned on to assure that it does indeed exhaust air from the laboratory. This type of demonstration
is not intended to certify that the hood meets design specifications or safety requirements, but merely that it is
operational. During the tour, the assessor(s) should determine if sample storage areas are sufficient and whether
there are problems with laboratory operations which would affect data quality. For example, an extraction operation
located in the same room where volatile organic analyses are performed could contribute contamination to the volatile
organic analyses. Any problems or deficiencies with the laboratory facility should be brought to the attention of
the laboratory management at the time of the tour and reinforced at the closing conference. If discrepancies are noted
between statements made by the laboratory representative and visual observations, it may be necessary to interview
other laboratory personnel to obtain an explanation of the situation. As with all areas of the on-site assessment,
the experience and training of the on-site assessor are critical to the success of the facilities evaluation.


3.6.4.2 Organization Assessment


The assessor should review laboratory QA plans, SOPs, organizational charts and/or other documentation to determine
the laboratory's operational structure. If a documented organizational plan exists, the assessor should ascertain
during subsequent interviews with laboratory personnel if the laboratory operation follows the documented plan.
The assessor should interview laboratory management to determine the roles of management and how laboratory policy
is created. The absence of a documented organizational structure, clearly defined functional responsibilities,
and lines of communication, should be considered a deficiency.


3.6.4.3 Personnel Assessment


The assessor should review the laboratory's written qualification requirements for each position, and the qualifications
of those persons currently holding the positions. Key personnel, e.g., laboratory management staff, quality assurance
coordinator, section managers, chief analysts, etc., should be interviewed to verify their qualifications for
their positions. These interviews may be conducted concurrently with interviews on analytical and biological procedures,
quality control requirements, etc., in order to expedite the process. The assessor should be cautious when making
judgments on personnel qualifications, and must be aware that experience may be an acceptable substitute for formal
education. When in doubt concerning personnel qualifications, the assessor should conduct an in-depth interview
with the individual to determine his/her expertise in a given area.





Note: 

Section 5, Quality Systems, contains details on personnel qualifications.


3.6.4.4 Sample Handling Assessment


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00182 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The assessor should review the laboratory's SOP for sample 
receipt to assure that all appropriate elements (e.g., proper 
sample containers, preservatives, chain of custody, sample 
storage, sample rejection policy, etc.) are included. Any 
omissions should be brought to the attention of the laboratory 
management and appropriate laboratory staff person. Absence 
of a written sample receipt SOP should be considered a serious 
deficiency. The assessor should inspect the sample storage 
areas to insure that the facilities are adequate and secured. 
Cold storage facilities should be checked for maintenance of 
proper temperatures, proper monitoring devices (thermometers, 
etc.) and appropriate documentation. Sample receipt personnel 
should be interviewed to determine their adherence to the SOP. 
Sample receipt documentation and chain-of-custody records 
should be reviewed to determine if documentation is adequate. 
Failure to follow SOPs may be considered a serious deficiency, 
depending on the degree of deviation. Failure to keep sample 
receipt and chain-of-custody documentation should be 
considered a serious deficiency. 



3.6.4.5 Equipment Assessment 



The assessor should determine if the laboratory has all 
equipment and instrumentation necessary to perform the 
analyses for which certification is requested. This 
determination should be performed by visual inspection of the 
laboratory. The assessor should determine if the equipment is 
in reasonable working condition. An actual demonstration of 
equipment performance is not necessary in all circumstances, 
but should be required if the assessor has doubts about the 
condition of certain pieces of equipment. The absence of a 
required piece of equipment or instrument for a particular 
test should be considered a serious deficiency. The assessor 
should determine if the laboratory has written records of 
equipment repairs, maintenance, testing and calibration. 



3.6.4.6 Calibration Standards Assessment 



The assessor shall ascertain whether the laboratory has the 
necessary stock calibration standards and should spot check 
calibration standards to see if they are within expiration 
dates. The assessor should determine if stock standards are 
properly stored, e.g., volatile organic standards are stored 
in sealed vials in a freezer. The assessor should examine the 
laboratory's records for stock standards and the preparation 
of working standards to determine if the records are complete. 



3.6.4.7 Methodology Assessment 



The assessor should determine whether the laboratory has 
standard operating procedures for all test methods used by the 
laboratory. The standard operating procedures should be 
reviewed to determine if they adequately address all aspects 
of the analytical and biological procedures, e.g., sample 
preparation, calibration standard preparation, instrument 
calibration, etc. The analysts should be interviewed to 
verify that they have access to and are following the standard 
operating procedures for all methods. The lack of analytical 
and biological standard operating procedures or significant 
deviations from the standard operating procedures should be 
considered as serious deficiencies. 

While the ideal on-site assessment would consist, in part, of 
observing each individual perform his/her assigned work, time 
considerations will not permit this approach in a laboratory 
which conducts a wide variety of analytical or biological 
procedures. Consequently, the on-site assessor will need to 
rely more heavily on interviews with laboratory personnel, 
observations, and review of records to determine proficiency 
with, and knowledge of, the analytical or biological 
methodology. The assessor's experience and training will play 
a key role in this process. 

The assessor should be familiar with the performance of a 
test, so that the appropriate technical questions may be asked 
of the laboratory's analysts. The assessor should pose 
questions to the laboratory's staff in such a way as to not 
lead the individual into the correct response. The 
individual's responses should be cross-checked with the 
laboratory's documentation. During interviews with the 
individuals, it may be unclear as to how the analytical and 
biological procedures are being performed. If this occurs, 
then the assessor should ask the individual to demonstrate the 
procedure. 



3.6.4.8 Data Audit 



The assessor should perform a data audit on an appropriate 
number of sample sets which contain all the tests for which 
the laboratory is seeking accreditation. It may be necessary 
to audit multiple sample sets in order to cover all tests. 
The assessor should verify that the required sample receipt 
documentation and chain-of-custody records are on file and 
that they contain all necessary information. The assessor 
should obtain final data reports for the sample set being 
audited. The assessor should verify that the final reports 
contain the following information: 





_Sample receipt date; 

_Sample analysis date; 

_Sample identification; 

_Method used for analysis; 

_Quantitation units, e.g., mg/L, mg/Kg,  u g/m

3

, etc.;

<TEXT>
 

_If sample is a solid, whether results are 
calculated on a wet weight or dry weight basis, and 
if on a dry weight basis, the percent moisture or 
percent solids; 

_The sample result (if the result is none detected, 
the method detection limit should also be 
reported); and 

_Method of statistical determination of test result, 
if applicable. 




The assessor should assure that all information needed to 
verify the final result is on file, including reasons for 
invalidating testing results if this has occurred. The 
information may include sample preparation data, instrument 
output (chromatograms, mass spectra, strip charts), instrument 
calibration records, and records of dilutions. Once the 
information is located, the assessor should recreate the 
calculation in order to verify the final reported result. The 
absence of the required information needed to verify the final 
result should be considered a serious deficiency. If the 
assessor is unable to recreate a calculation, the problem 
should be discussed with laboratory personnel in an attempt to 
resolve the issue. If any calculations/final results are 
determined to be incorrect, the assessor should examine 
approximately ten percent of the data for the test in question 
over a selected time period to see if a systematic error has 
occurred. 

In addition to auditing results from routine sample analyses, 
assessors must also audit results of performance evaluation 
(PE) samples analyzed by the laboratory for the NELAP. 
Assessors should verify that the sample(s) were analyzed using 
the criteria set forth by NELAP. The data generated during 
the analysis of PE samples should be examined and compared 
with final results reported to the NELAP. 



3.6.4.9 QA Plan Assessment 



The assessor should examine the laboratory's written QA Plan 
to determine if it conforms to the Quality Systems 
requirements in Section 5.0. The assessor should examine the 
laboratory's raw data to ascertain if the required QC checks 
have been documented. If QC criteria were exceeded, the 
assessor must determine if corrective action was initiated. 
Laboratory personnel should be interviewed to determine if 
they understand and follow the requirements of the QA Plan. 
Laboratory management should be interviewed to determine their 
commitment to the QA program. The absence of a QA Plan, or an 
incomplete QA Plan, should be considered a major deficiency. 
The lack of appropriate corrective action or documentation of 
corrective action should be considered a serious deficiency.

3.6.4.10 General Health and Safety Procedures 



The responsibility for promulgating and enforcing occupational 
safety and health standards rests with the U.S. Department of 
Labor.
 While it is not within the scope of the assessment 
team to evaluate all health and safety regulations, any 
obviously unsafe condition(s) should be described to the 
appropriate laboratory official, and reported to the 
appropriate state or federal agency. The accreditation on-
site assessment is not intended to certify that the laboratory 
is in compliance with all applicable health and safety 
regulations. 





3.6.4.11 Laboratory Waste Disposal Assessment 



The assessor(s) should ask if adequate facilities are 
available for the collection, storage and/or treatment (if 
applicable) of all laboratory wastes. The waste disposal 
system(s) should be operated in such a manner to protect the 
air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all 
releases from fume hoods and bench operations. Compliance is 
also required with any wastewater discharge permits and 
regulations. It is the laboratory's responsibility to comply 
with all federal, state, and local regulations governing waste 
management, particularly the hazardous waste regulations. 
The accreditation on-site assessment is not intended to 
certify that the laboratory is in compliance with all 
applicable waste disposal regulations. 



3.7 Documentation of On-Site Assessment 



3.7.1 Checklists 



The checklists used by the assessors during the assessment 
should become a part of the permanent file kept by the 
NELAP/State on each laboratory. 



3.7.2 Report Format 



Evaluation reports should be generated in a narrative format, 
allowing for differences in style and technique between 
accrediting authorities. Deficiencies must be addressed at a 
minimum, however, documentation of positive aspects should be 
included. Documentation of existing conditions at the 
laboratory should be included in each report to serve as a 
baseline for future contacts with the facility. 



3.7.3 Distribution 



The accrediting authority should be recognized as having the 
responsibility for the content of the evaluation reports. The 
team leader should compile, edit and submit the final report 
to the accrediting authority. The team leader must assure 
that the results within the final report conform to 
established criteria for the evaluated parameters. 



3.7.4 Report Deadline 



No longer than thirty (30) days should elapse from the last 
day of an on-site evaluation until the report is submitted to 
the accrediting authority for review and final decision. 



3.7.5 Release of Report 



On-site evaluation reports should be released by the 
accrediting authority only. The reports will be released to 
the management of the affected laboratory and to those persons 
nominated by the laboratory to receive a copy of the report. 
The assessment report shall not be released until the 
assessment and all other appropriate action has been 
completed. In accordance with the Freedom of Information 
requirements, any documentation adjudged to be proprietary, 
financial and/or trade information will be considered exempt 
from release to the public. 



3.7.6 Report Storage Time 



At a minimum, copies of all evaluation reports must be 
retained by the evaluators and the accrediting authority for 
a period of five years, or longer if required by regulation.

4.0 Accreditation Process 



4.1 Components of Accreditation 



These criteria must be fulfilled for accreditation. The 
components and criteria are herein described. 



4.1.1 Personnel Qualifications 



This component ensures that the managerial and supervisory 
personnel in the environmental laboratory meet a minimum set 
of qualifications that address the elements of education, 
training and experience. It should be recognized that some of 
these elements are interconnectable, i.e. a greater magnitude 
of training and/or experience may substitute for lesser 
degrees of formal education. Refer to Quality Systems for a 
detailed review of supervisors and managers, and the criteria 
to be maintained by the supervisors and managers for awarding 
accreditation. 



4.1.2 On-Site Assessments 



On-site assessments and evaluations may be of two types: 
announced and unannounced. The assessment ensures that the 
environmental laboratory is capable of performing analyses to 
the level, precision and accuracy required by the specific 
method or performance based method. Announced assessments test 
these methods and evaluate the results against the criteria 
under the best circumstances in a controlled environment. The 
unannounced assessment measures the abilities of the 
laboratory to meet these standards for methods on an average 
day under normal working conditions and in a normal working 
environment. Each type of assessment has limitations and 
advantages, but the information obtained from both will 
provide a higher degree of confidence in the ability of the 
laboratory to attain a required level of competence in the 
quality of data produced for regulatory and compliance 
purposes. Refer to on-site assessment for additional 
information regarding frequency, procedures, criteria, 
scheduling and documentation of on-site assessments. 



Announced Assessments

_The elements present in and criteria 
for announced assessments for national accreditation are: 

(a) The assessment must be performed a minimum of one time 
per year and be conducted on-site; i.e., the site at 
which the actual analyses take place; 

(b) The assessment may consist of any or all of the 
categories for which the laboratory wants to obtain 
accreditation; 

(c) The inspector must have access to all information and 
data requested both for analyses completed and laboratory 
personnel; 

(d) The results of the assessment and the Performance 
Evaluation sample analyses indicating satisfactory or 
unsatisfactory performance will be sent to the National 
Database on environmental laboratories; and 

(e) At least two performance evaluation (PE) samples, twice 
per year, for each method or field of testing, must be 
successfully analyzed according to the standards 
established for quality assurance/quality control, 
precision and accuracy. It may not be required to 
analyze PE samples during the on-site assessment. 
Marginal performance on any previous PE samples can be 
grounds for requiring that a subsequent PE sample 
analysis be performed under the observation of an 
inspector. 



Unannounced Assessments

_The elements and criteria for the 
unannounced assessments for the purpose of the national 
accreditation program are: 

(a) The inspector may not be denied immediate access to the 
laboratory facility; 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00186 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Elements (a) through (d) under announced assessments are 
also applicable to unannounced assessments; 
(c) Performance evaluation samples may be distributed and 
analyses run in the categories and for the methods that 
are determined by and prescribed by the inspector; and 
(d) All performance evaluation samples and other analyses 
required by the inspector are to be done as directed by 
the inspector. These include parameters such as: 
specified equipment, analysts and times, but are not 
limited to these factors. 


Factors Examined in Announced and Unannounced Laboratory 
Assessments.

_Refer to On-site Assessments for assessment criteria required 
to be satisfied for accreditation. It should be noted, the 
inspector is not limited to these factors in reaching an 
evaluation and conclusion. Other factors may be considered 
and documented as appropriate. 

Laboratories will be furnished with an inspection report 
documenting any deficiencies found in the factors listed above 
or any others considered by the inspector. It shall also 
include whether a specific method passed or failed based on 
the Performance Evaluation sample. All such reports are 
public record and any or all of the information contained 
therein may be put into the National Database. Proprietary 
data will be excepted from all public records. 

The laboratory will have no more than 45 days from the date of 
receipt of the report to correct deficiencies noted in the 
inspection report. At that time, if no remedial action has 
been taken to correct the noted deficiencies, accreditation 
for categories or specific methods within those categories 
will be immediately revoked. 



4.1.3 Performance Evaluation Samples 



A critical component of laboratory assessments is the analysis 
of the Performance Evaluation Samples. Refer to Performance 
Evaluation Testing, specifically Testing of Samples, for 
additional information regarding separate treatment of 
Performance Evaluation samples, discussion of issues of 
availability, and purity and distribution. Performance 
Evaluation samples would be used and evaluated in the 
accreditation process in the following manner: 

(a) All laboratories seeking National Accreditation must 
receive, examine and analyze initial performance 
evaluation sample(s) for each category (e.g., drinking 
water, hazardous waste, etc.) in which they are 
requesting accreditation. The analysis must be completed 
and the results reported to the performance evaluation 
testing organization or the Inspector within 45 days of 
the receipt of the sample. 

(b) Each laboratory seeking national accreditation shall also 
be required to perform analyses on at least two 
performance evaluation samples, two concentrations, two 
times per year in each category for which they have 
applied for accreditation or for which the laboratory is 
currently accredited. 

(c) The laboratory will be informed of the results of the 
performance evaluation sample analysis within 60 days of 
receipt by the state agency or authorized third party 
contractor. The results of all of the performance 
evaluation sample tests indicating satisfactory or 
unsatisfactory compliance will be public record and will 
be recorded on the national database. 

(d) The results of the performance evaluation sample analysis 
will be considered, along with other information obtained 
from announced and/or unannounced assessments in 
determining whether accreditation should be granted, 
denied or modified for a category, or whether the 
laboratory should lose accreditation for a category or 
method within a category. 



4.1.4 Corrective Action Reports 



The purpose of the corrective action report is to have a 
written record of response to deficiencies that are noted in 
the laboratory assessment procedure. 
(a) After being notified of deficiencies from the laboratory 
inspection, the laboratory has 45 days from the date of 
receipt of the deficiency report to submit a corrective 
action report. 

(b) The state authority or authorized third party contractor 
will respond to the action noted in the corrective action 
report within 30 days of receiving it. The report must 
address each of the deficiencies noted on the deficiency 
report. 

(c) A laboratory can lose accreditation in a category or a 
method within a category by any or all of the following 
items: 

i. Failing to respond to corrective action two times; 

ii. Failing to submit a corrective action report; 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00187 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

iii. Failing to address each item noted as a deficiency 
in the corrective action report; 
iv. Failing the same performance evaluation sample 
analysis two consecutive times for the same 
analyte; or 
v. Failing to achieve an overall testing event passing 
score for two consecutive testing events or two out 
of three consecutive testing events. 
(d) All information included and documented in a deficiency 
report and the corrective action report are considered to 
be public information. Other states participating in the 
National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program 
would have access to this information through a national 
database. At a minimum, the database would include the 
following information: 
i. Name and location of laboratory; 
ii. Number and dates of assessments performed and 
whether they were announced or unannounced; 
iii. Performance evaluation samples and analyses done, 
the date completed and the status (in process; 
passed, failed); 
iv. Categories and methods for which the laboratory is 
currently accredited and date of accreditation; 
and/or 
v. Categories and method for which the laboratory has 
lost accreditation and the date of loss of 
accreditation. 


4.1.5 Ethical Standards 



Elements in a national program that ensure consistency and 
promote the use of quality assurance/quality control 
procedures to generate quality data for regulatory purposes 
are 
(a) NELAC strongly recommends requires that each laboratory 
seeking national accreditation have a named Quality 
Assurance Officer. NELAC strongly recommends that the 
Quality Assurance Officer be a person other than any 
supervisor of laboratory analysts, who reports directly 
to the laboratory management and not to the laboratory 
supervisor in matters related to quality assurance and 
quality control of analyses, methods relating to these 
analyses, and instrumentation. 
(b) NELAC will consider that responsibility for falsification 
of data, records or instrument parameters will rest upon 
the Quality Assurance Officer (named in 4.1.4a above), 
the laboratory management and the company. 
(c) The National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation 
Program shall establish a ``Laboratory Fraud Hotline'' 
telephone number. Alleged cases of data, record or 
analytical fraud reported via this hotline will be 
referred to the relevant state authority for 
investigation. The fact that a federal or state has 
taken regulatory, legal, or contractual action against a 
laboratory will be made available on the national 
database. 


4.1.6 Fee Process for National Accreditation 



Refer to Policy and Structure, specifically funding of the 
program 1.7.3, regarding the funding of state accreditation 
programs, including a fee structure covering the actual cost 
of an accreditation. 
(a) The cost incurred in the application process for national 
environmental laboratory accreditation will be called an 
accreditation fee. 
(b) Where required, accreditation fees will be paid to the 
state(s) which grants accreditation to the laboratory. 
These fees must be paid in accordance with existing state 
regulations, levels and practices.

(c) Failure to remit the accreditation fee within the time 
limit as established by the individual state authority 
will be grounds for immediate loss of accreditation in 
that state. The loss of accreditation will immediately 
be entered in the national database. 



4.1.7 Application Process 



The National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program 
encompasses a standardized set of elements in each application 
for accreditation that will be reported to and recorded in the 
national database. The application package includes any 
specific state regulatory requirements that are essential for

4.1.8 Transfer of Ownership/Change of Ownership and/or 
Location of Laboratory 



Accreditation may be transferred when the legal status or 
ownership of an accredited laboratory changes without 
affecting its staff, equipment, and organization. The 
accrediting agency may charge a transfer fee and shall conduct 
an on-site assessment to verify affects of such changes on 
laboratory performance. 

The following conditions apply to the change in ownership 
and/or the change in location of a laboratory that has 
national accreditation. 

(a) Any change in ownership and/or location of an accredited 
laboratory must be reported in writing to the primary 
state(s) and the National Environmental Laboratory 
Accreditation Program within twenty business days of such 
a change taking effect. 

(b) Such a change in ownership and/or location will not 
necessarily require reaccreditation or reapplication in 
any or all of the categories in which the laboratory is 
currently accredited. 

(c) Change in ownership and/or location may require a 
mandatory on-site assessment with the elements of the 
assessment being determined by the inspector. 

(d) Any change in ownership must assure historical

responsible for any analyses, data and reports 
generated before the legal transfer of ownership 
occurs. 



4.1.9 ``Certification of Compliance'' Statement 



The following ``Certification of Compliance'' statement must 
accompany the application for laboratory accreditation. It 
must be signed and dated by both the laboratory management and 
the quality assurance officer for that laboratory. 



Certification By Applicant 



The applicant understands and acknowledges that the laboratory 
is required to be continually in compliance with the National 
Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program's rules and 
regulations concerning laboratory accreditation and standards 
and will be subject to the penalty provisions provided 
therein. 

The applicant understands and acknowledges that accreditation 
is specifically subject to unannounced assessments. 

Authorized representatives of any state in which the 
laboratory is accredited may make an announced or unannounced

4.2 Period of Accreditation



For a laboratory in good standing, the period for 
accreditation within categories for methods or analytes will 
be reevaluated yearly and will be considered to be ongoing 
once a laboratory has been accredited for that category, 
method, or analyte. The loss of accreditation for categories, 
methods or analytes will occur upon not fulfilling any of the 
conditions outlined below in the sections on maintaining 
accreditation and supervision, revocation and loss of 
accreditation. Additionally, failure to pay the required fees 
as determined by the participating states within the 
stipulated deadlines or by the stipulated dates will result in 
loss of accreditation. This information will be entered into 
the National Database. 

There is a separate process for accreditation for new 
categories, methods and analytes (vide supra: Application 
Process, 4.1.7). 

Each year the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation 
Program will provide each laboratory with a current directory 
with information on what categories, methods, and analytes for 
which they are accredited. Additionally, new categories, 
methods, and analytes will appear on the actual certificate 
that is reissued as these items are added and/or deleted 
during the year. All new categories will be included in 
updates to the database. 



4.3 Maintaining Accreditation 



Accreditation remains in affect until revoked by the 
accrediting authority, until discontinued by the accredited 
laboratory, or until expiration of accreditation date. To 
maintain accreditation, the accredited laboratory shall 
complete or comply with elements 4.3.1 TO 4.3.7. Failure to 
complete or comply with these elements may be cause for 
downgrading or revoking accreditation.

4.3.1 Performance Evaluation Samples 



Performance evaluation samples appropriate for the accredited 
methodology shall be acquired twice per year from a source 
acceptable to the National Environmental Laboratory 
Accreditation Program, successfully analyzed, and reported to 
the accrediting body within required deadlines. In the event 
of unsatisfactory performance and required reanalysis, repeat 
analysis shall also be completed and reported within 
established deadlines. Poor performance on a performance 
evaluation sample or failure to submit results within required 
deadlines may be cause for downgrading accreditation. 



4.3.2 On-Site Assessments 



Announced on-site assessments shall be performed by the 
accrediting agency at a minimum frequency of one assessment 
every year. Unannounced on-site assessments or follow-up on-site assessments may be conducted more frequently,
for cause, 
at the option of the accrediting agency. Situations which 
might trigger an unannounced on-site assessment or follow-up 
on-site assessment include, review of a previously deficient 
on-site assessment, poor performance on a performance 
evaluation sample, change in other accreditation elements, or 
other information concerning the capabilities or practices of 
the accredited laboratory. On-site assessments, regardless of 
frequency, shall be successfully completed to maintain 
accreditation. Deficiencies identified during the on-site 
assessment shall be corrected within deadlines established in 
these guidelines or according to deadlines in an approved 
correction action plan. Failure to pass an on-site assessment 
or to correct deficiencies according to the provisions of an 
approved corrective action plan may be cause for downgrading 
accreditation. 



4.3.3 Other Accreditation Elements 



The accredited laboratory shall maintain other key 
accreditation elements which originally served as the basis 
for accreditation including the facility, organization and 
management, qualifications of key personnel, sample handling 
procedures, calibration standards, analytical methods, data 
reduction procedures, and laboratory quality assurance plan. 
Failure to maintain, revise, or replace any of these key 
components may be cause for downgrading accreditation status. 



4.3.4 Notification and Reporting Requirements 




The accredited laboratory shall notify the accrediting body of 
any changes in key accreditation criteria including but not 
necessarily limited to the laboratory ownership, location, key 
personnel, and major instrumentation. The accredited lab shall 
also comply with any other reporting requirements identified 
in these guidelines. 



4.3.5 Record Keeping and Retention 



All lab records associated with accreditation parameters, 
including raw data associated with each analysis, changes in 
method standard operating procedures, or the laboratory 
quality assurance plan, shall be maintained for a minimum of 
five years unless otherwise designated for a longer period in 
another regulation. In the case of data used in litigation, 
the laboratory is required to store such records for a longer 
period upon written notification from the accrediting agency. 



4.3.6 Payment of Fees 



The accredited lab shall pay all fees associated with 
maintaining accreditation to the accrediting body within 
established deadlines. 



4.4 Suspension, Revocation and Denial of Accreditation

Reasons to deny an initial application or reapplication shall 
include: 

(a) Failure of laboratory staff to meet the personnel 
qualifications as required by NELAC. These 
qualifications include education, training and experience 
requirements. 

(b) Failure to successfully perform performance evaluation 
test as required by NELAC. 

(c) Failure to attest that analysis are performed by approved 
methodologies and/or in accordance with NELAC 
requirements. 

A laboratory shall have two opportunities to correct the areas 
of deficiencies which results in a denial of applications. If 
the laboratory is not successful in remedying said 
deficiencies, it must wait six months before again applying 
for accreditation. 

Revocation_shall mean the total withdrawal of a laboratory's 
accreditation by the accrediting authority. The laboratory 
cannot reapply for accreditation for 6 months, by which time 
the reason/cause of the revocation must be corrected. 

Reasons for revocation shall include: 

(a) Failure to participate or unsatisfactory performance in 
the performance evaluation testing program as required by 
the program. 

(b) Submitting performance evaluation sample results 
generated by another laboratory. 

(c) Misrepresentation of any material fact pertinent to 
receiving initial approval. 

(d) Denial of entry for laboratory inspection. 

(e) Conviction of charges of the falsification of any report 
of or relating to a laboratory analysis. 

(f) Failure to pay accreditation fees. 

No laboratory's accreditation will be revoked or a renewal 
denied without the opportunity to request a hearing. 

Suspension shall mean the temporary removal of a laboratory's 
accreditation for a defined period of time. The purpose of 
suspension is to allow a laboratory time to correct 
deficiencies or area of non-compliance with program 
requirements as defined by regulation. A suspended laboratory 
would not have to reapply for accreditation if the 
cause/causes for suspension are corrected within six months. 
A laboratory's accreditation may be suspended in total or in 
part. It may retain those areas of accreditation where it 
continues to meet the standards and requirements of the 
program. 

Reasons for suspension shall include: 

(a) Failure to successfully perform performance evaluation 
tests pursuant to the requirements of the program; 

(b) Failure to submit and implement corrective action related 
to deficiencies found during laboratory inspections; 

(c) Loss of personnel with the required educational, training 
and experience qualifications; or 

(d) Failure to pay accreditation application fees.

<TEXT>
 

If a laboratory completes all of the requirements for accreditation except that of an on-site assessment because
the accrediting authority is unable to schedule the assessment an interim accreditation shall be issued and will
be in effect until the assessment requirements have been completed. Interim accreditation will allow a laboratory
to perform analyses and report results of samples with the same status as a fully accredited laboratory until an on-site
assessment has been completed. Accreditation will still be granted when performance evaluation samples are not
available. 




4.5.2 Revocation of Interim Accreditation 




Revocation of interim accreditation may be initiated for due cause as described in 4.4.0 by order of the accrediting
agency, without right to a hearing. 




4.6 Awarding of Accreditation 




When a participating laboratory has met the requirements specified for receiving accreditation, the laboratory
will receive a single certificate awarded on behalf of the state accrediting authority. The certificate will provide
the following information: the name of the laboratory, address of the laboratory, the specifications of the accreditation
action (for example, the laboratory may be accredited for analysis of water or for use of a specific analytical methodology,
etc.), the states in which the laboratory may operate. Even though a parent laboratory is accredited, the subfacilities
(laboratories operating under the same parent organization, analytical procedures, and quality assurance system)
are also required to become accredited. The subfacilities accredited will be listed on the certificate of the parent
laboratory. 




4.6.1 The Certificate of Accreditation 




The certificate of accreditation will briefly define the rules of obtaining and maintaining accreditation. Finally,
the certificate will be signed by a member of the accrediting authority. 


To address the concern that an individual state may revoke a laboratory's accreditation for work in that state, the
certificate will explain that continued accredited status depends on successful ongoing participation in the program.
The certificate will urge a customer to verify the laboratory's current accreditation standing within a particular
state. The certificate must be returned to the accrediting agency upon loss of accreditation. 




4.6.2 Changes in Areas of Accreditation 




If an accredited laboratory increases its areas of accreditation, a new certificate will be awarded which details
the spectrum of accreditations the laboratory has achieved. 




4.7 Enforcement 




The development of an enforcement component of the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP)
should be based on explicit values, or principles, with which all participants concur. The proposed basic principles
are: 



(a) The program should be fair to all participants; 

(b) The rules should be well publicized; 


(c) The program needs of the participating agencies must be upheld; and 


(d) The due process rights of participating laboratories must be protected. 


The major components of the program shall include: 

(a) All enforcement actions are taken independently by EPA or state agencies and communicated to all other NELAP participating
agencies.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941202-2-00193 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941202-2-00098 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) NELAP enforcement is limited to suspension (short-to-long-term) from NELAP only. Any other civil/criminal
actions are taken by participating agencies. 


(c) An effective information-sharing database used by all participating agencies is essential to ensure informed
decision-making based on lab performance. 




4.7.1 Role of Enforcement vs QA/QC 




Most agencies have historically conducted laboratory QA/QC programs designed to help laboratories identify and
correct technical problems affecting their performance. This is basically a technical assistance function by government.
Enforcement, on the other hand, is an oversight process of taking informative (``warning/information gathering
letters'') or punitive actions to ensure the public's desired objectives (``reliable data'') are achieved. QA/QC
and enforcement are different functions and need to be kept separate. 




4.7.2 Defining Enforceable Violations 




The NELAP will need to specify what actions by laboratories will result in enforcement action. Furthermore, enforcement
actions should be developed in increasing severity to allow laboratory correction with minimal enforcement effort.
This could be done with tiers of enforcement actions, e.g. warning letter, suspension investigation order, suspension
order, and suspension hearing. 


Enforceable violations will also need to be established to provide the basis for the enforcement program. Categories
of enforceable violations could include: 

(a) Data falsification_intentional, by lab management, by employees, etc.; 


(b) False advertising_misinforming clients regarding their accreditation and capabilities; and 


(c) Continuing technical problems_lack of technical staff, failure to follow required SOP's, lack of equipment,
etc. 




4.7.3 Recommendation 




Given resource constraints, strong interest in encouraging state support, and the greater potential for implementation
in the mid-term (2 to 5 years), a variation of the decentralized option is recommended. This approach will still require
a federal-state laboratory integrated effort to ensure the objectives, structure, and issues are defined in the
necessary detail.

5.0 Quality Systems 


5.1 Introduction 


Quality Systems include all quality assurance (QA) policies 
and quality control (QC) procedures, which shall be delineated 
in a QA Plan to help ensure and document the quality of the 
analytical data. These shall include QA policies, which will 
establish essential QC procedures applicable to environmental 
laboratories regardless of size and complexity. The 
laboratory shall meet any additional or more stringent 
requirements as specified by the analytical methods, specific 
programs or Agencies. 
All items identified in this discussion shall be available for 
on-site inspection or data audit. 


5.2 Quality System 


5.2.1 Quality Assurance Plan 


All laboratories shall prepare and have available for review 
a written description of the laboratory's quality assurance 
activities, i.e., a QA plan. The QA plan must be an 
independent document that may incorporate by reference, 
already available standard operating procedures (SOPs) or 
other material, e.g., methods, guidance documents, etc., that 
are approved by the laboratory management. Analysts in the 
laboratory should either have copies of the document or easy 
access to the document. The items listed below constitute 
essential requirements of a Quality System. All laboratories 
should be encouraged to add any additional items thought to 
improve the analytical data. The following items shall be 
included:

 

_General QC procedures 
_Performance evaluation samples 
_Staff 
_Equipment 
_Test methods & standard operating procedures (SOPs) 
_Physical facilities 
_Sample acceptance policy & sample receipt 
_Sample tracking 
_Record keeping, data review and reporting 
_Corrective action policy and procedures 
_Definition of terms 
_Bibliography 


5.3 General Quality Control Procedures 


The following are the essential requirements and routines to 
calculate and assess analytical precision, accuracy, and 
method detection limits. All records and related quality 
control procedures shall be documented and maintained. 
The required essential quality control shall be as specified 
in the analytical methods or as listed below, whichever is 
more stringent.

It is suggested that these be analyzed at the same 
frequency as the matrix spikes, but are mandatory if the 
matrix spikes are not within quality control acceptance 
limits. 
(d) 

Surrogates

_Surrogate compounds must be added to all 
samples, standards, and blanks whenever possible for all 
organic chromatography methods. Limits must be used to 
determine acceptable surrogate recoveries on a daily 
basis. 
(e)

Demonstration of Analytical Capability

_QC Validation 
Studies shall be performed on a one-time basis (initially 
and with a significant change, e.g., new analyst, 
instrument or technique). 
(f) 

Methods Used to Assess Precision and Accuracy

_The 
laboratories shall calculate and track precision and 
accuracy of test measurements and the associated 
acceptance ranges using the data from the duplicate, MS, 
blank and surrogate measurements. The resulting 
acceptance ranges (and/or quality control charts) shall 
be used to assess data acceptance and shall be readily 
accessible in an identifiable file to all personnel 
involved with the data review/data acceptance process. 
(g) 

Method Detection Limits

_Method detection limits shall 
be determined by an approved protocol or by a method 
specified by the accrediting authority. The detection 
limit is to be determined for the compounds of interest 
in each method in laboratory pure water and the matrix of 
interest. The procedure used must be documented. 
(h) 

Qualitative Identifications

_Qualitative quality control 
refers to the identification of a specific compound. 
Identification of all analytes must be accomplished with 
a verified standard of the analyte.

reasons for doubt exists, a confirmatory analysis shall 
be performed. Such analysis shall be a technique with a 
different scientific principle and may include:

 

_Second column confirmation 
_Alternate wavelengths 
_Derivatization 
_Mass spectral interpretation 
_Alternate detectors 
_Additional cleanup procedures

specified by the method shall not be used. The 
labels on the container should be checked and the 
contents examined to verify that the purity of the 
reagents meets the needs of the particular method. 
ii. Water_Where the method does not specify the type 
of water (e.g., distilled, deionized, etc.), the 
water quality shall be free from all constituents 
that may potentially interfere with the sample 
preparation or analytical test. The quality of 
water sources shall be monitored and documented. 
(j) 

Glassware Cleaning

_In the analysis of samples 
containing components in the parts per billion range, the 
preparation of scrupulously clean glassware is mandatory. 
Particular care must be taken with glassware such as 
Soxhlet extractors, Kuderna-Danish evaporative 
concentrators, sampling-train components, or any other 
glassware coming in contact with an extract that will be 
evaporated to a lesser volume.

Instrument Blanks

_Instrument blanks are blanks at the background levels for any of the nuclide emission of interest. Instrument blanks
consist of a clean planchet, ampule or sealed canister that is placed in the instrument to duplicate sample counting
geometry. The purpose of the instrument blank is to verify instrument operation and ensure that no contamination
has occurred in the counting chamber. Instrument blanks are used for calculation of lower limits of detection. The
frequency of instrument analysis depends on the type of instrument. Essential frequencies for analysis of instrument
blanks on typical instruments are: 







(b) 

Method Blanks_

The required frequency for method blanks shall be at least once each batch or one out of every 20 samples, whichever
is greater. These specifications are applicable to all radiochemistry techniques except for gamma spectroscopy
where no chemical separation or other chemical manipulation is performed.

Laboratory Control Samples (LCS)_

At least one LCS shall be included with each batch or one out of every 20 analytical samples, whichever is greater. 


(d) 

Matrix Spikes_

Matrix spikes shall be included with each sample batch where chemical manipulations and separations are performed.
The frequency for measurement of matrix spikes shall be at least one per batch or one out of every 20 samples, whichever
is greater. 


The following criteria is recommended for spiking: 


i. Samples should be spiked at random within each batch. There should be adequate samples available for duplicate
analysis, if necessary. 


ii. Spikes should be prepared in a manner to minimize alteration of the original matrix (i.e., minimize dilution of
the sample during the spiking). 


iii. Spikes should be prepared at a level that is at least two times the concentration of the analyte of interest. 


(e) 

Laboratory Duplicates_

Sample analysis shall be duplicated on a randomly selected sample (not field blanks) within every batch or one per

5.7.3 Calibration
5.7.3.1 Documentation and Labeling


The laboratory shall retain records (e.g., manufacturer's statement of purity), of the origin, purity and traceability
of all standards and reagents (including balance weights and thermometers). These records shall include the date
of receipt, the date of opening and an expiration date.
Detailed records shall be maintained on reagent and standard preparation. These records shall indicate traceability
to purchase stocks or neat compounds, and must include the date of preparation and preparer's initials.
Where calibrations do not include the generation of a standard curve (e.g., thermometers, balances, titrations,
etc.), records shall indicate the calibration date and type (e.g. balance weight, thermometer serial number, primary
standard concentration, etc.) of calibration standard that was used.
All prepared reagents and standards shall be clearly identified with preparation date, concentration(s) and preparer's
initials.
All standard curves shall be dated and labeled with method, analyte and standard concentrations and instrument responses.
The axes of the calibration curve should be labeled. For electronic data processing systems, that automatically
compute the calibration curve, the equation for the curve and the correlation coefficient must be recorded. The equation
for the line and the correlation coefficient shall also be recorded when the calibration curve is prepared manually.
A criteria for an acceptable correlation coefficient shall be established.


5.7.3.2 Initial Calibrations


All initial calibrations shall be verified with standards of high quality obtained from a second or different source.
These verification standards shall be analyzed with each initial calibration or quarterly, whichever is more frequent.
Standard curves shall be prepared as specified in the method.
The lowest standard should approach the method detection limit.
If a method does not provide guidance in the preparation of a standard curve, the following guidelines shall be followed:
For all methods, use a blank and at least three (3) standards that lie within the linear portion of the curve. Additional
standards are required for non-linear calibration curves. In all cases, the sample results must be closely bracketed
by calibration standards.
A new curve shall be run if two successive runs of one continuing calibration check is outside acceptable limits.


5.7.3.3 Continuing Calibration Verification


When an initial calibration curve is not run on the day of analysis, the integrity of the initial calibration curve
shall be verified on each day of use (or 24 hour period) by initially analyzing a blank and a standard at a concentration
equal to or near the lowest calibration standard (the lowest calibration standard shall be in the range of 4 to 8 times
the calculated method detection limit).
Additional standards shall be analyzed after the initial calibration curve or the integrity of the initial calibration
curve (see previous paragraph) has been accepted.

(a) These standards shall be analyzed at a frequency of 5% or every 8 hours whichever is more frequent and may be standards
used in the original calibration curve or standards from another source. 

(b) The concentration of these standards shall be determined by the anticipated or known concentration of the samples.
To the extent possible, the samples in each interval (i.e. every 20 samples or every 8 hours) should be 
bracketed with standard concentrations closely representing the lower and upper range of reported sample concentrations.
If this is not possible, the standard calibration checks should vary in concentration throughout the range of the
data being acquired. 

When not specified by the analytical method, these calibration verification standards shall be within 15% of the
true value. 



5.8 Physical Facilities
 


5.8.1 Environment 



The laboratory facilities shall be maintained to permit the production of analytical data of needed quality. In addition
to adequate housekeeping that must be performed to assure that contamination is unlikely, the following elements
shall be controlled:

 


_Temperature; 
_Humidity;

5.9 Sample Acceptance Policy and Sample Receipt 



Regardless of the laboratory's level of control over sampling activities, the following are essential to ensure
sample integrity and valid data. 



5.9.1 Sample Acceptance Policy 



The laboratory shall have a written sample acceptance policy that clearly outlines the circumstances under which
samples will be accepted. Data from any samples which do not meet the following criteria must be flagged in an unambiguous
manner clearly defining the nature and substance of the variation. 
This document should be circulated to sample collecting personnel with other sampling instructions and shall include
the following areas of concern: 

(a) Submittal of field quality control samples as required by the accrediting agency. The samples may include trip
blanks, field blanks, equipment blanks, duplicates or other field-submitted quality control measures; 

(b) Proper, full, and complete documentation, which shall include sample identification, the location, date and
time of collection, collector's name, preservative added, sample type and any special remarks concerning the 
sample; 

(c) Proper sample labeling to include unique identification and a labeling system for the samples with requirements
concerning the durability of the labels (water resistant) and the use of indelible ink; 

(d) Evidence of proper preservation and use of appropriate sample containers. The type of sample containers and preservatives
are as specified by the individual programs, a Performance Based Method System or NELAP; 

(e) Adherence to specified holding times. The maximum allowable holding time prior to analyses are as specified by
individual Programs, a Performance Based Method System or NELAP; and 

(f) Adequate sample volume. Sufficient sample volume must be available to perform the necessary analysis. 



5.9.2 Sample Receipt Protocols 



Samples shall be checked upon receipt for thermal preservation (if applicable) and all other aforementioned items.
Chemical preservation (e.g., appropriate Ph) shall be checked upon receipt or prior to sample preparation/analyses.
The results of such checks shall be recorded. Data from any samples which do not meet the criteria must be flagged in
an unambiguous 
manner clearly defining the nature and substance of the variation. 

If applicable, a complete chain of custody record (Section 5.11.3) shall be maintained. 



5.9.3 Storage Conditions 



The samples shall be properly preserved and stored in approved containers specified by the individual EPA or state
programs, the Performance Based Method System or NELAP. Samples shall be stored in a secure area. 



5.10 Sample Tracking 



The laboratory shall design a system to unequivocally identify all samples, subsamples and subsequent extracts
and/or digestates so that each aliquot is uniquely identified. 

The laboratory shall assign a unique identification (ID) code to each sample container received in the laboratory.
Multiple aliquots of a sample that have been received for different analytical tests (e.g., nutrients, metals, VOCs,
etc.) must be assigned a different ID code. The use of container shape, size or other physical characteristic (e.g.,
amber glass, purple top, etc.) is not an acceptable means of identifying the sample. 

This laboratory code shall maintain an unequivocal link with the unique field ID assigned each container. 

The laboratory ID number shall be placed on the sample container as a durable label. 

The laboratory ID number shall be entered into the laboratory records (see 5.11.2) and shall be the link that associates
the sample with related laboratory activities (i.e., sample preparation, calibration, etc.). 

In cases where the sample collector and analyst are the same individual or the laboratory preassigns numbers to sample
containers, the laboratory ID number may be the same as the field ID number. 



5.11 Record Keeping, Data Review and Reporting 



The laboratory shall implement protocols that will produce unequivocal, accurate records which document all laboratory
activities associated with sample receipt, preparation, analysis, review and reporting. 

There are two levels of record keeping: (1) Sample custody or tracking and (2) legal or evidentiary chain of custody.
All essential requirements for sample custody are outlined in Sections 5.11.1.1, and 5.11.1.2. The basic requirements
for legal chain of custody (if required or implemented) are 
specified in Section 5.11.3. 



5.11.1 Sample Custody Requirements

 Notice of proposed priority.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Education proposes to establish an absolute priority for an award to provide technical assistance
to improve the transition from school to work and other postsecondary settings, including assistance to State and
local partnerships that are responsible for developing and implementing School-to-Work Opportunities systems.
This proposed priority is intended to provide technical assistance to support students with disabilities, including
those with severe disabilities, in a wide range of school to work experiences and promote their successful transition
to a variety of postsecondary settings. The Secretary also proposes selection criteria that will be applied in evaluating
applications submitted for this competition.

Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service
(FIRS) at 1-800-877-8339 between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.





<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Over the last decade, three pieces of Federal legislation have been enacted that impact on the transition of students
with disabilities from school to postsecondary settings, including gainful employment. These include amendments
to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the School-to-Work
Opportunities Act of 1994. Each piece of legislation is described below. 



The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, as amended, now requires that a statement of needed transition
services be included in the individualized education program (IEP) of all eligible students beginning no later than
age 16, and at a younger age if appropriate, and that the statement of required services be updated on an annual basis.
20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(20)(D). Transition services are defined as ``a coordinated set of activities for a student, designed
within an outcome-oriented process, which promotes movement from school to post-school activities * * *
and shall include instruction, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-school adult
living objectives, and, when appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocational evaluation.''


20 U.S.C. 1401(a)(19). 

The Rehabilitation Act now requires the State Vocational Rehabilitation programs to enter into formal interagency
cooperative agreements with education officials responsible for the provision of a free appropriate public education
to students with disabilities in order to facilitate the development and accomplishment of long term rehabilitation
goals, intermediate rehabilitation objectives, and goals and objectives to enable students with disabilities
to live independently before leaving the school setting. State vocational rehabilitation plans must address: (i)
Provisions for determining State lead agencies and qualified personnel responsible for transition services; (ii)
procedures for outreach to and identification of youth in need of such services; and (iii) a timeframe for evaluation
and follow-up of youth who have received such services. 29 U.S.C. 721(a)(24). 

In May of 1994, President Clinton signed into law the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994. This law, administered
jointly by the Departments of Education and Labor, establishes a national framework within which all States can create
statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. These systems will be designed to help youth acquire the knowledge,
skills, abilities, and labor market information they need to make a smooth and effective transition from school to
career-oriented work and to further education and training. 

Under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994, 20 U.S.C. 6101 et seq., States and local partnerships are developing


and implementing plans for school-to-work opportunities systems that will provide opportunities for all students,
including those with disabilities, to prepare successfully for high-skill, high-wage jobs or further education
and training. Any student who completes a School-to-Work Opportunities program of study will receive: (1) A high
school diploma, (2) a certificate or diploma recognizing one or two years of postsecondary education, if appropriate,
and (3) a portable, industry-recognized skill certificate. While each State and locality will have broad latitude
to design its own system, every system will have common core components: 

 

Work-based learning. 

Providing students with a planned program of job training and work experiences in a broad range of tasks in an occupational
area, as well as workplace mentoring. 

 

School-based learning. 

Including a coherent multi-year sequence of instruction_typically including at least 2 years of secondary education
and at least 1 or 2 years of postsecondary education_tied to occupational skills standards and challenging academic
standards such as those established by States under Goals 2000. 

 

Connecting activities. 

To ensure coordination of the work- and school-based learning components, such as providing technical assistance
in designing work-based learning, matching students with employers' work-based learning opportunities, and collecting
information on what happens to students after they complete the program. 
This award will be jointly funded in fiscal year 1995 under three statutory authorities: 
(1) The Secondary Education and Transitional Services for Youth with Disabilities Program authorized by section
626 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; 

(2) Sections 202(b)(4) and (6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and 

(3) The Cooperative Demonstration Program authorized by section 420A of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Education Act (the Perkins Act). In fiscal year 1996, the award will include funding from section 311(d)
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Secretary has determined that this joint award is necessary because of the need
to provide technical assistance to support students with disabilities in a wide range of school to work experiences
and promote their successful transition to a variety of postsecondary settings including gainful employment. 

The funds provided under the Cooperative Demonstration Program must meet the cost-sharing requirement of section
420A(b)(2) of the Perkins Act implemented by 34 CFR 426.30. In the first year of the project, we anticipate providing
$25,000 from the Cooperative Demonstration program. The funds provided under section 311(d) of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 must be used only for youth with severe disabilities.

In the application notice, we will inform potential applicants how much funding we estimate will come from each program
for fiscal year 1995. As noted above, we anticipate that the source and amount of funding will change in future years
and will notify the grantee. If other sources of funding are added that would result in additional requirements in
a future year, the Secretary will notify the grantee concerning those requirements. 



Proposed Priority: Accessing School-to-Work and Postsecondary Environments_A Technical Assistance Effort 



Purpose 



The purpose of this technical assistance project is to improve the skills and knowledge-base of (1) staff delivering
transitional services and (2) School-to-Work Opportunities grantees to assist individuals with disabilities,
including those with severe disabilities, to become integrated into appropriate transition programs and School-to-Work
Opportunities systems established at State and local levels. The proposed project must provide technical assistance
to all Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) transition and postsecondary education
projects as well as to States funded under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act to ensure that they provide personnel
with the necessary training to accommodate and support students with disabilities, including those with severe
disabilities, in the transition to a variety of postsecondary settings. The project must also disseminate information
to other interested parties. 

Project activities 

must 

include the development of effective practice information on: 

(1) Promoting compliance with transition requirements mandated by Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act; 


(2) Helping students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, access transition programs
including those supported by developing School-to-Work Opportunities systems; 

(3) Overcoming administrative, attitudinal, and programmatic barriers that limit the planning and implementation
of effective practices for students with disabilities in transitional programs, such as those that school personnel
can use to encourage and facilitate extensive student/parent involvement; 

(4) Working with statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems, in collaboration with activities initiated
by the State Systems for Transition Services projects, to help students with disabilities, including those with
severe disabilities, acquire the academic and occupational skills, abilities, and labor market information they
need to make a smooth and effective transition from school to career-oriented work or to further education or training;


(5) Building on and enriching current promising programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, school-to-apprenticeship,
youth apprenticeship, cooperative education, adult education, adult services, and business-education compacts;


(6) Facilitating the representation of disability interests in the formation of partnerships among secondary and
postsecondary educational institutions, private and public employers, labor organizations, government, community
groups, parents, and other key groups; and 

(7) Ensuring that students with disabilities, including those with severe disabilities, are provided an inte
