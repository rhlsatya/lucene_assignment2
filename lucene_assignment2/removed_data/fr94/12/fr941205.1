OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Agency Administrative Grievance System



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to abolish regulations at 5 CFR Part 771 on the agency administrative
grievance system (AGS). This change would implement a human resources management recommendation under Vice President
Al Gore's National Performance Review (NPR). This change also would be consistent with OPM's initiative under the
NPR to sunset the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), which included abolishing FPM Chapter 771 on the AGS as of December
31, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Performance Review was issued on September 7, 1993. Appendix C to the NPR is entitled Major Recommendations
Affecting Governmental Systems and includes a number of recommendations concerning reinvention of human resources
management. One recommendation, HRM08, stated that agencies should ``improve processes and procedures established
to provide workplace due process for employees'' and elaborated that ``[a]ll agencies should establish alternative
dispute resolution methods and options for informal disposition of employment disputes.'' Among other things,
the recommendation specifies that ``[t]he Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) should eliminate
by December 1994, all regulations governing internal agency grievance and appeal procedures, thus freeing agencies
to tailor ADR [or alternative dispute resolution] techniques to various situations.''.




The proposed abolishment of the AGS regulations does not preclude agencies from continuing their AGS procedures
established under Part 771 to resolve workplace disputes. It merely means that the mandatory requirement for such
procedures would cease to exist. Thus, agencies would be free to continue their AGS procedures, modify them, or eliminate
them depending on the needs of their organizations. As suggested by the NPR, agencies could take the opportunity to
use ADR techniques in helping resolve disputes in the workplace. Tried and proven techniques such as mediation and
facilitation, to name only two of many possibilities, may be used in this regard. In addition, elimination of the restrictions
contained in the current regulations affords agencies even more flexibility to design and operate appropriate workplace
dispute resolution procedures. OPM's Office of Labor Relations and Workforce Performance will be available upon
request to assist agencies in exercising their new flexibility in this important area of human resources management.
In this role, OPM endorses and is guided by the NPR which states that ``[w]orkplace problems which are not resolved
in a timely and sensitive way impair productivity and morale and impede mission accomplishment.''



Conforming Amendments



OPM also proposes to delete references to Part 771 as they appear elsewhere in title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
In those cases, the languages would be modified to refer generically to ``administrative'' grievances or grievance
systems to reflect the fact that agencies may have administrative grievance systems even though they would no longer
technically be established under Part 771, i.e., 5 CFR 300.104(c)(2), 550.803, 752.203(f), 831.204(e)(2), and
842.106(e)(2). Likewise, other current references to ``administrative'' grievances in title 5 (and not also referring
to Part 771) would remain unchanged, i.e., 5 CFR 511.607(a)(1) and 550.804(b)(1).

Rules of Practice and Procedure in

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is proposing an amendment to its Rules of Practice and Procedure in Adjudicatory
Proceedings. The proposal is intended to clarify that provisions relating to 

ex parte 

communications conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, the proposed
amendment would clarify that the 

ex parte 

provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision of the APA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



In August, 1991, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the National
Credit Union Administration (NCUA) adopted Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure for agency adjudicatory proceedings.
(OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; OCC, 56 FR 38024, Aug. 9, 1991; Board of Governors, 56 FR 38048, Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56
FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The OTS codified these uniform rules in its Rules of Practice
and Procedure in Adjudicatory Proceedings at 12 CFR Part 509, Subpart A. 

In this Notice, the OTS is proposing to amend one aspect of its rules relating to 

ex parte 

communications to clarify that the rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The
other banking agencies are issuing identical proposals. 

Currently,  509.9 prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from making an 

ex parte 

communication to the Director or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding.
When the uniform rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793,
June 17, 1991) explained that the proposed rule regarding 

ex parte 

communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding ex parte communications.'' There
was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA.

<DOCNO> FR941205-1-00006 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's 

ex parte 

communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 

outside the agency

'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 

Intra-agency 

communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended
decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel.
The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party
on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation
of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial staff from seeking the amendment
of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. 

The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, neglected to mention the separation of functions concept explicitly,
and appeared to apply the 

ex parte 

communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the
Director, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested
in the proceeding'' on the other. The OTS and the other banking agencies do not interpret this provision as limiting
agency enforcement staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions.
As drafted, however, the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the 

ex parte 

communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The OTS and the other banking agencies did not intend this result.


The proposed amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting
the prohibition on 

ex parte 

communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States. 



II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the OTS hereby certifies that this notice of proposed
rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a
regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. 

The proposed rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure
exclusively. Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised
regulation is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute. 



III. Executive Order 12866 



The OTS has determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
Executive Order 12866.

Capital Distributions

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposes to amend its capital distributions regulation to conform to the system
of prompt corrective action (PCA) established by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) and by implementing regulations adopted by the OTS and the other federal banking agencies. The proposed
regulation incorporates the PCA definition of capital distributions. Under the proposal, a savings association
that is not held by a savings and loan holding company and that has a composite CAMEL rating of ``1'' or ``2'' need not
notify the OTS before making a capital distribution. Other savings associations that will remain at least adequately
capitalized after making a capital distribution would be required to provide notice to the OTS. ``Troubled'' associations
and undercapitalized associations may make capital distributions only by filing an application and receiving OTS
approval. Such applications may be approved only under certain limited conditions. 



The proposed regulation defines ``troubled condition'' as a function of a savings association's composite examination
rating, its capital condition, or on the basis of supervisory directives issued, or ``troubled condition'' designation
made, by the OTS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



The OTS is proposing today to simplify its current capital distributions regulation in light of both its implementation
of PCA and the improved capital position of the thrift industry. The proposal reduces the regulatory burden and compliance
costs associated with capital distributions and, for the healthiest savings associations, removes those costs
and burden entirely to the extent permitted by statute. Adequately or well capitalized savings associations that
(1) are not held by savings and loan holding companies

1

; (2) have a composite rating of ``1'' or ``2;'' (3) are not deemed to be in ``troubled condition;'' and (4) will remain
at least adequately capitalized after the proposed capital distribution are not required to provide notice to the
OTS before making capital distributions. Notice is not required because these associations are in the two highest
rating categories and the rule requires that savings associations continue to be adequately capitalized after the
capital distribution. 





In 1990, the OTS adopted a capital distributions regulation, 12 CFR 563.134, 55 FR 17185 (July 2, 1990), designed to
apply a uniform regulatory approach to all capital distributions made by savings associations, including dividends,
stock repurchases, and cash-out mergers. The OTS adopted this rule during a period when the thrift industry was considered
generally undercapitalized. The rule established a ``tiered'' approach under which an association's ability to
make capital distributions varied according to its level of capitalization. Associations that met their fully phased-in
capital requirements had greater flexibility to make capital distributions than associations that did not. All
associations were required either to provide notice to the OTS or to apply for approval before making any capital distribution.
At that time, thrifts were under pressure to increase capital in order to meet rapidly rising standards and the regulation
was intended to restrict capital distributions by associations that were not expected to meet the FIRREA capital
requirements. 

In September 1992, the OTS promulgated its Prompt Corrective Action Final Rule (PCA Rule). 57 FR 44866 (September
29, 1992). The PCA Rule implemented section 131 of FDICIA,

2

 which created a new statutory framework that applies to all insured depository institutions a system of supervisory
actions indexed to capital levels. Well-capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions are generally not
subject to PCA restrictions;

3

 institutions falling into the undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized
categories are subject to increasing levels of supervisory restrictions. Under the PCA Rule, the ratio of total capital
to risk-weighted assets, the ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets, and the ratio of core capital to total
average assets (the leverage ratio)

4

 are used to determine a thrift's PCA category. 






In the preamble to the PCA Rule, the OTS indicated ``that the permissibility of capital distributions will be determined
by the prompt corrective action regulations.''

5

 Moreover, specific regulatory incentives are now in place to encourage associations to maintain high capital levels,
which was the original goal of the capital distributions regulation. Additionally, the capital tier thresholds
in the current regulation have become partially obsolete as associations have met targets for the fully phased-in
capital requirements under part 567.

II. Description of Proposal 



This proposal simplifies the current capital distribution regulation by replacing the ``tiered'' approach to allowing
savings associations to make capital distributions with one that allows associations to make only capital distributions
that would not cause capital to drop below the level required to remain adequately capitalized. The OTS believes that
the proposed rule, which is revised to conform with the PCA, is, on balance, as stringent as the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (OCC) treatment of capital distributions. Each agency provides guidance and standards relating
to limitations on the amount of capital distributions permissible although the OCC has another statutorily imposed
standard in addition to the PCA standard and the OTS does not.

6

 In addition, each agency requires prior notification if capital distributions exceed these standards. 





Conformity with PCA 



The proposed regulation incorporates the standards established in the PCA Rule into 12 CFR 563.134 by defining ``capital
distributions'' to reflect the language of section 38(b)(2)(B). 

Pursuant to the regulatory standards set forth in the PCA Rule, a savings association is ``adequately capitalized''
if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent or greater; a core risk-based capital ratio of 4.0 percent
or greater; and a leverage ratio of 4.0 percent or greater (or of 3.0 percent or greater, if it was rated composite 1 after
its most recent examination).

Associations may not make capital distributions that would cause capital to drop below the level required to remain
adequately capitalized. The OTS believes that distinguishing among savings associations on this basis, rather
than the current multi-tiered structure, is more appropriate for an industry that is generally not capital deficient.

Under the proposal, a savings association may make a capital distribution using one of three procedures: (1) without
notice or application, if the association is not held by a savings and loan holding company and received a composite
rating of ``1'' or ``2;'' (2) by providing notice to the OTS if, after the capital distribution, the association would
remain at least adequately capitalized; or (3) by submitting an application to the OTS. 

The OTS notes that the first procedure_distribution without notice or application in certain circumstances_could
permit a savings association to reduce its capital significantly and quickly so long as it remained at, or just above,
the adequately capitalized threshold. OTS has proposed this procedure because it wishes to allow maximum flexibility
to the best institutions consistent with its overall goal of reducing regulatory burden where possible and where
consistent with safety and soundness. The OTS, however, specifically solicits comment on whether the broad flexibility
that this procedure allows to the institutions that qualify to use it poses safety and soundness concerns. Commenters
addressing this issue are also invited to suggest alternative procedures and/or additional conditions that would
strike the appropriate balance between reducing regulatory burden and ensuring prompt and effective regulatory
oversight. For instance, should notice be required if the dividend will cause the capital level to fall below ``well
capitalized'' or, as the discussion below describes, if it exceeds an established threshold amount? 

The second procedure_distribution upon notice to OTS_would be available to institutions that do not qualify for
the first, that is, to institutions with a composite CAMEL rating of lower than 2 or to those in a holding company structure.


The third procedure_distribution upon application to and approval by the OTS_is available in two circumstances:
first, if under PCA criteria the applicant institution is undercapitalized or would be undercapitalized after the
capital distribution; second, if the applicant institution is not undercapitalized under the PCA standards but
is nonetheless in ``troubled condition.''

The Prompt Corrective Action statute and the OTS's implementing PCA Rule prohibit savings associations from declaring
any dividend or making any other capital distribution if, following the distribution, the institution would fall
within any of the three undercapitalized categories. A limited exception to this prohibition permits the OTS to approve
the repurchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of shares or ownership interests by an undercapitalized
institution in connection with the issuance of additional shares in at least an equivalent amount if that distribution
will reduce the institution's financial obligations or otherwise improve the institution's financial condition.
The OTS proposes to incorporate this limited exception into its capital distribution rule and to add the requirement
that the distribution be consistent with an institution's capital restoration plan. Thus, with respect to a savings
association that is, or post-distribution would be, undercapitalized, the OTS will approve an application to make
a capital distribution only if the distribution meets the criteria for the limited statutory and regulatory exception
described above and is consistent with the association's capital restoration plan. When considered in the context
of the capital restoration plan, the proposed distribution must be consistent with safe and sound operation and must
not hinder the association from achieving any increased levels of capital required to meet the OTS's capital standards
as certain statutory ``phase-in'' schedules take effect.
 The OTS notes that, since enactment of the PCA statute, it has authorized use of the limited exception principally
to provide incentives to private investors in recapitalization transactions where, at the conclusion of the entire
transaction, the institution was adequately capitalized or better.






The OTS will use the same application procedure and will apply the same approval standards with respect to savings
associations in ``troubled condition.'' ``Troubled condition'' would be defined in the rule to mean the condition
of any savings association that: (1) has a composite rating of 4 or 5 under the OTS's examination rating system; (2)
is subject to a capital directive, a cease and desist order, a consent order, a formal written agreement, or a PCA directive
relating to the safety and soundness or financial viability of the association, unless otherwise informed in writing
by the OTS; or (3) is informed in writing by the OTS that it has been designated in ``troubled condition'' based on its
current financial statements, report of examination, or limited scope review.

The OTS intends to continue to use net income to date during the calendar year plus 50 percent of surplus capital above
the adequately capitalized level as the general rule of thumb for determining the permissible amount of a capital
distribution. Under the proposal, however, this limit would no longer be prescribed by regulation. The effect of
its removal from regulatory language would be that institutions not in a holding company structure with composite
ratings of 1 or 2 could make capital distributions that exceeded the limit without any notice to the OTS. The OTS invites
comment on whether it would be preferable to retain a notice requirement for all capital distributions above the amount
described by the general rule of thumb regardless of an institution's CAMEL rating. Commenters are also invited to
address and suggest alternatives to the computation that OTS uses to determine the permissible amount of a capital
distribution.
Finally, the proposal would explicitly reserve the OTS's authority to prohibit any capital distribution that it
determines would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.


Comment Solicitation


In addition to the specific requests for comment that appear above, the OTS solicits comment on all aspects of the proposal.


Executive Order 12866


The Director of the OTS has determined that this regulation does not constitute a significant regulatory action for
purposes of Executive Order 12866.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Office certifies that this regulation will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation merely conforms the
capital distribution regulation to standards already in place for all institutions as a result of PCA.


Paperwork Reduction Act


The reporting requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collections
of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1550), Washington,
DC 20503 with copies to the Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552.

troubled condition 

based on the current financial statements, report of examination, or limited scope review of the savings association.


(b) 

Capital Distribution Restrictions. 

(1) An undercapitalized association is not authorized to make any capital distributions except in accordance with
the provisions of this paragraph. 

(2) Subject to the concurrence of the Corporation, applications to repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire
shares or ownership interests may be approved in the case of: 

(i) An association operating in compliance with an approved capital restoration plan under  565.5 of this subchapter;
or

(i) An association that is deemed to be in ``troubled condition;'' 
(ii) A well or adequately capitalized association that wishes to make a capital distribution that would result in
the association being undercapitalized; or 
(iii) An undercapitalized association. 
(3) 

Multi-purpose notices or applications.

 A separate notice or application for making a capital distribution is not necessary if a notice or application providing
sufficient information is required under other OTS regulations. In such a case, the standards of this section shall
govern whether the capital distribution is approved or disapproved or whether, under a notice, the OTS will object
to the capital distribution. The association has the burden of stating clearly that the notice or application submitted
for other purposes is also serving as its notice or application for purposes of this section. Associations may seek
approval or provide notice of prospective capital distributions by submitting schedules of such prospective capital
distributions in accordance with supervisory guidance on such procedures. 

(d) 

Prohibition of otherwise permitted capital distributions.

 The OTS may prohibit any capital distribution otherwise permitted under this section upon a determination that the
making of a capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The circumstances posing such risk
include, but are not limited to, a capital distribution by an adequately capitalized association whose capital is
or may be impaired as a result of substantial losses. 
(e) 

Corporate reorganizations.

 The limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall be applicable to any direct or indirect distributions of
capital to affiliates, including those in connection with corporate reorganizations. 
(f) 

Less stringent prior provisions or conditions.

 The requirements of this section shall supersede the provisions of agreements or conditions to approved applications
controlling an association's prospective capital distributions that were less stringent than the restrictions
imposed under this rule. 
(g) 

More stringent prior provisions or conditions.

 An association may substitute the requirements of this rule for more stringent requirements imposed upon it by a previous
written agreement or application condition after obtaining the written approval of the OTS.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to amend the Lamar, Colorado, Class E airspace. This action would provide controlled airspace
for a new instrument approach procedure at the Lamar Municipal Airport, Colorado. Controlled airspace extending
upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing the approach.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Comments Invited





Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Please refer to Docket 94-ANM-48 when responding. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt
of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following
statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-ANM-48.'' The postcard will be date/time stamped
and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the specified closing date for comments will
be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light
of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination at the address listed above both before
and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel
concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.







Availability of NPRM's





Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, System Management Branch, ANM-530, 1601 Lind Avenue S.W., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.
Communications must identify Docket 94-ANM-48. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list
for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application
procedure.






The Proposal






The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace
at Lamar, Colorado, to provide controlled airspace for a new instrument approach procedure at the Lamar Municipal
Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The
area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.


The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace
areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order
7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The
Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.



The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore,_(1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Proposed Revision of Class E Airspace; Hondo, TX


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM); reopening of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document revises an earlier proposed airspace rule that would have amended the airspace at Hondo, TX. That proposal
was preempted by the development of a new very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) standard instrument approach
procedure (SIAP) to Runway (RWY) 17. The legal description of the proposed airspace in the notice of proposed rulemaking
was incomplete. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing
the recently established VOR RWY 17 SIAP at Hondo, TX.

The Proposal



On December 17, 1993, the FAA proposed to revise the Class E airspace at Hondo, TX (58 FR 65948). That action proposed
to revise the 700 feet AGL Class E airspace to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the recently
established VOR SIAP to RWY 17. The comment period for that action ended February 19, 1994. Since the issuance of that
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the FAA has discovered that the legal description contained in that proposal
did not include the airspace required from the airport to 16 miles south of RBN. Therefore, this SNPRM proposes a correction
to that legal description. Since this change expands the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to reopen the comment period to provide an additional opportunity for public comment. 

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending
upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994,
and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

FDA published a notice of the filing of this petition in the 

Federal Register

 of September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43096). FDA gave interested persons an opportunity to submit comments to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). FDA did not receive any comments in response to that notice. 
In the filing notice the agency gave notice that the petition had requested that 




-amylase enzyme derived from B. stearothermophilus be affirmed as GRAS for use in production of sweeteners from starch.
However, the petition requested, and the agency evaluated, the use of this enzyme preparation in the production of
nutritive saccharides (which includes maltodextrins as well as nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners). The end products
of the 




-amylase hydrolysis of starch are maltodextrins, which are not sweet and are not used as sweeteners in food, as well
as nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners. Maltodextrins may be used as a food ingredient or used as a raw material in the
manufacture of nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, for example, glucose syrups. Therefore, FDA finds that the phrase
``production of maltodextrins and nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners from starch'' is a more accurate description
of the petitioned food use of 




-amylase enzyme preparation. FDA is publishing this document as a tentative final rule to afford interested persons
the opportunity to comment on this change. To avoid confusion between 




-amylase, the enzyme, and 




-amylase, the enzyme preparation (in which 




-amylase is the principal active component, but which also contains other components derived from the production
organism or the fermentation media), this document will use the term ``




-amylase'' to refer to the former and ``




-amylase enzyme preparation'' to refer to the latter.


II. Standards for GRAS Affirmation


Pursuant to  170.30 (21 CFR 170.30), general recognition of safety may be based only on the views of experts qualified
by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances. The basis of such views may be either:
(1) Scientific procedures, or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, experience based
on common use in food. General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures requires the same quantity
and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation and ordinarily
is to be based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information
( 170.30(b)). General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January
1, 1958, may be determined without the quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a food
additive regulation but ordinarily is to be based upon generally available data and information concerning its pre-1958
use ( 170.30(c)).


III. Safety Evaluation


A. Introduction
Starch produced in plants exists in two main forms. The linear form is composed of 




-D-glucose sugar residues bonded together with a type of linkage termed 




-1,4 (Ref. 1). This linear form is commonly termed amylose. The other form of starch, termed amylopectin, is composed
of amylose molecules linked together at branch points. In this form, resembling a tree-like structure, the branch
points are formed by a different kind of linkage termed 




-1,6. An 




-amylase enzyme (1,4-




-D glucan glucanohydrolase (International Union of Biochemistry Enzyme Commission (E.C.) 3.2.1.1)) can hydrolyze,
i.e., break, the 




-1,4 linkages found in amylose and amylopectin (Ref. 2). Treatment with 




-amylase enzyme lowers the molecular weight of the starch molecules to form molecules collectively called maltodextrins.


Certain maltodextrins may be subjected to subsequent processing. For instance, corn maltodextrins may be further
hydrolyzed by another enzyme, glucoamylase, to produce glucose (also known as dextrose) which may in turn be isomerized
to form high fructose corn syrups. These corn sweeteners are refined with ion exchange resins to remove impurities
and are then concentrated. The processed corn sweeteners are then used in a wide variety of products in the food industry.
Current technology sometimes requires the 




-amylase enzyme to function at high temperatures, up to 110
  C (Refs. 1 and 3). Therefore, much effort has gone into research on 




-amylases from thermophilic microorganisms such as 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 (Ref. 3).
In evaluating this petition to affirm as GRAS the use of 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 as a food ingredient, the agency considered six aspects of its manufacture and use: (1) The identity of the 




-amylase enzyme component; (2) the identity and safety of the source (production) organism for the 




-amylase enzyme preparation; (3) the manufacturing process of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation; (4) the intended uses for the 




-amylase enzyme preparation in food and exposure to residual levels of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation; (5) the specifications for the formulation of the enzyme preparation; and (6) toxicological
studies of the enzyme preparation.


B. The Enzyme Component


The 




-amylase enzyme from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is extracellular (Ref. 2). That is, the enzyme is secreted by the bacteria into the surrounding media. Data and published
information in the petition confirm that the petitioner's enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 functions in the hydrolysis of starch as an 




-amylase (1,4-




-D glucan glucanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.1)) (Refs. 4 through 7).
Published data show that the 




-amylase enzyme functions at an optimum temperature of 80
  C and at pH values below 6 (Ref. 7), which is consistent with previous published reports characterizing 




-amylase from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 and other thermophilic Bacillus species (Refs. 2 and 3). The published data further show that the petitioner's enzyme
has a molecular weight of 58 kilodaltons (kd) (Ref. 7) which is consistent with the 58 kd mass reported by Sen (Ref. 8)
and within experimental error of the predicted 61 kd mass based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence analysis
(Ref. 9). 
The 




-amylases are functionally divided into two categories, saccharifying 




-amylases, which break approximately 40 to 60 percent of the 




-1,4 linkages in a starch, and liquefying 




-amylases, which break only 30 to 40 percent of the linkages in the starch (Ref. 3). The 




-amylase from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is of the liquefying type and is very similar in protein sequence to liquefying 




-amylases from other Bacillus species that have been commonly used in food processing (Refs. 1, 3, and 9 through 12),
for example, 

Bacillus

 

amyloliquefaciens

 (Ref. 1) and 

Bacillus

 

licheniformis

 (see 21 CFR 184.1027). 


C. The Production Organism


The source organism for this enzyme preparation is the bacterium 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

. The petition includes data to show that the strain used by the petitioner, 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 (AS-154), conforms to the description of 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 in ``Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology,'' 8th ed. (Ref. 13), which is a standard compendium for the taxonomy
of bacteria. The petition also contains data to show that this strain of 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is an asporogenic variant and does not produce antibiotics or toxins.
Published scientific literature as well as standard textbooks on food microbiology demonstrate that 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 and its spores are widely distributed in nature and they are commonly found in fresh foods (Refs. 13 and 14). 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is also reported to be the typical organism causing nontoxic sour spoilage in low acid foods (Ref. 14). 
The petition contains one published pathogenicity study that demonstrated that 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is not pathogenic (Ref. 15). The petition also contains an extensive search of the published literature from 1917
to 1992 involving over 1,700 references and citations relating to 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 concerning pathogenicity, pathogen formation, toxicology and toxins, and disease or infection. The search failed
to disclose a single report that implicated 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 as the etiologic agent of a disease state in man or animals. There were no reports of any toxicity or pathogenicity associated
with the presence of this organism in food.


D. The Manufacturing Process


The 




-amylase enzymes of Bacillus are extracellular enzymes (Ref. 10). Therefore, the manufacturing procedures follow
those generally used in the enzyme industry to separate and concentrate extracellular enzymes (Ref. 16). Under the
method of manufacture of 




-amylase enzyme preparation described in the petition, 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is maintained as a pure culture under conditions that minimize any genetic changes and is grown in a pure culture fermentation.
When fermentation is complete, the broth is clarified by treating it with calcium hydroxide, and cells are removed
from the broth by filtration using a diatomaceous earth filter aid (Ref. 17). The filtered, clarified broth containing
the soluble enzyme is then ultrafiltered to remove all particulate matter. The filtrate, containing the 




-amylase enzyme, is then evaporated to a concentrate of the desired enzyme potency, usually about a three-fold concentration.
Sodium chloride is added to the concentrate so that the final salt concentration is 20 percent by weight of the enzyme
preparation. Data submitted in the petition show that the enzyme preparation produced by this method of manufacture
does not contain any viable bacterial cells. 
FDA finds that the manufacturing method does not require the use of any processing materials that are not GRAS or approved
food additives. Therefore, the agency concludes that the manufacturing steps will not introduce impurities into
the enzyme preparation that will adversely affect the safety of the preparation.


E. Estimated Exposure Levels


The amount of the enzyme preparation used will vary based on the catalytic activity of the enzyme in any particular
batch of enzyme preparation. Estimates of enzyme use level and intake are usually based on the total organic solids
(TOS) content of the enzyme preparation (Ref. 18). TOS is the sum of all organic compounds present in the final enzyme
preparation, excluding diluents or carriers, if added. TOS is calculated as follows: TOS percent=100-(A+W+D) where
A is the percent of ash, W is the percent of water, and D is the percent of diluents or carriers. 
FDA's estimate of exposure to 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is based on the food use of maltodextrins and nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, data for general usage of 




-amylase preparations, and the relative enzymatic potency of this particular enzyme preparation compared to typical
preparations. FDA calculates that the intake of typical 




-amylase enzyme preparations reported as TOS is 25 milligrams (mg) TOS per person per day (TOS/person/day). The subject
preparation has an enzymatic potency about six-fold higher than typical preparations; therefore, the estimated
daily intake (EDI) is one-sixth of 25 mg or about 4 mg/TOS/person/day, or 67 micrograms ( u g)/kilograms (kg) body
weight/day for a 60 kg person.


F. Enzyme Preparation Specifications


The petition contains data showing that the 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 produced in this manner meets the general and additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the ``Food Chemicals
Codex,'' 3d ed. (Ref. 19).


G. Safety of Enzyme Preparation 


The petition contains published animal feeding studies to support the safety of the enzyme preparation. These include
a 90-day subchronic oral toxicity study in dogs and a 90-day subchronic oral toxicity study in F1 rats exposed in utero.
No adverse treatment-related effects were identified in the 90-day studies (Ref. 20).
The petition also contained several unpublished, corroborative safety studies. These animal feeding studies of
the 




-amylase enzyme preparation included an acute oral toxicity study in rats and 14-day palatability studies in both
rats and dogs. None of these studies demonstrated any adverse 
treatment-related effects. 
Based upon the 90-day dog study, FDA estimated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 377  u g/kg body weight, which
is 1/1000 of the highest no-effect level (377 mg/kg body weight, which was the highest dose tested). These studies
show that the ADI for the enzyme preparation (377  u g/kg body weight/day) exceeds the EDI for uses of this enzyme
preparation (67  u g/kg body weight/day).


IV. Conclusions 


The petition requested affirmation of GRAS status of 




-amylase preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 based on its similarity to other 




-amylase enzyme preparations that have a history of common use in food prior to 1958. The petition cites data that report
that 




-amylase enzyme preparation from B. subtilis has been used commercially since 1929, when it was used in the manufacture
of chocolate syrup to reduce its viscosity (Ref. 21). The petition stated that bacterial 




-amylase enzyme preparations were first described in the preparation of corn sweeteners in 1962, but that common
use of these enzymes by major food processors did not occur until some time later. The petition also stated that today,
corn sweeteners prepared with bacterial amylase enzyme preparations are used in nearly all commercially prepared
foods.
The agency evaluated the petition using the criteria of  170.30(c) and concluded that although 




-amylase enzyme preparations have had a long history of use before 1958, the data provided no evidence for history
of use of 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

, and that based on the data in the petition, this preparation is not eligible for GRAS affirmation based on history
of common use in food. However, the agency has also evaluated the petition using the criteria of  170.30(b) and
concludes that 





-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is eligible for GRAS affirmation based on scientific procedures.
The agency has evaluated the information in the petition along with other available information and concludes, based
on evaluation of published information, corroborated by unpublished data and information, that use of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation derived by fermentation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 to hydrolyze starch to produce maltodextrins and nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners is GRAS. Furthermore, the data
show no basis for a potential risk from any use of this 




-amylase preparation that can be anticipated. Therefore, the agency is tentatively affirming that the use of the
enzyme is GRAS with no limits other than current good manufacturing conditions in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1(b)(1).

The agency further finds that because the principal active ingredient of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation is safe and because expected impurities in the 




-amylase enzyme preparation do not provide any basis for a safety concern that the general and additional requirements
given for enzyme preparations in the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed. (1981), pp. 107-110, are adequate for defining
minimum criteria for a food-grade 




-amylase enzyme preparation derived from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

.


V. Environmental Effects


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(7) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


VI. Analysis of Impacts


FDA has examined the impacts of the tentative final rule under Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this tentative final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the tentative final rule is not a significant regulatory action as
defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because no current activity is prohibited by this tentative final rule, the compliance
cost to firms is zero. Because no increase in the health risks faced by consumers will result from this tentative final
rule, total costs are also zero. Potential benefits include the wider use of this enzyme because of reduced uncertainty
concerning its GRAS status, and any resources saved by eliminating the need to prepare further petitions to affirm
the GRAS status of this enzyme for this use. The agency certifies, therefore, that the tentative final rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, no further analysis is required.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed amendments to the regulations to eliminate the special rule that requires an employer
to deduct and withhold income tax as a prerequisite for claiming a deduction for property transferred to an employee
in connection with the performance of services. Under the existing regulation, employers have been denied a deduction
for failure to withhold even where the employee has reported the income and paid the tax. The proposed amendments will
provide guidance on substantiating deductions for property transferred in connection with the performance of services.
The proposed amendments will affect employers and other service recipients who transfer property for services.

The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking has been submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on
the collection of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department
of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with copies to the Internal
Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224.
The collection of information is in   1.6041-1 and 1.6041-2 of the Regulations. This information
is required by the IRS to ensure the proper matching of income recognized by service providers with deductions claimed
by service recipients. The likely respondents are individuals, farms, business or other for-profit institutions,
nonprofit institutions, and small businesses or organizations.
The burden for the reporting requirement contained in   1.6041-1 and 1.6041-2 is reflected

Overview


This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under section 83(h) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code). The proposed regulations eliminate the requirement to deduct and withhold
income tax as a prerequisite for claiming a deduction.
Under section 83(h) of the Code, in the case of a transfer of property to which section 83(a) applies, the person for
whom services were provided may deduct an amount equal to the amount included in the service provider's gross income.
In light of the difficulty that a service recipient may have in demonstrating that an amount has actually been included
in the service provider's gross income, the general rule in existing  1.83-6(a)(1) permits the deduction
for the amount ``includible'' in the service provider's gross income. Thus, the deduction may be allowed to the service
recipient even if the service provider does not properly report the includible amount. Where the service provider
is an employee of the service recipient, however, the special rule in  1.83-6(a)(2) provides that a deduction
may be claimed only if the service recipient (employer) deducts and withholds income tax in accordance with section
3402. The special rule was designed to ensure that the service recipient's deduction is in fact offset by a corresponding
inclusion in the service provider's gross income. The special rule is limited to employer-employee situations because
in other situations there is no underlying withholding requirement upon which the deduction could be conditioned.
Taxpayers have expressed concern that it is often difficult to satisfy the prerequisite that employers must deduct
and withhold income tax from payments in kind as a condition for claiming a deduction. The proposed amendments to the
section 83 regulations would address this concern by eliminating this prerequisite, while still ensuring consistent
treatment between service recipients and service providers as required by the statute. In addition, because the
deduction no longer would be conditioned on withholding, there no longer would be a need to have different rules for
those who receive services from employees and those who receive services from others.
Under the proposed amendments, the existing general rule and special rule would be replaced by a revised general rule
that more closely follows the statutory language of section 83(h). The service recipient would be allowed a deduction
for the amount ``included'' in the service provider's gross income. For this purpose, the amount included means the
amount reported on an original or amended return or included in gross income as a result of an IRS audit of the service
provider.
Because of the potential difficulty of demonstrating actual inclusion by the service provider, a special rule would
provide that, if the service recipient timely complies with applicable Form W-2 or 1099 reporting requirements
under section 6041 (or 6041A), as appropriate, with respect to the amount includible in income by the service provider,
the service provider will be deemed to have included the amount in gross income for this purpose. Thus, the proposed
amendments would allow the deduction without requiring the service recipient to demonstrate actual inclusion by
the service provider. If a transfer met the requirements for exemption from reporting for payments aggregating less
than $600 in any taxable year, or was eligible for any other reporting exemption, no reporting would be required in
order for the service recipient to rely on the deemed inclusion rule.
In order to allow service recipients to take advantage of the deemed inclusion rule with respect to property transfers
to all service providers, the proposed amendments would permit service recipients to use the special rule also in
the case of transfers to corporate service providers. To that end, service recipients would be permitted, solely
for purposes of this rule, to treat the Form 1099 reporting requirements as applicable to transfers to corporate service
providers in the same manner as those requirements would apply to transfers to noncorporate service providers. Thus,
if a service recipient who transferred property to a corporate service provider timely reported that income on Form
1099 (to both the service provider and the federal government), the service recipient would be entitled to rely on
the deemed inclusion rule in claiming a deduction for the amount of that income. If the transfer met the requirements
for exemption from reporting for payments aggregating less than $600 in any taxable year, or was eligible for any other
reporting exemption applicable to a service provider that is not a corporation, no reporting would be required in
order for the service recipient to rely on the deemed inclusion rule.

The deemed inclusion rule could be used only by a service recipient whose compliance with applicable Form W-2
or 1099 reporting requirements was timely. Thus, for example, under the current reporting requirements, if amounts
attributable to one or more section 83 transfers of property are includible in an employee's income in year 1 (and are
not eligible for any reporting exemption), the employer generally would be required to furnish the employee a Form
W-2 reflecting that amount by January 31 of year 2 and generally would be required to file a copy of the Form W-2
with the federal government by the last day of February of year 2. If the employer did report to the employee and the government
in a timely manner, the employer would be able to rely on the deemed inclusion rule to claim a deduction for the amount
in year 1. If the employee's Form W-2 were not furnished until after January 31 of year 2 or the government's copy
of Form W-2 were not filed until after the last day of February of year 2, the employer generally would be required
to demonstrate that the employee actually included the amount in income in order to support its deduction of such amount.


Under the proposed amendments, a special rule would apply with respect to an amount includible in an employee's or
former employee's income by reason of a disqualifying disposition of stock that had been acquired pursuant to a statutory
stock option. In the case of such a disposition, a Form W-2 or W-2c (as appropriate) would have to be furnished
to the employee or former employee, and filed with the federal government, only by the date on which the employer files
its tax return (including an amended return) claiming a deduction for that amount. 

With respect to disqualifying dispositions, the proposed amendments would modify the conditions for an employer's
deduction under section 83(h) in a manner that is not inconsistent with the guidance provided by Notice 87-49
(Changes to Incentive Stock Option Requirements by Section 321 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), 1987-2 C.B. 355.
The proposed amendments are not intended to have any effect on the application of Notice 87-49 or the analysis
contained therein, and therefore should not be viewed as constituting a reconsideration of Revenue Ruling 71-52,
1971-1 C.B. 278, within the meaning of Notice 87-49. 

Although the withholding requirement would be eliminated as a prerequisite for claiming a deduction, the proposed
amendments would not relieve the service recipient from any applicable withholding requirements of subtitle C or
from the statutorily prescribed penalties or additions to tax for noncompliance with those requirements. Thus,
for example, if an employer transferred to an employee property to which section 83 applies and failed to withhold
income tax on the payment, the employer would be liable for the tax under section 3403. However, under section 3402(d),
any tax liability assessed against the employer would be offset by any tax paid by the employee. In addition, nothing
in this proposed regulation would relieve the service recipient from penalties or additions to tax for noncompliance
with the requirements of section 6041 or 6041A (relating to information reporting) to the extent they otherwise apply.


The proposed regulation that was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1983 (48 FR 52079), proposing to amend the special rule in  1.83-6(a)(2), is hereby withdrawn.


These amendments are proposed to be effective for deductions allowable for taxable years beginning on or after January
1, 1995. However, taxpayers may apply these proposed amendments when claiming a deduction for any year not closed
by the statute of limitations. For example, if substantially vested (within the meaning of  1.83-3(b))
stock was transferred to an employee in 1992 upon the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, and if the calendar year
employer furnished a Form W-2 to the employee by January 31, 1993, reflecting the income generated by such transfer,
and filed the appropriate Form W-2 with the federal government by February 28, 1993, then the employer could
apply these proposed amendments to claim a deduction for 1992 for the amount of the income, even if the employer failed
to withhold in accordance with section 3402 and could not demonstrate actual inclusion in income by the employee.
If that employer did not claim a deduction for the amount of the income on its 1992 tax return, it could file an amended
return for 1992 claiming such a deduction pursuant to the proposed amendments, provided that 1992 is still an open
year.

Reliance on These Proposed Regulations 



Taxpayers may rely on these proposed amendments for guidance pending their issuance as final regulations. If future
amendments are more restrictive than these proposed amendments, the future amendments will be applied without retroactive
effect. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section
553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
6) do not apply to these regulations and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant
to section 7805(f) of the Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business. 



Comments and Requests for Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely submits written
comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in
the 

Federal Register

.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these proposed regulations is Charles T. Deliee, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee
Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, personnel from other offices of the IRS and Treasury Department
participated in their development.

Allowance of deduction_

(1) 

General Rule.

 In the case of a transfer of property in connection with the performance of services, or a compensatory cancellation
of a nonlapse restriction described in section 83(d) and  1.83-5, a deduction is allowable under section
162 or 212 to the person for whom the services were performed. The amount of the deduction is equal to the amount included
as compensation in the gross income of the service provider under section 83(a), (b), or (d)(2), but only to the extent
the amount meets the requirements of section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder. The deduction is allowed only
for the taxable year of that person in which or with which ends the taxable year of the service provider in which the amount
is included as compensation. For purposes of this paragraph, any amount excluded from gross income under section
79 or section 101(b) or subchapter N is considered to have been included in gross income. 

(2) 

Special Rule.

 For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the service provider is deemed to have included the amount as compensation
in gross income if the person for whom the services were performed satisfies in a timely manner all requirements of
section 6041 or section 6041A, and the regulations thereunder, with respect to that amount of compensation. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, whether a person for whom services were performed satisfies all requirements of section
6041 or section 6041A, and the regulations thereunder, is determined without regard to  1.6041-3(c)
(exception for payments to corporations). In the case of a disqualifying disposition of stock described in section
421(b), an employer that otherwise satisfies all requirements of section 6041 and the regulations thereunder will
be considered to have done so timely if Form W-2 or Form W-2c, as appropriate, is furnished to the employee
or former employee, and is filed with the Federal Government, on or before the date on which the employer files the tax
return claiming the deduction relating to the disqualifying disposition. 



* * * * *



(5) 

Effective Date. 

Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section apply to deductions for taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
1995. However, taxpayers may also apply paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section when claiming deductions for
taxable years beginning before that date if the claims are not barred by the statute of limitations. Paragraphs (a)(3)
and (a)(4) of this section are effective as set forth in  1.83-8(b).

Financial Reporting Requirements and Rate of Return Methodology in the Domestic Offshore Trades



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Maritime Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Rule; Enlargement of Time.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission is extending the time for reply comments in regard to its proposed rule on financial reporting requirements
and rate of return methodology in the domestic offshore trades. The Commission also is permitting NPR, Inc., a new
participant in the domestic offshore trades, to comment generally on the proposed rule.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Commission, by notice published November 4, 1994, 59 FR 55232, invited reply comments on four specific issues
raised in this proceeding.




Counsel for NPR, Inc. now seeks an extension of time in this proceeding from December 5, 1994, to January 27, 1995, to
submit reply comments and ``such further comments on the issues as the Commission is required to consider under the
terms of the Administrative Procedures Act.'' The upshot of this request is that NPR seeks to comment on any issue raised
by the proposed rule, not just the issues on which the Commission specifically sought replies. The basis for the request
is that NPR has only recently purchased the assets of Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority, a major participant
in a domestic offshore trade, and has not had a prior opportunity to comment on the proposed rules.

The Commission has determined to grant the request in part, extending the reply comment date to January 6, 1995. Additionally,
since NPR, Inc. has not had a prior opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, its comments will not be required to
be limited to the specific issues on which replies are sought.





By the Commission.

Information Form and Post-Effective Reporting Requirements for Agreements Among Ocean Common Carriers Subject
to the Shipping Act of 1984 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Maritime Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Maritime Commission proposes to amend its regulations governing the information submission requirements
for agreements among ocean common carriers subject to the Shipping Act of 1984. The Commission proposes to replace
the current information form that accompanies newly filed agreements with a new form applicable to certain kinds
of agreements, which requires the submission of specific data on the agreement member lines' cargo carryings, revenue
results and port service patterns before they entered into the agreement. In addition, the Commission proposes regulations
that require the member lines of certain kinds of effective agreements to submit reports on their operations on a regular
and ongoing basis, which would reflect the lines' cargo carryings, revenue results and port service patterns after
they entered into the agreement. The application of the proposed rule to a particular agreement depends primarily
on whether the agreement authorizes its carrier members to engage in certain activities, and secondarily on the carrier
members' combined market share. An agreement that does not authorize any of the activities specified by the proposed
rule would still be filed with the Commission, unless it qualifies for one of the Commission's existing filing exemptions,
but would not have any information form or reporting obligations. The intent of the proposed rule is to provide the
Commission with improved information on the impact of concerted carrier practices on the foreign commerce of the
United States, and to facilitate the processing and monitoring of ocean carrier agreements under the standards of
the Shipping Act of 1984.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background 



The jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'' or ``Commission'') over ocean carrier agreements
in the foreign commerce of the United States extends under section 4(a) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act'') to
all agreements to: 

(1) Discuss, fix, or regulate transportation rates, including through rates, cargo space accommodations, and other
conditions of service; 

(2) Pool or apportion traffic, revenues, earnings, or losses; 

(3) Allot ports or restrict or otherwise regulate the number and character of sailings between ports; 

(4) Limit or regulate the volume or character of cargo or passenger traffic to be carried; 

(5) Engage in exclusive, preferential, or cooperative working arrangements * * *; 

(6) Control, regulate, or prevent competition in international ocean transportation; and 

(7) Regulate or prohibit * * * use of service contracts.




46 U.S.C. app. 1703(a).

 


The reforms in 1984 to the Shipping Act were intended in large part to facilitate the swift effectiveness, with immunity
from the antitrust laws, of such agreements. Section 15 of the former Shipping Act, 1916 (``1916 Act''), had required
carriers to secure Commission approval for any agreement governing rates, conditions of service, or similar matters,
before such an agreement could become effective. Under standards set forth in section 15, the Commission was permitted
to disapprove, cancel, or modify any agreement that it found to be unjustly discriminatory or unfair, or to operate
to the detriment of the commerce of the United States, or to be contrary to the public interest, or to be in violation
of the 1916 Act. 46 U.S.C. 814 (1982). 

The Commission, with Supreme Court approval, had taken the position that agreements to set rates, pool revenues,
restrict capacity, or to engage in other activities that normally would be contrary to the antitrust laws were presumed
to be contrary to the public interest, and would be approved only if they were shown to be ``required by a serious transportation
need, necessary to secure important public benefits or in furtherance of a valid regulatory purpose of the Shipping
Act.'' 

FMC 

v. 

Svenska Amerika Linien, 

390 U.S. 238, 243 (1968). The burden of making this showing was placed upon the carrier proponents of an agreement,
on the ground that information regarding the operation and probable future impact of an agreement ``[a]lmost uniformly
* * * is in the hands of those seeking approval * * * and it is incumbent upon those in possession
of such information to come forward with it.'' 

Mediterranean Pools Investigation, 

9 F.M.C. 264, 290 (1966). Under these procedures, the implementation of agreements had often been delayed for considerable
amounts of time, especially if formal protests were made. 

See Marine Space Enclosures, Inc. 

v. 

FMC, 

420 F.2d 577 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (requiring that the Commission hold a hearing when a protest raising substantial issues
had been filed). In many cases, protests were filed by other carriers, who effectively delayed or blocked their competitors'
business plans. 

The 1984 Act did away with the requirement that an agreement had to be approved by the Commission before it could lawfully
operate. Instead, agreements now generally become effective forty-five days after they are filed. As a partial counterbalance
to this liberalized approach, conference agreements
 are required by section 5(b) of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b), to include a number of procompetitive provisions,
and the Commission may reject a conference agreement that does not meet this standard. Especially noteworthy is the
requirement that all conference agreements must clearly state that any member line may take ``independent action''
on any rate or service item required to be filed in a tariff with the Commission; this empowers any member line to set
an individual rate below (or above) the conference rate, without having to obtain approval of the rate from the other
member lines. The conference is then required to publish the independent action rate in its conference tariff upon
no more than ten days' notice. 





The Commission may also prescribe the ``form and manner'' in which agreements of any kind must be filed, and may reject
an improperly drafted agreement. In addition, the Commission may request information and documents in connection
with a newly filed agreement and, if its demand is not ``substantially'' met, may seek a delay in the agreement's effective
date or other relief from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The 1984 Act sets forth an extensive list of prohibited acts, 
barring many anticompetitive practices that previously had been 
outlawed under the broad ``public interest'' standard of section 15 
of the 1916 Act. For example, section 10(b)(6) of the 1984 Act, 46 
U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(6), carries forward section 15's prohibition of 
agreements that are unfair or unjustly discriminatory between 
shippers or ports. Sections 10(c)(1)-(3) and (5) of the 1984 Act, 


id.

 app. 1709(c)(1)-(3) and (5), prohibit boycotts, restrictions on 
technological innovations, predatory practices and the denial of 
reasonable freight forwarder compensation, all of which the 
Commission previously had found violated section 15.





If the Commission has indications that an agreement may be 
operating in violation of the 1984 Act, it may institute an 
investigation of the agreement and its member lines. In addition, 
the Commission may ask any U.S. district court to temporarily 
enjoin the agreement while the investigation proceeds.
 If the 
court should find that continued operation of the agreement would 
be inequitable, it can issue an order barring further effectiveness 
of the agreement until ten days after issuance of the Commission's 
final decision. If the Commission should find in its final 
decision that violations of the 1984 Act in fact occurred, it may 
``disapprove, cancel or modify'' the agreement,
 which would in 
effect supersede the existing court injunction. In addition, the 
Commission may assess fines against the agreement member lines.
 






The other procedure provided by the 1984 Act by which the 
Commission can prevent an agreement from going into effect, or 
prevent further operation of an existing agreement, is set forth in 
section 6(g). This provision authorizes the Commission to seek an 
injunction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia 
against an agreement that is ``likely, by a reduction in 
competition, to produce an unreasonable reduction in transportation 
service or an unreasonable increase in transportation cost.'' 46 
U.S.C. app. 1705(g). A proceeding under section 6(g) does not 
involve questions of discrimination or unfairness, which are 
covered by the section 10 prohibited acts, nor does it involve 
questions of statutory violations or fines against the carriers. 
Section 6(g) was meant to provide a way of dealing with ``unusual or 
severe cases not addressed by other prohibitions in the Act,''
 and 
the only remedy available under the provision is an injunction 
against the agreement itself. 




B. The Commission's Agreement Program 


The Commission's procedures for evaluating and monitoring 
carrier agreements reflect the new responsibilities and limitations 
imposed by the 1984 Act. When an agreement is first filed, its 
provisions are immediately reviewed to ensure that they contain the 
1984 Act's mandatory provisions and do not run afoul of the 
prohibited acts sections. In the ordinary case, that is a one-time 
process and does not entail ongoing periodic review.

<TEXT>
 

An agreement's effect on shippers, ports and maritime commerce 
is a different matter. An agreement of significant anticompetitive 
dimensions_for example, a large market share combined with 
authority to fix rates and control service contracts_poses 
potential dangers of unlawful activities and unreasonable rate 
increases or service reductions both when it is first filed and for 
as long as it remains in effect. Thus, under the new regulatory 
framework established by the 1984 Act, the role of the Commission 
as a monitoring and surveillance agency was greatly enhanced. In 
discharging that responsibility, the Commission cannot merely 
examine an agreement's provisions; rather, it must continually 
gather, review and interpret data on the impact of the agreement on 
U.S. foreign commerce. As for the source of such information, the 
1984 Act removed the burden of proof in agreement investigations 
from the carriers, but did not alter the accuracy of the 
Commission's 1966 observation in 

Mediterranean Pools Investigation

 
that the primary source for information on the operation of an 
agreement is the carriers that are the parties to the agreement. 
At present, the Commission has regulations in place that 
obtain information from carriers about their agreements in two 
principal ways. All new agreements, unless specifically exempted,
 
and all ``significant modifications'' to existing agreements
 must 
submit an information form
 which, at a minimum, requires the 
parties to state the full name of the agreement (Part I); whether 
the agreement authorizes collective rate fixing (Part II(A)), cargo 
or revenue pooling (Part II(B)), or the establishment of a ``joint 
service/consortium'' arrangement (Part II(C)); whether the agreement 
was entered into as a response to any law or other official action 
by a foreign government (

e.g.,

 cargo reservation laws) (Part VI); 
and persons who can be contacted by the Commission's staff for 
further information if necessary (Part IX). If an agreement does 
authorize collective rate fixing, cargo or revenue pooling, or the 
establishment of a ``joint service/consortium'' arrangement, the 
parties are required additionally to provide market share and cargo 
carryings information for the previous year (Part III), to identify 
the nature and extent of any competition on the trade (Part IV), 
and to identify any reports, studies or other research on 
competitive conditions in the trade (Part VIII). Agreements that 
authorize service rationalization are required to provide 
information on any changes in port calls or reductions in service 
that will result from the agreement within the next twelve months 
(Part V). In addition, filing parties may voluntarily describe the 
benefits that they anticipate will accrue from the agreement to 
themselves (such as improved operational efficiencies) or to 
shippers and U.S. commerce (such as improved service) (Part VII). 






The data and information shown on an agreement's information 
form are the basis for pre-implementation review of an agreement 
under section 10 and section 6(g) of the 1984 Act, unless 
additional information is obtained as a result of a formal request 
issued under section 6(d),
 in which case the agreement's 
effective date is delayed until the 45th day after the Commission 
receives the information requested, so that pre-implementation 
review can include the additional material. 




In addition, parties to effective agreements are required to 
file minutes of meetings of the carriers or other persons 
authorized to take action on behalf of the carriers, which include 
reports on shippers' requests and complaints and reports on 
consultations with shippers and shippers' associations.





C. Areas of Needed Improvement

While the information-gathering processes for agreements established by the Commission immediately after passage
of the 1984 Act have served their purpose adequately, the increasingly comprehensive and complex agreements filed
in recent years indicate a need for updating and augmentation. Agreements with multi- country geographic ranges
are now common. New devices and arrangements for dealing with excess capacity have appeared. Rate discussion agreements
between conference and nonconference lines have become more prevalent, and such arrangements have not been required
to include the procompetitive provisions applicable to conferences. Networks of vessel and space charter agreements
covering a multitude of trade lanes have been established, and some of those agreements operate within larger conference
agreements.

In addition, some of the provisions of the current information form have not produced much useful information. It
appears that these provisions either have become outdated or, with the benefit of hindsight, were not sufficiently
relevant to the Commission's pre-implementation review of a new agreement under the standards of the 1984 Act. This
is particularly true of Part VI, which concerns whether the agreement was entered into as a response to a law or other
action by a foreign government, and Part VII, which allows the carriers to describe the expected benefits of the agreement
if they wish. Further, the activity queries in Part II of the current form which, if answered in the affirmative, trigger
the further requirements of Parts III, IV and VIII, do not reach rate discussion agreements between independent lines
or between conference lines and independents, nor do they reach agreements to discuss costs or exchange cost information.
These types of agreements do not directly authorize rate setting but nonetheless have a direct and substantial impact
on rate competition, as discussed further below.

Due to the limitations of the current post-implementation reporting requirements, monitoring of effective agreements
at present depends primarily on other reports that are not required by regulation, but rather must be negotiated as
to content and frequency by the Commission's staff with the carrier parties during the initial review period. Such
reports produce data bearing on the carriers' concerted practices and operating results, such as percentage of capacity
being utilized by shippers and average gross revenue per twenty-foot-equivalent container unit (``TEU'') of cargo.
Major agreements that currently are subject to negotiated reporting requirements include the Trans Atlantic Conference
Agreement, the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement and the Inter-American Discussion Agreement.

Obtaining data about the economic impact of effective agreements through 

ad hoc

 negotiations during the initial review period has been a flawed procedure. Carrier representatives have shown good
will and substantial cooperation, but both they and the Commission's staff are inevitably hampered by the 1984 Act's
strict time limits for agreement processing. Once an agreement has gone into effect, the Commission can always issue
an order under section 15 of the 1984 Act to obtain information from the member carriers,
 but that power is better suited for special circumstances than for day-to-day regulation. In sum, neither the current
practice of negotiating 

ad hoc

 reports nor the authority set forth in section 15 is an efficacious method of achieving consistent and predictable
oversight of significant carrier agreements after they have gone into effect.





D. The Proposed Rule



The Commission addresses the concerns discussed above by proposing new regulations that are designed to elicit more
detailed and specific information on ocean carrier agreements in a more structured and comprehensive manner. The
proposed rule formulates a sliding scale of information demands for three classes of agreements, ``Class A,'' ``Class
B'' and ``Class C.'' Where an agreement fits on the scale depends on the activities it authorizes and the parties' combined
market share. These criteria are discussed further below. An agreement that does not authorize any of the specified
activities would still be required by law to be filed with the Commission (unless it qualifies for one of the existing
exemptions), but would not have any information form or reporting obligations.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941205-1-00040 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For an agreement fitting into one of the three covered classes, the proposed rule has the following important features:

 A revised information form that would accompany the agreement when it is first filed, requiring the submission
of specific data on the agreement member lines' cargo carryings, revenue results and port service patterns before
they entered into the agreement.

 If the agreement goes into effect, additional provisions requiring the member lines to submit reports on their
operations on a regular and ongoing basis. Thus, the proposed rule would establish reporting requirements as Commission
regulations that would have the status of agency public policy and could be enforced by Commission or court sanctions
if necessary.

 Linkage between the information form and the subsequent reports. Aside from some activities that are relevant
only to effective agreements (such as independent rate actions), the reporting requirements track the subject areas
of the information form. This would enable the Commission to compare the carriers' operations and economic results
before and after their agreement went into effect.


 1. Classification of Agreements: The Six ``Class A/B'' Activities



``Class A'' and ``Class B'' agreements permit the same kinds of activities; the difference between them is market
share. An agreement is a ``Class A/B'' agreement if it authorizes 

any one 

of the following six activities:

 Ratemaking. This specifically includes not only traditional conference agreements, under which a group
of lines agree upon fixed rates and practices and are bound to them under a common tariff, but also agreements under
which non-conference lines meet among themselves or with a conference to discuss rates, or to discuss and agree upon
rates on a ``non-binding'' basis. The latter types of agreements have become increasingly common, and their presence
in a trade raises serious concerns about the true level of competition since they involve discussions and agreements
about rates between non-conference lines or between a conference and its non-conference competitors. These concerns
are not necessarily lessened by the fact that any agreement reached with regard to a particular rate would not bind
the carriers to adhere to the rate; a shipper in the trade seeking to negotiate a rate with a carrier would still be faced
with an arrangement that unilaterally brings outside carriers into the rate negotiation process and potentially
limits the shipper's ability to negotiate the best possible rates for its cargo.

The ``ratemaking'' criterion is met if the agreement authorizes its carrier members to (1) agree on a binding basis
under a common tariff, (2) agree on a non-binding basis, or (3) discuss any kind of basic linehaul rate_including port-to-port
rates, independent action rates, overland rates, minilandbridge rates, interior point intermodal rates, proportional
rates, through rates, joint rates, minimum rates, volume rates, joint time/volume rates, project rates, freight-all-kinds
rates, volume incentive programs, service contract rates, loyalty contract rates, rates on commodities exempt
from tariff filing, and so forth_or any kind of ancillary charge or allowance that affects the total transportation
cost to the shipper. Those include surcharges, arbitraries, currency adjustment factors, terminal handling charges,
pickup and delivery charges, demurrage, absorption and equalization allowances, and so forth.

On the other hand, in the interest of balance and restraint, the proposed rule does not treat as ``ratemaking'' agreements
those agreements that concern how rates are collected from shippers_
for example, credit conditions and the handling of delinquent accounts_but do not concern the level of the rates themselves,
or those agreements that concern charges or payments to persons other than shippers, 

e.g., 

inland divisions of through rates, brokerage, freight forwarder compensation, employment of neutral bodies for
self-policing purposes, or development of electronic cargo information systems.

 Discussion or exchange of vessel-operating cost data. The Commission has received a number of agreements
that do not authorize rate discussions or agreements of any kind, but do authorize discussion of or exchange of cost
data among the member carriers. The antitrust laws have been applied against such arrangements in other industries,
on the theory that the sharing of pricing information can have a significant impact on price competition.
 The most significant costs for ocean common carriers are vessel-operating costs, which the proposed rule defines
to include wages of officers and crew, fringe benefits, consumable stores, supplies and equipment, maintenance
and repair, insurance, vessel fuel, and bareboat charter hire.
 The 1984 Act allows carriers to enter into agreements to discuss and exchange information about these costs, but the
Commission believes that they should be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny as their close cousins, rate discussion
agreements. On the other hand, again in the interest of balance and restraint, the ``costs'' criterion does not apply
to discussion of other types of expense that are less important for setting rates (for example, terminal costs). In
order to make this distinction effective, agreements seeking to authorize discussion or exchange of cost data must
specify whether that authority includes any of the vessel-operating costs.

 Joint service, which is defined by the Commission's 
regulations as * * * 



* * * an agreement between ocean common carriers 
operating as a joint venture whereby a separate service 
is established which: (1) Holds itself out in its own 
distinct operating name; (2) independently fixes its own 
rates, charges, practices and conditions of service or 
chooses to participate in its operating name in another 
agreement which is duly authorized to determine and 
implement such activities; (3) independently publishes 
its own tariff or chooses to participate in its operating 
name in an otherwise established tariff; (4) issues its 
own bills of lading; and (5) acts generally as a single 
carrier. The common use of facilities may occur and 
there is no competition between members for traffic in 
the agreement trade; but they otherwise maintain their 
separate identities.

 


46 CFR 572.104(n). While the introduction of a joint service into 
a trade by outside lines may increase the level of competition and 
the range of services available for shippers, there can be negative 
effects on competition and service if the joint service is formed 
by lines that up to that point had been competing in the trade, and 
especially if the new entity would have substantial market power. 


 ``Capacity management'' or ``capacity regulation''. This 
relatively new technique for dealing with overtonnaging and 
depressed rates limits the availability of vessel space to shippers 
but does not reduce the real capacity of the carriers. Therefore, 
such programs have the potential to perpetuate economic 
inefficiencies and unnecessary costs for shippers, particularly if 
they remain in place beyond short-term cargo declines or surges in 
capacity. Agreements authorizing such programs have sufficiently 
serious ramifications under the 1984 Act to warrant thorough 
monitoring. 
 Regulation or discussion of service contracts. Most 
agreements engaging in this activity are conference agreements, 
which would already be covered by the ``ratemaking'' criterion 
discussed above. However, agreements among non-conference lines 
may include authority to confer and to reach ``non-binding'' 
agreements on service contract terms, and such authority may well 
diminish price and service competition.

 Pooling, which is defined by the Commission's regulations as * * *




* * * an agreement between ocean common carriers which provides for the division of cargo carryings,
earnings, or revenue and/or losses between the members in accordance with an established formula or scheme.

 

46 CFR 572.104(w). While such agreements are not as common as they once were, they are severely anticompetitive by
nature and must be closely regulated when they do appear. 


2. Classification of Agreements: the Importance of Market Share 


The proposed rule requires any agreement that authorizes one or more of the six ``Class A/B'' activities to be accompanied,
upon its initial filing, with an information form showing its parties' market shares both for the entire agreement
and also in each of the sub-trades within the overall scope of the agreement, during the most recent calendar quarter
for which complete data are available. ``Sub-trade'' is defined as all liner movements between each U.S. port range
(Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific) and each foreign country within the overall scope of the agreement. For example, an agreement
with an overall scope of U.S. Pacific Coast to the Far East would have sub-trades of U.S. Pacific Coast to Japan, U.S.
Pacific Coast to Taiwan, and so forth. 
An agreement that authorizes at least one of the six ``Class A/B'' activities and holds market shares of 50 percent
or more in half or more of its sub-trades is classified as a ``Class A'' agreement under the proposed rule.
 The parties to such an agreement are required to submit extensive historical data on the initial information form
and, if the agreement goes into effect, to submit detailed quarterly reports on their operations under the agreement.
These requirements are discussed in detail below. An agreement that authorizes at least one of the six activities,
but did not hold market shares of 50 percent or more in at least half of its sub-trades, is classified as a ``Class B''
agreement. It would file the same information form as a ``Class A'' agreement but, if it went into effect, would have
significantly lighter reporting obligations, as also discussed below. It should be noted that the classification
of an agreement as ``Class A'' would not be permanent; the agreement's ongoing reporting obligations would include
market share data, and at the beginning of each calendar year, the agreement's sub-trade market shares during the
most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available would determine whether it would remain under
``Class A'' reporting obligations for the upcoming year. 




Market share measures an agreement's potential for abuse of economic power and unreasonable or discriminatory price
and service practices. The break point of 50 percent in at least half of the sub-trades was chosen in the belief that
an agreement that is a relatively minor presence in a majority of its sub-trades_that is, a ``Class B'' agreement_is
unlikely to be able to impose unreasonable or unfair rates or practices regardless of what it authorizes its parties
to do, and does not require extensive gathering of information about its operation. While commenters on the proposed
rule are free to argue for a different break point, it should be noted that an important feature of the proposed rule
is that the market share calculation for rate discussion agreements and ``non-binding'' rate agreements adds the
market shares held by the non-conference lines to those held by the conference lines for purposes of determining whether
such an agreement should be classified as ``Class A'' or ``Class B''. 
The new focus on sub-trades results from the Commission's belief, resulting from the agency's experience over the
ten years since passage of the 1984 Act, that economic analysis of an agreement is facilitated and acquires depth of
understanding if it is done according to the agreement's smaller components. This is particularly true since, as
noted above, the Commission is now seeing more and more agreements that have multi-coast or even multi-continent
geographic ranges. Further, in some of the more geographically fragmented parts of the world, such as the Far East
and the South Pacific, sub-trades can constitute separate and cloistered markets. Agreements that serve a comparatively
unified landmass, such as Europe, might still implement practices that differ from area to area within the general
market. These factors all argue for information-gathering systems that acquire data relevant to an agreement's
sub-trades, rather than only the market defined by the agreement's total scope.
 Accordingly, the information (besides market share) sought by the proposed rule for ``Class A'' and ``Class B'' agreements
is, for the most part, concerned with the agreements' sub-trades.

It should be stated at this juncture that the proposed rule 
includes a procedure whereby the Commission may grant a waiver from 
full compliance with the rule's requirements, if a group of 
carriers applies for and justifies such relief. A waiver could 
apply to any part of the rule, including the requirement that data 
be reported by individual country sub-trades. For example, an 
agreement might be permitted to report by a multi-country region 
rather than by individual countries, if it could show that the 
major moving commodities moving into or out of a particular group 
of countries did not vary much country by country, and so regional 
data would provide a reasonably accurate and complete description 
of the trades with those countries. The waiver procedure could 
also be used to allow conferences made up of relatively small 
carriers serving a relatively small trade to submit post-implementation monitoring reports at wider intervals
(for example, 
once a year). The waiver provisions specifically state that the 
Commission will take into account the presence or absence of 
shipper complaints in considering an application for a waiver. 



3. ``Class A'' Agreements Under the Proposed Rule 


The 

information form

 for a ``Class A'' agreement begins by 
requiring a listing of all effective agreements covering all or 
part of the geographic scope of the proposed agreement, whose 
parties include one or more of the parties to the proposed 
agreement. This provision is designed to ensure that the 
Commission has accurate information regarding the recent trend 
toward networks of agreements connected by common parties. Next, 
the form requires an identification of all ``Class A/B'' activities 
that the agreement seeks to authorize. 
After obtaining the market share data discussed above, the 
information form then inquires into the recent agreement-wide cargo 
carryings and revenue results of each of the carriers that would 
now join together into the agreement. Otherwise, the information 
form focuses primarily on the state of affairs in each of the 
agreement's sub-trades before the agreement was filed. This is 
done by reference to the major commodities moving to and from the 
United States in each sub-trade. 
Using the actual commodities moving under an agreement as the 
chief frame of regulatory reference is an important feature of the 
proposed rule, and represents a significant departure from current 
practice. At present, the information obtained by the Commission 
on carrier rate and service practices via the monitoring reports 
submitted for certain major agreements does not describe the cargo 
being transported, and is stated in the aggregate (for example, 
total number of service contracts executed) or as broad averages 
(for example, average revenue per TEU of all cargoes). In 
contrast, the proposed information form, while continuing to 
require the submission of aggregate data in certain areas, mainly 
requires carriers to identify the commodities that have made up the 
bulk of their cargo in each sub-trade and then to submit data on 
the price and service practices they have applied to each of those 
commodities. With this information in hand, the Commission will 
have a reasonably comprehensive summary of pre-agreement rate and 
service practices in each sub-trade covered by the new agreement, 
as well as in the agreement's entire geographic scope. If the 
agreement is permitted to go into effect, that summary will serve 
as a baseline for analyzing the corresponding information later 
obtained through the post-implementation reports. 
In sum, the proposed rule both changes the orientation of 
agreement review to that of the cargo being affected, and also 
calls for more refined and differentiated data from the carriers. 
These reforms should provide the Commission with improved and more 
useful indicators of the potential or actual impact of an agreement 
on the needs of shippers for good service at reasonable rates, and 
in particular whether the agreement might cause or has caused 
unfair or unreasonable conditions for specific commodities, classes 
of shippers, or geographic areas. It should be noted that, while 
the proposed rule is constructed around the major moving 
commodities in each sub-trade, nothing prevents the Commission from 
taking appropriate action if it receives information that an 
agreement is harming the fair and reasonable transportation of a 
relatively minor commodity.

<DOCNO> FR941205-1-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The information form also inquires into the effect of the 
agreement on ports within its geographic range; it should be noted 
that it is unnecessary to segregate data on port calls by sub- 
trades. In addition, the information form imposes special 
requirements on any ``Class A'' agreement that authorizes ``capacity 
management'' or ``capacity regulation.'' Because such programs are 
designed to address problems of excess capacity, the information 
form inquires into each agreement member line's recent capacity 
utilization experience within the geographic service area to be 
covered by the proposed program and its initial capacity level 
under the program. These data are to be provided within a 
``geographic service area'' because a capacity management or 
regulation program that is part of a larger agreement can be 
designed to cover less than the entire geographic scope of the 
agreement. This section of the form also requires the submission 
of any reports or studies dealing with capacity utilization and 
related topics, but only to the extent that such documents were 
both recently prepared and shared among the agreement lines, and 
thus may have influenced the formation of the capacity management 
program. 
If the new agreement were permitted to go into effect, then 
the reporting requirements for ``Class A'' agreements would become 
applicable. Changes in membership in other agreements would be 
reported, and the parties' market shares would continue to be 
tracked by entire agreement geographic scope and by sub-trade. 
Otherwise, the reporting requirements would mirror the information 
form in order to provide ``before and after'' depictions of the 
trade, with some additional provisions that can apply only to an 
effective agreement. For example, the special provisions of the 
information form applicable to a capacity management program would 
be expanded to carefully monitor the actual operation of the 
program. In addition, a new section entitled ``Independent Rate 
Actions'' would apply to ``Class A'' conference agreements and would 
require:

 

For each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement, and 
for each of the leading commodities * * *, and for each 
party, state the number of independent rate actions taken 
during the calendar quarter that were applicable to that 
commodity moving in that sub-trade, and the total number 
of TEUs of that commodity covered by the independent 
actions. Also, state the name of each shipper for whom 
an independent rate was taken on that commodity during 
the calendar quarter, and state whether the shipper was 
a beneficial cargo owner, a non-vessel-operating common 
carrier, or a shippers' association.

 


This provision would allow the Commission to monitor the level of 
independent rate activity (or the lack of such activity) on 
specific commodities, and to take appropriate action immediately if 
it appears that certain commodities or types of shipper are 
receiving more rigid rate treatment than others. 


4. ``Class B'' agreements under the proposed rule 


As already stated, the proposed rule prescribes the same 
information form for ``Class B'' agreements as for ``Class A'' 
agreements. This establishes the same pre-agreement baseline as is 
done for ``Class A'' agreements. However, assuming the ``Class B'' 
agreement were allowed to go into effect, the reporting 
requirements are limited to quarterly updates on market share, 
agreement-wide cargo and revenue results, membership in other 
agreements, and changes in port service. The agreement would be 
monitored by the Commission, particularly the sub-trades where the 
agreement holds more than 50 percent of the market, and if there 
were indications of possible rate or service problems in a sub- 
trade, further information would be obtained_by either informal 
negotiation or a section 15 order_and compared against the 
original baseline data to determine whether further action was 
necessary. 


5. ``Class C'' Agreements Under the Proposed Rule 


An agreement that authorizes service rationalization, such as 
space charters, coordination of service frequency and port 
rotations, and coordination of the size and capacity of vessels to 
be deployed by the parties, but does not authorize ``capacity 
management'' or ``capacity regulation'' (or any of the other five 
``Class A/B'' activities), is a ``Class C'' agreement. Although such 
agreements have rarely presented serious regulatory concerns, some 
oversight is necessitated by section 6(g)'s admonition against 
agreements that cause unreasonable reductions in service. For a 
``Class C'' agreement, the proposed rule provides for information 
form and reporting requirements limited to membership in other 
agreements and the level of service at the ports within the 
agreement's overall scope. Those provisions should provide the 
Commission with adequate warnings in case service rationalization 
reaches the point where a port, and the shippers which use that 
port, begin to suffer.

6. Other Amendments 


The proposed rule contains a number of other amendments to the 
Commission's existing regulations in 46 CFR part 572. For the most 
part, these amendments are not substantive and are designed to make 
the existing regulations consistent with the proposed rule, to 
eliminate certain outdated regulations, or to reorganize certain 
subparts of the existing regulations. They include the following: 

 In  572.104, new definitions are added for such 
terms as ``capacity management or capacity regulation agreements,'' 
``monitoring report,'' ``rate'' and ``vessel-operating costs.'' In 
addition, the present definition of a joint service is revised to 
eliminate the reference to ``consortium,'' which is a term not 
defined by the 1984 Act and could include a number of commercial 
relationships besides joint services. 

 In subpart C, the exemptions of certain kinds of 
agreements are revised to eliminate unnecessary references to 
``Information Form'' requirements. These changes have no effect on 
the exemptions themselves. 

 Subpart D is revised to include existing subpart E, so 
that all regulations governing the content and organization of 
filed agreements will be contained within one subpart. Also, 
proposed  572.401(a)(2) states that five copies of the new 
Information Form must be filed along with a new agreement; this is 
the minimum number of copies that will be needed by the Commission 
in order to review and process an agreement. Subparagraph (h) of 
present  572.402 is deleted as no longer necessary. Also, 
the proposed rule eliminates the requirements in current  572.403(a)(2)-(3) that Information Forms
must accompany 
``significant modifications'' to effective agreements; they will not 
longer be necessary since the agreements addressed by those 
regulations will in all likelihood be subject to ongoing reporting 
requirements. Also, the standards presently set forth in  572.404 for granting a waiver are revised to remove
the requirement 
that the applicant show that ``beneficial results'' will occur if the 
waiver is granted, and instead to require that the applicant show 
that granting the waiver will not impair effective regulation by 
the Commission, consistent with the language of section 16 of the 
1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1715. Similar language is used in the 
proposed rule's other waiver provisions in revised subparts E and 
G. 

 Section 572.608(b)(2), which sets forth an exception to 
the confidentiality of submitted material, is revised to more 
closely reflect the language of section 6(j) of the 1984 Act, 46 
U.S.C. app. 1705(j). Similar language is used in the proposed 
rule's provision on confidentiality in revised subpart G. 



7. Carrier Costs and Profits 



The Commission's obligation under section 6(g) of the 1984 Act 
to police against agreements that may cause, or have caused, 
unreasonable increases in transportation rates, and the 1984 Act's 
purpose of providing an efficient and economic transportation 
system in the ocean commerce of the United States, 46 U.S.C. app. 
1701(2), raise the question whether these policies can or should be 
pursued by monitoring the costs and/or profitability of the 
carriers to a particular agreement. The proposed rule does not 
include provisions on carrier costs or profitability, but the 
Commission wishes to solicit comments on the lawfulness and 
feasibility of such provisions. Commenters should address whether 
such provisions would be inconsistent with Congress's directive 
that ``[t]he determination whether an agreement is likely to produce 
an `unreasonable increase in the price of transportation' does not 
authorize the FMC to engage in the type of ratemaking analysis 
undertaken by regulators of public utilities or as applied in the 
domestic offshore trades.'' H.R. Rep. No. 600, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 
35 (1984). That aside, commenters should also address how such 
provisions might be structured, particularly given the proposed 
rule's focus on individual country sub-trades; whether costs and/or 
profitability under a particular agreement can be measured 
accurately, particularly if the carriers to the agreement have 
other operations elsewhere; and whether arguments that an agreement 
is necessary to control costs or to improve profits are better 
explored in the context of an investigation of a particular 
agreement, rather than made the subject of regulations applicable 
to broad classes of agreements.

8. Effective Agreements Under the Proposed Rule 



The Commission's present intentions regarding the treatment of 
effective agreements under the regulations proposed in this 
proceeding are as follows. Upon publication of a final rule, the 
regulations would become effective immediately for new agreements, 
which thus would be required to comply with the revised Information 
Form provisions. However, the proper application of the new 
regulations to agreements already in effect could not be determined 
immediately, because the market share data necessary to separate 
Class A/B agreements into Class A and Class B will not be readily 
available. 

Accordingly, the Commission intends to stay application of the 
final rule to effective agreements. The Commission then will 
direct all existing Class A/B agreements to submit reports under 
section 15 of the 1984 Act that would include all the information 
demanded of new Class A/B agreements under the Information Form 
regulations, including market share data. Upon review of these 
reports, those agreements will be appropriately classified into 
Class A or Class B, the stay of the final rule will be lifted, and 
the orderly filing of the regular monitoring reports (including 
those applicable to Class C agreements) will begin. The initial 
section 15 reports will provide baselines (albeit not pre- 
implementation baselines) against which the subsequent reports will 
be compared as part of the continuous monitoring of each agreement. 
For those agreements already in effect that are subject to 
reporting requirements negotiated by the Commission's staff, those 
requirements will be superseded by the final rule. 

The Federal Maritime Commission certifies, pursuant to section 
605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that 
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities, including small businesses, 
small organizational units and small government jurisdictions. The 
ocean carriers affected by the rule are not ``small organizations'' 
or ``small governmental jurisdictions'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 601 
and, as large and predominantly foreign-based enterprises, are not 
``small business concerns'' as defined by 15 U.S.C. 632 and 
regulations issued thereunder. 

The collection of information requirements contained in this 
proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and 
Budget for review under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-511), as amended. The incremental public 
reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to 
range from an average of 46 hours to 144 hours per response, 
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing 
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and 
completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send 
comments regarding this burden estimate, including suggestions for 
reducing this burden, to Bruce A. Dombrowski, Deputy Managing 
Director, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573, and 
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 and sections 4, 5, 6, 10, 
15 and 17 of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1703, 1704, 
1705, 1709, 1714 and 1716, Part 572 of Title 46, Code of Federal 
Regulations, is proposed to be amended as follows: 



PART 572_AGREEMENTS BY OCEAN COMMON CARRIERS AND OTHER PERSONS SUBJECT TO THE SHIPPING ACT OF 1984 



1. The authority citation for Part 572 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 553, 46 U.S.C. app. 1701-1707, 1709-
1710, 1712 and 1714-1717.

 


2. In section 572.103, the first sentence of paragraph (a), the first two sentences of paragraph (b), the first sentence
of paragraph (c), and the second sentence of paragraph (d) are revised; in paragraph (e), the third sentence is revised,
the last sentence is revised, and a new sentence is added as follows: 



 572.103 

Policies. 



(a) The Act requires that agreements be processed and reviewed, upon their initial filing, according to strict statutory
deadlines. * * * 

(b) The Act requires that agreements be reviewed, upon their initial filing, to ensure compliance with all applicable
provisions of the Act and empowers the Commission to obtain information to conduct that review. This part identifies
those classes of agreements which must be accompanied by information submissions when they are first filed, and sets
forth the kind of information for each class of agreement which the Commission believes relevant to that review. * * *


(c) In order to further the goal of expedited processing and review of agreements upon their initial filing, agreements
are required to meet certain minimum requirements as to form. * * * 

(d) * * * In order to minimize delay in implementation of routine agreements and to avoid the private
and public cost of unnecessary regulation, the Commission is exempting certain classes of agreements from the filing
requirements of this part. 

(e) * * * This, however, requires greater monitoring of agreements after they have become effective,
to assure continued compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act. * * * Only that information
which is necessary to assure that Commission monitoring responsibilities will be fulfilled is requested. It is the
policy of the Commission to keep the costs of regulation to a minimum and at the same time obtain information needed
to fulfill its statutory responsibility. 



* * * * * 



3. In section 572.104, paragraphs (e) through (r) are redesignated (f) through (s); (s) through (x) are redesignated
(u) through (z); (y) is redesignated (cc); (z) through (cc) are redesignated (dd) through (gg); (dd) is redesignated

Part IV 


Part IV requires the filing party to provide the market shares 
of all liner operators within the entire geographic scope of the 
agreement and in each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement, 
during the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are 
available. 

Sub-trade 

is defined as the scope of all liner 
movements between each U.S. port range within the scope of the 
agreement and each foreign country within the scope of the 
agreement. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and 
outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound market shares should 
be shown separately. 
U.S. port ranges are defined as follows: 


Atlantic

_Includes ports along the eastern seaboard from the 
northern boundary of Maine to, but not including, Key West, 
Florida. Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes 
and their connecting waterways as well as all ports in the State of 
New York on the St. Lawrence River. 


Gulf

_Includes all ports along the Gulf of Mexico from Key 
West, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas, inclusive. Also includes all 
ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 


Pacific

_Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii, 
California, Oregon and Washington. Also includes all ports in 
Guam, American Samoa and Saipan. 
The 

formula for calculating market share

 (in either the entire 
agreement scope or in a sub-trade) is as follows: 
The total amount of cargo carried on each liner operator's 
liner vessels (in either the entire agreement scope or in the 
particular sub-trade) during the most recent calendar quarter for 
which complete data are available, divided by the total amount of 
cargo carried on all liner vessels (in either the entire agreement 
scope or in the particular sub-trade) during the same calendar 
quarter, which quotient is multiplied by 100. The calendar quarter 
used must be clearly identified. The market shares held by non- 
agreement lines as well as by agreement lines must be provided, 
stated separately in the format indicated. 
The 

amount of cargo 

is to be measured in TEUs. 

Liner 
movements 

is the carriage of liner cargo by liner operators. 

Liner 
cargoes 

are cargoes carried on liner vessels in a liner service. 
A 

liner operator 

is a vessel-operating common carrier engaged in 
liner service. 

Liner vessels 

are those vessels used in a liner 
service. 

Liner service 

refers to a definite, advertised schedule 
of sailings at regular intervals. All these definitions, terms and 
descriptions apply only for purposes of the Information Form. 


Part V 


Part V requires the filing party to state, for each agreement 
member line that served all or any part of the geographic area 
covered by the agreement during all or any part of the most recent 
12-month period for which complete data are available, each line's 
total cargo carryings (measured in TEUs) within the geographic 
area, total revenues within the geographic area, and average 
revenue per TEU. The Information Form specifies the format in 
which the information is to be reported. Where the agreement 
covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and 
outbound data should be stated separately. 


Part VI 


Part VI requires the filing party to identify, for each sub-
trade within the scope of the agreement, the top 10 commodities by 
cumulative TEUs carried by all the parties during the same 12-month 
period used in responding to Part V, or the commodities accounting 
for 50 percent of the cumulative TEUs carried by all the parties 
during the 12-month period, whichever is greater. Where the 
agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, 
inbound and outbound sub-trades should be stated separately. 


Part VII 


Part VII addresses how each of the parties to the proposed 
agreement has carried each major commodity in each sub-trade, and 
the revenue results experienced by each party from its carriage of 
each commodity. The Information Form specifies the format in which 
the information is to be reported. 


Part VIII 


Part VIII is concerned with the levels of service at each port 
within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. The filing 
party is required to provide the number of calls at each port by 
each of the agreement lines over the 12-month period used in 
responding to Parts V, VI and VII, and also to indicate any change 
in the nature or type of service to be effected immediately by the 
agreement.

authorizes capacity management or capacity regulation as defined by 
46 CFR 572.104(e). The filing party is required to state the total 
TEU capacity provided by each party in the geographic service area 
covered by the capacity management or capacity regulation program 
during the same 12-month period used in responding to Parts V, VI, 
VII and VIII, the number of those TEUs that were utilized, and each 
party's initial capacity commitment or allocation under the 
program. Where the capacity management or capacity regulation 
program covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, 
inbound and outbound data should be stated separately. Copies of 
specified kinds of reports must also be provided.

the definition set forth in  572.502(a) and has market shares of 50 
percent or more in half or more of its sub-trades. 

(b)

Classification of an agreement as ``Class A'' or ``Class B'' for purposes of its reporting obligations under this
subpart shall be done by the Bureau of Trade Monitoring and Analysis, based in the first instance on the market share
data reported on the agreement's Information Form pursuant to  572.503, or on similar data otherwise obtained.
Thereafter, at the beginning of each calendar year, the Bureau of Trade Monitoring and Analysis shall determine whether
the agreement should be classified as ``Class A'' or ``Class B'' for that year, based on the market share data reported
on the agreement's most recent quarterly Monitoring Report. 

(c) 

Class C agreement

 means an agreement that is subject to the definition set forth in  572.502(b). 

25. A new section 572.703 is added, as follows: 



 572.703 



Monitoring report for Class A agreements. 



This section sets forth the Monitoring Report form for Class A agreements, with accompanying instructions that are
intended to facilitate the completion of the Report. The instructions should be read in conjunction with the Shipping
Act of 1984 and with this part 572. 



Monitoring Report for Class A Agreements 



Instructions 



A complete response must be supplied to each part of the Report. Where the party answering a particular part is unable
to supply a complete response, that party shall provide either estimated data (with an explanation of why precise
data are not available) or a detailed statement of reasons for noncompliance and the efforts made to obtain the required
information. All sources must be identified. 



Part by Part Explanation




Part I 



Part I requires the filing party to state the full name of the agreement, and the assigned FMC number. 



Part II 



Part II requires the filing party to indicate any change occurring during the calendar quarter to the list of other
agreements set forth in Part II of the Information Form. 



Part III(A) 



Part III(A) requires the filing party to indicate whether the agreement authorizes the parties to operate as a conference.




Part III(B) 



Part III(B) requires the filing party to indicate whether the agreement authorizes the parties to establish capacity
management or capacity regulation programs, as defined in  572.104(e), whereby some part of the capacity of
the parties' vessels is withheld from a specified transportation market. 



Part IV 



Part IV requires the filing party to provide the market shares of all liner operators within the entire geographic
scope of the agreement and in each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement during the most recent calendar quarter.
Sub-trade is defined as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port range and each foreign country within
the scope of the agreement. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and
outbound market shares should be shown separately. 

U.S. port ranges are defined as follows: 



Atlantic_

Includes ports along the eastern seaboard from the northern boundary of Maine to, but not including, Key West, Florida.
Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes and their connecting waterways as well as all ports in the State
of New York on the St. Lawrence River. 



Gulf_

Includes all ports along the Gulf of Mexico from Key West, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas, inclusive. Also includes
all ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 



Pacific_

Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington. Also includes all ports in
Guam, American Samoa and Saipan. 

The 

formula for calculating market share 

(in either the entire agreement scope or in a sub-trade) is as follows: 

The total amount of cargo carried on each liner operator's liner vessels (in either the entire agreement scope or in
the particular sub-trade) during the calendar quarter, divided by the total amount of cargo carried on all liner vessels
(in either the entire agreement scope or in the particular sub-trade) during the calendar quarter, which quotient
is multiplied by 100. The market shares held by non-agreement lines as well as by agreement lines must be provided,
stated separately in the format indicated. 

The 

amount of cargo

 is to be measured in TEUs. 

Liner movements

 is the carriage of liner cargo by liner operators. 

Liner cargoes

 are cargoes carried on liner vessels in a liner service. A 

liner operator

 is a vessel-operating common carrier engaged in liner service. 

Liner vessels

 are those vessels used in a liner service. 

Liner service 

refers to a definite, advertised schedule of sailings at regular intervals. All these definitions, terms and descriptions
apply only for purposes of the Monitoring Report. 



Part V 



Part V requires the filing party to state each agreement member line's total cargo carryings (measured in TEUs) during
the calendar quarter within the entire geographic area covered by the agreement, each line's total revenues within
the geographic area during the calendar quarter, and average revenue per TEU. The Monitoring Report specifies the
format in which the information is to be reported. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner
movements, inbound and outbound data should be stated separately. 


Part VI 


Part VI requires the filing party to identify, for each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement, the top 10 commodities
by cumulative TEUs carried by all the parties during the calendar quarter, or the commodities accounting for 50 percent
of the cumulative TEUs carried by all the parties during the calendar quarter, whichever is greater. Where the agreement
covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound sub-trades should be stated separately.

Part VII 



Part VII addresses how each of the parties has carried each major commodity in each sub-trade, and the revenue results
experienced by each party from its carriage of each commodity. The Monitoring Report specifies the format in which
the information is to be reported. 



Part VIII 



Part VIII is required to be completed if Part III(A) is answered ``YES.'' The filing party is required to indicate the
extent to which each party has taken independent rate actions on each of the leading commodities in each of the sub-trades.
Part VIII also inquires into the type of shipper_beneficial cargo owner, non-vessel-operating common carrier,
or shippers' association_for whom independent rate actions have been taken. The Monitoring Report specifies the
format in which the information is to be reported. 



Part IX 



Part IX is concerned with the level of service at each port within the entire geographic scope of the agreement. The
filing party is required to provide the number of calls at each port by each of the parties during the calendar quarter,
and also to indicate any change in the nature or type of service effected during the calendar quarter. 



Part X 



Part X is required to be completed if part III(B) is answered ``YES.'' The filing party is required to submit responses
to a number of inquiries into the operation of the capacity management or capacity regulation program during the calendar
quarter. Where the program covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner movements, inbound and outbound data should
be stated separately. Copies of specified kinds of documents must also be provided. 



Part XI(A) 



Part XI(A) requires the filing party to provide the name, title, address, telephone number and cable address of a person
the Commission may contact regarding the Monitoring Report and any information provided therein. 



Part XI(B) 



Part XI(B) requires that the filing party sign the Monitoring Report and certify that the information in the Report
and all attachments and appendices are, to the best of the filing party's knowledge, true, correct and complete. The

MONITORING REPORT FOR CLASS B AGREEMENTS 



Instructions 



A complete response must be supplied to each part of the Report. Where the party answering a particular part is unable
to supply a complete response, that party shall provide either estimated data (with an explanation of why precise
data are not available) or a detailed statement of reasons for noncompliance and the efforts made to obtain the required
information. All sources must be identified. 



Part by Part Explanation 



Part I 



Part I requires the filing party to state the full name of the agreement, and the assigned FMC number. 



Part II 



Part II requires the filing party to indicate any change occurring during the calendar quarter to the list of other
agreements set forth in Part II of the Information Form. 



Part III 



Part III requires the filing party to provide the market shares of all liner operators within the entire geographic
scope of the agreement and in each sub-trade within the scope of the agreement during the most recent calendar quarter.
Sub-trade is defined as the scope of all liner movements between each U.S. port range and each foreign country within
the scope of the agreement. Where the agreement covers both U.S. inbound and outbound liner 
movements, inbound and outbound market shares should be shown separately. 

U.S. port ranges are defined as follows: 



Atlantic

_Includes ports along the eastern seaboard from the northern boundary of Maine to, but not including, Key West, Florida.
Also includes all ports bordering upon the Great Lakes and their connecting waterways as well as all ports in the State
of New York on the St. Lawrence River. 



Gulf

_Includes all ports along the Gulf of Mexico from Key West, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas, inclusive. Also includes
all ports in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 



Pacific

_Includes all ports in the States of Alaska, Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington. Also includes all ports in
Guam, American Samoa and Saipan. 

The 

formula for calculating market share

 (in either the entire 
agreement scope or in a sub-trade) is as follows: 

The total amount of cargo carried on each liner operator's liner vessels (in either the entire agreement scope or in
the particular sub-trade) during the calendar quarter, divided by the total amount of cargo carried on all liner vessels
(in either the entire agreement scope or in the particular sub-trade) during the calendar quarter, which quotient
is multiplied by 100. The market shares held by non-agreement lines as well as
