<DOCTITLE>Request for nominations to three Advisory Committees serving the Klamath, Northwest Sacramento, and California
Coast Provinces</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for nominations of people to serve on one of three PIEC Advisory Committees for the Klamath, Northwest Sacramento,
or California Coast Provinces.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The interagency groups responsible for implementing the President's Forest Plan in the Klamath, Northwest Sacramento
and California Coast Provinces are forming three advisory committees to obtain advice and recommendations from
agencies and interested publics.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

There will be a total of 12 province advisory committees in northern California, Oregon and Washington working with
federal agencies to implement the President's Forest Plan on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest. ``These advisory
committees will help us work with the people as we move forward with ecosystem management,'' said Pacific Northwest
Regional Forester John Lowe who is coordinating the effort for national forests in northern California, Oregon and
Washington. ``These committees will supplement our regular public involvement efforts to help us make decisions
that serve people and care for the land. We're eager to begin the dialogue.''


Each advisory committee will provide advice to the respective Province Interagency Executive Committee (PIEC)
regarding implementation of a comprehensive ecosystem management strategy for federal lands within the province.
While boundaries of the provinces include whole river drainages for broad ecosystem planning, the purpose of the
advisory committees is to assist in implementing the President's Forest Plan, which is limited to federal lands within
the range of the northern spotted owl. Therefore, preference for positions on the committees will likely be to individuals,
agencies and groups most directly associated with those federal lands involved with the northern spotted owl. Map
for geographic boundaries of each province included in nomination packet information.
Each advisory committee will consist of no more than 29 members from the following entities.



State, local and tribal governments.
Public interest groups: to include representatives of environmental interests; different sectors of the forest
products industry; and the recreation and tourism sectors.



The committees may also include representatives of the following interests: fish, wildlife, forestry conservation
organizations, special forest products, mining, grazing, and commercial fishing or charter fishing boat industry.
All advisory committee meetings will be open to the public. Interested citizens may request time on the agenda to address
the committee. All papers and documents used by the committee, including meeting minutes, will be available to the
public.
Applicants must be United States citizens, at least 18 years old, and will be recommended for appointment based on
their personal knowledge of local and regional resource issues, and understanding of public land uses and activities;
willingness to work toward mutually beneficial solutions to complex issues; respect and credibility in local communities;
and commitment to attending advisory committee meetings held for the province.
Advisory committee members must be willing to travel to meetings held throughout the provinces. Members will serve
without pay, but reimbursement of travel and per diem is allowed for attendance at meetings called by the Chairperson
of the advisory committee.
Regional Forester John Lowe will consult with other agency leaders to decide who will be on the 12 province advisory
committees. The first meetings of the advisory committees will be held early in 1995 and the frequency thereafter
will be determined by each committee.
Advisory committee recommendations are not legally binding and will not supersede the legally established decision
authority granted to the federal agencies involved.

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Certificate of Interim Extension of the Term of U.S. Patent No. 4,066,772; Motilium</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Interim Patent Term Extension.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office has issued a certificate under 35 U.S.C.  156(d)(5) for a one-year interim extension
of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,066,772 that claims the human drug product known as Motilium.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 156 of Title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.



On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103-179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.

On November 18, 1994, the patent owner Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. filed an application under 35 U.S.C.  156(d)(5)
for interim extension of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,066,772. The application states that the patent claims the active
ingredient domperidone in the human drug product Motilium. The application indicates that the product is currently
undergoing a regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market or use the product
commercially. The original term of the patent is set to expire on January 3, 1995. Applicant requests an interim extension
of the term of the patent for a period of one year.

Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C.  156. Since it is apparent that the
regulatory review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the
patent term under 35 U.S.C.  156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C.  156(d)(5)
of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,066,772 has been granted for a period of one year from the original expiration date of
the patent.

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directive issued to you on January 14, 1983, as
amend, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. That directive directed you to prohibit
entry of certain cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products,

Effective on November 30, 1994, you are directed to permit entry of made-to-measure suits in Categories 443, 444,
643, 644, 843 and 844 which are visaed as merged Categories 443/643/843 and 444/644/844 or 443/643/843(1) and 444/644/844(1)
or the correct category corresponding to the actual shipment. Made-to-measure suits in Categories 443, 444, 643,
644, 843 and 844 may be visaed with or without the (1) suffix. Merchandise in Categories 443, 444, 643, 644, 843 and 844
which has been exported prior to November 30, 1994 shall not be denied entry if visaed without the (1) suffix.


Shipments entered or withdrawn from warehouse according to this directive which are not accompanied by an appropriate
export visa shall be denied entry and a new visa must be obtained.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign

SUMMARY:

 On Friday, October 7, 1994, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) published a notice inviting participation in Motor
Challenge Showcase Demonstration Projects (59 FR 51186). DOE is interested in obtaining proposals from industrial
electric motor system end users for projects that are intended to demonstrate and ``showcase'' electric motor system
energy efficiency, productivity, and environmental improvement in varied industrial or municipal facilities
and settings. Projects selected by DOE will become ``Showcase Demonstrations'' and are part of a larger, Federally-sponsored
(DOE) program that is an industry-driven collaborative effort called MOTOR CHALLENGE. The experiences and successful
results to be gained from the Showcase Demonstrations will be used to encourage other U.S. industrial companies with
similar applications to adopt efficient electric motor systems, and therefore, to increase the market penetration
of efficient electric motor systems on a widespread basis within the U.S. Todays notice announces an extension for
the submission of Motor Challenge Showcase Demonstration Project proposals.

Atul Shah; Denial of Hearing; Final Debarment Order



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denying Dr. Atul Shah's request for a hearing and is issuing a final order under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) permanently debarring Dr. Atul Shah, 20 Hampton Hollow Dr., Millstone
Township, NJ 08535, from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product
application. FDA bases this order on a finding that Dr. Shah was convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct
relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of a drug product, and
relating to the regulation of a drug product under the act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Background


Dr. Atul Shah, the former Director of Analytical Research and Development at Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Par), pled
guilty and was sentenced on March 5, 1993, for making a false declaration to a grand jury, a felony offense under 18 U.S.C.
1623. The basis for this conviction was Dr. Shah's false claim during his testimony before the Special Grand Jury for
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland that he could not remember that the pilot batch for one
of Par's generic drug products had been taken off accelerated stability testing and then put back on stability testing.
In fact, Dr. Shah did remember during this testimony that the initial pilot batch had failed accelerated stability
testing, and that a new formulation of that product had been put back on accelerated stability testing. This testimony
was material to the grand jury's investigation because Par had filed a false abbreviated new drug application that
failed to disclose that the pilot batch had failed stability testing.
In a certified letter received by Dr. Shah on August 11, 1993, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations offered Dr. Shah
an opportunity for a hearing on the agency's proposal to issue an order under section 306(a) of the act debarring Dr.
Shah from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application.
FDA based the proposal to debar Dr. Shah on its finding that he had been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct
relating to the development, approval, and regulation of Par's drug products. 
The certified letter also informed Dr. Shah that his request for a hearing could not rest upon mere allegations or denials
but must present specific facts showing that there was a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing.
The letter also notified Dr. Shah that if it conclusively appeared from the face of the information and factual analyses
in his request for a hearing that there was no genuine and substantial issue of fact which precluded the order of debarment,
FDA would enter summary judgment against him and deny his request for a hearing.
In a letter dated August 25, 1993, Dr. Shah requested a hearing, and in a letter dated October 8, 1993, Dr. Shah submitted
arguments and information in support of his hearing request. In his request for a hearing, Dr. Shah acknowledges that
he was convicted of a felony under Federal law as alleged by FDA. However, Dr. Shah argues that FDA's findings based
on that conviction are incorrect and that the agency's proposal to debar him is unconstitutional. The Interim Deputy
Commissioner for Operations has considered Dr. Shah's arguments and concludes that they are unpersuasive and fail
to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing. Moreover, the legal arguments that Dr. Shah offers
do not create a basis for a hearing (see 21 CFR 12.24(b)(1)). Dr. Shah's arguments are discussed below.


II. Dr. Shah's Arguments in Support of a Hearing


A. Mandatory Versus Permissive Debarment 


Dr. Shah first argues that mandatory debarment is inapplicable to his case. He states that his false testimony subjects
him to permissive rather than mandatory debarment because his conduct underlying his conviction does not relate
to the development, approval, or regulation of a drug product. Dr. Shah claims that his testimony ``pertained'' to
stability testing, but did not ``relate'' to stability testing.
This argument is unconvincing and fails to raise a genuine and substantial issue of fact. Section 306(a)(2)(A) of
the act (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(A)) requires debarment of an individual if FDA finds that the individual has been convicted
of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the development or approval, including the process for development
or approval, of any drug product. The statutory language, ``relating to the development or approval * * *,'' by definition,
encompasses all things that are logically connected with the development or approval of a drug product (see Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc., Springfield, MA, 1990, ``relate'').
Dr. Shah's act of falsely testifying before the grand jury concerning his knowledge about the stability testing used
to support approval of a Par drug product is clearly connected to the development or approval of a drug product. Stability
testing is an essential step in the development and approval of a generic drug product. 
Dr. Shah argues that he left Par long before his grand jury testimony and, thus, this testimony could not have interfered
with the drug development and approval process. Whether or not Dr. Shah was employed by Par at the time of his testimony
is irrelevant. Dr. Shah's testimony concerned, or was related to, FDA's approval of a Par drug product, because it
pertained to stability testing used to support approval of that drug product.
Section 306(a)(2)(B) of the act requires debarment of an individual if FDA finds that the individual has been convicted
of a felony under Federal law for conduct relating to the regulation of any drug product under the act. Dr. Shah's conviction
is related to the regulation of a drug product in that it concerns matters that affect FDA's regulatory decisions about
drug products. Dr. Shaw's testimony concerns information related to the stability of a drug product. FDA uses such
information to determine, among other things, whether to approve a drug, whether to remove a drug from the market,
whether labeling changes are necessary, and whether approved marketing conditions need to be altered. The act does
not require that Dr. Shah's testimony regarding stability testing directly affect FDA's regulatory decisions.
Rather, it 

need

 only relate to FDA's regulation of a drug product. 
Dr. Shah contends that grand jury investigations have nothing to do with the development and approval of a drug product.
He additionally states that the grand jury process is not a means by which FDA regulates a company's drug products.
To the contrary, FDA often requests grand jury investigations to explore criminal activity involving matters under
the jurisdiction of FDA. Dr. Shah's crime of lying before a grand jury relates to FDA's regulatory powers because it
interferes with the inquiry into criminal activity concerning drug applications. Because his false declarations
concerned matters relating to the development, approval, and regulation of a drug product, Dr. Shah's mandatory
debarment is appropriate.
Dr. Shah also argues that the legislative history of the act indicates that mandatory debarment is inapplicable in
this case because his crime did not ``corrupt'' or ``directly involve'' the approval process. As mentioned above,
Dr. Shah's crime is one that does corrupt or perpetuate corruption of the FDA approval process because it interfered
with an investigation into criminal activity concerning information used by FDA in deciding drug approval and other
drug regulatory issues. Whether the crime ``directly involves'' the approval process is not the standard set forth
in the statute for mandatory debarment; ``directly involves'' does not have the same meaning as ``relates to.'' 


B. The Ex Post Facto Clause 


Dr. Shah also argues that the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits application of section 306(a)(2)
of the act to him because this section was not in effect at the time of Dr. Shah's criminal conduct. With the enactment
of the Generic Drug Enforcement Act (GDEA) on May 13, 1992, Congress amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
to include section 306(a)(2).
An ex post facto law is one that reaches back to punish acts that occurred before enactment of the law or that adds a new
punishment to one that was in effect when the crime was committed. (

Ex Parte Garland

, 4 Wall. 333, 377, 18 L. Ed. 366 (1866); 

Collins

 v. 

Youngblood

, 110 S.Ct. 2715 (1990).)
Dr. Shah's claim that application of the mandatory debarment provisions of the act is prohibited by the ex post facto
clause is unpersuasive. Because the intent behind debarment under section 306(a)(2) of the act is remedial rather
than punitive, this section does not violate the ex post facto clause.
The congressional intent with respect to actions under section 306(a)(2) of the act is clearly remedial. Congress
created the GDEA in response to findings of fraud and corruption in the generic drug industry. Both the language of
the GDEA itself and its legislative history reveal that the purpose of the debarment provisions set forth in the GDEA
is ``to restore and ensure the integrity of the ANDA approval process and to protect the public health.'' (See section
1, Pub. L. 102-282, The Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992.) This is a remedial rather than punitive goal. (See


Manocchio

 v. 

Kusserow

, 961 F.2d 1539, 1542 (11th Cir. 1992) (exclusion of physician from participation in medicare programs because of
criminal conviction is remedial, not punitive).) Supporting the remedial character of debarment is a statement
by Senator Hatch in the Congressional Record of 
April 10, 1992, at S 5616, ``* * * [t]he legislation * * * provides a much-needed remedy for the blatant fraud and corruption
uncovered in the generic drug industry * * * during the last 3 years.''
The Supreme Court has long held that statutes that deny future privileges to convicted offenders because of their
previous criminal activities in order to insure against corruption in specified areas do not impose penalties for
past conduct and, therefore, do not violate the ex post facto prohibitions. (See, e.g., 

Hawker

 v. 

New York

, 170 U.S. 189, 190 (1898) (physician barred from practicing medicine for a prior felony conviction); 

DeVeau

 v. 

Braisted

, 373 U.S. 154 (1960) (convicted felon's exclusion from employment as officer of waterfront union is not a violation
of the ex post facto clause).) 
In 

DeVeau

, the court upheld a law that prohibited a convicted felon from employment as an officer in a waterfront union. The purpose
of the law was to remedy the past corruption and to insure against future corruption in the waterfront unions. The court
in 

DeVeau

, 363 U.S. at 160, stated:



The question in each case where unpleasant consequences are brought to bear upon an individual for prior conduct,
is whether the legislative aim was to punish that individual for past activity, or whether the restriction of the individual
comes about as a relevant incident to a regulation of a present situation, such as the proper qualifications for a profession
* * * .

 

As in 

DeVeau

, the legislative purpose of the relevant statute is to ensure that fraud and corruption are eliminated from the drug
industry. The restrictions placed on individuals convicted of a felony under Federal law are not intended as punishment
but are ``incident to a regulation of a present situation'' (

DeVeau

, 363 U.S. at 160) and necessary in order to remedy the past fraud and corruption in the industry.


C. The Double Jeopardy Clause


In another argument, Dr. Shah claims that the proposal to debar him under section 306(a)(2) of the act violates the
double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The double jeopardy clause states that no
person shall ``be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.'' Dr. Shah relies on 

U.S.

 v. 

Halper

, 490 U.S. 435 (1989), to argue that the Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause should prevent his debarment because
``jeopardy'' can attach even in a purely civil proceeding, so long as the civil sanction is punitive, not remedial.
He further argues that his proposed permanent debarment is punitive because (1) it is permanent and without regard
to whether Dr. Shah represents a continuing threat to the integrity of the drug testing, approval, or regulatory processes;
(2) it precludes his providing services in any capacity to a company whose products are subject to FDA approval, regardless
of whether or not the service relates to drug testing, approval, or regulation; (3) it can be terminated only for substantial
assistance to prosecutors and not when the threat to public safety is eliminated; and (4) it arises out of the mere fact
of conviction and precludes factfinding into whether a risk to the public exists.
Dr. Shah's arguments are unpersuasive. First, ``jeopardy'' cannot attach because the effect of section 306(a)(2)
of the act is remedial, not punitive. As discussed above, the legislative goal of this section is to restore and ensure
the integrity of the drug approval process and to protect the public health by eradicating fraud and corruption from
the drug industry. This is plainly a remedial rather than punitive goal. (

Manocchio

 v. 

Kusserow

, 961 F.2d at 1542.) 
The fact that Dr. Shah's debarment is permanent rather than temporary does not signify that the legislation is nonremedial
or punitive. The Supreme Court has upheld laws which, for remedial purposes, permanently bar a class or group of individuals
from certain occupations due to a prior criminal conviction. (See 

Hawker

 v. 

New York

, 170 U.S. 189, 190 (1898); 

DeVeau

 v. 

Braisted

, 373 U.S. 154 (1960).) Additionally, these cases support the fact that Dr. Shah's debarment can arise only because
of his conviction, which Dr. Shah argues is punitive.
Dr. Shah's conduct, which has been shown to relate to the development, approval, and regulation of a drug product,
establishes the potential for future violations by Dr. Shah that undermine the integrity of the drug approval and
regulatory process. The act precludes Dr. Shah's providing any type of service to holders of drug product applications
because of this possibility of future violations. Congress proscribed all services in order to avoid the serious
administrative difficulties involved in distinguishing between those positions clearly related to drug regulation
from those not clearly related. Such a proscription for this reason is permissible. 

Siegel

 v. 

Lyng

, 851 F.2d 412, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1988.)
Dr. Shah's assertion that the special termination provision is punitive is unpersuasive. In fact, the provision
advances the remedial objective of ensuring the safety and efficacy of the country's drug supply. The cooperation
fostered by this special termination provision enables FDA to eliminate from the drug industry many actors who are
corrupting the industry, endangering the public health, and destroying consumers' confidence in the Nation's drug
supply. Convictions based on debarred persons' assistance can form the basis for other debarments if the terms of
the act are satisfied, which further serves the act's remedial objectives.
An individual's debarment will not be terminated if FDA finds that the remedial intent of the act will be undermined
by such termination. The act does not guarantee termination of debarment to those who are debarred. The power to terminate
debarment is discretionary with FDA, and the agency is bound by the provision's terms to exercise this authority in
a manner consistent with the interest of justice and protection of the integrity of the drug approval process (21 U.S.C.
335a(d)(4)(D)).
Due to the potentially serious consequences to the public health of fraud and corruption in the drug industry, the
permanent debarment of convicted felons like Dr. Shah is not an excessive means to eliminate fraud from the industry.
The legislative history of the GDEA is replete with statements, some cited above, that the act provides a reasonable
means of ridding the drug industry of widespread corruption and to restore consumer confidence in generic drugs.


D. Due Process


In his final argument, Dr. Shah claims that his debarment violates the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution
because it bears no rational relationship to any legitimate purpose. He asserts that his conduct does not automatically
demonstrate a likelihood of future violations under the act. He also contends that debarment precludes providing
services regardless of whether such service bears any relationship to the development, approval, or regulation
of a drug product.
Dr. Shah's claims are unpersuasive. Dr. Shah fails to demonstrate that this debarment is unrelated to any legitimate
purpose. Although his conduct does not automatically establish a likelihood of future violations, it does reveal
the possibility of future violations. Debarment guards against future violations by prohibiting individuals ``from
providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application'' in order
to meet the legitimate regulatory purpose of restoring the integrity of the drug approval and regulatory process
and protecting the public health. Dr. Shah acknowledges that protecting the public health is a legitimate purpose.
As mentioned above, Congress can appropriately achieve this purpose by proscribing ``all services'' due to the serious
administrative difficulties involved in distinguishing between those positions clearly related to drug regulation
from those not clearly related. These difficulties would include the problem of ascertaining the exact nature of
the employee's relationship with the employer as well as defining what constitutes a sufficient nexus with the regulatory
scheme under all circumstances. 
Dr. Shah's claim that FDA's refusal to grant a hearing in his case would violate procedural due process is inaccurate.
Dr. Shah acknowledges that he was convicted as alleged by FDA and has raised no genuine and substantial issue of fact
regarding his conviction. The facts underlying Dr. Shah's conviction have been established by his conviction, and,
therefore, are not at issue. While Dr. Shah's legal arguments do not create a basis for a hearing, FDA has considered
these arguments before taking final action and has found them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the Interim Deputy Commissioner
for Operations denies Dr. Shah's request for a hearing.


III. Findings and Order


Therefore, the Interim Deputy Commissioner for Operations, under section 306(a) of the act, and under authority
delegated to her (21 CFR 5.20) finds that Dr. Atul Shah has been convicted of a felony under Federal law for conduct:
(1) relating to the development or approval, including the process for development or approval, of a drug product
(21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(A)); and (2) relating to the regulation of a drug product (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)(2)(B)).
As a result of the foregoing findings, Dr. Atul Shah is permanently debarred from providing services in any capacity
to a person with an approved or pending drug product application under section 505, 507, 512, or 802 of the act (21 U.S.C.
355, 357, 360b, or 382), or under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), effective December 5,
1994. (21 U.S.C. 335a(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2)(A)(ii) and 21 U.S.C. 321(ee)). 
Any person with an approved or pending drug product application who knowingly uses the services of Dr. Shah in any capacity,
during his period of debarment, will be subject to civil money penalties (21 U.S.C. 335b(a)(6)). If Dr. Shah, during
his period of debarment, provides services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending drug product application,
he will be subject to civil money penalties (21 U.S.C. 335b(a)(7)). In addition, FDA will not accept or review any abbreviated
new drug application or abbreviated antibiotic drug application submitted by or with Dr. Shah's assistance during
his period of debarment.
Dr. Shah may file an application to attempt to terminate his debarment pursuant to section 306(d)(4)(A) of the act.
Any such application would be reviewed under the criteria and processes set forth in section 306(d)(4)(C) and (d)(4)(D)
of the act. Such an application should be identified with Docket No. 93N-0252 and sent to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). All such submissions are to be filed in four copies. The public availability of information
in these submissions is governed by 21 CFR 10.20(j). Publicly available submissions may be seen in the Dockets Management
Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resource and Services Administration is 
announcing the availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for a 
limited competition for Community Integrated Service Systems 
(CISS) Home Visiting for At-Risk Families (HVAF) grants. The 
purpose of the CISS/HVAF is to assist State Maternal and Child 
Health (MCH) programs to support development and expansion of 
successful community integrated service strategies. Projects 
funded under this initiative are expected to emphasize the 
home visiting model as an important component of care. The 
CISS/HVAF grants will be used to support the development of 
enhanced health components in States' Administration for 
Children and Families' (ACF) Five-Year State Plans for Family Preservation and Family Support (FP/FS) Services.
These Five-Year Plans, being developed under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, are part of the Family Preservation
and Family 
Support (FP/FS) Services programs authorized under the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66). The 
CISS/HVAF grants will complement planning activities supported 
by the HRSA and the ACF to promote State efforts to develop 
comprehensive systems of services which meet both the health 
and welfare needs of families. Awards will be made under the 
program authority of section 502(b)(1)(A) of the Social 
Security Act, the Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
Grant CISS Set-Aside Program. 


Competition is limited to the eleven States and jurisdictions 
currently without CISS/HVAF grants. In FY 1994, 50 of the 56 
eligible States and Jurisdictions applied for CISS/HVAF grants 
and 45 were funded. With this notice, HRSA is offering the 
remainder the opportunity to participate in this initiative. 
They constitute the universe of remaining eligible applicants 
that were either disapproved last year or did not apply. The 
eleven States and jurisdictions are: New Jersey; Virgin 
Islands; West Virginia; Tennessee; Mississippi; North 
Carolina; Texas; California; American Samoa; Guam; and the 
Northern Mariana Islands. 


Grants/Amounts:

 Up to $550,000 will be available to support 
up to eleven new projects in an amount up to $50,000 per award 
for the project period. Project periods are for nine months, 
beginning January 1, 1995. 


Eligibility:

 Eligibility for funding is limited to a single 
application from each of eleven specified States and 
Jurisdictions which has been approved to receive FY 1994 
funding under Title IV-B, Subpart 2 of the Social Security 
Act: Family Preservation and Support Services, and which has 
not been approved to receive funds under the CISS/HVAF grant 
program. State Title V/Title IV-B agency partnerships are 
especially encouraged, with State Child Welfare and Maternal 
and Child Health agencies acting either as co-applicants or 
collaborating in the identification of the applicant. The 
application must be jointly developed and the project must be 
jointly implemented by both programs.

A novel method has been developed to quickly evaluate and 
screen potential anti-cancer and anti-viral drugs in vivo. The 
desire for effective treatments for tumors and viral infections 
has created a need in the research and medical communities for a 
quick, reliable way to test chemotherapeutic agents. Although 
several teams of investigators have attempted in recent years to 
develop in vivo methods for screening such drugs, these methods 
have had limited value because they usually permit only the agent 
to be tested against one type of tumor cell or cell line per 
experiment and/or have been labor intensive and expensive. This 
new method for screening chemotherapeutic agents involves 
encapsulating the target (i.e., tumor) cells in a biocompatible, 
semipermeable membrane_which is made of unique hollow fibers 
or dialysis tubing_and transplanting the encapsulated cells 
into a laboratory animal. Each laboratory animal can receive an 
implant at a single site or multiple sites, making it possible to 
test a chemotherapeutic agent against several types of tumor 
cells simultaneously. The membrane, which does not generate an 
autoimmune response or release any toxic chemicals, allows for 
the target cells to be reharvested after the treatment. 


Sensitive Method For Locating Chromosomal Breakpoints 


Magrath, I.T., Shiramizu, B. (NCI) 
Filed 2 Dec 93 
Serial No. 08/160,547 (CON of 07/698,233, CON of 07/441,516)



A new technique for localizing chromosomal breakpoints 
offers a significant advancement in detecting genetic 
translocations such as those found in Burkitt's lymphoma. Present 
techniques for detecting chromosomal breakpoints require large 
amounts of tumor sample, are often insensitive, or are cumbersome 
and time consuming. This new technique utilizes sequence-specific 
primers for rapid, efficient PCR amplification of a fragment 
containing a breakpoint. This technique is so sensitive it can be 
used to sub-divide Burkitt's lymphomas into subtypes based on the 
location of chromosomal breakpoints. 


Method For Estimating mRNA Content By Filter Hybridization To A 
Polythymidylate Probe 


Hollander, M.C., Fornace, A.J. (NCI) 
Filed 21 Feb 94 
Serial No. 08/183,911 (CON of 07/908,814, CON of 07/501,774) 



A method for the quantitation of relative mRNA samples which 
entails hybridization of a polythymidylate (polyT) probe with RNA 
bound to an insoluble substrate. This method is especially 
applicable for normalizing numerous RNA samples which are to be 
analyzed by dot blot hybridization. The relative hybridization of 
polyT probe to RNA is proportional to the polyA RNA content of 
the RNA samples. Since the hybridization of polyT probe to RNA 
does not appear to be dependent on any cell treatment or growth 
condition and experimental variation is minimized, this method is 
a better method for standardizing the amount of mRNA in RNA 
samples than is relative hybridization to cDNA probes such as 
actin or 

b

2

-microglobulin, the transcript levels of which may 
vary according to cell treatment.

Sphingoid Bases And Methods For Their Preparation And Use 


Boumendjel, A., Miller, S.P.F. (NINDS) 
Filed 14 Feb 94 
Serial No. 08/195,815 




This is a new method for synthesizing a group of novel analogs of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) that
offer improved methods of studying cell growth as well as other cell regulatory processes. Sphingolipids compromise
a large class of biologically significant compounds, some of which act upon enzymes that control cell growth or have
potent mitogen activity. Previously, it has been difficult to study this class of compounds because there was no economically
feasible method of producing large-scale amounts; however, a method has been developed for synthesizing S-1-P
and other related analogs with greater yields and quantities in a shorter period of time compared to previous methods,
allowing for large-scale production of these compounds at much lower costs. 


A Novel Chaperone Protein 


Kaye, F.J., Otterson, G.A. (NCI) 
Filed 28 Feb 94 
Serial No. 08/203,905 




The gene sequences for the rat and human Stch chaperone protein, which belongs to the heat shock protein (HSP) family,
have been isolated and characterized. HSP products have been localized to specific cellular fractions, such as cytosol,
nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, and recent experimental models have implicated these ``chaperones''
in facilitating protein transport across these specialized compartments. The Stch protein has significant differences
from previously identified heat shock proteins and is expressed in tumor origin cells. These novel gene sequences
and probes derived from the gene sequences are useful for quantitating the amount of Stch gene transcript in tissues,
and antibodies are useful for detecting the presence of protein in cells. 


Genes Coding For Melanoma Tumor Antigens 


Kawakami, Y., Rosenberg, S.A. (NCI) 
Filed 22 Apr 94 
Serial No. 08/231,565 




Genes have been isolated that code for melanoma tumor antigens, which may provide an important new method for the prevention
or treatment of this deadly form of cancer. Melanomas are aggressive, frequently metastatic tumors, and even when
the melanoma is apparently localized to the skin, up to 30 percent of patients eventually will have the tumor spread
to other organs and tissues of the body. The majority of these individuals will die. Recent studies have shown that
many melanoma patients mount cellular and humoral responses against these tumors and that melanomas express both
MHC antigens and tumor-associated antigens. These newly discovered melanoma antigen genes may be used in gene therapy
protocols, or peptides derived from the gene product may be used in vaccines to help the recipient mount a T-cell-mediated
immune response against the melanoma.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Report of Revised System of Records</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revision to a system of records.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11)), we are issuing public notice of our intent to revise the
description of a system of records entitled ``Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System'' (HHS/SSA/OSR,
09-60-0059) (last published at 58 FR 48525, September 16, 1993).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Discussion of Proposed Revision


We are adding information to the description of the system of records to indicate that it includes information about
individuals affected by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, and that the information is obtained
from the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) Combined Benefit Fund. We are also revising two routine use statements.
To comply with the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776), we published
new routine uses to this system of records on September 16, 1993 (at 58 FR 48525). At that time we did not believe that
any further change to the system was necessary. However, as the Social Security Administration (SSA) has gained some
experience with developing cases in connection with this law, we have found that we need to revise our description
of the records which are included in the system and to make other changes in the system's notice.
We therefore propose to add the following phrase to the paragraph entitled ``Categories of individuals covered by
the system'': ``any person affected by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.''
We propose to add the following phrase to the paragraph entitled ``Categories of records in the system'': ``information
about miners and their families needed to administer the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.''
We propose to add the following to the list of ``Purposes'': ``To make assignments of responsibility for paying premiums
and to perform other functions under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992.''
We propose to expand the explanation of information which may be disclosed to the coal industry assigned operator
(in Routine Use 

#

29) to include: ``work history and other detailed information as to the basis for the assignment of that individual.''
We propose to add the following phrase to the paragraph entitled ``Record source categories'': ``the United Mine
Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund.''
We are proposing the changes to Routine Use 

#

29 in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7), (b)(3), and (e)(11)) and our disclosure regulation (20
CFR part 401).
The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information about individuals without their consents for a routine use, i.e.,
where the information will be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which we collected the information.
The disclosure of information on individuals obtained from the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund to the coal industry operators
to whom they were assigned under 26 U.S.C. 9706, as described in Routine Use 

#

29, for use by those operators in pursuing their remedies regarding those assignments, is required by statute, 26
U.S.C. 9706(f). Thus, we believe that this disclosure meets the compatibility criterion discussed above because
it serves the purposes for which it was collected and because it is required by law.
The proposed changes will make it clear that the earnings record system now includes information which SSA has received
from the UMWA Combined Benefit Fund regarding miners and their families who are affected by the Coal Industry Retiree
Health Benefit Act of 1992, and that this information will be used and disclosed for the purpose of performing those
functions assigned to us under that statute.
We are also making a minor wording change to Routine Use 

#

13 so that the language will be consistent with the routine use statements in systems notices of other SSA systems of
records which deal with disclosure to the Department of Justice.


II. Effect of the Proposed Changes on Individual Rights


The proposed changes will:



 Add another category of individuals and category of records covered by this system of records,
 Clarify the kind of information which SSA maintains and the routine use statement on disclosures of this information,
and
 Show the sources from which the information is obtained.



The proposed changes will have no unwarranted effect on individual's rights.

Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing and disposing of records in the system:

Storage:



Records in this system are maintained as paper forms, correspondence in manila folders on open shelving, paper lists,
punchcards, microfilm, magnetic tapes, and discs with online access files.



Retrievability:



Records in this system are indexed by SSN, name, and employer identification number.

safeguards:


Safeguards for automated records have been established in accordance with the HHS Information Resources Management
Manual, Part 6, Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook. This includes maintaining the magnetic
tapes and discs within an enclosure attended by security guards. Anyone entering or leaving this enclosure must have
a special badge issued only to authorized personnel.
For computerized records electronically transmitted between Central Office and field office locations (including
organizations administering SSA programs under contractual agreements, safeguards include a lock/unlock password
system, exclusive use of leased telephone lines, a terminal-oriented transaction matrix, and an audit trail. All
microfilm and paper files are accessible only by authorized personnel who have a need for the information in the performance
of their official duties.
Expansion and improvement of SSA's telecommunications systems has resulted in the acquisition of terminals equipped
with physical key locks. The terminals also are fitted with adapters to permit the future installation of data encryption
devices and devices to permit the identification of terminal users.


retention and disposal:


All paper forms and cards are retained until they are filmed or are entered on tape and their accuracy is verified. Then
they are destroyed by shredding. All tapes, discs, and microfilm files are updated periodically. The out-of-date
magnetic tapes and discs are erased. The out-of-date microfilm is shredded.
SSA retains correspondence for 1 year when it concerns documents returned to an individual, denials of confidential
information, release of confidential information to an authorized third party and undeliverable material, for
4 years when it concerns information and evidence pertaining to coverage, wage, and self-employment determinations
or when the statute of limitations is involved, and permanently when it affects future claims development, especially
coverage, wage, and self-employment determinations. Correspondence is destroyed, when appropriate, by shredding.


system manager(s) and address:


Director, Office of Pre-Claims Requirements, Office of Systems Requirements, Social Security Administration,
6401 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, MD 21235.


notification procedure:


An individual can determine if this system contains a record pertaining to him/her by providing his/her name, signature
and SSN or, if the SSN is not known, name, signature, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name and father's name
to the address shown under system manager and by referring to this system. (Furnishing the SSN is voluntary, but it
will make searching for an individuals's record easier and prevent delay.)
An individual requesting notification of records in person need not furnish any special documents of identity. Documents
he/she would normally carry on his/her person would be sufficient (e.g., credit cards, driver's license, or voter
registration card). An individual requesting notification via mail or telephone must furnish a minimum of his/her
name, date of birth, and address in order to establish identity, plus any additional information specified in this
section. These procedures are in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR part 5b.


record access procedures:


Same as notification procedures. Also, requesters should reasonably specify the record contents they are seeking.
These procedures are in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR part 5b.


contesting record procedures:

<DOCTITLE>Current List of Laboratories Which Meet Minimum Standards To Engage in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies and
Laboratories That Have Withdrawn From the Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, HHS (Formerly: National Institute on Drug Abuse, ADAMHA,
HHS).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (59 FR 29916, 29925).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 



If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Pub. L. 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Urine
Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct urine
drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of performance
testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in a quarterly
performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 



Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum
requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS
(formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 

In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

Consolidated Rail Corporation, Trackage Rights Exemption, CSX Transportation, Inc. 


CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), has agreed to grant overhead trackage rights to Consolidated Rail Corporation
(Conrail) on a portion of its Indiana Subdivision in Indiana and Jefferson Counties, PA, from its connection with
the Ridge Subdivision at Ridge Branch Junction (milepost 26.6) near Creekside to a connection to be established at
a point to be mutually agreed upon between milepost 41.5 and milepost 44.7 near Josephine. The trackage rights agreement
provides for a 30-year term and a 30-year renewal option and is limited to the movement of limestone, limestone substitutes,
ammonia, rail materials, transformers, and coal terminating at the Keystone Generating Station (Keystone) at Shelocta,
PA. 
The trackage rights qualify under the class exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7) and ordinarily would have
become effective 50 days after filing. However, they are related to two other transactions that applicants simultane-ously
seek approval for as one integral transaction.

1

 Accordingly, at applicants' request all three proceedings were considered together and the effective date of this
notice of exemption necessarily was delayed. This notice of exemption will become effective on December 5, 1994,
as will the related decision in Finance Docket No. 32544 and the related notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32544
(Sub-No. 2). 





This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption
is void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: John J. Paylor,
2001 Market Street_16A, Philadelphia, PA 19101-1416. 
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected
under 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 

354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in 

Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 

360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 



Decided: November 23, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>CSX Transportation, Inc.; Trackage Rights Exemption; Consolidated Rail Corporation </DOCTITLE>


Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) has agreed to grant back to CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), trackage rights
in Indiana and Jefferson Counties, PA, over the portions of the Indiana and Ridge Subdivisions that it is acquiring
and leasing for a coextensive period of time. The trackage rights on the Indiana Subdivision are overhead. The trackage
rights on the Ridge Subdivision are both overhead and local, but the local trackage rights are restricted to limestone,
limestone substitutes, ammonia, transformers and coal terminating at the Keystone Generating Station at Shelocta,
PA. The limestone and coal transportation will be further restricted to commodities originating at quarries or mines
served by CSXT or short line railroads connecting solely with CSXT, or originating or transloading on The Three Rivers
Railway, Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc. (B&PR), Allegheny Railroad, Beech Mountain Railroad, West
Virginia Northern Railroad, Elk River Railroad, or Strouds Creek & Muddlety Railroad. No traffic originating
on lines owned or leased by Conrail may be transported by CSXT in local service under these trackage rights. The overhead
trackage rights are restricted to movements to the portion of the Ridge Subdivision between Shelocta and Clarksburg
and will terminate if CSXT abandons that portion of track. 
The trackage rights qualify under the class exemption procedures of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7), and ordinarily would have
become effective 50 days after filing. However, they are related to two other transactions that applicants simult-aneously

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Northern States Power Company; Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2 Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-42 and DPR-60, issued to Northern States Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Goodhue County, Minnesota.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



By letter dated May 2, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.1, to
the extent that it requires that one train of systems needed for hot shutdown be free of fire damage. Specifically,
the licensee requested an exemption from the Section III.G.1 requirement for performing proposed hot shutdown repairs
which will allow the licensee to remove fuses from the power operated relief valves (PORV) control circuit as a means
of ensuring the reactor coolant system (RCS) inventory in the event of a control room fire.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The licensee has stated that satisfying Appendix R criteria in this circumstance would require plant hardware modifications;
for example, installation of switches outside of the control room to de-energize the circuit in this scenario. The
licensee states that the current operator actions provide an adequate substitute response, and that expending the
resources to perform the hardware changes are not justified. Therefore, the licensee requests an exemption from
the Appendix R criteria in order to allow removal of the fuses in the power operated relief valve (PORV) control circuit
as a means of ensuring that proper reactor coolant system inventory is maintained.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and determined that the granting of this exemption
will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety. The licensee's proposal to isolate the PORVs by removing
the subject control circuit fuses provides reasonable assurance that safe shutdown can be achieved in the event of
a control room fire. Furthermore, the modifications required to meet 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.G.1 would
not enhance fire protection safety levels above that currently provided by the licensee. Therefore, post-accident
radiological releases are not expected to exceed previously determined values as a result of the proposed action.
Further, the exemption is not expected to have an impact on plant radiological effluent releases.

The change will not increase the probability or consequences of any accidents, no changes are being made in the types
of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or
cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00039 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption involves features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result
in unjustified cost to the licensee.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resource not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant dated May 1973.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with the Minnesota State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated May 2, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Minneapolis Public Library, Technology and Science Department,
300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401.

<DOCTITLE>Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-6 issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. for operation of Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2 (ANO-2)
located in Pope County, Arkansas. 
The proposed amendment would delete requirements to perform the full complement of steam generator surveillances
as outlined in the Technical Specifications (TSs) when the steam generators are subjected to special inspections
that are in addition to inspections that are required by the TSs. 
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
Criterion 1_Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated. 
This change has no actual impact on any previously analyzed accident in the final safety analysis report (FSAR). A
double-ended break of one steam generator tube is postulated as part of the ANO-2 design basis accident evaluation.
The change permits Entergy Operations to determine the appropriate scope and expansion criteria for special steam
generator tube inspections that are beyond the scope of the augmented inservice inspection program included in the
TSs. The augmented inservice inspection program contained in the TSs is not being modified. 
General Design Criterion 14 of Appendix A of 10 CFR 50 states: ``The reactor coolant pressure boundary shall be * * *
tested so as to have an extremely low probability of abnormal leakage, of rapidly propagating failure, and of gross
rupture.'' The proper scope and expansion criteria for special steam generator tube inspections are determined
such that the requirement of the general design criterion will be met. Additionally, special inspections utilize
calculations of minimum acceptable wall thickness per the guidance of Regulatory Guide 1.121, ``Basis for Plugging
Degraded Steam Generator Tubes.'' 
This change does not modify any parameter that will increase radioactivity in the primary system or increase the amount
of radioactive steam released from the secondary safety valves or atmospheric dump valves in the event of a tube rupture.

The administrative corrections made to correct inconsistencies introduced in previous TS amendments do not affect
reactor operations or accident analyses and have no radiological consequences. 
Therefore, this change does 

not

 involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 
Criterion 2_Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident From Any Previously Evaluated.

The scope of this change does not establish a potential new accident precursor. The design basis accident analyses
for ANO-2 include the consequences of a double-ended break of one steam generator tube which bounds other postulated
failure mechanisms. The proposed change would permit determination of alternate inspection criteria for special
inspections which are in addition to the inservice inspections required by the TSs. The equipment used in special
inspections would not affect any plant components differently than those used for TS required inspections. 
The corrections made to remove inconsistencies introduced in previous TS amendments are administrative and do not
change the design, configuration, or method of operation of the plant. 
Therefore, this change does 

not

 create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
Criterion 3_Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety. 
As previously stated, a double-ended rupture of one steam generator tube is accounted for in the ANO-2 design
basis accident analysis. Safety margins to detect and repair tube defects prior to rupture are reflected by the 0.5
GPM primary to secondary leakage limit stated in the ANO-2 TSs and the minimum acceptable wall thickness criteria
included in Regulatory Guide 1.121. As stated in the ANO-2 TS Bases, cracks having a primary to secondary leakage
less than the 0.5 GPM limit during operation will have an adequate margin of safety to withstand the loads imposed during
normal operation and by postulated accidents. Considering that special inspections are in addition to the inservice
inspection program defined in the ANO-2 TSs, that the scope of special inspections are determined taking into
consideration General Design Criteria 14, and that leakage detection capability is not being modified, the exemption
of special inspections from the requirements of the augmented inservice inspection program does not significantly
reduce the margin of safety. 
The other administrative changes do not reduce TS operability and surveillance requirements, and, therefore, do
not reduce any margin of safety. 
Therefore, this change does 

not

 involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW, Washington, DC.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By January 4, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Tomlinson Library, Arkansas Tech University, Russellville,
Arkansas 72801. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Mr. William D. Beckner: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition

Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The IRA is a self-directed IRA described in section 408(a) of the Code. Arkansas Trust Management, Inc. of Fayettevillle,
Arkansas, is the custodian of the IRA. As of September 6, 1994, the IRA had approximately $169,150 in total assets.

2. On April 20, 1993, the IRA purchased the Interest, which consists of an overriding royalty interest of one-quarter
of one percent of 8/8ths of all oil and gas produced from Block Q/13(a), a proposed offshore oil and gas drilling operation
to be located on property near the Netherlands. The IRA purchased the Interest from the Van Dyke Energy Company (VDE)
for a consideration of $95,000. VDE is unrelated to Mr. Jansson and the IRA. Mr. Jansson, who had worked for over 25 years
in the field of oil and gas drilling management, had determined that the Interest was a suitable investment for his
IRA. 
3. At the time the Interest was purchased by the IRA, the parties were unaware that the Dutch government would impose
a 35% foreign income tax on the oil and gas proceeds produced by the Interest (the Foreign Tax). The parties learned
of the Foreign Tax after the Interest was acquired when VDE announced it had been advised by the Dutch government that
any proceeds from the asset were subject to Dutch income tax and the Foreign Tax would be withheld from the proceeds
before payments to the IRA. In addition, Mr. Jansson has determined that he wishes to invest the IRA's assets in a more
liquid and less speculative investment. Accordingly, he proposes to purchase the Interest from the IRA for cash at
its appraised fair market value. No commissions or other expenses will be paid by the IRA in connection with the sale.

4. Mr. John R. Gorman, financial consultant for VDE, has stated that as of August 22, 1994, no development plan has been
filed for Block Q/13(a), nor has there been any oil or gas production on the Block. Accordingly, Mr. Gorman has appraised
the Interest as still having a fair market value of $95,000 as of August 22, 1994. 
5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria contained in section
4975(c)(2) of the Code because: a) the sale is a one-time transaction for cash; b) the IRA will pay no commissions or
other expenses in connection with the sale; c) the sales price has been determined by a qualified, independent appraiser;
and d) Mr. Jansson is the only participant in the IRA, and he has determined that the transaction is appropriate for
and in the best interest of the IRA and desires that the transaction be consummated.

 

notice to interested persons: 

Because Mr. Jansson is the only participant in the IRA, it has been determined that there is no need to distribute the
notice of proposed exemption to interested persons. Comments and requests for a hearing are due 30 days after publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act because: 



(a) all terms of the transactions will be no less favorable to the Plan than those which the Plan could obtain in an arm's-length
transaction with an unrelated party; 



(b) no interest and/or expenses will be paid by the Plan; 



(c) the Loan will be no less than the accumulated book value of the GIC as of August 12, 1994; 



(d) the Repayments are restricted to the GIC Proceeds; 



(e) the Repayments will not exceed the total amount of the Loan; and 



(f) the Repayments are waived to the extent the Loan exceeds the GIC Proceeds.

4. The annual rental for the Property has been established by an independent appraisal performed by Messrs. Kenneth
Golub, MAI, and Harvey Cohen (the Appraisers) of American Property Counselors of Armonk, New York, as of April 30,
1994. The Appraisers have also determined that the Property had a fair market value of $565,000 as of that date. The
applicant represents that the Property will be personally inspected every year by a qualified, independent appraiser
chosen by the Plan's independent fiduciary (see rep. 5, below) who will provide the Plan with an annual fair market
rental value update. The applicant represents that the rental payment will be adjusted annually in accordance with
the fair market rental value stated by the independent appraiser. The adjusted rent will either stay the same or be
adjusted upward, but will never be decreased from the prior year's rent paid. 

5. The applicant represents that Mr. Joseph J. Berger of Joseph J. Berger Management Associates in White Plains, New
York, has been appointed to serve as the Plan's independent fiduciary with respect to the subject transactions. Mr.
Berger represents that he has been a CPA for over 35 years, and that he is knowledgeable in the area of real estate and
experienced in working with qualified retirement plans. The applicant represents that Mr. Berger has no relationship
to the Plan or the Employer other than serving as the independent fiduciary to the Plan.

3

 Mr. Berger represents that he is aware of his duties, liabilities and responsibilities as a fiduciary under the Act,
and he has accepted them. 





6. Mr. Berger represents that he has undertaken the following duties as independent fiduciary to the Plan with respect
to the Lease: 

(a) to review the Plan's proposed purchase of the Property, and in that connection to determine whether the purchase
will be at fair market value as determined by an independent real estate appraiser and based upon arm's-length negotiations,
and whether the purchase will be in the best interest of the Plan and its participants, taking into account the diversity
of Plan assets and the Plan's need for liquidity; 

(b) to review the Lease (and any proposed renewals thereof) covering the Property to confirm in each case that the Lease
(or renewal) is in the best interest of the Plan and its participants; 

(c) to confirm that the Lease (or renewal thereof) reflects the current fair market rental rate as determined by an
independent real estate appraiser; 

(d) to review all financial statements and other documents to be filed by the Plan in connection with the Lease (or the
renewal thereof); 
(e) to monitor the Lease to ensure that all actions are taken that are necessary or proper to safeguard the interests
of the Plan; and 
(f) to review the Plan's assets periodically to determine whether the value of the Property remains less than 25% of
the total value of Plan assets. 

7. Mr. Berger represents that he completed his analysis of the transactions and, based upon his review and analysis,
it is his opinion that the Property is an appropriate investment for the Plan and the acquisition and Lease thereof
is in the best interests of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries. Mr. Berger represents that he has reviewed
the Plan's investment portfolio and determined that while it is prudently diversified among its various securities,
less than 20% of the total corpus is invested in intermediate and long-term securities. Mr Berger believes that it
would be appropriate to further diversify the portfolio with a long-term investment such as the Property and the subject
Lease. 

8. Mr. Berger represents that after having examined the purchase contract, the proposed Lease, the appraisal report,
the physical Property and the Plan's assets, he considers the purchase of the Property to be a sound and secure investment
which will earn a fair market return for the Plan and will enhance the diversification of the Plan's assets and provide
a more consistent and level flow of current income. Mr. Berger represents that he will continue to monitor the Lease
throughout its duration and take whatever action is necessary to protect the Plan's rights under the Lease.

9. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: 

(a) the Property represents approximately 7.7% of the Plan's total assets; (b) the rental for the Property has been,
and will continue to be, established by a qualified, independent appraiser; 
(c) the Plan's independent fiduciary, Mr. Berger, has determined that the transactions are appropriate for the Plan
and in the best interests of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; and 
(d) Mr. Berger will continue to monitor the Lease and take whatever action is necessary to protect the Plan's rights
under the Lease.

Exemption Application No. D-9257, et al.] 


 


<DOCTITLE>Grant of Individual Exemptions; Marshall & Ilsley Trust Company et al. </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions. 

 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


 

Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 


 The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


 

Statutory Findings 


 

In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 


 (a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 


 (b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 


 (c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (F) of the Code, shall not apply, as of November 20, 1992,
to the in-kind transfer of assets of plans for which Marshall & Ilsley Trust Company or an affiliate (collectively,
M&I) serves as a fiduciary (the Client Plans), other than plans established and maintained by M&I, that are
held in certain collective investment funds maintained by M&I (the CIFs), in exchange for shares of the Marshall
Funds, Inc. (the Funds), an open-end investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
1940 Act), for which M&I acts as investment adviser, custodian, and/or shareholder servicing agent, in connection
with the termination of such CIFs, provided that the following conditions and the general conditions of Section III
below are met:

(b) Each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund which have a total net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client
Plan's pro rata share of the assets of the CIF on the date of the transfer, based on the current market value of the CIF's
assets, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner at the close of the same business day, using
independent sources in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1940 Act
and the procedures established by the Funds pursuant to Rule 17a-7 for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures
must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price
for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding
the weekend of the CIF transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are
broker-dealers or pricing services independent of M&I. 


 (c) A second fiduciary who is independent of and unrelated to M&I (the Second Fiduciary) receives advance written
notice of the in-kind transfer of assets of the CIFs and full written disclosure of information concerning the Funds
(including a current prospectus for each of the Funds and a statement describing the fee structure) and, on the basis
of such information, authorizes in writing the in-kind transfer of the Client Plan's CIF assets to a corresponding
Fund in exchange for shares of the Fund. 


 (d) For all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of the proposed exemption in the


Federal Register

, M&I sends by regular mail to each affected Client Plan a written confirmation, not later than 30 days after completion
of the transaction, containing the following information: 


 (1) The identity of each security that was valued for purposes of the transaction in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4);



 (2) The price of each such security involved in the transaction; and 


 (3) The identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. 


 (e) For all subsequent transfers of CIF assets to a Fund following the publication of the proposed exemption in the


Federal Register

, M&I sends by regular mail to the Second Fiduciary no later than 90 days after completion of each transfer a written
confirmation that contains the following information: 


 (1) The number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value, and
the total dollar amount of such CIF units; and 


 (2) The number of shares in the Funds that are held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net
asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares.

to: (1) the receipt of fees by M&I from the Funds for acting as an investment adviser to the Funds in connection with
the investment by the Client Plans in shares of the Funds; and (2) the receipt and proposed retention of fees by M&I
from the Funds for acting as custodian and shareholder servicing agent to the Funds as well as for any other services
to the Funds which are not investment advisory services (i.e. ``secondary services'') in connection with the investment
by the Client Plans in shares of the Funds, provided that the following conditions and the general conditions of Section
III are met: 
(a) No sales commissions are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase or sale of shares of the Funds and
no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of shares by the Client Plans to the Funds. 
(b) The price paid or received by a Client Plan for shares in a Fund is the net asset value per share at the time of the transaction,
as defined in Section IV(e), and is the same price which would have been paid or received for the shares by any other investor
at that time. 
(c) Neither M&I nor an affiliate, including any officer or director of M&I, purchases or sells shares of the
Funds from or to any Client Plan. 
(d) Each Client Plan receives a credit, either through cash or the purchase of additional shares of the Funds pursuant
to an annual election made by the Client Plan, of such Plan's proportionate share of all fees charged to the Funds by
M&I for investment advisory services, including any investment advisory fees paid by M&I to third party
sub-advisers, within no more than one business day of the receipt of such fees by M&I. 
(e) The combined total of all fees received by M&I for the provision of services to a Client Plan, and in connection
with the provision of services to the Funds in which the Client Plan may invest, are not in excess of ``reasonable compensation''
within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act.

(i) On the basis of the information described above in paragraph (h), the Second Fiduciary authorizes in writing the
investment of assets of the Client Plan in each particular Fund, the fees to be paid by such Funds to M&I, and, if
applicable, the purchase of additional shares of a Fund by the Client Plan with the fees credited to the Client Plan
by M&I. 
(j) All authorizations made by a Second Fiduciary regarding investments in a Fund and the fees paid to M&I are subject
to an annual reauthorization wherein any such prior authorization referred to in paragraph (i) shall be terminable
at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&I of written notice of termination.
A form expressly providing an election to terminate the authorization described in paragraph  (i) above (the Termination
Form) with instructions on the use of the form must be supplied to the Second Fiduciary no less than annually. The instructions
for the Termination Form must include the following information: 
(1) The authorization is terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by
M&I of written notice from the Second Fiduciary; and 
(2) Failure to return the Termination Form will result in continued authorization of M&I to engage in the transactions
described in paragraph (i) on behalf of the Client Plan. 
(k) The Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan invested in a particular Fund receives full written disclosure, in a statement
separate from the Fund prospectus, of any proposed increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for
secondary services (as defined in Section IV(h) below) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such increase,
accompanied by a copy of the Termination Form, and receives full written disclosure in a Fund prospectus or otherwise
of any increases in the rates of fees charged by M&I to the Funds for investment advisory services even though such
fees will be credited as required by paragraph (d) above. 
(l) In the event that M&I provides an additional secondary service to a Fund for which a fee is charged or there is
an increase in the amount of fees paid by the Funds to M&I for any secondary services resulting from a decrease in
the number or kind of services performed by M&I for such fees in connection with a previously authorized secondary
service, M&I will, at least thirty days in advance of the implementation of such additional service or fee increase,
provide written notice to the Second Fiduciary explaining the nature and the amount of the additional service for
which a fee will be charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees of the affected Fund. Such notice shall be
accompanied by the Termination Form, as defined in Section IV(i) below. 
(m) On an annual basis, M&I provides the Second Fiduciary of a Client Plan investing in the Funds with: 
(1) A copy of the current prospectus for the Funds and, upon such fiduciary's request, a copy of the Statement of Additional
Information for such Funds which contains a description of all fees paid by the Funds to M&I; 
(2) A copy of the annual financial disclosure report prepared by M&I which includes information about the Fund
portfolios as well as audit findings of an independent auditor within 60 days of the preparation of the report; and

(3) Oral or written responses to inquiries of the Second Fiduciary as they arise. 
(n) All dealings between the Client Plans and the Funds are on a basis no less favorable to the Client Plans than dealings
with other shareholders of the Funds. 


Section III_General Conditions 


(a) M&I maintains for a period of six years the records necessary to enable the persons described below in paragraph
(b) to determine whether the conditions of this exemption have been met, except that (1) a prohibited transaction

(e) The term ``net asset value'' means the amount for purposes of pricing all purchases and sales calculated by dividing

Therefore, in response to this comment, the Department has amended Section I(b) of the Proposal by changing the clause
to 
read as follows (the new language being underlined):

 


 
``* * * and the procedures established by the Funds 

pursuant to Rule 17a-7

 for the valuation of such assets.''

 



 
The applicant states further that the valuation procedures used by a mutual fund for determining the net asset value
of its shares may differ slightly from the valuation procedures used for Rule 17a-7 transactions. For example,
the applicant notes that although the rules and procedures for determining net asset value parallel the valuation
rules of Rule 17a-7(b) for securities for which market quotations are readily available, the net asset value
rules permit the amortized cost method to be used for valuing certain types of securities, such as short-term fixed-income
securities, and permit the use of one, rather than three, independent brokers or pricing services to value securities
which are not exchanged-traded. 


 However, the applicant represents that the net asset value determinations by the Funds are made on an objective and
consistent basis, in accordance with the applicable SEC rules and internal procedures established by the board of
directors of the Funds (the Board). The applicant states that all the members of the Board are independent of M&I,
the investment adviser of the Funds. The procedures established by the Board are described in the Statement of Additional
Information issued to Fund investors. These procedures include the time of day at which net asset value will be determined
and the specific independent pricing services that will be used by the Funds. 


 Accordingly, the Department has determined that no further modifications to Section I(b) of the Proposal are necessary.



 In response to a question raised by the Department regarding the utilization of sub-advisers, the applicant states
that M&I currently uses a third party sub-adviser for one of the Funds but otherwise is the sole investment adviser
to the Funds' existing portfolios and presently contemplates no change with respect to such existing portfolios.
M&I states that in the event that other, particularly more specialized, portfolios are started, third party
sub-advisers may be utilized to enhance the investment alternatives and the investment advisory services available
to the Funds for such portfolios. M&I represents that each Client Plan's credit of all investment advisory fees
charged by M&I to the Funds will include any investment advisory fees paid by M&I to third party sub-advisers.



 In response to the applicant's comment, the Department has amended Section II(d) of the Proposal as follows (new language
being underlined):

 


 
``* * * Each Client Plan receives a credit, either through cash or the purchase of additional shares
of the Funds pursuant to an annual election made by the Client Plan, of such Plan's proportionate share of all fees charged
to the Funds by M&I for investment advisory services, 

including any investment advisory fees paid by M&I to third party sub-advisers,

 within no more than one business day of the receipt of such fees by M&I.''

 


 
In response to a further question raised by the Department regarding changes in fees received by M&I for secondary
services, the applicant has agreed to add a new condition to Section II of the Proposal which requires prior disclosure
of the addition of a secondary service for which a fee is charged or an increase in fees as a result of a decrease in the
number or kind of services performed for an existing secondary service fee. This condition, as discussed in paragraph
(l) of Section II, requires M&I to provide written notice to the Second Fiduciary, at least thirty days in advance
of the implementation of such additional service or fee increase, explaining the nature and the amount of the additional
service for which a fee will be charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees of the affected Fund. Such notice
must be accompanied by a Termination Form. 


 With respect to purchases and sales of Fund shares, Section II(c) of the Proposal states that neither M&I nor an
affiliate, including any officer or director of M&I, may purchase or sell shares of the Funds from or to any Client
Plan. The applicant states that while purchases or redemptions of Fund shares by the Client Plans are made with the
Funds' distributor, which is independent of M&I, purchase and redemption orders may be placed through the Client
Plan's account representative at M&I. The applicant requests that the Department clarify that the language
of Section II(c) of the Proposal does not affect the ability of Client Plans to place orders through M&I personnel.

In response to the applicant's comment, the Department notes that Section II(c) was not intended to limit the ability
of Client Plans to deal with M&I account representatives on Fund matters and is not meant to prohibit purchases
or sales of Fund shares that are placed through M&I personnel when such personnel are acting as agents for the Client
Plans. 


 With respect to 12b-1 fees, Section II(f) of the Proposal provides that M&I may not receive any fees payable
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. The applicant states that this condition is consistent with the representations
made by M&I. However, the applicant notes that Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Summary of Facts and Representations in
the Proposal (the Summary) overstate the representations made by M&I with regard to 12b-1 fees and require
minor clarification. 


 Paragraph 3 indicates that the Client Plans will invest only in ``Trust Shares'' of the Funds. The applicant states
that at the current time only the Marshall Money Market Fund has established a category of ``Trust Shares'', as distinguished
from ``Investment Shares'' that are charged with 12b-1 fees. The applicant notes that the remaining Funds,
while capable of establishing 12b-1 plans, have not done so, and currently use only a single class of shares.
The applicant represents that if any of these Funds does establish a 12b-1 plan, it will create a separate class
of shares analogous to the Marshall Money Market Funds' ``Trust Shares'' that will not be charged 12b-1 fees,
and investments by Client Plans will be limited to the class of shares not subject to 12b-1 fees. 


 In Paragraph 4 of the Summary, the third sentence reads, ``* * * In addition, M&I does not and will
not receive fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b-1 in connection with transactions involving any shares of the
Funds.'' The applicant states that this statement should be clarified to limit it to transactions described under
the exemption, because M&I may receive 12b-1 fees in connection with transactions outside the exemption
involving separate classes of Fund shares. The Department notes the applicant's clarification. 


 With respect to the authorization of credits in the form of Fund shares, the applicant states that the Second Fiduciary's
authorization of the fee credits may not necessarily include an authorization to purchase additional shares with
the credited fees. Therefore, Section II(i) of the Proposal should include the phrase ``if applicable'' as part of
the clause ``* * * and the purchase of additional shares of a Fund by the Client Plan with the fees credited
to the Client Plan by M&I''. The Department has amended Section II(i) to include this phrase. In addition, Paragraph
8 of the Summary states, in the middle of the first paragraph, that ``* * * Such authorization 

will

 include in the future an election for the Second Fiduciary to purchase additional shares of the Fund with the fees credited
to the Client Plan by M&I.'' The applicant states that this should be clarified to provide that such authorizations


may

, rather than will, be included in the future. The Department also notes this additional clarification. 


 With respect to the use of broker quotations and pricing services for valuing the securities transferred to a Fund,
the applicant states that the reference in Section I(b) of the Proposal to the use of ``* * * at least
three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of M&I * * *'' for securities
described under Rule 17a-7(b)(4) is consistent with M&I's representations. However, the applicant notes
that the third paragraph of Paragraph 6 of the Summary indicates that unlisted securities were valued based on quotations
obtained from three brokers independent of M&I, without referring to the use of a fourth quotation in the event
of an aberration in the three quotations obtained or the use in some cases of independent pricing services in place
of brokers. The applicant requests that this matter be clarified for the record. In this regard, the Department notes
the applicant's clarification regarding M&I's use of broker quotations and pricing services for valuing unlisted
securities involved in the in-kind transfers to the Funds and also notes that such procedures were consistent with
Section I(b) of the Proposal. 


 With respect to the frequency of reports made to the Client Plans on Fund transactions, the applicant states that Paragraph
8 of the Summary should be clarified to state that such reports are provided to Second Fiduciaries monthly or quarterly,
rather than just monthly. The Department also notes this clarification. In addition, the Department has added as
a condition of the exemption (see Section II(m) above) a requirement that M&I provide the Second Fiduciaries
of Client Plans investing in the Funds the following:

(1) A copy of the current prospectus for the Funds and, upon such fiduciary's request, a copy of the Statement of Additional
Information for such Funds which contains a description of all fees paid by the Funds to M&I; 
(2) A copy of the annual financial disclosure report prepared by M&I which includes information about the Fund
portfolios as well as audit findings of an independent auditor within 60 days of the preparation of the report; and

(3) Oral or written responses to inquiries of the Second Fiduciary as they arise. 
Accordingly, after consideration of the entire record, the Department has determined to grant the exemption as modified.

(B) The Guarantees are made solely with respect to the amounts which are due the Plans, but unpaid, with respect to the
GACs; and 
(C) The Settlement Agreement described within the Summary of Facts and Representations, in the notice of proposed
exemption, is approved by the U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut. 
For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on September 30, 1994 at 59 FR 50011. 


Written Comments: 

The Department received 16 written comments and no requests for a hearing. Two of the comments requested additional
information, which was provided by telephone by a representative of the Department. Twelve of the comments did not
address substantively the transactions addressed by the proposed exemption. The remaining two comments addressed
substantive issues relating to the proposed exemption: 
1. One comment raised issues which are summarized as follows: (a) The Plans continue to lose earning opportunities
on the assets invested in the GACs until 1999; (b) The Plans' participants have incurred administrative and litigation
expenses related to the proposed transaction; (c) The Employer's profitability is affected by the subject transactions;
(d) The proposed transaction represents an estimated loss of 15 percent of the Plans' principal investment in the
GACs; and (e) The Plans will have earned no income on their investments in the GACs. 
In a written response, the Xerox Corporation (the Applicant) notes that the comment raises questions, and appears
to constitute an objection, with respect to the Applicant's entire two-part remedy proposed for the problems resulting
from the conservatorship of Executive Life. This two-part remedy consists of (1) an up-front cash payment, and (2)
the proposed Guarantees pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Applicant emphasizes that the proposed exemption
relates solely to the proposed Guarantees, and not to the entire two-part remedy. Since the comment addresses the
entire remedy as a whole, the Applicant maintains that the comment is not relevant to the proposed exemption, which
involves only the Guarantees. The Applicant states that prior to the Settlement Agreement's approval by the Federal
District Court for the District of Connecticut (the Court), affected Plan participants were duly notified and afforded
ample opportunity to comment on the proposed Settlement Agreement. In response to approximately 32,000 notices
mailed to affected Plan participants publicizing the settlement's terms, in addition to newspaper reports, the
Applicant states that only three objections were received. The Applicant represents that in its hearing on September
8, 1994, the Court determined that the Settlement Agreement was ``fair, reasonable and adequate''. In conclusion,
the Applicant states that the comment is neither timely, nor relevant to the exemption request, nor in keeping with
the judgment of the Court which has considered this matter. 
In specific response to the comment's point relating to litigation expenses, the Applicant states that fees and administrative
costs with respect to the lawsuit resulting in the Settlement Agreement will be paid out of funds transferred by the
Applicant to an escrow account. In specific response to the comment's point relating to loss of principal, the Applicant
states that the comment is wrong factually: The Applicant represents that the proposed two-part remedy will protect
100 percent of the face value of the GACs as of April 1, 1991, consisting of all principal investments plus interest
accrued at the rates guaranteed by the GACs, less previous withdrawals. 
2. The other comment objected to the proposed transaction because of the commenter's opinion that it would wrongfully
permit Xerox Corporation to reinstate the principal investments in the GACs by 1999 while depriving the Plans' participants
of any interest on such funds. The commenter maintained that the proposed transaction rewards Xerox Corporation
for faulty investment strategy and violations of its fiduciary duties. 
In a written response to this comment, the Applicant notes that, like the previous comment, it raises questions about
the Applicant's entire two-part remedy as a whole, rather than the proposed exemption, which relates solely to the
proposed Guarantees pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Applicant maintains that since the comment addresses
the entire proposed remedy, the comment is not relevant to the proposed exemption. As in response to the prior comment,
the Applicant states that before the Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court, affected Plan participants
were duly notified and afforded ample opportunity to comment on the proposed Settlement Agreement. The Applicant
again notes that in its hearing on September 8, 1994, the Court determined that the Settlement Agreement was ``fair,
reasonable and adequate''. The Applicant maintains in conclusion that the comment is neither timely, nor relevant
to the exemption request, nor in keeping with the judgment of the Court which has considered this matter. 
3. The Department notes that, although all aspects of the Settlement Agreement were disclosed in the Applicant's
exemption application, the exemption request was specifically limited to the provision of the Guarantees by the
Xerox Corporation. Accordingly, the Department considered the request in the context of a settlement agreement
that had been agreed to by the parties to the litigation and approved by the U.S. District Court. In this regard, the
Department noted in the proposal that it was not proposing any relief for any violation of Part 4 which may have arisen
as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GACs. 
Accordingly, after consideration of the entire record, including the comments and the Applicant's responses, the
Department has determined to grant the exemption as proposed.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by American Stock Exchange, Inc. Revising
Qualification Examinations Administered by the Exchange.


November 29, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C.  78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on October 25, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and
III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this
notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The American Stock Exchange, Inc. is filing this proposed rule change pursuant to a Commission request that all qualification
examinations administered by the Exchange be filed with the Commission.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




1. Purpose



The Commission takes the position that self-regulatory organizations must file for Commission review all actions
imposing qualification standards.
 The Exchange has gone through an extensive process to update and revise its examinations to conform them to new rules
and procedures. Accordingly, the Amex is submitting the contents of its qualification examinations and related
materials as a proposed rule change.




The Amex administers six qualification examinations: the Qualification Examination for Regular Members, the Qualification
Examination for Options Principal Members (``OPMs''), the Put and Call Stock Option Examination, the Put and Call
Option Questionnaire for Listed Personnel, the Specialist Examination and the Registered Equity Trader and Registered
Equity Market Maker Examination.

Pursuant to Exchange Rule 50(a) very applicant for regular and options principal membership shall pass a qualifying
examination prior to undertaking any active duties on the Floor. As a result, regular members who may trade stocks
and options take both the Qualifying Examination for Regular Floor Members and the Put and Call Stock Option Examination.
OPMs, who are prohibited from trading equities, take the Qualifying Examination for OPMs and the Put and Call Stock
Option Examination. Limited Trading Permit Holders take the Qualifying Examination for OPMs and the Put and Call
Stock Option Examination.

Commentary .01 to Exchange Rule 50(a) requires that a regular member who applies to register as a specialist and a regular
or OPM member who applies to register as a registered floor trader must also pass an examination. Specialists take
the Specialist Examination. Registered floor traders take the Registered Equity Trader and Registered Equity Trader
and Registered Equity Market Maker Examination.

Any member who was registered and approved by the Exchange prior to 1977, the date when the Series 7 exam began to cover
standardized options, must successfully complete an examination before being registered to do public options business.
 These individuals must take the Listed Put and Call Options Questionnaire for Registered Personnel.




The Qualification Examinations for Regular Members and OPMS, and the Put and Call Examination are administered by
the Director of Membership Services.

The Specialist and Registered Traders Examinations are administered by the Assistant Director of Trading Analysis.

<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Put and Call Options Questionnaire for Registered Personnel is administered by the broker-dealer firms who certify
to the Exchange that the applicant has satisfactorily completed the examination.

All six examinations are specifically designed for Amex membership applicants in order to test the applicant's knowledge
in a variety of areas, including general trading principles and procedures as well as specific Amex rules and policies.



2. Statutory Basis



The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), and 6(c)(3)(A) in particular in that the rule change is designed to examine the
training, experience and competence of applicants for Amex membership and verify such applicant qualifications
for Exchange membership. In addition, the proposed rule change serves to protect investors and the public interest
by helping to assure member competence.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-46
and should be submitted by December 27, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Amendments to the Minor Rule Violation Fine Plan</DOCTITLE>





November 28, 1994.






Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 21, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




CBOE Rule 17.50, ``Imposition of Fines for Minor Rule Violations,'' authorizes the Exchange to impose a fine of up
to $5,000 for minor violations of certain CBOE rules in lieu of commencing a disciplinary proceeding. The CBOE proposes
to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to extend the ``lookback period'' for determining certain sanctions, clarify appeal procedures,
and limit the number of times a member may request verification of certain fines. Specifically, the Exchange proposes
to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to: (1) extend from nine to 18 months the ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate
trade information pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties;'' and (2) create an 18-month ``lookback period''
for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter pursuant to CBOE Rule 6.51.



The CBOE also proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(6) to provide that the maximum fine authorized under the Exchange's
trading and decorum policies may be imposed for a first or second offense if warranted under the circumstances in the
view of the Floor Officials Committee. In addition, the CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .03 to Exchange
Rule 17.50 to impose a cap on the number of transactions during a particular month for which a member fined more than
twice in a 18-month period for failure to submit accurate trade information or failure to submit trade information
to the price reporter may request verification of the fine. Under the amended interpretation, a member fined more
than twice in an 18-month period may request verification of the greater of 50 transactions during a month or 10% of
the number of transactions deemed not to be in compliance with CBOE Rule 6.51.



Moreover, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to (1) clarify the appeal procedures for fines imposed for trading
conduct and decorum violations; (2) allow waiver of the forum fee for appeals of fines imposed pursuant to CBOE Rule
17.50 if a fine is reduced on appeal; and (3) make the procedures applicable to requests by the Exchange's Board of Directors
(``Board'') for review by the Board of determinations rendered under CBOE Rule 17.50 consistent with the procedures
applicable to similar Board requests for review under CBOE Rule 19.5, ``Review.'' Finally, the proposal makes certain
nonsubstantive editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rule 17.50.



The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.








II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change








In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.







(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change







CBOE Rule 17.50 authorizes the Exchange to impose a fine, not to exceed $5,000, for minor violations of certain CBOE
rules in lieu of commencing a disciplinary proceeding. The purpose of the proposal is to revise CBOE Rule 17.50 to (1)
extend from nine to 18 months the ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade information; (2) establish
an 18-month ``lookback period'' for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter; (3) impose a cap on
the number of transactions during a particular month for which a member fined more than twice in an 18-month period
for failure to submit accurate trade information or failure to submit trade information to the price reporter may
request verification; (4) clarify the appeal procedures for fines imposed for trading conduct and decorum violations;
(5) allow waiver of the forum fee for appeals of fines imposed pursuant to CBOE Rule 17.50 if a fine is reduced on appeal;
and (6) make the procedures applicable to requests by the Exchange's Board for review by the Board of determinations
rendered under CBOE Rule 17.50 consistent with the procedures applicable to similar Board requests for review under
CBOE Rule 19.5. In addition, the proposal makes certain editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rule 17.50 without affecting
its substance.

Currently, CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(4) provides for a nine month ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade
information. Specifically, the sanction schedule applicable with respect to such violations is graduated so that
the sanctions imposed start to increase with the third violation committed during a nine month period and continue
to increase with each subsequent violation committed during such nine month period. Under the proposal, the sanction
schedule for failure to submit accurate trade information will retain its current structure except that the current
nine month ``lookback period'' will be replaced with an eighteen month ``lookback period.''

Similarly, the Exchange proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(5), which currently contains no ``lookback period''
for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter, to also provide for an eighteen month ``lookback period.''
As amended, the structure of the ``lookback period'' for failure to submit trade information to the price reporter
will be the same as the amended ``lookback period'' for failure to submit accurate trade information.

The Exchange believes that the proposed increased ``lookback periods'' will help to sanction recidivists more effectively
by increasing the sanctions for repeat violators. In addition, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'')
of the Commission recommended to the Exchange in connection with the Division's 1993 inspection of the Exchange's
surveillance, investigative, and enforcement programs that the ``lookback periods'' under CBOE Rule 17.50 be increased,
 and the proposed ``lookback period'' increases are in accordance with the Exchange's response to the Division concerning
the implementation of this recommendation.







The CBOE also proposed to amend Interpretation and Policy .03 to CBOE Rule 17.50 to limit the number of transactions
during a particular month for which a member fined more than twice during an 18-month period under CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(4)
or (g)(5) may request verification of the fine. Currently, there is no limitation on the number of transactions for
which a member may request verification under Interpretation and Policy .03. Under the proposal, if during an 18-month
period a member receives three or more fines pursuant to CBOE Rules 17.50(g)(4) or 17.50(g)(5), a limitation would
be imposed on the member's ability to request verification of the fines. Specifically, in requesting verification
of such fines, the maximum number of transactions during a particular month with respect to which a member could request
verification would be limited to the greater of (1) 50 transactions or (2) 10% of the number of transactions deemed
not to be in compliance with CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(4) or 17.50(g)(5). The proposed cap would apply separately to fines
imposed under CBOE Rules 17.50(g)(4) and 17.50(g)(5).


The CBOE states that in most instances a request for verification involves the review by the Exchange of the hard copies
of a member's trading tickets in order to determine whether keypunch errors have occurred in the inputting of the data
contained on the tickets. The majority of the requests involve the review of between 30 and 150 transactions, and the
number of transactions with respect to which review has been requested by a member has ranged in scope from as little
as three transactions to as many as 700 transactions. Since the end of the third quarter of 1993, contemporaneous with
an increase in trading volume on the Exchange, the number of fines imposed pursuant to CBOE Rules 17.50(g)(4) and (g)(5)
has risen, resulting in a higher number of requests for verification. Consequently, the Exchange has had to devote
an increasing amount of staff time and resources to handling these requests.

The Exchange believes that the proposed cap is necessary to reduce the amount of staff time and resources which are
currently devoted to processing verification requests and to alleviate the current administrative burden associated
with responding to these requests. In addition, the Exchange believes that the proposed cap strikes an appropriate
balance between not overburdening the Exchange's surveillance staff with the processing of verification requests
and leaving in place a meaningful and reasonable opportunity for CBOE members to request verification. Specifically,
the Exchange believes that the proposed cap is reasonable based on its analysis that the cap will affect a small percentage
of the members requesting verification while at the same time materially reducing the total number of transactions
that will need to be reviewed by the Exchange's surveillance staff.

The CBOE also proposes several amendments to revise the procedures applicable to the appeal and review of fines imposed
under CBOE Rule 17.50. First, the Exchange notes that all fines imposed under CBOE Rule 17.50 are appealable to the
CBOE's BCC, except for fines imposed for trading conduct and decorum violations not exceeding $2,500, which are appealable
to the Exchange's Appeals Committee and are governed by CBOE Chapter 19, ``Hearings and Review.'' The CBOE proposes
to amend Exchange Rule 17.50 to clarify the procedures applicable to appeals from fines imposed for trading conduct
and decorum violations by adding paragraph (d)(1), which notes that, among other things, a person fined for such violations
may contest the Exchange's determination by filing a written application with the Secretary of the Exchange pursuant
to CBOE 19.2, ``Submission of Application to Exchange,'' and stating that a hearing, if requested, will be conducted
in accordance with the provisions of CBOE Rules 19.3, ``Procedure Following Applications for Hearing,'' and 19.4,
``Hearing.'' Under paragraph (d)(2), the Appeals Committee may waive the forum fee if the Appeals Committee finds
that the person charged is guilty of one or more of the rule violations alleged and the sole disciplinary sanction imposed
by the Appeals Committee is a fine which is less than the total fine initially imposed by the Exchange.
In addition, after a hearing or review in which the BCC determines that a person is guilty of a rule violation, CBOE Rule
17.50(c) currently requires the BCC to impose a forum fee of $100 against the person if the determination was reached
without a hearing, or $300 if a hearing was conducted. The CBOE proposes to amend the rule to provide the BCC with the
discretion to waive the forum fee if the BCC finds that the person charged is guilty of one or more of the rule violations
alleged and the sole disciplinary sanction imposed by the BCC is a fine which is less than the total fine initially imposed
by the Exchange. The CBOE believes that this amendment will lead to a more equitable resolution of certain appeals
under CBOE Rule 17.50 in situations where the BCC believes that a waiver of the forum fee is warranted, for example,
when a fine is reduced on appeal.
The CBOE also proposes to amend CBOE Rule 17.50 to make the procedures applicable to requests by the Board for review
by the Board of determinations of the BCC and Appeals Committee under CBOE Rule 17.50 consistent with the procedures
applicable to requests by the Board for Board review of other decisions of those committees as provided in CBOE Rules
17.10(c) and 19.5(a).
Finally, the CBOE proposes a nonsubstantive change to clarify CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(1), ``Violation of position limit
rules,'' by deleting a potentially confusing reference to CBOE Rule 24.4, ``Position Limits for Broad-Based Index
Options.'' Currently, CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(1), which applies to violations of all of the Exchange's position limit
rules, only specifically references CBOE Rules 4.11, ``Position Limits,'' and 24.4(a), and does not specifically
reference the other CBOE rules which determine compliance with CBOE Rule 4.11, the Exchange's general rule governing
position limits.
 Although the CBOE states that this is not technically incorrect_because all position limit violations, no matter
what type of option they relate to, are violations of CBOE Rule 4.11_the current references are potentially confusing.
Therefore, to eliminate potential confusion, the CBOE proposes to delete the reference to CBOE Rule 24.4(a), so that
CBOE Rule 17.50(g)(1), as amended, will refer only to CBOE Rule 4.11.




The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Sections 6(b)(1) and 6(b)(7), in particular, in that it enhances the effectiveness and fairness
of the Exchange's disciplinary procedures.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.

 Section 15A(g)(3) provides, among other things, that a registered securities association may require that members
and their associated persons meet certain training, experience and competence standards. The proposed changes
to the examination will help ensure that persons seeking registration in the securities industry have attained the
requisite levels of knowledge and competence.






It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR-NASD-94-43 be, and hereby

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice
of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change Relating to
Hedge Order Spread Priority</DOCTITLE>


November 29, 1994.


On April 1, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to permit various types of hedge orders to attain spread priority. On November 17, 1994, the
Phlx submitted Amendment Number 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposal to clarify, among other things, that the proposed
priority principles in the original filing will only apply to hedge orders and to remove synthetic option orders from
the definition of hedge order.
 On November 23, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to the proposal to clarify the definition
of multi-spread transaction in Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 and amend Options Floor Procedure Advice F-14 to
reference the procedures for the execution of synthetic orders.








Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment and appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on November 17, 1993.
 No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal, as amended.




I. Description of the Proposal


The Phlx proposes to permit certain types of hedge orders to attain spread priority, 

i.e.

, to be executed as a single transaction, with priority over certain existing bids or offers for each leg of the transaction.
Under the proposal, the Exchange is amending Rule 1066 to define the types of hedge orders that would be eligible for
spread priority. Specifically, paragraph (f) of Rule 1066 would be amended to define the term hedge order to include
spread orders, straddle orders, and combination orders for the same account.
 Additionally, Rule 1066(g) would be amended to define a synthetic option order as an order to buy or sell a stated number
of option contracts and buy or sell the underlying stock in an amount that would offset (on a one-for-one basis) the
option position. This proposed definition would include buy-writes, synthetic calls, and synthetic puts. As with
hedge orders, synthetic options may be quoted at a net debit or credit.






Currently, Phlx Rule 1033(d) affords priority to certain spread transactions. Under this provision, an eligible
spread is executable as a single transaction at a total net credit/debit against one other member that represents
all legs of the trade provided that net credit/debit improves the established market for the spread as measured by
the aggregate price of the respective legs, if executed individually. The new proposed language to Rule 1033(d) would
clarify that in order to establish whether a spread transaction has improved the established market, at least one
option leg must be executed at a better price than the established market for the option and no option leg can be executed
outside of the established market.
 Pursuant to this proposed rule change, all of the types of hedge orders defined in proposed Rule 1066(f) would be eligible
for spread priority.
 Rule 1033(e) would clarify the priority principles applicable to synthetic options,
 and Rule 1033 would also be amended to add headings to each paragraph for quick reference to the appropriate topic.

As a result of the proposed changes to Rules 1066 and 1033, corresponding changes to OFPA F-4 will be required.
OFPA F-4 (Orders Executed as Spreads, Straddles, or Combinations) would be amended to reflect the definitional
changes to Rule 1066. Accordingly, the title would be changed to ``Orders Executed as Spread, Straddle, Combination
or Synthetic Orders,'' and the text would reflect the new term, synthetic orders. OFPA F-4 would additionally
require the marking of order tickets executed in reliance upon the spread priority rules with a ``syn'' for synthetic
orders in addition to the existing requirement that spreads, straddles, and combinations also be marked with the
identifier ``sp,'' ``st,'' or ``comb.'' Also, the Phlx will disseminate the appropriate Options Price Reporting
Authority (``OPRA'') prefix as an indicator that each option leg was executed as part of a hedge transaction.
 A new Advice enumerating the procedure for executing hedge orders is also proposed for both equity option and foreign
currency option (``FCO'') floors. OFPA F-14 (Executing Hedge Orders) restates the definitions in Rule 1066(f)
and the priority procedures in Rule 1033(d) and (e) for easy reference by floor persons in the floor procedure advice
handbook. Finally, Advice D-2, Instances of Non-Liability for Floor Brokers or Specialists, would be amended
to include synthetic orders.





Certain changes proposed by the Phlx to Rules 1066 and 1033 are applicable solely to the trading of FCOs. The Phlx believes
these changes will allow Phlx market participants to utilize foreign currency options contracts more effectively
as risk hedging instruments. The Exchange notes that the FCO markets tend to attract and be utilized by sophisticated
institutional and corporate investors. This is in part due to the nature of the instruments and the tremendous size
of the underlying currency markets. Sophisticated institutional and corporate investors frequently effect ratio
and multi-part transitions, rather than relying on one-to-one spreads and other orders.

First, because Rule 1033 deals with priority for different types of spreads, existing Commentary .02 of Rule 1066
is proposed to be moved to Rule 1033(f). Because Rule 1066 generally contains definitional provisions, a new Commentary
.02 to Rule 1066 would be adopted containing a definition of multi-spread transactions in FCOs.






Second, Rule 1033(g) is proposed to be added to state that for options on foreign currency, a spread order may consist
of a different number of contracts so long as the number of contracts differ by a permissible ratio. As a result, ratio
spreads would become eligible for spread priority pursuant to Rule 1033(d). For purposes of this rule, a permissible
ratio would be defined as one-to-one, on-to-two, one-to-three, and two-to-three.

Third, proposed Rule 1033(h) is a new paragraph governing multi-spread priority for an FCO participant holding two
spread type orders for the same amount. Eligible multi-spread transactions in FCOs, as defined in new Commentary
.02 of Rule 1066, could be executed as a single transaction as long as at least one of the individual legs of each individual
spread (up to a maximum of six legs for the total transaction, or two spreads) is executed at a better price than the established
bid or offer for that option, and that no option leg is executed at a price outside of the established bid or offer for
that option contract. The language of Rule 1033(h) parallels existing language in Rule 1033(f), relating to three-way
transactions.






Finally, OFPA F-16 (Two-Way, Three-Way and Multi-Spread Transactions) is proposed by the Phlx for adoption.
This Advice restates the aforementioned definitions and procedures regarding FCO spread priority for easy reference
by floor persons in the floor procedure advice handbook.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and not to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, and dealers.






The Commission believes that the proposal will ensure adequate protection to investors because the rule as amended
will only afford priority to those transactions that improve the established market for the spread, as measured by
the aggregate price of all legs of the transaction. Because the rule provides that at least one leg of the transaction
must be executed at a better price than the established market for the option and that no leg of the transaction may be
executed outside of the established market for the option series, the Commission believes that this change affords
greater protection to the limit order book and therefore, that customer limit orders will not be disadvantaged. Furthermore,
because the Rule currently requires that one member must represent all legs of the trade and that the trade may only
be executed against one other member, public customers are still less likely to lose priority to hedge orders. The
Commission believes the proposal is a reasonable effort by the Phlx to accommodate the ability to price hedge orders
more competitively while at the same time not disadvantaging the public customer limit order book. The Commission
also notes that the priority principles applicable to synthetic options remain unchanged, 

i.e.

, the option leg will have to be executed at a price better than the established market in order to receive price priority.






The Phlx has created a new Advice, OFPA F-14, that restates the definitions of hedge orders contained in Rule
1066(f) and enumerates the priority principles contained in Rule 1033. Additionally, the Phlx has amended OFPA F-4
to, among other things, require the marking of order tickets executed in reliance upon the spread priority rules.
OFPA F-14 simply restates the definitions and principles already established in Rules 1066 and 1033 for easy
reference by floor traders. Moreover, the amendment to OFPA F-4 merely crates a new trade identifier for synthetic
options similar to that already required the hedge orders. Accordingly, the Commission believes these changes raise
no new or unique regulatory issues.

Several other changes are applicable only to foreign currency options. The Phlx has added Commentary .02 to Rule 1066
to provide a definition of multi-spread transactions, and new paragraph (h) to Rule 1033 was created to allow multi-spread
transactions in FCOs for the same account to be executed as a single transaction in accordance with spread priority
principles. Although the Commission has been concerned that granting priority to ratio orders and multi-part transactions
would allow institutional orders to preempt public customer orders, the Commission believes the above changes are
appropriate in the context of the FCO market only for several reasons. First, the Commission notes that the FCO market
is dominated by institutions and sophisticated corporate investors who regularly utilize ratio orders and conduct
multi-spread transactions. Second, because the number of public customer orders placed on the books of foreign currency
specialists is not significant, preemption of customer orders is unlikely. Third, the priority rules applicable
to multi-spread transactions mirror the priority rules currently in place for three-way spread type orders, as stated
in Rule 1033(e). Because a multi-spread order, as defined by Commentary .02 to Rule 1066, combines two-way and/or
three-way spread transactions (to a maximum of six legs for the total transaction), and must be for the same account,
the Commission believes that this change will allow institutional investors to better utilize sophisticated trading
techniques involving FCO's without altering the existing priority principles applicable to three-way orders.

The proposal also permits spread orders in the FCO market to consist of a different number of contracts provided the
number of contracts differ by a permissible ratio. This will permit ratio orders to become eligible for spread priority
pursuant to Rule 1033(d). The Commission recognizes the predominance of institutional investors and the prevalence
of spread-type ratio orders in the FCO markets. Accordingly, the Commission believes the ability to utilize ratio
orders will facilitate opportunities for risk hedging.

The Phlx has restated the above changes to the definitions and priority principles applicable to FCOs in OFPA F-16
for easy reference by floor persons. Therefore, the Commission does not believe these changes raise any new or unique
regulatory issues.
Finally, OFPA D-2 has been amended to provide for the inclusion of synthetic options. Because synthetic orders
consist of two separate transactions which may be quoted at a net debit/credit, the Commission notes there will be
instances where floor members will be unable to fill both components of the order at the net price. Accordingly, the
Commission believes it is proper to include synthetic orders within OFPA D-2 so as not to subject floor members
to liability for failure to fill an order at a specified price.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the 

Federal Register. 

Amendment No. 1 permits synthetic orders to be quoted at a net debit/credit, and also removes synthetic options from
the definition of hedge order. The ability to quote in net prices will permit market participants to price these orders
more precisely, which should result in greater efficiency and improved liquidity in their execution, and better
prices for investors. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the exclusion of synthetic orders from the definition
of hedge order will have the effect of not extending the spread priority rules to synthetic orders. The Commission
believes this will prevent the excessive loss of priority to public customers on the limit order book. Additionally,
the Amendment requires the stock portion of synthetic options and conversions and reversals to be executed prior
to the execution of the option portion of the transaction. The Commission believes this change is consistent with
previous instances where the Commission has required related transactions to be effected prior to the execution
of the options order, in order to prevent stock prices from being influenced by the options leg of the transaction.
The definitions of hedge order in Rule 1066(f) and multi-spread transaction in Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 in Amendment
No. 2 have also been amended to include the requirement that all legs of the transaction(s) be for the same account.
 The Commission believes these changes will prevent the unbundling of orders for the purpose of taking advantage of
the benefits of the spread priority rules. Amendment No. 2 also creates a new paragraph (d) in OFPA F-14 for synthetic
option orders. This change simply restates for the benefit of floor personnel the procedures involved in executing
synthetic orders and, therefore, raises no new or unique regulatory issues. Finally, in Amendment No. 2, the Phlx
inserted the clause ``in accordance with Rule 1014'' to paragraph (e) of Rule 1033. The Commission notes that this
change clarifies that synthetic orders are not eligible for special priority rules and that they must instead be executed
in accordance to the Phlx's normal order priority principles, which are referenced in Rule 1014 (g) and (h). Accordingly,
the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and
2 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.






III. Solicitation of Comments





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2. Persons
making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written

relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from
the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by December 27, 1994.


It therefore is Ordered

, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change, as amended, (SR-Phlx-93-14) is approved.

6. Various fees and charges are deducted under the Contracts. An annual policy maintenance charge of the lesser of
2% of Contract Value or $35 per Contract Year will be deducted prior to the Annuity Commencement Date, and upon a full
surrender on any date other than a Policy Anniversary, to compensate AUSA Life for contract administration. A daily
administrative expense charge, equal to an effective annual rate of .15% of the net assets of each Subaccount in which
the Contract Owner has invested, will be deducted prior to the Annuity Commencement Date and, if a Variable Payment
Option is selected, may be deducted after that Date. No charge currently is made for transfers among the Portfolios;
however, the right is reserved to impose a charge of up to $25 for the thirteenth and each subsequent transfer thereafter
during a single Contract Year. AUSA Life does not expect a profit from these charges. AUSA represents that it will monitor
its administrative expenses and the proceeds of these charges on at least an annual basis to ensure compliance with
Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.

7. AUSA Life will deduct applicable premium taxes from the Policy Value on the Annuity Commencement Date, or upon full
surrender or payment of the Death Benefit. No charges currently are made for federal, state or local taxes, other than
premium taxes; however, such taxes may be deducted in the future.

8. No sales charge is deducted from premium payments. However, certain full or partial surrenders will be subject
to a maximum 7% contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC''), which will be imposed on a declining basis during the
first seven Contract Years after payment of the premium being withdrawn. The CSDC will compensate AUSA Life for expenses
relating to the distribution and sale of the Contracts. For purposes of computing the CSDC, the earliest premium payments
will be deemed to be withdrawn first. No CSDC will be applied after the first Contract Year to that portion of the first
surrender in the Contract Year equal to 10% or less of the Contract Value. The CSDC also will not apply under certain
circumstances if the Contract Value is applied to provide an annuity under one of the Annuity Payment Options.

AUSA Life does not anticipate that the CDSC will generate sufficient revenues to pay all its distribution costs. Excess
distribution costs would be paid out of AUSA Life's general assets, which may include profits derived from the mortality
and expense risk charge assessed under the Contracts.

9. A daily charge equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the Separate Account will
be deducted to compensate AUSA Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. Of that amount,
approximately 0.45% is for mortality risks and approximately 0.80% is for expense risks. This charge applies prior
to the Annuity Commencement Date and, if a Variable Payment Option is selected, after that Date.

10. The mortality risk arises from AUSA Life's contractual obligation to make Annuity Payments (determined in accordance
with the annuity tables and other provisions provided in the Contracts) regardless of how long any individual Annuitant
or all Annuitants may live. This undertaking assures that neither an Annuitant's own longevity, nor an improvement
in general life expectancy, will adversely affect the monthly annuity payments that the Annuitant will receive under
the Contracts. A mortality risk also is assumed in connection with the Death Benefit Guarantee, for which there is
no extra charge.

11. The expense risk assumed by AUSA Life's actual administrative costs will exceed the amount recovered through
the administrative and policy maintenance charges.

12. AUSA Life currently anticipates that the mortality and expense risk charge will be more than sufficient to cover
its costs. Accordingly, any excess will be profit to AUSA Life and may be available to pay distribution costs for the
Contracts that are not covered by funds derived from the CSDC.

Applicants' Legal Analysis:


1. Applicants request exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to
permit the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of the 1.25% charge for the assumption of mortality and
expense risks. Applicants further request that such exemptive relief be extended to Future Underwriters, a class
consisting of broker-dealers who may, in the future, act as principal underwriters of the Contracts. Applicants
assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
Applicants state that the terms of the relief requested with respect to any Future Underwriter are consistent with
the standards set forth in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants state that without the requested relief, exemptive
relief would have to be requested for each new principal underwriter. Applicants assert that these additional requests
for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed in this application. Applicants
state that, if AUSA Life were to repeatedly seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in this
application, investors would not receive additional protection or benefit and could be disadvantaged by increased
overhead of AUSA Life. Applicants argue that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because the
relief will promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need for the filing of redundant
exemptive applications, thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources.
Both the delay and the expense of repeatedly seeking exemptive relief would, Applicants believe, impair AUSA Life's
ability to effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.
2. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act authorizes the Commission to grant an exemption from any provision, rule or regulation
of the 1940 Act to the extent that it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust, its depositor or principal
underwriter, from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments, other than sales
loads, are deposited with a qualified bank and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the deposit or
principal underwriter except a reasonable fee, as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and
other administrative duties normally performed by the bank itself.
3. Applicants submit that AUSA Life is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality and expense
risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% under the Contracts is a reasonable
and proper insurance charge to compensate AUSA Life for assuming certain risks under the Contracts, including the
risk that: (a) Annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting the annuity
rates guaranteed in the Contracts; and (b) the Account Value will be less than the Death Benefit; and (c) administrative
expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges. Thus, Applicants assert that this
charge is consistent with the protection of investors.
4. AUSA Life represents that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for
comparable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon AUSA Life's analysis of publicly available information
about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence
of charge level guarantees, guaranteed death benefits, and guaranteed annuity rates. AUSA Life will maintain at
its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the product analyzed
in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative review.
5. Applicants acknowledge that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion
of such profit may be available to pay distribution expenses not reimbursed by the CDSC. AUSA Life has concluded that
there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Separate
Account and Contract Owners. The basis for that conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by
AUSA Life at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.
6. AUSA Life also represents that the Separate Account will only invest in management investment companies which
undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a
board of directors of trustees, a majority of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the company, formulate and approve
any such plan.


Conclusion:


For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations





1. Citicorp Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Arizona. Citicorp Life is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citibank Delaware, which is, in turn, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citicorp, a bank holding company.
Citicorp Life is licensed to do business in 46 states and the District of Columbia. Citicorp Life is the depositor and
sponsor of the Separate Account.

2. First Citicorp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citicorp Life, is a stock life insurance company organized under
the laws of New York. First Citicorp is licensed to do business only in New York and Arizona. First Citicorp is the depositor
and sponsor of the First Citicorp Separate Account.

3. The Separate Account and the First Citicorp Separate Account were established by Citicorp Life and First Citicorp,
respectively, to fund certain individual flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts (``Contracts'').
The Separate Accounts are registered as unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act and the Contracts are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933. The Separate Accounts are divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests solely
in the shares of the corresponding portfolio of one of the following series investment companies: the Landmark Variable
Insurance Products Fund, the Fidelity Variable Insurance Products Fund, the A.I.M. Variable Insurance Funds, Inc.,
and the M.F.S. Variable Insurance Trust (collectively, the ``Funds''). Additional sub-accounts may be established
in the future to invest in other portfolios of the funds or other investment companies or unit investment trusts.

4. The Contracts are individual flexible premium deferred variable annuity contracts designed to provide benefits
in connection with retirement plans that qualify for special federal tax treatment, or on a non-qualified basis.
Contract owners may allocate payments to one or more sub-accounts or to the Fixed Account Option that is part of the
general account of either Citicorp Life or First Citicorp.

5. The Landmark Funds Broker-Dealer Services, Inc., registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., will serve as the principal underwriter
of the Contracts.






6. There is an annual Contract administration charge of $30 that is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1. Applicants
do not anticipate any profit from this charge.

7. There is a daily administrative charge at an annual rate of 0.05% of the assets of the Separate Accounts. This charge
is guaranteed not to increase and is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act. Applicants do not expect
a profit from this charge.

8. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge to be deducted from purchase payments. Instead, a surrender
or contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') of up to 7% of the amount withdrawn or surrendered is charged. During
each Contract year, up to 10% of all purchase payments, less prior withdrawals, may be withdrawn without the imposition
of a surrender charge. The following table shows the charges applied to purchase payments withdrawn or surrendered,
on a first-in-first-out basis:








9. Citicorp Life and First Citicorp will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge that is equal, on an annual basis,
to 1.25% of the average daily net asset value of the Separate Accounts: approximately .50% for mortality risks and
.75% for expense risks.

The mortality risks assumed by Citicorp Life and First Citicorp arise from their guarantees to make annuity payments
as provided in the Contracts regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant lives. Also, Citicorp
Life and First Citicorp bear mortality risks associated with the Contracts' death benefit provisions. The expense
risks assumed by Citicorp Life and First Citicorp are the risks that actual administrative costs will exceed the amount
recovered from the administration charges, processing fees, if any, and the annual contract fee.

10. Premium taxes of states and other governmental entities, currently ranging up to 3.5%, are deducted from Contract
Value either at the time the Contract is surrendered, on the annuity income date, or at such other time as the taxes are
assessed.

11. Currently no fee is charged for transfers among the sub-accounts and the Fixed Account. However, Citicorp Life
and First Citicorp reserve the right to charge $25 for the 13th and each subsequent transfer during a Contract year.
Applicants represent that this charge, if imposed, would be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1 under the 1940
Act. Citicorp Life and First Citicorp do not anticipate any profit from this charge.

12. Currently no processing fee is charged for withdrawals. However, Citicorp Life and First Citicorp reserve the
right to charge the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn for the 13th and each subsequent withdrawal during a Contract
year. This charge would be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act. Applicants do not expect a profit
from this charge.



Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions



1. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or
underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited
with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing
bookkeeping and other administrative services.

2. Applicants request an order under Section 6(c) exempting them from Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act
to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Accounts under the Contracts.

3. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice with respect
to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of publicly available information
about comparable products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge
level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. Citicorp Life and First Citicorp represent that they will maintain
at their administrative offices memoranda, available to the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis.
4. To the extent the CDSC is insufficient to cover the actual cost of distribution costs will be paid from Citicorp Life's
and First Citicorp's general assets, including the profits, if any, from the mortality and expense risks charges.
Applicants represent that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Separate Accounts and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in memoranda
maintained by the Citicorp Life and First Citicorp at their administrative offices and available to the Commission
upon request.
5. Citicorp Life and First Citicorp represent that the Separate Accounts will invest only in management investment
companies that undertake, in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, to have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.


Conclusion


Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Accounts under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions
requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purpose fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.

M&I Ventures Corporation


Notice is hereby given of the filing of a request by M&I Ventures Corporation (M&I), a Small Business Investment
company, located at 770 North Water Street, Milwaukee, WI 53202 for an exemption to CFR 13, Section 107.901(b)(1)
of the Small Business Investment Company Regulations which prohibit a licensee from directly or indirectly financing
an associate.
M&I has requested the exemption from Section 107.903 so that: (i) Thomas B. Hansen, an associate of M&I, may
become a director, officer and 10% stockholder of Predelivery Service Corporation (PSC), a small concern recently
financed by M&I, and (ii) M&I may provide additional financing to PSC in the future without prior SBA approval.
M&I is an unleveraged Licensee and expects to remain so.
In October of 1994, M&I and William Blair Leveraged Capital Fund, L.P. (Blair), an unaffiliated third party investor,
each provided $2,520,120 on the same terms for a 30% share each of PSC equity to partially finance a management buy-out
of PSC from Ford Motor Company (Ford). Additional debt financing for the buy-out which totaled $23,320,120 was provided
by the Bank of America and Ford. Pursuant to the transaction, all future decisions by the investors concerning PSC
will require the unanimous consent of M&I and Blair. The interests of both the Licensee and PSC were protected
due to the participation of unaffiliated third parties material to the transaction.
Notice is hereby given that any person may, not later than 30 days from the date of publication of this Notice, submit
written comments on the proposed transaction to the Associate Administrator for Investment, Small Business Administration,
409 3rd Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20416.
A copy of this Notice will be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Noise Exposure Map Notice; Receipt of Noise Compatibility Program and Request for Review, Palm Beach International
Airport, West Palm Beach, FL


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the revised future noise exposure map
submitted by the Palm Beach County Department of Airports, West Palm Beach, Florida for The Palm Beach International
Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193)
and 14 CFR Part 150 is in compliance with applicable requirements. The FAA also announces that it is reviewing a proposed
noise compatibility program that was submitted for The Palm Beach International Airport under Part 150 in conjunction
with the noise exposure maps, and that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before May 17, 1995. This program
was submitted subsequent to a determination by FAA that the associated existing noise exposure map submitted under
14 CFR Part 150 for The Palm Beach International Airport was in compliance with applicable requirements effective
February 1, 1993.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the revised future noise exposure map submitted for The Palm Beach International
Airport is in compliance with applicable requirements of Part 150, effective November 18, 1994. Further, FAA is reviewing
a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before May 17,
1995. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment. 


Under Section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties to the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.
The Palm Beach County Department of Airports, West Palm Beach, Florida, submitted to the FAA on October 6, 1994, a revised
future noise exposure map, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during the Palm Beach International
Airport FAR Part 150 Study conducted between March 21, 1991 and October 4, 1994. It was requested that the FAA review
this material as the future noise exposure map, as described in Section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation
measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility
program under Section 104(b) of the Act.

The FAA has completed its review of the revised future nose exposure map and related descriptions submitted by the
Palm Beach County Department of Airports, West Palm Beach, Florida. The specific map under consideration is ``REVISED
FIVE-YEAR (1998) NOISE EXPOSURE MAP, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF REVISED NOISE COMPATIBILITY PROGRAM WITH EXISTING
OFF-AIRPORT LAND USE'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that this map for The Palm Beach International Airport
is in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on November 18, 1994. FAA's determination
on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a funding that the maps were developed in accordance with
the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's
data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation
of that program.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under Section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of Section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlying of noise contours onto the map depicting
properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public
agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied
on the certification by the airport operator, under Section 150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily required
consultation has been accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for The Palm Beach International Airport, also effective
on November 18, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements
for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or
disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or
before May 17, 1995.

The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provision of 14 CFR Part 150, Section 150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
crate an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonable consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.

Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Ltd.; Notice of Application for Waiver of 
Section 804(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as Amended 



By application of November 21, 1994, Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc. (Lykes) requests a waiver of the provisions of
section 804 of the Act so as to permit it to time charter up to four 2,400 TEU containerships under foreign registry in
the trade between ports on the U.S. gulf and east coast and north Europe. 

The vessels for which a waiver is sought are now under construction in a German shipyard for a U.S. documentation citizen
owner. The first vessel is scheduled for delivery in March 1995 with the remaining vessels to be delivered at three
month intervals thereafter. Lykes has committed to time charter these vessels on a long term basis. 

The likely itinerary of the vessels according to Lykes will be Galveston, New Orleans, Miami, Charleston, Norfolk,
New York, Boston, Antwerp, Bremerhaven, Felixstowe, and LeHavre. 

For quite some time now, Lykes notes that it, just as other subsidized carriers, has been unable to acquire modern efficient
subsidy eligible tonnage at world prices. Lykes contends that it is essential for Lykes to upgrade the fleet of vessels
available to it in order to maintain its competitive position in the trade and to meet the needs of its customer base.


Lykes concludes that failure to grant this application would deprive it of the use of these modern vessels and the revenue
they will generate. 

This application may be inspected in the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person, firm, or corporation
having any interest in such request within the meaning of section 804 of the Act and desiring to submit comments concerning
the application must file written comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7210,
Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Comments must be received no later than 5:00 p.m.
on December 19, 1994. This notice is published as a matter of discretion and publication should in no way be considered
a favorable or unfavorable decision on the application, as filed or as may be amended. The Maritime Administrator
will consider any comments submitted and take such action with respect thereto as may be deemed appropriate.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On October 27, 1994, NHTSA published a notice that it will hold a public meeting on December 6, 1994 regarding the initial
decision by the Secretary of Transportation that certain pickup trucks manufactured by General Motors Corporation
(GM) with fuel tanks mounted outside the frame rails contain a defect that relates to motor vehicle safety. In view
of the intense interest in this meeting, NHTSA has changed the location and starting time for the meeting.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 17, 1994, Secretary of Transportation Federico Pe&ntilde;a announced his initial decision that model

frame rails contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety. 59 Fed. Reg. 54025 (October 27, 1994).



That notice also announced that, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.  30118 and 49 CFR 554.10, a public meeting will be held
on December 6, 1994, in order to afford GM and other interested persons an opportunity to present information, views,
and arguments on the issue of whether the vehicles covered by this initial decision contain a defect related to motor
vehicle safety.

The public meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m. in the Department of Transportation headquarters
building. However, in view of the number of people who have advised the agency that they wish to appear and the public
interest in this proceeding, NHTSA has decided to move the meeting to the Federal Aviation Administration Auditorium,

Tariff Classification of Imported Magnets


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final change of position.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document gives notice of a change of position regarding the classification of imported articles consisting
of small metal or barium ferrite magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing (sometimes referred to as
refrigerator or household magnets), under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).


Customs has ruled in the past that based on the composition of the magnet, it was classified either as an article of metal
under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading 6912, HTSUS.
Customs now believes that because composite goods consisting of magnets and a textile, plastic or ceramic housing
or shell, have the essential character of magnets, they are properly classifiable as such under heading 8505, HTSUS.
The result of this change of position is a small decrease in the rate of duty on the subject merchandise.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is in accordance
with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRIs). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according
to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes.
Magnets are specifically provided for in heading 8505, HTSUS. In several rulings, we have held that articles consisting
of a magnet placed within a decorative housing or shell made of plastic, ceramic, or textile (sometimes referred to
as refrigerator or household magnets), were composite goods. Classification was considered under the following
subheadings and duty rates:



6912.00.50: Ceramic tableware, kitchenware, other household articles . . .: [o]ther


The general, column one rate of duty is 7 percent 

ad valorem.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00118 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

7323.99.90: Table, kitchen or other household articles and parts thereof, of iron or steel . . . : [o]ther: [o]ther:
[n]ot coated or plated with precious metal: [o]ther: [o]ther. . . . 



The general, column one rate of duty is 3.4 percent 

ad valorem. 



8505.19.00: Electromagnets; permanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization.
. . : [p]ermanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization: [o]ther. . . . 


The general, column one rate of duty is 4.9 percent ad valorem. 




Because the article was a composite good consisting of metal, ceramic, textile, and/or plastic, it was prima facie
classifiable under two or more headings. Customs would then apply GRI 3(b) to determine the essential character of
the article. 

The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) constitute the Customs Cooperation
Council's official interpretation of the HTSUS. While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope
of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings. See 

T.D. 89-80, 54 FR 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN VIII to GRI 3(b) states as follows: 



[t]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example,
be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent
material in relation to the use of the goods. 




In the rulings issued, Customs concluded that the magnet imparts the essential character to the article. The plastic,
textile or ceramic portion of the article merely embellished the article and acted as a decorative selling feature.


However, Customs precluded classification of the article under heading 8505, HTSUS, which specifically provides
for permanent magnets based upon a portion of EN 85.05. EN 85.05, page 1341, states in pertinent part as follows: 



[t]his heading does not cover: [e]lectro-magnets, permanent magnets or magnetic devices of this heading, when presented
with machines, apparatus, toys, games, etc., of which they are designed to form part (classified with those machines,
apparatus, etc.) 




Based upon this portion of EN 85.05, we held that the magnets were designed to form part of the article. It was concluded
that because the magnets are presented with and incorporated into a textile, ceramic or plastic article (i.e., a hook,
fruit caricature or advertising slogan), they are precluded from classification in heading 8505, HTSUS. Because
the essential character of the article is the magnet, the article would then be classified based upon the composition
of the magnet as an article of metal under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading
6912, HTSUS. 

Several rulings were issued following this rationale. 

See

 HQs 082500, 083130, 083133, 083134, 089332, 089333, 089760; NYs 860370, 862523. This list may not be exhaustive.
There may be others issued by Customs in New York or in the various Customs districts under the pre-entry classification
procedures. 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1994 (59 FR 33320), Customs furnished notice that the classification of the subject merchandise was under
review and requested comments from interested parties. 

Only two submissions were received in response to the 
notice. While both agreed to the proposed change of position, they each provided a substantive discussion of the legal
issues 
involved. 



Discussion of Comments 





Comment: 

Articles consisting of small metal or barium ferrite magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing (sometimes
referred to as refrigerator or household magnets) are eo nomine provided for under heading 8505 as magnets, based
upon GRI 1. 

See

 O.C.O.D. 89-1, 23 Cust. Bull. 36, dated September 6, 1989. 


Response: 

Customs disagrees that the subject merchandise is classifiable under GRI 1. Magnets entered unattached to any other
object are eo nomine classifiable under heading 8505, HTSUS. Magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing
are prima facie classifiable under headings 8505, 3926, 6307, or 6912, HTSUS, respectively. Because the subject
merchandise is comprised of two or more articles classified under separate headings, classification cannot be determined
by use of GRI 1. Therefore, GRI 3 must be used. 

Furthermore, O.C.O.D. 89-1 was issued as guidelines on the proper interpretation and application of GRI 1 to
classify merchandise to the importing community. Since the enactment of the HTSUS, Customs has consistently issued
binding rulings which set forth the proper interpretation of articles which are prima facie classifiable in two or
more headings under the HTSUS according to GRI 3.

Comment

: 
The proposed change in the method of classification of the subject merchandise should apply to all relevant protested
and unliquidated entries, as well as to future entries. 



Response

: 
Because Customs believes that our previous interpretation was incorrect and this change in position results in a
slight reduction in duties, we believe that the benefit should be available to importers immediately for all entries
not finally liquidated. 



Conclusion 



It is now our position that EN 85.05 has been misinterpreted. The exclusion in EN 85.05 is designed to cover only those
articles in which the magnet is merely an insignificant part of a larger article (i.e., kitchen cabinets with a magnet
to keep the doors closed). In such cases, the magnet portion is ignored for classification purposes, and the article
(i.e., kitchen cabinet) is classified as if the magnet were not present. 



In regards to articles consisting of a metal or barium ferrite magnet and a plastic, textile or ceramic shell or housing
(i.e., a hook, fruit caricature or an advertisement slogan), Customs believes that they are composite goods. Customs
will continue to apply an essential character analysis pursuant to GRI 3(b) to find the essential character of the
merchandise. If the shell or housing portion of the article merely embellishes the product and acts as a decorative
selling feature, and the essential character is imparted by the magnet, then the article is properly classifiable
in heading 8505, HTSUS, as a permanent magnet. This change in position only relates to how Customs interprets the exclusion
stated in EN 85.05. 


The change in tariff classification resulting from this 
decision will be effective immediately for all entries not finally liquidated as well as to merchandise entered for
consumption or withdrawn from warehouse on or after this date. By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent
with our current position are revoked.

<DOCTITLE>Tariff Classification of Water Resistant Garments With Non-Water Resistant Hood</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Customs Service, Department of Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed change of practice; solicitation of comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 177.10(c)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10(c)(1)), this notice advises the public
that Customs proposes a change of practice regarding the classification of imported merchandise consisting of water
resistant jackets with non-water resistant hoods, under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).


Customs has rules in the past that water resistant garments with non-water resistant hoods were classified as water
resistant garments as per the terms of Chapter 62, HTSUS.
After a thorough review of the issue, it is Customs opinion that the permanently attached hood of a garment is an integral
part of the garment as a whole. As such, if the hood is not similarly coated (in the same manner as the jacket), the garment
is precluded from classification as a water resistant garment. The result of this proposed change of practice would
be an increase in the rate of duty on the subject merchandise.
By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with our current practice would be revoked. Before adopting
this proposed change, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted in response to publication
of this document.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background


Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is in accordance
with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according
to the terms of the headings and any relative chapter notes.
Chapter 62, HTSUS, provides for articles of apparel and clothing accessories not knitted or crocheted. Additional
U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 62, HTSUS, in addressing the term ``water resistant'', refers to garments classified within
certain subheadings of the chapter. On separate occasions, Customs determined that the hood was a peripheral aspect
of the garment. Accordingly, when a water resistant analysis was conducted, no consideration was given to the hood,
i.e., whether it was or was not water resistant.


Several rulings were issued following this rationale. 

See

 DD 888234, DD884731, NY 887628 and NY 874163. This list may not be exhaustive. There may be others issued by Customs
in the various Customs districts.


Proposed Change of Practice



As a result of our reexamination of the issue we find that Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 62, HTSUS, has not been applied
to its proper effect. There is nothing in the language of that Note which suggests that only a portion of a garment be
made water resistant in order for the entire garment to be classifiable as water resistant. The test, as it is written,
applies to the complete garment. On water resistant garments, the hood contributes materially to the garment's usefulness
and, essentially, is an integral part of the garment itself. The hood adds significant additional protection to the
wearer in times of inclement weather.
This change in practice only relates to water resistant garments with non-water resistant hoods that are an integral
part of the garment (i.e. permanently attached to the garment).


Authority




This notice is published in accordance with section 177.10, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10).


Comments



Before adopting this proposed change in practice, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted
to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552), section 1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between
the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Office of Regulations and Rulings, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street, N.W.,

1. Authority 


Title I, Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301-5320); 24 CFR part 570, subpart F. 


2. Background 


Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 authorizes the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
Program. Section 106 of Title I permits the States to elect to assume the administrative responsibility for the CDBG
Program for nonentitled areas within their jurisdiction. Section 106 provides that HUD will administer the CDBG
Program for nonentitled areas within any State that does not elect to assume the administrative responsibility for
the program. Subpart F of 24 CFR part 570 sets out the requirements for HUD's administration of the CDBG Program in nonentitled
areas (Small Cities Program). This NOFA supplements subpart F of 24 CFR part 570, which sets out the requirements applicable
to the CDBG Program in nonentitled areas. 
In accordance with 24 CFR 570.420(e) and 570.420(h)(3), and with the requirements of section 102 of the Housing and
Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act), HUD is issuing this NOFA for New York State's Small Cities Program
for Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 to announce the allocation of funds for Single Purpose and Comprehensive grants, and to establish
the deadline for filing grant applications. The NOFA explains how HUD will apply the regulatory threshold requirements
for funding eligibility, and the selection criteria for rating and scoring applications for Comprehensive grants
and for scoring projects in applications for Single Purpose grants. 
The Department has proposed regulations at 24 CFR 570.420-32 which govern the HUD-administered Small Cities
program in New York. These regulations will modify the HUD-administered Small Cities program to allow for multi-year
plans. 
The multi-year plan competition will permit the Department to select multi-year plans of two or three years in a competition
that will allow the first year to be funded. The Department intends to fund future years of the plan on a non-competitive
basis, pursuant to acceptable performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, the provision
of adequate appropriations for the HUD-administered Small Cities program, and publication of a final rule. 
Section I.A.3 of this NOFA provides a description of certain statutory amendments that apply to the HUD-Administered
Small Cities Program, even though conforming regulations have not yet been adopted. The statutory amendments listed
in Section I.A.3 require little or no regulatory elaboration. Conforming amendments will be made to 24 CFR part 570,
subpart F in future rulemaking. Other information about the Small Cities Program will be provided in the application
kit, which will be made available to applicants by HUD's New York Office and Buffalo Office. 


3. Statutory Changes 


Both the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub.L. 101-625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA) and the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act) amended Title
I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the HCD Act). Various amendments made by the two recent statutes
are applicable, as described below, to the funds made available under this NOFA.

<PARENT> FR941205-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. 

Principal Benefit Certification.

 NAHA amended section 101(c) of the HCD Act to require that at least 70 percent of the CDBG assistance provided over a
specified period must be used for activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Applicants
must certify that CDBG assistance will be used as required by the amended section 101(c). The principal benefit certification
has been revised to incorporate this change from 60 percent to 70 percent. 
b. 

Program Income.

 In determining the applicability of CDBG requirements to the use of program income, section 804 of the 1992 Act removes
any consideration of whether the grantee is still participating in the CDBG program. This means that program income
generated from projects funded in FY 1993 and thereafter will always be subject to all of the CDBG requirements. 
c. 

Microenterprise and Small Business Development.

 Section 807(c) of the 1992 Act defines a ``small business'' as one that meets the criteria set forth in section 3(a)
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)), and defines a ``microenterprise'' as a commercial enterprise having
five or fewer employees, one or more of whom own the enterprise. 
Additionally, section 807(c) of the 1992 Act provides that in the provision of assistance under  570.203(b)
to for-profit microenterprises and small businesses, HUD will not consider the use of CDBG funds for training, technical
assistance, and other support costs provided to such entities to be planning or administrative costs. 
(Section 807(c) also directs HUD not to consider CDBG funds as being used for a planning or administrative activity
when the funds are used to pay costs to develop the capacity of the grantee (or a subrecipient) to provide training,
technical assistance or other support services to small businesses or microenterprises. Consequently_since these
activities are not to be considered as planning or administrative activities_they 

are

 subject to compliance with the national objective requirements.) 

d. 

Lump Sum Drawdowns.

 The use of lump sum drawdowns for residential rehabilitation has been re-authorized for CDBG funds appropriated
after Fiscal Year 1992. 
e. 

Eligible Activities.

 (1) 

Changes Affecting Existing Categories. 


(a) 

Assistance to For-Profit Businesses.

 Section 806(b) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a) of the HCD Act so that CDBG assistance provided to for-profit businesses
is not limited to activities for which no other forms of assistance are available, or to activities that could not be
accomplished, but for that assistance. 
(b) 

Direct Homeownership Assistance.

 NAHA amended section 105(a) of the HCD Act to provide that CDBG funds can be used to provide direct assistance to facilitate
and expand homeownership among persons of low- and moderate-income. Under this provision, CDBG funds may be used
to: subsidize interest rates and mortgage principal amounts for low- and moderate-income homebuyers; finance the
acquisition by low- and moderate-income homebuyers of housing that is occupied by the homebuyers; acquire guarantees
for mortgage financing obtained by low- and moderate-income homebuyers from private lenders (except that assistance
under Title I of the HCD Act may not be used by recipients or subrecipients to guarantee mortgage financing directly);
provide up to 50 percent of the downpayment required from low- and moderate-income buyers; and pay reasonable closing
costs normally associated with the purchase of a home incurred by a low- and moderate-income homebuyer. While this
provision was set to expire on October 1, 1993, it has been extended to October 1, 1994 by section 807(b) of the 1992 Act,
with authority for HUD to extend the date for an additional year. HUD published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on September 30, 1994 to officially extend the expiration date to October 1, 1995. Under the terms of this provision,
the locality must commit funds to a specific homeowner prior to October 1, 1995.

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Code Enforcement

. Section 807(e) of the 1992 Act adds ``private improvements or services'' undertaken in an area to the list of activities
that may be considered, together with code enforcement, in determining whether CDBG funds may be used to pay for the
code enforcement in an area. 
(d) 

Loans to Subrecipients. 

Section 807(d) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a)(14) of the HCD Act to authorize the use of CDBG assistance for activities
in the form of loans_both interim and long-term_as well as grants. 
(e) 

Public Service Cap. 

NAHA amended section 105(a)(8) of the HCD Act by placing the 15 percent cap for public services on each State's total
nonentitlement CDBG allocation, plus 15 percent of program income anticipated to be received in the fiscal year.
(Previously, the 15 percent cap for public services was applied to each recipient's grant.) As a result of this provision,
HUD may award a grant to a recipient for public service activities with 100 percent of the funds spent for public service
activities. However, any application requesting funds for public service activities must be ratable under one of
the existing Single Purpose or the Comprehensive grant categories. HUD will apply the 15 percent statewide cap to
public service activities by funding public service activities in the highest-rated applications until the cap
is reached. 

(f) 

Neighborhood-Based Nonprofit Organizations. 

Section 807(f) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a)(15) of the HCD Act to add nonprofit organizations serving the
development needs of communities in nonentitlement areas as entities eligible to carry out CDBG activities. 
(2) New Categories of Eligible Activities. (a) Nonprofit Capacity Building. Section 807(a)(4) makes eligible the
provision of technical assistance to public or nonprofit entities to increase the capacity of these entities to carry
out eligible neighborhood revitalization or economic development activities. Section 807(a)(4) makes clear,
however, that the use of funds for technical assistance is not to be considered as a planning or administrative cost
of the program. Before the amendment, the use of CDBG funds for nonprofit capacity building was an eligible activity
only under  570.205, and therefore was subject to the cap on planning and administration set out at  570.200(g).
While nonprofit capacity building is now eligible under the new provision and is not subject to a percentage limitation,
it should be noted that any such use of funds under the new authority must be shown to meet one of the national objectives.
(This may be difficult in some cases, since all activities carried out by the nonprofit using the added capacity will
need to be considered for that purpose.) 

(b) 

Institutions of Higher Education. 

Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act makes it possible for a grantee to provide CDBG funds to institutions of higher education
to carry out activities otherwise eligible for CDBG assistance, provided that it can be determined that the institution
has demonstrated a capability to carry out such activities. 
(c) 

Acquisition by Tax Foreclosure. 

Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act makes eligible the use of CDBG funds to make essential repairs and to pay operating
expenses necessary to maintain the habitability of housing units acquired through tax foreclosure proceedings
in order to prevent abandonment and deterioration of housing in primarily low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.

(d) 

Microenterprises. 

Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act establishes a new category of eligibility under which CDBG funds may be used to provide
assistance to public and private organizations, agencies, and other entities (including nonprofit and for-profit
entities) to enable these entities to facilitate economic development by: 
 Providing credit (including providing direct loans and loan guarantees, establishing revolving loan funds,
and facilitating peer lending programs) for the establishment, stabilization, and expansion of microenterprises;

 Providing technical assistance, advice, and business support services (including assistance, advice,
and support relating to developing business plans, securing funding, conducting marketing, and otherwise engaging
in microenterprise activities) to owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises; and 
 Providing general support (such as peer support programs and counseling) to the owners of microenterprises
and to persons developing microenterprises. 
(e) 

Housing Services. 

Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act, as amended by section 207 of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform
Act of 1994, establishes a new category of eligibility for ``housing services''. Housing services include housing
counseling, energy auditing, preparation of work specifications, loan processing, inspections, tenant selection,
management of tenant-based rental assistance, and other services related to assisting owners, tenants, contractors,
and other entities, participating or seeking to participate in housing activities authorized under the HOME program.


(f) 

Lead-Based Paint Hazards. 

Section 1012 of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a) by stating that CDBG funds may be used for lead-based paint hazard
evaluation and reduction, as defined in section 1004 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of
1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851). It should be noted that  570.202(a)(iv) currently authorizes inspection and abatement
of lead-based paint in conjunction with CDBG-assisted rehabilitation. Additionally,  570.205 authorizes
evaluation of lead-based paint hazards within the jurisdiction generally. Until the regulations are modified to
incorporate this new provision, grantees may use the new authority to fund lead-based paint inspection of houses
whether or not rehabilitation of the houses will be CDBG-funded. The new authority may also be used to fund large scale
evaluation of lead based-paint hazards in the community (assuming that it is an approved activity in the Small Cities
application), outside of the 20 percent limitation on planning and administration cost, if the grantee can demonstrate
that the evaluation addresses a CDBG national objective. 

(3) Changes Concerning National Objectives. (a) Low/Mod Jobs Presumption. Section 806(e) of the 1992 Act amends
section 105(c) of the HCD Act by adding a new paragraph (4) which states that, for purposes of determining whether an
activity involves the employment of persons the majority of whom are low- and moderate-income persons, a person may
be presumed to be a low- and moderate-income person in either of the following circumstances: 
 if the employee resides in, or the assisted activity through which he or she is employed, is located in a census
tract that meets the Federal enterprise zone eligibility criteria; or 
 the employee resides in a census tract where not less than 70 percent of the residents are low- and moderate-income
persons. 

The provision of new paragraph (4) concerning the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons residing in a census
tract was effective upon enactment. However, because existing HUD regulations do not clearly apply enterprise zone
criteria to census tracts, the portion of new paragraph (4) concerning census tracts that meet the Federal enterprise
zone eligibility criteria will not become effective until regulations are established identifying the specific
criteria that must be met. 
f. 

Housing Strategies. 

Any applicant which plans to undertake a housing activity with Fiscal Year 1995 funds under the HUD-administered
Small Cities Program must prepare and submit a comprehensive housing affordability strategy (CHAS) to be eligible
to apply for such assistance. In order to receive funding if the Small Cities application is approved, the housing
strategy must be approved by HUD. Further, any Small Cities application for which a housing strategy is required must
include a certification that the application is consistent with the housing strategy.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00133 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Current CHAS regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 1, 1992, at 57 FR 40038, as amended, in part, on March 12, 1993 at 58 FR 13686. These regulations are codified
in 24 CFR part 91. Applicants under this NOFA are permitted to use an abbreviated housing strategy, as set forth in  91.25
of the CHAS regulations. Applicants are advised to begin preparation of the abbreviated strategy at the earliest
possible time in order to have sufficient time to fulfill the applicable citizen participation requirements, which
provide that the strategy must be available to the public for at least thirty days before its submission to HUD. Additional
information about abbreviated strategy requirements is provided in the application kit. 
If possible, applicants should endeavor to submit the abbreviated strategy in advance of the Small Cities application
due date. The latest time at which the abbreviated strategy will be accepted by HUD for the HUD-administered Small
Cities Program in New York will be the application due date for the Small Cities application. Failure to submit the
abbreviated strategy by the due date is not a curable technical deficiency. As noted in Section II.C.2. of this NOFA,
certain applicants may satisfy this submission requirement by submitting amendments which update the CHAS or abbreviated
strategy submitted in conjunction with their Fiscal Year 1994 application. Questions regarding the housing strategies
should be directed to the appropriate HUD field office. 
Complete Small Cities applications for which the abbreviated strategy has been submitted but not yet approved will
still be rated and ranked with the other applications; if determined to be fundable, those applications will receive
a conditional approval subject to approval of the abbreviated strategy. However, such an approval will be rescinded
if the abbreviated strategy has not been approved by HUD within 60 days from the date that the conditional approval
has been announced. In such event the funding will be awarded to the highest rated fundable applicant that did not receive
funding under this competition. 
g. 

Section 3. 

Assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published on June 30,
1994 (59 FR 33866). One of the purposes of this NOFA, which is consistent with section 3, is to give, to the greatest extent
feasible and consistent with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other
contracting opportunities generated from certain HUD financial assistance to low- and very low-income persons.
Public entities awarded funds under this NOFA, and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing
construction, or other public construction must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in the regulations
published on June 30, 1994. 


4. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance: Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient
Disclosures



HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by HUD. (See also Section II.D. of this NOFA.) On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional
information that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information
on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public access, and applicant and recipient disclosure
requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: 

a. 

HUD Responsibilities. 

(1) Documentation and Public Access. HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application
submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied.
This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period
beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD
will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 

(2) Disclosures. HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880)
submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant
disclosure reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and
updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 
b. 

Units of General Local Government Responsibilities. 

Units of general local government awarded assistance under this NOFA are subject to the provisions of either paragraph
b(1), 

or

 paragraph (b)(2) 

and

 (b)(3). For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA which in turn make the assistance available
on a NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraph b(1) applies. For units
of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA, which in turn make the assistance available on a COMPETITIVE
BASIS for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraphs b(2) 

and

 (3) apply.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00134 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Disclosures. The units of general local government receiving assistance under this NOFA must make all applicant
disclosure reports available to the public for three years. Required update reports must be made available along
with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. Each unit of general local
government may use HUD Form 2880 to collect the disclosures, or may develop its own form. (See 24 CFR 12 subpart C, and
the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 
(2) Documentation and Public Access. The recipient unit of general local government must ensure that documentation
and other information regarding each application submitted to the recipient by a subrecipient applicant are adequate
to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. The unit of general local government must make
this material, including any letters of support, available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning
not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Unit of general local government recipients must also notify
the public of the subrecipients of the assistance. Each recipient will develop documentation, public access, and
notification procedures for its programs. (See 24 CFR 12.14(b) and 12.16(c), and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for more information on these documentation and public access requirements.) 
(3) Disclosures. Units of general local government receiving assistance under this NOFA must make all applicant
disclosure reports available to the public for five years. Required update reports must be made available along with
the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. Each unit of general local government
may use HUD Form 2880 to collect the disclosures, or may develop its own form. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 


B. Allocation Amounts 


1. Total Available Funding


The nonentitlement CDBG funds for New York State for FY 1995 total approximately $50,616,000. $44,438,000 is allocated
for distribution to eligible units of general local government within the jurisdiction of HUD's Buffalo Office.
$6,178,000 is allocated for distribution to eligible units of general local government within the jurisdiction
of HUD's New York Office. HUD has the option to revise these allocations in order to assure a competitive distribution
of funds. 


2. Imminent Threats


 All imminent threat projects must meet the national objective of benefitting low-and moderate-income persons.
The Department may elect to set aside up to 15% of the Fiscal Year 1995 allocation for imminent threat projects. These
funds will be available until the rating and ranking process for funds distributed under this NOFA is completed. 


C. Eligibility 


1. Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants are units of general local government in New York State, excluding: metropolitan cities, urban
counties, units of government which are participating in urban counties or metropolitan cities even if only part
of the participating unit of government is located in the urban county or metropolitan city, and Indian tribes eligible
for 
assistance under section 106 of the HCD Act. Applications may be submitted individually or jointly. 


2. Previous grantees


 Eligible applicants, which previously have been awarded Small Cities Program CDBG grants, are also subject to an
evaluation of capacity and performance. Numerical thresholds for drawdown of funds have been established to assist
HUD in evaluating a grantee's progress in implementing its program activities. (These standards apply to all CDBG
Program grants received by the community.) An additional threshold established this year relates to the submission
of annual Performance Assessment Reports (PARs) which are due annually for each grant which a local government has
received. Failure to submit a PAR is not a curable technical deficiency. Applicants generally will be determined
to have performed adequately in the area(s) where the thresholds are met. Where a threshold has not been met, HUD will
evaluate the documentation of any mitigating factors, particularly with respect to actions taken by the applicant
to accelerate the implementation of its program activities.

<TEXT>
 

3. Eligible Activities and National Objectives


Eligible activities under the Small Cities CDBG Program are those identified in subpart C of 24 CFR part 570. Each activity
must meet one of the national objectives (i.e. benefit to low- and moderate-income persons, elimination of slums
or blighting conditions, or meeting imminent threats to the health and safety of the community), and each grant must
meet the requirements for compliance with the primary objective of principally benefitting low- and moderate-income
persons, as required under the provisions of  570.200(a) (2) and (3) and  570.208, which supersede  570.420(h)(2).
As described in Section I.A.3.a. of this NOFA, the principal benefit requirement was increased by NAHA from 60 to 70
percent. The method of calculating the use of these funds for compliance with the 70 percent overall benefit requirement
is set forth in  570.200(a)(3) (i) through (v). 


4. Environmental Review Requirement


The HUD environmental review procedures contained in 24 CFR part 58 apply to this program. Under part 58, grantees
assume all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decision-making and action pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the other provisions of law specified by the Secretary in 24 CFR part 58 that would
apply to the Secretary were he to undertake such projects as Federal projects. 


D. Types of Grants


1. Comprehensive Grants


a. 

General. 

Comprehensive grants are available to fund projects which meet the following criteria: 
(1) Address a substantial portion of the identified community development needs within a defined area or areas; 
(2) Involve two or more activities related to each other that will be carried out in a coordinated manner; 
(3) Have a beneficial impact within a reasonable period of time. 
HUD may make an exception to the requirement that all activities must be carried out in a defined area or areas if the
applicant can demonstrate that the comprehensive strategy is a reasonable means of addressing identified needs.

If an application for a Comprehensive grant does not meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Grant Program, HUD
will rate the proposal as a Single Purpose grant. 
b. 

Grant Limits and Funding Requirements. 

The maximum grant for a Comprehensive grant is $900,000. Up to 25% of the FY 1995 allocation may be made available for
Comprehensive grants. Grant funds requested must be sufficient, either by themselves or in combination with funds
from other sources, to complete the project within a reasonable amount of time. If other sources of funds are to be used
with respect to a project, the source of those funds must be identified and the level of commitment indicated. 


2. Single Purpose Grants


a. 

General. 

Single Purpose grants are designed to address and resolve a specific community development need. A Single Purpose
grant may consist of more than one project. A project may consist of one activity or a set of activities. Each project
must address community development needs in one of the following problem areas:



_Housing 
_Public Facilities 
_Economic Development.



Each project will be rated against all other projects addressing the same problem area, according to the criteria
outlined below. It should be noted that each project within an application will be given a separate impact 
rating, if each one is clearly designated by the applicant as a separate and distinct project (i.e. separate Needs
Description, Community Development 
Activities, Impact Description and Program Schedule forms have been filled out, indicating project names). In some
cases, it may be to the applicant's advantage to designate separate projects for activities that can ``stand on their
own'' in terms of meeting the described need, especially where a particular project would tend to weaken the impact
rating of the other activities, if they were rated as a whole, as has been the case with some economic development and
housing projects. If, however, the projects tend to meet impact criteria to the same extent, or the weaker element
is only a small portion of the overall project, there is no discernable benefit in designating separate projects.

b. 

Grant Limits and Funding Requirements. 

The maximum annual grant for a Single Purpose grant is $400,000, except that counties may apply for up to $600,000 in
Single Purpose funds. At least 75 percent of the FY 1995 allocation will be made available for Single Purpose Grants.
The maximum amount for Single Purpose grant applications made jointly by units of general local government will be
$600,000. If other sources of funds are to be used with respect to a project, the source of those funds must be identified
and the level of commitment indicated. 


3. Applications With Multiple Projects


If an application contains more than one project, each project will be rated separately for program impact. Applicants
should note that regardless of the number of projects, the total grant amount cannot exceed the limits identified
in Section I.D.1.b and I.D.2.b. of this NOFA. 


4. Multiyear Plans


a. 

General. 

Multiyear plan grants are available to fund projects that will have a substantial and comprehensive effect on meeting
the grantees identified community development needs. It is envisioned that the large majority of multiyear plan
projects will address a defined area or areas, but grantees may apply for grants for activities that will affect the
grantees entire jurisdiction.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Multiyear plans may be for two or three years. The action plan for each year of the multiyear plan must be a viable project
on its own. The multiyear plans will be rated competitively against each other. Multiyear plans that are selected
will be funded for the first year of the plan. HUD intends to fund succeeding years of the plan on a non-competitive basis,
subject to acceptable performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, and the provision
of adequate appropriations for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program. HUD reserves the right to lower the amount
of funds for succeeding years if nonentitled areas are not in compliance with performance requirements and applicable
regulations. 
b. 

Grant Limits and Funding Requirements.

 The maximum annual grant for a multiyear plan is $900,000. The maximum funding for implementing an entire multiyear
plan is $1,800,000 for a two year multiyear plan, and $2,700,000 for a three year multiyear plan. Grant funds requested
must be sufficient, either by themselves or in combination with funds from other sources, to complete the project
within a reasonable amount of time. If other sources of funds are to be used with respect to a project, the source of those
funds must be identified and the level of commitment indicated. 



E. Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors and Final Selection 


1. General 


Complete applications received from eligible applicants by the application due date are rated and scored by HUD.
Regardless of the type of grant sought (Single Purpose or Comprehensive), applications are rated and scored against
four factors. These four factors are discussed in more detail in subsection 3 of this Section E. Previous grantees
of Small Cities Program 
CDBG grants also undergo a performance evaluation. The criteria for determining adequacy of performance are discussed
in subsection 2 of this Section E. 


2. Performance Evaluation 


As noted in Section C of this NOFA, previous grantees of Small Cities Program CDBG grants are subject to an evaluation
of performance and capacity to undertake the proposed program. 
For purposes of making performance evaluations, HUD will use any information available as of the application due
date. Performance also will be evaluated using information which may be available already to HUD, including previously
submitted performance reports, site visit reports, audits, monitoring reports and annual in-house reviews. Grantees
may be requested to submit additional information, if generally available facts raise a question as to capacity to
undertake the proposed program. No grants will be made to an applicant that does not have the capacity to undertake
the proposed program. A performance determination will be made by evaluation of the following areas: 
a. 

Community Development Activities.

 The following thresholds for performance in expending CDBG funds have been established for FY 1995 and pertain to
all Single Purpose and Comprehensive Grants:

b. 

Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations.

 An applicant will be considered to have performed inadequately if the applicant: 
(1) Has not substantially complied with the laws, regulations, and Executive Orders applicable to the CDBG Program,
including applicable civil rights laws as may be evidenced by: an outstanding finding of civil rights noncompliance,
unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed
to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against
it by a private individual, unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order
designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; a deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations;
a pending civil rights suit brought against it by the Department of Justice; or an unresolved charge of discrimination
issued against it by the Secretary under section 810(g) of the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400; 
(2) Has not resolved or attempted to resolve findings made as a result of HUD monitoring; or 
(3) Has not resolved or attempted to resolve audit findings. 
An applicant will be ineligible for a grant where the inadequate performance in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations evidences a lack of capacity to carry out the proposed project or program. An application also will not
be accepted from a unit of general local government which has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation
for any HUD program. Additionally, applications will not be accepted from any entity which proposes an activity in
a unit of general local government that has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation for any HUD program.
The Director of the Community Planning and Development Division of the HUD field office may provide waivers to this
prohibition, but in no instance will a waiver be provided where funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement
for repayment of the debt has been made. 
c. 

Performance Assessment Reports.

 Under 24 CFR 570.507, Small Cities CDBG grantees are required to submit Performance Assessment Reports (PARs) annually
on the date when the grant was originally executed. For an application for FY 1995 funds to be considered for funding,
the applicant must be current in its submission of Performance Assessment Reports. Failure to submit a PAR is not a
curable technical deficiency under Section V of this NOFA. 


3. Four Factor Rating


As noted in subsections 1 and 3 of this Section E, all applications are rated and scored against four factors. These
four factors are: 



_Need based on absolute number of persons in poverty; 
_Need based on the percent of persons in poverty; 
_Program Impact; and 
_Outstanding performance in fair housing and equal opportunity. 



A maximum of 615 points is possible under this system with the maximum points for each factor being: 






Each of the four factors is outlined below. All points for each factor are rounded to the nearest whole number. Applicants
should note that there is a distinct difference in the methods used to evaluate Program Impact for Single Purpose grants
versus Program Impact for Comprehensive grants. These differences are more fully discussed below. 
a. 

Need_Absolute number of persons in poverty.

 HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the absolute number of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit
of general local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately
for this factor. Applicants which are county governments are rated separately from all other applicants. Applicants
in each group are compared in terms of the number of persons whose incomes are below the poverty level. Individual scores
are obtained by dividing each applicant's absolute number of persons in poverty by the greatest number of persons
in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75.

b. 

Need_Percent of persons in poverty

. HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the percent of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit of general
local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately for this factor.
Applicants in each group are compared in terms of the percentage of their population below the poverty level. Individual
scores are obtained by dividing each applicant's percentage of persons in poverty by the highest percentage of persons
in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75. 
c. 

Program Impact_General

. In evaluating program impact, HUD will consider:

 

_Extent and seriousness of the identified needs; 
_Results to be achieved; 
_Number of beneficiaries, given the type of program; 
_Nature of the benefit; 
_Additional actions that may be necessary to fully resolve the need; 
_Previous coordinated actions taken by the applicant to address the need; 
_Environmental considerations; 
_Whether displacement will be involved and what steps will be taken to minimize displacement and to mitigate its adverse
effects or related hardships; and 
_Where appropriate, housing site selection standards. 


 

Assessments are done on a comparative basis and, as a result, it is important that each applicant present information
in a detailed and uniform manner. 
In addressing Program Impact criteria, applicants should adhere to the following general guidelines for quantification.
Where appropriate, absolute and percentage figures should be used to describe the extent of community development
needs and the impact of the proposed program. This includes, but is not limited to, appropriate units of measure (e.g.,
number of housing units or structures, linear feet of pipe, pounds per square inch, etc.), and costs per unit of measure.
These quantification guidelines apply to the description of need, the nature of proposed activities and the extent
to which the proposed program will address the identified need. 
Appropriate documentation should be provided to support the degree of need described in the application. Basically,
the sources for all statements and conclusions relating to community needs should be included in the application
or incorporated by reference. Examples of appropriate documentation include planning studies, letters from public
agencies, newspaper articles, photographs and survey data. 
Generally, the most effective documentation is that which specifically addresses the subject matter and has a high
degree of credibility. Applicants which intend to conduct surveys to obtain data are advised to contact the appropriate
HUD office prior to conducting the survey for a determination as to whether the survey methodology is statistically
acceptable. 
There are a number of program design factors related to feasibility which can alter significantly the award of impact
points. Accordingly, it is imperative that applicants provide adequate documentation in addressing these factors.
Common feasibility issues include site control, availability of other funding sources, validity of cost estimates,
and status of financial commitments as well as evidence of the status of regulatory agency review and approval. 
Past productivity and administrative performance of prior grantees will be taken into consideration when reviewing
the overall feasibility of the program. Overall program design, administration and guidelines are other feasibility
issues that should be articulated and presented in the application, since they are critical in assessing the effectiveness
and impact of the proposed program. 
(1) 

Program Impact_Single Purpose Grants

. Each project will be rated against other projects addressing the same problem area, so that, for example, housing
projects only will be compared with other housing projects, according to the criteria outlined below. It should be
noted that each project within an application will be given a separate impact rating, if each one is clearly designated
by the applicant as a separate and distinct project (i.e. separate Needs Descriptions, Community Development Activities,
and Impact Description and Program Schedule forms have been filled out, indicating separate project names). 
In some cases, it may be to the applicant's advantage to designate separate projects for activities that can ``stand
on their own'' in terms of meeting the described need, especially where a particular project would tend to weaken the
impact rating of the other activities, if they were all related as a whole, as has been the case with some economic development
projects. If, however, the projects tend to meet the impact criteria to the same extent, or the weaker element is only
a small portion of the overall program, there is no discernable benefit in designating separate projects. 
Applicants should bear in mind that the impact of the proposed project will be judged by persons who may not be familiar
with the particular community. Accordingly, individual projects will be rated according to how well the application
demonstrates in specific, measurable terms, the extent to which the impact criteria are met. General statements
of need and impact alone will not be sufficient to obtain a favorable rating. 
(a) 

Program Impact_Single Purpose_Housing

. There are three distinct types of Single Purpose Housing projects: Housing Rehabilitation, Creation of New Housing
and Direct Homeownership Assistance. Separate rating criteria are provided for each type of project. 
(i) 

Housing Rehabilitation. Needs

. Each application should provide information on the total number of units in the project area, the number that are
substandard, and the number of substandard units occupied by low- and moderate-income households. The purpose of
this information is to establish the relative severity of housing conditions within the designated project area
compared to other housing rehabilitation applications. The application also should describe the date and methodology
of any surveys used to obtain the information, including an explicit and detailed definition of ``substandard''.

<PARENT> FR941205-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Surveys of Housing Conditions

. Surveys of housing conditions serve several purposes in evaluating applications for housing rehabilitation activities.
These include establishing the seriousness of need for such assistance in the project area, providing a basis for
estimating overall budgetary needs, and providing an indication of the marketability of the project. 



Project Design and Feasibility

. The application should describe the project in sufficient detail to allow the reviewer to assess its feasibility
and its probable impact on the conditions described. It also should describe project requirements in such a way that
regulatory and policy concerns will be addressed. 

In reviewing applications from grantees with prior housing rehabilitation projects, reasonableness of cost-per-unit,
stated in the application, will be compared against the grantee's actual past performance. All applications should
provide documentation to justify the cost-per-unit estimates, particularly grantees where past performance does
not support the estimates in the applications. 

It should be noted that HUD encourages communities to design projects supplementing CDBG rehabilitation funds with
private funds wherever feasible and appropriate, especially in the case of rental units and housing not occupied
by lower income persons. In such cases, the CDBG subsidy should be as low as possible, while retaining sufficient incentive
to attract local participants. On the other hand, projects designed for low income homeowners should not require
private contributions at a level that puts the project out of reach of potential participants. 

Where the creation of new units is proposed through conversion, the application should document the need for additional
units based on vacancy rates, waiting lists, and other pertinent information. The proposed project clearly must
support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from the rehabilitation
of currently vacant structures, conversion of non-residential structure for residential use, or new construction
projects for which the proposed project will provide non-construction assistance. 

Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document
the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely
affect project impact. Applicants should address issues of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing
feasibility from the standpoint of market financing. 

The impact of the proposed project will be based on the degree of need, the number of units to be created, overall feasibility
and the nature and cost of the proposed activities. 

For projects consisting of more than one activity, the activity that directly addresses the need must represent at
least the majority of funds requested. Other activities must be incidental to and in support of the principal activity.
For example, public improvements included in a rehabilitation project that addresses housing need must: be a relatively
small amount in terms of funds requested; clearly be in support of the housing objective; and demonstrate a positive
and direct link to the national objective. 

For incidental activities claiming benefit to low- and moderate-income persons on an area basis, the application
must document that at least 51 percent of the residents of the service area meet the low- and moderate-income requirement.
Funds should not be requested for activities that are not incidental to, and in support of the principal activity.




Scoring

. Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Accordingly, it is difficult
to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all projects receiving a particular rating will match all the criteria point-by-point, in the same manner.
The objective for non-target area projects, in as much as they are sparsely populated, only should be to assist low-
and moderate-income persons. Accordingly, the following standard will be used for rating housing rehabilitation
projects: 



Maximum (400 Points) 



1. Severe need is shown in the project area, in terms of the proportion of units that are substandard and the extent of
disrepair in the units. 

2. The project would bring all, or almost all, of the units in the project area up to standard. 

3. There are no feasibility questions, such as availability of other resources, marketability, or appropriateness
of project design, which would hinder the timely completion of the project as proposed. 

4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other housing projects. 

5. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Substantial (300 Points) 



1. Serious need is shown. 

2. Project would bring most of the units in the area up to standard. 

3. There are no major feasibility questions. 

4. Benefits a substantial number of persons. 

5. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Moderate (200 Points) 



1. Serious need is shown, but is not as well documented as in other applications. 

2. Project would bring units up to standard, but not to the same extent as other applications. 

3. There may be some minor feasibility questions. 

4. Benefits a significant number of persons. 

5. Moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

Minimal (100 Points) 


1. Some need is evident, but it is not serious compared to other applications, or is not well documented. 
2. Project may bring most units up to standard, but not to same extent as in other applications. 
3. There are serious feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a small number of persons. 
5. Minimally supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Insignificant

1. Very little need has been demonstrated. 
2. Project would not rehabilitate most units. 
3. There are serious feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a very small number of persons. 
5. Does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 




(ii) Creation of New Housing

. CDBG funds may be used to support the construction of new housing units, and, in certain circumstances, to finance
the actual cost of constructing new units. New construction may be carried out by an eligible non-profit entity pursuant
to 24 CFR 570.204, or as last resort housing. Support of new construction could include activities such as the acquisition
and/or clearance of land, the provision of infrastructure, or the payment of certain planning costs. 
Where the creation of new units is proposed, the application should document the need for additional units based on
vacancy rates, waiting lists, and other pertinent information. The proposed project clearly must support, or result
in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from new construction projects for
which the proposed project will provide non-construction assistance. 
Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document
the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely
affect project impact. Applicants should address issues of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing
feasibility from the standpoint of market financing. 
The impact of the proposed project will be based on the degree of need, the number of units to be created, overall feasibility
and the nature and cost of the proposed activities. 


Scoring

. Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Accordingly, it is difficult
to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all projects receiving a particular rating will match all the criteria point-by-point, in the same manner.
Accordingly, the following standard will be used for rating projects supporting new housing construction: 


Maximum 

(400 Points) 


1. Severe need for new housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons is shown in the project area. 
2. Project would create a large number of new housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income persons.

of project design, which would hinder the timely completion of the project as proposed. 
4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other new housing projects. 
5. Project would affirmatively further fair housing choice by resulting in the spatial deconcentration of minorities
throughout the community, or would provide spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income households if there
are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Substantial (300 Points) 


1. Serious need for new units affordable to low- and moderate-income persons is shown. 
2. Project would create a substantial number of new housing units. 
3. There are no major feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a substantial number of persons. 
5. Project would affirmatively further fair housing choice through significant efforts toward the spatial deconcentration
of minorities throughout the community, or would provide significant efforts toward spatial deconcentration of
low- and moderate-income households if there are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Moderate (200 Points) 


1. Serious need is shown, but is not as well documented as in other applications. 
2. Project would create new units but not a substantial number. 
3. There may be some minor feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a significant number of persons. 
5. Project would have some effect of affirmatively furthering fair housing choice by encouraging spatial deconcentration
of minorities throughout the community, or would encourage spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income
households if there are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Minimal (100 Points) 


1. Some need is evident, but it is not serious compared to other applications, or is not well documented.

households if there are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 




(iii) 

Direct Homeownership Assistance

. Homeownership activities are defined as activities which would promote homeownership within the applicant jurisdiction,
focusing particularly on aiding low- and moderate-income persons in becoming homeowners. While declining to identify
any particular type of proposed project as superior, HUD is identifying several criteria which must be addressed
within the project design, in order for the application to receive the maximum project impact. 
Applications must include a well developed description of homeownership needs in the applicant jurisdiction, focusing
particularly on the needs of low- and moderate-income persons. The description also should include, if applicable,
any alternative approaches which have been considered in meeting homeownership needs. Project feasibility must
be addressed as part of the application. 
The application must demonstrate that the proposed project would make effective use of all available funds. This
would include any local, State or other Federal funds which would be utilized by the proposed project. If other such
funds are included as part of the proposed project, the applicant must demonstrate that such funds are committed and
truly available for the project. Any efforts which would affirmatively further fair housing, by promoting homeownership
among minorities as well as homeownership throughout the community, must be outlined in the application. 
The application must explain how the project would benefit low- and moderate-income homebuyers, particularly focusing
on first-time and minority homebuyers. The application also should address any homeownership counseling services,
including counseling pertaining to Federal, State, and local fair housing laws and requirements, which would be
provided to persons selected to participate in the proposed project. Finally, the application should describe how
the project would utilize public/private partnerships to promote homeownership, particularly in the sense that
private sector financing would be accessible, as necessary, to project participants to complement available public
sector funds, including CDBG money. 
HUD will review each application which meets the threshold against the following criteria: 


Maximum (400 Points) 


1. Project design is appropriate to meet demonstrated homeownership need and alternative approaches to meeting
the need are shown to have been considered. Additionally, there are no feasibility questions regarding the implementation
and execution of the proposed project according to the schedule. 
2. The application documents serious homeownership needs in the community and the proposed project would make effective
use of available funds. 
3. The proposed project would affirmatively further fair housing by including initiatives to reach out to potential
minority homeowners and by promoting homeownership opportunities throughout the community. 
4. The proposed project would target first-time homebuyers. 
5. The proposed project would provide homeownership counseling to project participants. 
6. The proposed project would complement other Federal, State or local programs which promote homeownership. 
7. The proposed project would utilize public/private partnerships in attempting to promote homeownership, particularly
in regard to participation by local financial institutions. 
8. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Substantial (300 Points) 


1. Project design demonstrates a workable approach to homeownership assistance needs, and there are no major feasibility
questions regarding implementation of the proposed project. 
2. Substantial homeownership needs are documented by the application, and the proposed project would make effective
use of available funds. 
3. The proposed project would affirmatively further fair housing by promoting homeownership opportunities throughout
the community. 
4. The proposed project would encourage homeownership among first-time homebuyers. 
5. The proposed project would encourage local financial institutions to lend to assisted homebuyers. 
6. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

(b) 

Program Impact_Single Purpose_Public Facilities Affecting Public Health and Safety.

 In the case of public facility projects, documentation of the problem by outside, third-party sources is of primary
importance. In the case of water and sewer projects, documentation from public agencies is particularly helpful,
especially where such agencies have pinpointed the exact cause of the problem and have recommended courses of action
which would eliminate the problem. Such supporting documentation should be as up-to-date as possible: the older
the supporting material, the more doubt arises that the need is current and immediate. Applicants also should be sure
to indicate how the project would address public health and safety needs and conditions. Quantification also is essential
in describing needs. Documentation from those affected should be included. 



In order to show that the project is likely to impact upon the problem, the following items should be covered: 


(1) Total project costs. Total project costs should be documented by qualified third party estimates, and be as recent
as possible. 


(2) Source of other funds. To the extent that CDBG funds will not cover all costs, the source of other funds should be
identified and committed. If local funds are to be used, the applicant should show both the willingness and the ability
to provide the funds. 


(3) How the project will solve the problem. The applicant should demonstrate that the project will completely solve
the problem and, if applicable, the applicant should address whether the proposal would be satisfactory to other
State/local agencies which have jurisdiction over the problem. 



(4) Cost effectiveness of the proposal. The applicant should address whether the proposal is the most cost effective
and efficient among the possible alternatives considered. 



(5) Reasonableness of service area. The applicant should address whether the service area claimed for the project
is reasonable, in view of the nature of the proposed project, and if not, the applicant should address what effect a
more realistic appraisal would have on overall benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. 


(6) Project impact on public health and safety; and 


(7) Other applicable feasibility issues have been addressed. 
Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Therefore, it is difficult
to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all applications receiving a particular rating will match point-for-point all the criteria in the same
way. 
The following standards will be applied: 




Maximum (400 Points) 




1. Need is serious, current and requires prompt attention. 


2. Program would resolve the problem completely, either through funds requested or with the support of other resources
already committed. 



3. No other obstacles to timely and effective implementation of the program exist. 


4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other public facility projects.

7. Project would substantially address serious deficiencies in accessibility for disabled persons and/or provide
a significant increase in the number of public facilities accessible to disabled persons. 
8. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Moderate (200 Points) 


1. Serious need is shown, but is not as serious or well documented as other applications.

Program Impact_Single Purpose_Economic Development Projects. 


As discussed earlier in this section of the NOFA, each individual Single Purpose project will receive a separate impact
rating. Applicants whose proposed economic development program will include multiple proposals should determine
the most appropriate form of submission. This determination will require a choice as to either the incorporation
of all proposals into a single project or the submission of separate projects for each proposal (each transaction
will be considered a separate project). The single project format presents an ``all or nothing'' situation. In determining
the appropriate submission format, applicants should consider the ability of a transaction to rate well on its own,
based on the magnitude of employment impact, size of the financial transaction and the other factors discussed in
this section. 
The submission of proposals as separate projects must be clearly designated by the applicant with individual Needs
Descriptions, Community Development Activities, Impact Descriptions and Program Schedule forms, including an
appropriate name for each project on HUD Form 4124.1. 
Section 807(c)(3) of the 1992 Act provides that it is the sense of Congress that each grantee should devote one percent
of its grant for the purpose of providing assistance under section 105(a)(23) of the HCD Act to facilitate economic
development through commercial microenterprises. A microenterprise is defined as a commercial enterprise with
five or fewer employees, one or more of whom owns the enterprise. This should be considered in developing an economic
development application. 
It is noted that in accordance with section 806 of the 1992 Act, the Department published on May 31, 1994, a proposed
rule relating to evaluation and selection of Economic Development activities by grantees. It is strongly suggested
that you read the proposed rule as it reflects the Department's latest proposed policy on the evaluation of Economic
Development Projects.

In addition to the standard submission requirements, to receive maximum points, Small Cities applicants must submit
information that demonstrates that CDBG funds are needed for the proposed project or activity. HUD will evaluate
this material as part of its Eligibility Review 

prior to considering an application for funding

 in the FY 1995 competition. The following is a discussion of some of the factors HUD will consider in assessing projects
in these key areas: 
(i) 

The Appropriate Determination

. HUD requires that economic development activities undertaken with CDBG funds be appropriate to carry out an economic
development project. Applicants should attempt to demonstrate that each economic development project has a reasonable
likelihood of success. Applicants must document the financial analysis of the project's need for assistance, as
well as public benefit factors that were considered in making its determination that assistance is appropriate.
The applicant is expected to provide clear documentation on how the decision was reached. 
The written documentation of the financial analysis of the project's need should use the following steps: 
1. 

Reasonableness of Proposed Costs. 

The applicant must review each project cost element and determine that the cost is reasonable and consistent with
third-party, fair-market prices for that cost element. The general principle is that the level of CDBG assistance
cannot be adequately determined if the project costs are understated or inflated. 
2. 

Commitment of Other Sources of Funds

. The applicant shall review all projected sources of funds necessary to complete the project and shall verify that
all sources (in particular private debt and equity financing) have been firmly committed to the extent practicable,
and are available to be invested in the project. Verification means ascertaining that: the source of funds is committed;
that the terms and conditions of the committed funds are known; and the source has the capacity to deliver. 
3. 

No Substitution of CDBG Funds for Private Sources of Funds.

 The applicant shall financially underwrite the project and ensure to the extent possible that CDBG funds are not being
substituted for available private debt financing or equity capital. The analysis must be tailored to the type of project
being assisted (i.e. real estate, user project, capital equipment, working capital, etc.). Real estate projects
require 
different financial analysis than working capital or machinery and equipment projects. Applicants should ensure
that both a significant equity commitment by the for-profit business exists, and that the level of certainty of the
end use of the property or project is sufficient to ensure the achievement of national objectives within a reasonable
period of time. 
4. 

Establishment of CDBG Financing Terms

. The amount of CDBG assistance provided to a for-profit business ideally should be limited to the amount, with appropriate
repayment terms, sufficient to go forward without substituting CDBG funds for available private debt or cash equity.
The applicant should structure its repayment terms so that the business is allowed a reasonable rate of return on invested
equity, considering the level of risk of the project. It should be remembered that equity funds generally should bear
the greatest risk of all funds invested in a project. 
5. 

Assessing Public Benefit

. The extent of public benefit expected to be derived from the economic development project must be assessed. While
no standards have been promulgated in a final rule, the assessment of public benefit should consider such factors
as the number and type of jobs to be created or retained, in relation to the needs of low- and moderate-income persons
who are likely to be employed, the extent to which a business provides essential services to low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods, and increases to the tax base including property, sales and income taxes in the area. These factors
are not all inclusive. 
(ii) 

CDBG Assistance Must Minimize Business and Job Displacement

. Each applicant will evaluate the potential of each economic development project for causing displacement of existing
businesses and lost jobs in the neighborhood where the project is proposed to be located. When the grantee concludes
that the potential exists to cause displacement, given the size, scope or nature of the business, then the grantee
must, to the extent practicable, take steps to minimize such displacement. The project file must document the grantee's
review conclusions and, if applicable, the steps the grantee will take to minimize displacement. 
(iii) 

Section 105(a)(17) Requirements

. Section 105 (a)(17) of the HCD Act requires that an activity assisted under that section achieve one of the following
criteria: 
(1) Creates or retains jobs for low- and moderate-income persons (note that a project which meets the national objective
of principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons by creating or retaining jobs, 51 percent of which are
for low- and moderate-income persons, will be deemed to have met this criterion without any additional documentation);

(2) Prevents or eliminates slums or blight (note that a project which meets the national objective of aiding in the
prevention or elimination of slums or blight on an area basis will be deemed to have met this criterion without any additional
documentation); 
(3) Meets an urgent need (note that a project which meets the national objective of meeting community development
needs having a particular urgency will be deemed to have met this criterion without any additional documentation);

(4) Creates or retains businesses owned by community residents; 
(5) Assists businesses that provide goods or services needed by and affordable to low- and moderate-income residents;

(6) Provides technical assistance to promote any of the activities under (1) through (5) of this subsection.

(iv) 

National Objectives.

 As previously stated in this NOFA, all CDBG-assisted activities must address one of the three broad national objectives.
Since economic development projects usually result in new employment or the retention of existing jobs, these activities
most likely would be categorized as principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons in this manner. Such
projects will be considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons where the criteria of 24 CFR 570.208(a)(4)
are met. HUD will consider an activity to qualify under this provision where the activity involves jobs at least 51
percent of which are taken by or made available to such persons, or retained by such persons. The extent to which the
proposed project will directly address employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons in the applicant
jurisdiction will be a primary factor in HUD's assessment of the proposed program. 
In determining whether the person is a low- and moderate-income person for these activities, it is the person's family
income at the time the CDBG assistance is provided that is determinative. When making judgments concerning whether
an individual qualifies as a low- and moderate-income person, both family size and the income of the entire family
must be considered. This consideration is necessary because a low- and moderate-income person is defined as a member
of a low- and moderate-income family. The 1992 Act amends the HCD Act by stating that a person may be presumed to be a low-
and moderate-income person if the employee resides in a census tract where not less than 70 percent of the residents
are low- and moderate-income persons. HUD will also accept a written certification by a person of his or her family
income and size to establish low- and moderate-income status. The certification may simply state that the person's
family income is below that required to be low- and moderate-income in that area. The form for such certification must
include a statement that the information is subject to verification. The application must contain adequate documentation
to explain fully, and to support, the process that will be used to ensure that project(s) comply with the low- and moderate-income
employment requirements. The documentation must be sufficient to show that the process has been developed and that
program participants have agreed to adhere to that process. 
(v) 

Application Requirements

. To the extent feasible, the material listed below should be submitted for economic development projects. The material
should be submitted for 

each proposed activity

 (e.g., each loan will be considered a separate activity), whether the proposed activity is presented as a separate
project or as part of a project involving multiple activities. Since economic development projects are rated against
each other, the more completely these submission requirements are met, the greater the potential exists for enhancing
the impact score of the project. 
1. A letter from each appropriate developmental entity which includes at least the following information: 
a. A detailed physical description of the project with a schedule of events and maps or drawings as appropriate. 
b. The estimated costs for the project, including any working capital requirements. 
c. A discussion of all financing sources, including the need for CDBG, the terms of the CDBG assistance, and the proposed
lien structure. The amount, source and nature of any equity investment(s) must also be provided as well as a commitment
to invest the equity. 
d. A discussion of employment impact which includes a schedule of newly created positions. The schedule should identify
the number, salary and skill level of each permanent position to be created. If jobs are made available to low- and moderate-income
persons, the applicant must also demonstrate and document how persons from low- and moderate-income households
will be accorded first consideration for employment opportunities. 
e. A discussion of all appropriate feasibility issues including, but not limited to: site control, zoning, public
approvals and permits, impact fees, corporate authorizations, infrastructure, environment and relocation. 
f. An analysis and summary of market and other data which supports the anticipated success of the project. 
2. A development budget showing all costs for the project, 
including professional fees and working capital. 
3. Documentation to support project costs. Documentation generally should be from a third party source and be consistent
with the following guidelines: 
a. Acquisition costs should be supported by an appraisal. 
b. Construction/renovation costs should be certified by an architect, engineer or contractor. Use of Federal Prevailing
Wage Rates should be cited where applicable. 
c. Machinery and equipment costs should be supported by vendor quotes. 
d. Soft costs (e.g., legal, accounting, title insurance) need be substantiated only where such costs are anticipated
to be abnormally high. 
4. Letters from all financing sources discussing (at a minimum) the amount and terms of the proposed financing, and
the current status of the application for funding. 
5. Historical financial data of the development entity, preferably for the last three years. This information may
be submitted under separate cover with confidentiality requested. It is recognized that historical financial data
may be unavailable or inappropriate for some projects (e.g., start-up companies and real estate transactions).

6. A two-to-five year cash flow pro forma with accompanying notes citing basic assumptions.

7. The applicant's assessment of the project's consistency with the CDBG program eligibility appropriate standards
and with the national objectives requirements. 

(vi) 

Review Criteria. 

In evaluating and rating economic development projects, HUD will analyze the following factors: 

1. 

Employment: 

The extent to which the proposed project will directly address employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income
persons in the applicant's jurisdiction will be a primary factor in HUD's assessment of program impact. Applicants
are reminded that for an activity to be consistent with the statutory objective of low- and moderate-income benefit,
as a result of the creation or retention of jobs, at least 51 percent of created or retained employment opportunities
must be held by, or made available to, persons from low- and moderate-income families. Applicants must fully document
and describe employment benefits. In addition, applicants should address the following issues: 

a. All employment data must be expressed in terms of full-time equivalents (FTEs). Only permanent jobs may be counted,
and applicants must take into account such factors as seasonal and part-time employment. A seasonal job may be considered
permanent if the season is long enough to be considered the person's principal occupation; permanent part-time jobs
must be converted to the full-time equivalent. 

b. The amount of CDBG assistance required to produce each full-time equivalent job will affect the impact assessment
by HUD. Lower CDBG costs per job are preferable to higher CDBG costs per job. Such assessments of impact will be done
on a comparative basis among all projects submitted, rather than by comparison to a given standard. 

c. The use of CDBG funds to assist a business with transferring to a different community will generally be considered
as having 

no

 employment impact. Exceptions to this rule may include an expansion to the business as a result of, or concurrent with,
the transfer; or if the business can demonstrate that it is infeasible to continue operations at the current site.
If the applicant proposes to assist in a transfer of operations based on an exception to the general rule, HUD should
be contacted early in the planning process to discuss the viability of such a proposal. Failure to do so could result
in the application receiving 0 impact points. 

d. Applicants are encouraged to use CDBG funds for projects that provide as many jobs as possible for individuals that
are currently receiving public assistance. Providing employment to recipients of public assistance will help break
the cycle of dependency and empower low income citizens to take control of their lives. 

2. 

Feasibility. 

A high-impact rating will not be given to projects that are likely to encounter feasibility issues which would hinder
the timely completion of the project. Such issues include, but are not limited to: site control, zoning, public approvals
and permits, infrastructure, environment, and relocation. Applicants should address these and any other applicable
issues and provide documentation where appropriate. 

Applicants 

also must demonstrate 

the reasonable likelihood of the project's success, from both a financial and employment standpoint. An analysis
or market data, which indicates an inordinate risk in the undertaking of the project, will affect the overall rating
of program impact. 

3. 

Leverage. 

Leverage is defined as the amount of private debt and equity to be invested as a direct result of the CDBG-funded activity.
Projects which fully conform with those requirements by providing the maximum feasible level of private investment
will be considered as having appropriate leverage. The extent of firm commitments for private financing will be reviewed
as well as the amount of equity investment. The project will be reviewed to determine whether CDBG funds are replacing
private sources of funds. In order to receive maximum impact CDBG funds may not replace private financing, CDBG assistance
must be limited to the amount necessary to fund the project without replacing CDBG funds for private funds, and equity
funds should bear the greatest risk in the project. 

4. 

Taxes. 

While not a primary factor in the evaluation of impact, projects which will augment the applicant's tax base may have
a positive effect on the rating of program impact. It is recognized, however, that good projects do not always result
in increased tax revenues due to their nature. 

5. 

Repayment. 

Where CDBG repayments are to be made in some manner to the applicant, the proposed use of those repayments for economic
development purposes will be considered. 

6. 

Cost Reasonableness. 

In order to receive a rating greater than the minimal, the costs must be reasonable, i.e. not inflated. 

7. 

Base Closures. 

The Department recognizes that communities facing the loss of a military base may need a well-planned economic development
project to help alleviate the effect of the base closure. Well planned projects that will help successfully alleviate
the economic impact of base closures will tend to have a high impact and rate well in the competition. 

8. 

Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities. 

The Department is supportive of using funds from this NOFA to support projects in designated Empowerment Zones and
Enterprise Communities. A project that significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone
or Enterprise Community will receive a maximum impact score provided that the other factors for maximum impact are
met.

(vii) 

Scoring. 

Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. It is, therefore, difficult
to precisely define those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all applications receiving a ``maximum'' rating will match all the criteria, point by point, in the same
manner. The following standards will be applied: 



Maximum (400 Points) 



1. The analysis of market and other risk data provides reasonable assurance that the project will be successful. 

2. The project will have a direct and positive impact on employment opportunities for persons from low- and moderate-income
households, and the extent of that impact compares favorably with that of other applicants. 

3. All appropriate feasibility issues have been addressed (including the submission of firm private financing commitments)
and there is reasonable assurance that the project will be completed in a timely manner. 

4. The Public Benefits (e.g., loan repayments, increases to the tax base including property, sales and income taxes
to the area, other development likely to be stimulated by the activity) to be derived from the project are considerable
relative to other proposals. 

5. The infusion of CDBG funds will leverage a substantial investment of private and other dollars. 

6. The project costs are reasonable (i.e. not inflated). 

7. CDBG funds will not replace private financing, CDBG assistance will be limited to the amount necessary to fund the
project without replacing CDBG funds for private funds, and equity funds will bear the greatest risk in the project.


8. Project significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.




Substantial (300 Points) 



The criteria for Maximum (400 Points) is met, with either of the following 
exceptions: 

1. While the project will have a direct and positive impact on employment opportunities for persons from low- and moderate-income
households, the extent of that impact is less than that demonstrated by applicants receiving the maximum rating.


2. While there are no major feasibility problems, there are feasibility issues which have not been fully addressed
and/or may have a negative effect on timely implementation of the project. However, overall success of the project
appears achievable. 

In addition: 

3. The Public Benefits derived from this project will be greater than that received by the majority of applicants.


4. CDBG funds will leverage more private and/or other public dollars than the majority of projects in the competition.


5. The project costs are reasonable (i.e. not inflated). 

6. CDBG funds will not replace private financing, CDBG assistance will be limited to the amount necessary to fund the
project without replacing CDBG funds for private funds, and equity funds will bear as great a risk as other project
funds. 

7. Project significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.




Moderate (200 Points) 



The project presents at least one of the following deficiencies which would affect the appropriateness of CDBG funding:


1. An analysis of the project indicates that the likelihood of the availability of other required financing is questionable.


2. There is a major feasibility issue which is likely to affect completion of the project. 

3. The analysis of market and other risk data indicates a likelihood that the project will not create a significant
employment impact. 

4. The number of employment positions to be created is significantly low and/or the CDBG cost per employment position
is significantly high in relation to other applications. 

In addition: 

5. There will be some Public Benefits resulting from this project. 

6. CDBG dollars will leverage a moderate amount of private and/or other 
public funds relative to other projects. 

7. The project costs are reasonable (i.e. not inflated). 

8. Project moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Minimal (100 Points) 



The project presents at least one of the following serious deficiencies which would affect the appropriateness of
CDBG funding: 

1. An analysis of the project indicates that other required financing is unlikely to be available. 

2. There will be few, if any, Public Benefits resulting from this project. 

3. CDBG dollars will leverage little private and/or other public investment in the project. 

4. Project minimally supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Insignificant (0 Points) 



The activity presents at least one of the following serious deficiencies which indicates the inappropriateness
of CDBG funding: 

1. It is clear that the activity cannot be accomplished based on any combination of the following factors: 

(1) Major feasibility issues. 

(2) Inordinate risk. 

(3) Unavailability of required financing.

2. The activity will not have a direct impact on employment opportunities for persons from low- and moderate-income
households. 


3. The completion of the project will result in no Public Benefits or will be detrimental to the community. 


4. No other investment will be triggered by the use of CDBG funds for this activity. 


5. Project does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

 



(2) 

Program Impact_Comprehensive Program Grants.

 Comprehensive programs must address a substantial portion of the identifiable community development needs of a
defined area(s). The extent to which activities are coordinated will be a major consideration in the evaluation of
program impact. In defining an appropriate area for comprehensive treatment, applicants should consider the severity
of condition within the area and the resources to be provided. The impact is greatest where community development
needs will be substantially addressed over a reasonable period of time. Exceptions to the requirement that activities
be concentrated within a defined area or areas may be made if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed program
represents a reasonable means of addressing the identified needs. 


HUD will assess the impact of the program for each of the four program design criteria selected, based on the factors
described below. Applicants must describe fully the extent to which the program will address each criterion selected.
HUD will compare all programs which address a particular 
criterion. The best proposal for that criterion will be the standard by which all others will be judged, although that
proposal will not necessarily be awarded a significant impact. 


Assignment of Program Impact points for a Comprehensive Grant application is a two-step process. First, the potential
of the proposed program of activities to achieve the results intended by each selected criterion when considered
in relation to other communities selecting the same criterion is assessed. A numerical value is assigned, based on
the following:

 



The results would have insignificant impact_0 Points 


The results would have minimal impact_2 Points 


The results would have a moderate impact_4 Points 


The results would have a maximum impact_8 points

 



After each of the four criteria selected by an applicant is rated and a value assigned, the values are summed. A minimum
of 12 points will be required at this stage in order for the application to be eligible for further consideration. A
score of less than 12 points indicates that the proposed activities would have insufficient impact to warrant funding.



Following this process, the actual points for impact are determined by dividing each applicant's Program Impact
Score by the highest Program Impact Score achieved by any applicant and multiplying the result by 400. 


Listed below are the ten design criteria and the standards which HUD has developed to evaluate each criterion. The
applicant must select and address four of the criteria. In addition to these standards, the Submission Requirements
and Review Criteria for Economic Development Projects under the Single Purpose Program apply in determining the
eligibility and rating for economic development proposals that are a part of a Comprehensive Program. It is particularly
important that applicants fully address the economic development criteria should Criteria 5 and 6 be selected. 


(a) 

Criterion 1_Supports Comprehensive Neighborhood Conservation, Stabilization, Revitalization, New Housing
Construction or Promotes Homeownership. 

The applicant must describe the degree to which the identified needs of a defined area or areas will be addressed in
a coordinated manner. In defining an area or areas, applicants should examine carefully the extent of needs and the
resources available to address those needs. Where an area has not been defined, the applicant should describe fully
the appropriateness of implementing activities on a community-wide basis. 


In evaluating the impact of the proposed program, HUD will examine the following factors:

 



_Nature and severity of neighborhood needs. 


_Extent to which needs will be addressed. 


_Amount of funds required to implement neighborhood activities. 


_Extent to which activities are coordinated to address housing, public facility and economic development needs.
Program impact will be the greatest where a substantial portion of the needs within a defined area will be met. 


_Extent to which the project promotes fair housing choice in homeownership among protected classes. 


_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

 



The strongest consideration for housing rehabilitation programs is given to those applicants which have designed
their housing programs by taking into account both structural conditions and appropriate financing mechanisms.
The proposed program should be structured in a way to be marketable, given income and structural characteristics
of the neighborhood area. The physical needs of residential or mixed use properties must be well stated and documented
in terms of substandardness. Applicants will be expected to maximize the leveraging of private funds, encourage
the participation of local financial institutions, and develop realistic program guidelines. Private funds available
from financial lending sources should be established. If leveraging is infeasible, the applicant must fully document
that fact. The most effective housing programs will be those which will address a substantial portion of the identified
needs, while maximizing the impact of Federal funds.

<TEXT>
 

For those programs that will support the construction of new residential units, project feasibility will be critical.
While the extent of need and number of units to be created will be a primary consideration in evaluating the impact,
issues of site control, marketability and assurance of private financing must be addressed, and must be documented.

Homeownership activities will be reviewed in terms of: how effectively the program would meet homeownership needs
identified in the community; and the extent to which they would make effective use of available funds.

Public service activities also may be considered in conjunction with other activities under this criterion. Again,
any such activities would need to meet demonstrated needs within the community.

The impact of public improvement activities will be assessed primarily on the documented severity of the need and
the extent to which the proposed program will address that need. Those needs which directly affect the public safety
and welfare will be considered the most severe.

Economic development activities also will be evaluated by the extent to which they will alleviate the identified
problems. However, the assessed impact for these activities is often diminished due to feasibility concerns. In
addition to quantifying the extent of the anticipated improvements, applicants must demonstrate that the proposed
activities can be carried out_that is, documentation with respect to private participation in such activities must
be thorough. Letters of only general interest, by either property owners or other private sector participants, do
not necessarily ensure their participation in the program. Some degree of assurance of participation should be presented.

Review Criteria and Submission requirements for Housing described under the Single Purpose Program apply in evaluating
and rating housing proposals that are a part of a Comprehensive Program. 

(b) 

Criterion 2_Provides Housing Choice Within the Community Either Outside Areas with Concentrations of Minorities
and Low- and Moderate-Income Persons or in a Neighborhood Which is Experiencing Revitalization and Substantial
Displacement as a Result of Private Reinvestment, by Enabling Low- and Moderate-Income Persons to Remain in Their
Neighborhood. 

If a proposed program provides housing choice within the community outside areas with concentrations of minorities
and low- and moderate-income persons, the application must document that there are existing areas which do, in fact,
contain concentrations of low- and moderate-income families and minorities. The proposed program, if implemented,
must result in additional housing assistance being provided in areas of non-concentration. Communities with no
minorities or minority concentrations may receive impact points where opportunities are provided outside areas
of low- and moderate-income concentration. The degree of impact will be based upon the severity of needs, the number
of units to be provided, and the nature and cost of the activities.

In a neighborhood which is experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment,
the applicant must provide a detailed description of the revitalization efforts within the neighborhood, the amount
of displacement of low- and moderate-income persons, and the manner in which the implementation of the proposed program
will enable displacees to remain in the neighborhood. The degree of needs, nature and cost of activities, and percentage
of needs to be addressed will be evaluated to determine program impact.

(c) 

Criterion 3_Supports the Expansion of Housing for Low- and Moderate-Income Persons by Providing Additional Housing
Units Not Previously Available. 

The proposed program clearly must support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons.
The units may result from the rehabilitation of currently vacant structures, conversion of non-residential structures
to residential use, or new construction projects for which the proposed program will provide non-construction or
construction assistance. Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant
must identify and document the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment
for assistance may adversely affect program impact. Applicants should address the areas of site control and marketability,
in addition to addressing feasibility from the standpoint of project financing. Consideration will not be given
to proposed programs which will rehabilitate occupied units or displace current occupants. The impact of the proposed
programs will be based upon the degree of needs, the number of units to be created, and the nature and cost of the proposed
activities.

(d) 

Criterion 4_Addresses a Serious Deficiency in a Community's Public Facilities. 

Consideration will be given to the extent of deficiencies, and their relative seriousness, of the identified need.
The following factors will be considered:




_Documentation of the seriousness of deficiencies. Appropriate documentation should be provided to substantiate
the degree of seriousness. Those deficiencies which directly affect the public safety and welfare will be considered
most severe.

_The nature and cost of the proposed activities in relation to the percentage of need to be addressed.

_The extent to which the proposed program will address a variety of deficiencies in public facilities within a defined
area.

_Coordination with other activities within the defined area.

_The degree to which the application addresses such feasibility issues, including but not limited to, the validity
of cost estimates by qualified sources, the availability of other funds, site control, and environmental constraints.

_The number of persons to benefit.

_The extent to which the project addresses serious deficiencies in accessibility requirements and/or expands the
number of accessible public facilities. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

 


(e) 

Criterion 5_Expands or Retains Employment Opportunities.

 Consideration will be given to proposed programs that will result in the creation of new jobs or retention of existing
employment opportunities. The following factors will be considered: 




_The number of jobs to be created or retained in relation to the identified needs. Documentation should be provided
to substantiate the number and type (permanent or seasonal, full or part-time) of job claimed. Letters from local
development agencies or expected participants which express more than general interest would be appropriate. With
respect to job retention, evidence should be provided to demonstrate that without the proposed program, existing
jobs would be lost. The applicant also must address the potential impact of job loss on the community. 

_The extent to which CDBG funds are used to leverage private commitments. If leveraging is proposed, applicants should
analyze the actual amount of additional funds required to make the project financially feasible. In designing a program
to assist existing business expansion or retention, or to encourage new business development, applicants must address
whether CDBG funds will be used for infrastructure, land assemblage or other financial incentives. These factors
may be important considerations for a firm deciding where to locate and whether to expand or reduce the scope of its
operation. CDBG funds may be more effectively used as a loan rather than a grant. In this regard, the CDBG funds would
generate additional program resources through loan repayments to the community. It is considered especially advantageous
if a revolving loan fund is established and repayments continue to be used to expand or retain employment opportunities.

_The relationship of the activity to other projects being implemented within the defined area. 
_The number of persons to benefit. 
_Particular attention will be given to the extent to which the Review Criteria and Submission Requirements for Economic
Development Projects are addressed (see Single Purpose Program Criteria). 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

_Extent to which the project results in the employment of persons on public assistance.

(f) 

Criterion 6_Attracts or Retains Businesses which Provide Essential Services.

 Consideration will be given to proposed programs which will address the attraction or retention of businesses commonly
associated with neighborhood needs (corner grocery stores, dry cleaners, pharmacies, etc.). The applicant must
describe clearly the nature and anticipated impact of activities. Documentation in the form of letters from existing
or new potential businesses offering a commitment to the program should be included. (Letters of only general interest
by property owners do not necessarily ensure their participation in the program, or their willingness to secure debt
if private lending is proposed). The following factors will be considered:

 
_The impact of the proposed program in relation to the identifiable neighborhood needs. The extent of area stability
must be documented. In describing the needs of a business district or neighborhood commercial area, such factors
as overall structural conditions, business turnovers, and vacancy rates over a period of time should be clearly presented.
The formulation of a commercial revitalization program must be based on a thorough assessment of local needs and a
realistic program design. An important consideration is whether the proposed program is designed to be marketable
given income characteristics, local business condition, etc. The condition of supporting public facilities and
improvements and their influence on the business environment must be established. If public improvements are proposed
in connection with economic expansion or retention, applicants must address the extent to which the lack of these
improvements impact on business. 

_Attraction/retention must be fully documented by the applicant. With respect to business retention, evidence
should be provided to demonstrate clearly and objectively that without the proposed CDBG Program, existing retail/commercial
businesses would curtail their operations. The applicant also must document and address the potential impact of
the business loss on the community and/or target area. HUD would accept as examples of clear and objective evidence
a notice issued by the business to affected employees, a public announcement by the business, or financial records
provided by the business that clearly indicate the need for closing or moving all or portions of the business out of
the area.

<TEXT>
 

_The amount of private funds to be leveraged. If leveraging is proposed, applicants should analyze the actual amount
of private or public funds needed to make the project financially feasible. In this regard, the establishment of a
revolving loan fund, in which repayments would continue to be used to attract or retain businesses providing essential
services, would be considered a positive factor. 
_The relationship of the activity to a comprehensive approach to meeting the overall needs of the neighborhood area.

_The impact of the proposed program in utilizing minority, women-owned, and project area businesses. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

_Extent to which the project results in the employment of persons on public assistance. 
(g) 

Criterion 7_Removes Slums or Blighting Conditions.

 Consideration will be given to proposed programs which will have a direct impact on the removal of slums or blighting
conditions. Appropriate areas may include, but are not limited to, deteriorated residential or commercial structures,
inappropriate land uses, or blighting conditions, such as repeated flooding and drainage problems or serious deficiencies
in public facilities. Applicants should be aware that slum and blight activities can be carried out under the national
objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. If an applicant elects to qualify the activity on this basis,
the degree of low- and moderate-income benefit must be demonstrated by the applicant. 

Where residential or commercial rehabilitation activities are proposed as preventing or eliminating blighting
conditions, the application must clearly document the number, type, and condition of deteriorating or deteriorated
buildings in the designated target area. Detailed conditions of the physical condition of buildings or structures
would be appropriate to establish the extent of substandard and blighting conditions. For rehabilitation of residential
structures to be designed as eliminating blight and addressing an area's deterioration, the buildings must be considered
substandard under local definition. 

When an area is determined to be blighted, there must be a substantial number of deteriorated or dilapidated buildings,
or the public improvements throughout the area must be in a state of deterioration. The proposed CDBG program or project
must be designed to eliminate or address a substantial portion of the identified blighting conditions or physical
decay. CDBG assistance for facilities or structures which are in good repair and show no real signs of deterioration
would not score well under this criterion. For instance, minor facade improvements to a commercial building alone
would not indicate that a building is in poor condition. However, assistance to a commercial area which consists of
deteriorating businesses, storefronts in serious need of rehabilitation, a high vacancy factor, and public improvements,
such as parking areas and parking access improvements which are in need of physical upgrading, would have a direct
impact on eliminating blighting conditions. Public improvements that are so deteriorated that they constitute
a genuine threat to the continued viability of an area by discouraging private investment necessary to maintain properties
may also be 
considered a blighting influence. The following factors will be considered: 
_Extent and documented seriousness of conditions/needs. References to engineering studies, surveys or letters
from appropriate local agencies should be included. 
_Impact of the proposed program in relation to providing long-term permanent solutions to alleviate the identified
need. Short-term or superficial improvements will not be considered to have a significant impact. 
_Coordination with other projects and activities which will address needs within the defined area. 
_Nature of any proposed re-use: degree of commitment for re-use. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.


(h) 

Criterion 8_Resolves a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.

 
The applicant must describe the condition which poses a threat to public health and safety. A serious threat refers
to a situation which demands immediate attention. This may be a condition that has just occurred or a condition which,
though long standing, has intensified to become an immediate danger. 

Applicants should be aware that imminent threat/urgent need activities can be carried out under the national objective
of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. If an applicant elects to qualify the activity on this basis, the degree
of low- and moderate-income benefit must be demonstrated by the applicant. Consideration will be given to the following:


_The extent to which a serious threat to health or safety is documented, or of recent origin, or which recently became
urgent. Documentation should include the identification of the existing conditions by appropriate agencies. 
_The extent to which the serious threat will be resolved. 
_The submission of documentation which demonstrates that other financial resources are insufficient or unavailable
to resolve such needs. 
_The degree to which the application addresses issues such as the validity of cost estimates by qualified sources;
the availability of other funds; site control and environmental conditions; or other public body approvals. 
_The number of persons to benefit, as well as the number of individuals actually threatened.

Note:

 This criterion is generally more restrictive than Criterion 4. The existing condition must pose a serious and immediate
threat to the health or welfare of the target population.




(i) 

Criterion 9_Supports Other Federal or State Programs Being Undertaken in the Community or Deals with the Adverse
Impact of Another Recent Federal or State Action. The Other Federal or State Program or Action Must Be of Substantial
Size or Impact in the Community in Relation to the Proposed Program.

 The application must contain a complete description of the Federal or State Program(s) (excluding other CDBG Programs)
which currently are underway, or a complete description of the adverse impact of a recent Federal or State action (e.g.
the closing of a military base). A Federal or State program or action not yet initiated will be considered only where
the application provides documentation establishing the certainty of, and the approximate commencement date of,
the described program or action.

The proposed CDBG Program must demonstrate clearly the magnitude of the effect of the Federal or State Program or action
on the community. The degree to which the proposed CDBG Program will support the Federal or State Program, and/or the
extent to which the adverse impact of Federal or State action will be mitigated, also must be demonstrated.

In addition to the above, the nature and costs of the proposed activities will be considered in determining the degree
of impact.

(j) 

Criterion 10_Supports Energy Production or Conservation.

 This criterion will be judged, and points will be awarded, based upon the community's ability to demonstrate that
the proposed program will support energy production or conservation. Applicants are urged to develop innovative
approaches toward addressing energy needs with Small Cities CDBG funds. Energy considerations can be a factor in
most activities proposed by smaller communities. Attention should focus on new methods of producing energy or conserving
energy where possible. In developing and evaluating proposals, there are a number of energy aspects to consider.
The following factors will be considered:

_Cost efficiency_Relationship of dollar amount to benefits to be derived. The applicant must document estimates
of energy costs which are to be saved as a result of the proposed program. The proposed program should make maximum use
of non-CDBG resources as well as CDBG funds. Appropriate documentation must be provided to ensure that the proposal
is economically feasible.

_The extent to which the proposed program will support other programs currently aimed at addressing energy production
or conservation needs of the community. From a management standpoint, proposed projects should be consistent with
needs or objectives of any plan for energy management or conservation. Applicants should pursue the availability
of other resources from Federal or State energy related programs. The degree of commitment of other resources should
be established. State energy offices, private as well as municipally-owned utility companies, and home heating
oil companies may be appropriate entities to be involved in the development and planning of proposals.

_The application should address whether the project is based on appropriate technology, materials and methods to
maximize energy conservation. Engineering reports or studies would be appropriate evidence to support the overall
feasibility of the project. The conversion of existing facilities, where appropriate, rather than proposing new
construction may be more economical.

_While housing rehabilitation programs which include weatherization/winterization components will be considered,
they generally will not be presumed as addressing a severe need unless unique conditions are specifically identified
and cost savings are properly documented.

d. 

Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Evaluation.

 Documentation for the 65 points for these items is the responsibility of the applicant. Claims of outstanding performance
must be based upon actual accomplishments. Clear, precise documentation will be required. Maps must have a census
tract or block numbering area (BNA), and they must be in accordance with the 1990 Census data. Additionally, maps must
identify the locations of areas with minorities by census tract or BNA. If there are no minority areas, state so on the
map. Only population data from the 1990 Census will be acceptable for purposes of this section.

Please note that a ``minority'' is a person belonging to, or culturally identified as, a member of any one of the following
racial/ethnic categories: Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native. For
the purposes of this section, the separate category_``women''_is not considered a minority.

Counties claiming points under this criterion must use county-wide statistics (excluding entitlement communities).
In the case of joint applications, points will be awarded based on the performance of the lead entity only.

The following factors will be used to judge outstanding performance in these areas. Please note that the criteria
are the same for Comprehensive and Single Purpose applicants, and that points for outstanding performance may be
claimed under each criterion:

(1) 

Housing Achievements

 (40 points total).

(a) 20 Points_Provision of Assisted Housing_Providing assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families,
located in a manner which provides housing choice in areas outside of minority, or low- and moderate-income concentrations.

Points will be awarded where both of the following criteria are met:

(i) More than one-third of the housing assistance provided by the applicant in the last five (5) years (excluding Section
8 existing and housing assistance provided in place) has been in Census Tracts (CT) or Block Numbering Areas (BNA)
having a percentage of minority population which is less than the minority population in the community as a whole;
and

(ii) With regard to the Section 8 Existing Program, a community must show the location (CT or BNA) of its currently occupied
family units by race/ethnicity. Points will be awarded if more than one-half of the minority assisted families occupy
units in areas which have a lower percentage of minority population than that of the community as a whole.

A community with no minorities must show the extent to which its assisted housing is located outside areas of concentrations
of low- and moderate-income persons. In order to receive points under this criteria, applicants should follow the
process outlined in (i) and (ii) above, substituting low- and moderate-income persons and families for minority
persons or families. Applicants addressing the first criterion must use a map indicating the location of all assisted
housing and a narrative which indicates the number of units and the type of assisted housing. The map also must show
the general location of low- and moderate-income households and minority households, giving the numbers and percentages
for both.

To qualify as housing assistance provided, the units being claimed must be part of a project located outside minority
or lower income concentrated areas which has, at a minimum, received a firm commitment from the funding agency.

(iii) Points also may be awarded for efforts which enable low- and moderate-income persons to remain in their neighborhood
when such neighborhoods are experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment.
Applicants requesting points under this criterion would not need to meet the requirements of (a) and (b) in order to
receive points. Points will be awarded where more than one half of the families displaced were able to remain in their
original neighborhood through the assistance of the applicant. Applicants must show that:

_the neighborhood experienced revitalization;

_the amount of displacement was substantial;

_displacement was caused by private reinvestment;

_low- and moderate-income persons were permitted to remain in the neighborhood as a result of action taken by the applicant.

If the community is inhabited predominantly by persons who are members of minority and/or low-income groups, points
will be awarded where there is a balanced distribution of assisted housing throughout the community.

(b) 20 Points_Implementation of a HUD-approved New Horizons Fair Housing Assistance Project or a Fair Housing Strategy
that is equivalent in scope to a New Horizons Project.

The applicant must demonstrate that it is implementing a HUD-approved New Horizons Fair Housing Assistance Project
or demonstrate participation in a HUD-approved county/State/regional New Horizons Project; or that the applicant
is implementing a fair housing strategy that is equivalent in scope to a New Horizons Project. If the applicant is implementing
a New Horizons Project, it must include:

_the date it was approved (by HUD); and

_those actions taken to implement the plan.

If the applicant is implementing an equivalent fair housing strategy, it must include:

_the strategy being implemented;

_those actions taken to implement the strategy.

Please note that a fair housing strategy must include the four elements of a New Horizons Project in order to be considered
equivalent in scope:

_Local compliance activities;

<TEXT>
 

_Educational programs to enhance the clarity and understanding of the community's fair housing policy. For communities
with few or no minorities, this should include publication in the surrounding communities of the applicant's policy
of fair housing for minorities and the disabled; 
_Assistance to minority families; and 
_Special programs (e.g. utilization of Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB) Programs, efforts to encourage
local realtors to enter into voluntary agreements to encourage equal access to financial institutions, etc.). 

The fair housing strategy must include goals for each of the above elements. The date of adoption or development of
the strategy should be indicated, as well as the date proposed activities will be or have been implemented. 

(2) 

Entrepreneurial Efforts and Local Equal Employment 

(25 points total). Applicants may request points for both of these subfactors and must use the format sheets included
in the application. 

(a) 

Minority Contracting.

 15 points_Outstanding performance points will be given to those applicants who have demonstrated that they have
utilized minority businesses to the following degree. The applicant must demonstrate that at least five percent
of all its contracts, based on dollar value, have been awarded within the past two years to minority owned and controlled
businesses (businesses that are at least 50 percent owned by minorities) provided that the minority population is
five percent or less. If the minority population exceeds five percent, then the applicant must have a corresponding
percentage of its contracts awarded to minority businesses; however, 20 percent of the total dollar value of its contracts
will be sufficient for award of points for any applicant. The applicable percentage of minority population is the
percentage of minorities in the applicant's jurisdiction, or is the county percentage, whichever is higher. 

The applicant must provide the information as outlined in the suggested format, showing the name, address, telephone
number, contract date and contract amount for each contract or subcontract with a minority business. This information
is to be provided in addition to information required on the HUD Form 4124.4, and should be for the two-year period ending
February 1, 1994. 

(b) 

Equal Opportunity Employment. 

10 points_In order to be considered for points, if claimed, the applicant must document that its percentage of minority,
permanent full-time employees is greater than the percentage of minorities within the county or the community, whichever
is higher. Applicants with no full-time employees may claim points based on part-time employment provided that they
document that the only permanent employment is on a part-time basis. 



4. Final Selection.



The total points received by a project for all of the selection factors are added, and the project is ranked against
all other projects from all applications, regardless of the problem areas in which the projects were rated. The highest
ranked projects will be funded to the 
extent funds are available. Applicants will receive a single grant in the amount of the project or projects applied
for which were ranked high enough to be funded. In the case of ties at the funding line, HUD will use the following criteria
in order to break ties: 

_The project receiving the highest program impact rating will be funded; 
_If tied projects have the same program impact rating, the project having the highest combined score on the needs factors
will be funded; 
_If tied projects have the same program impact ratings and equal needs factor scores, the project having the highest
score on the percent of persons in poverty needs factor will be funded; and 
_If tied projects have the same program impact ratings, equal needs factor scores, and an equal percent of persons
in poverty needs factor score, the application having the most outstanding performance in fair housing and equal
opportunity will be funded. 

As soon as possible after the rating and ranking process has been completed, HUD will notify all applicants regarding
their rating scores and funding status. Thereafter, applicants may contact HUD to discuss scores or any aspects of
the selection process.

V. Corrections to Deficient Applications 


Under no circumstances will HUD accept from the applicant unsolicited information regarding the application after
the application deadline has passed. 
HUD may advise applicants of technical deficiencies in applications and permit them to be corrected. A technical
deficiency would be an error or oversight which, if corrected, would not alter, in either a positive or negative fashion,
the review and rating of the application. Examples of curable technical deficiencies would be a failure to submit
the proper certifications or failure to submit an application containing an original signature by an authorized
official. Situations not considered curable would be, for example, a failure to submit program impact descriptions.

HUD will notify applicants in writing of any curable technical deficiencies in applications. Applicants will have
14 calendar days from the date of HUD's correspondence to reply and correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not
corrected within this time period, HUD will reject the application as incomplete. 
Applicants should note that if a CHAS is required in support of a housing activity, the failure to submit a CHAS in a timely
manner is not considered a curable deficiency. 


VI. Other Matters 


Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) at the
time of development of the FY 1993 NOFA for this program. Because no substantive programmatic changes have been made,
that Finding remains applicable to this NOFA and is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m.
and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 10276, Washington, DC
20410. 


Federalism 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between
them and other levels of government. While the NOFA will provide financial assistance to the Small Cities Program
of New York State, none of its provisions will have an effect on the relationship between the Federal Government and
New York State, or the State's political subdivisions. 


Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, 

The Family, 

has determined that the policies announced in this NOFA would not have the potential for significant impact on family
formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. No significant change in existing
HUD policies and programs will result from issuance of this NOFA, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.



Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 


See Section I.A.4 of this NOFA. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 
Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign
power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from
the statute's coverage. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any
efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples
contained in Appendix A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule. 
Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington DC 20410-3000. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions



Section 103 of the Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not
authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance that entails a competition
for its distribution. HUD's regulations implementing section 103 are codified at 24 CFR part 4. In accordance with
the requirements of section 103, HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding
decisions under a competitive funding process are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information
to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any
applicant an unfair competitive advantage.
Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted
by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD).

Rehabilitation Training Programs 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final priorities.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces priorities for four programs administered by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative
Services. The Secretary may use these priorities for competitions in fiscal year (FY) 1995 and subsequent years.
The Secretary takes this action to focus Federal financial assistance on areas of identified national need. These
priorities are intended to prepare individuals to enter rehabilitation professions and to maintain and upgrade
the basic skills and knowledge of trained rehabilitation professionals. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice contains one priority under the statutory authority for Rehabilitation Training, one priority under
the Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs, four priorities under the Rehabilitation Short-Term Training
program, and two priorities under the Interpreter Training for Individuals Who Are Deaf and Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind
program. A separate competition will be established for each priority. These programs are authorized by section
302 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The purpose of each program is stated separately under the
title of that program. The announcement for each program also lists the name, address, and telephone number of the
person who may be contacted for further information. 



These priorities support the National Education Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate
and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship. The Department supports a variety of training activities in vocational rehabilitation and training
that enhance the knowledge and skills of personnel. 

On September 6, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities for these programs in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 46118). 






Note: 

This notice of final priorities does 

not

 solicit applications. In any year in which the Secretary chooses to use a priority, the Secretary invites applications
through a notice in the 

Federal Register

 and designates that priority as absolute or competitive preference or invitational. The effect of each type of priority
is explained in the notice of proposed priorities and in 34 CFR 75.105.

Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priorities, 64 parties submitted comments. An
analysis of the comments and of the changes in the priorities since publication of the notice of proposed priorities
follows. Please note that this section addresses only those proposed priorities on which substantive comments were
received or priorities that have been substantially changed as a result of the Secretary's review. Technical and
other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory
authority_are also not addressed. 



General Comments 





Comments:

 Three commenters expressed concern that vocational evaluation and work adjustment, an important component of the
rehabilitation of persons with disabilities, is being eliminated by the Rehabilitation Services Administration
(RSA) as a training focus from its discretionary grant programs in general and from these priorities in particular.
Therefore, it was recommended that an additional priority be included to provide training for community rehabilitation
personnel in the field of vocational evaluation and work adjustment. 



Discussion:

 An announcement to fund projects that will provide vocational evaluation and work adjustment training for FY 1995
was published on June 16, 1994. In addition, vocational evaluation and work adjustment training is not precluded
under these priorities. 



Changes:

 None.
 


Comments:

 One commenter recommended that every priority included in the notice, and every future RSA priority, provide training
in access to assistive technology and devices. In addition, one of the same commenters proposed that two technology-specific
priorities be added to this notice. 


Discussion: 

Training in this area is allowed under any of the priorities in this notice. The Secretary believes that training rehabilitation
personnel in assistive technology can lead to increased choices and opportunities for persons with disabilities.




Changes:

 None.
 


Comments:

 One commenter suggested that a priority be added that would provide additional resources to State vocational rehabilitation
agencies to facilitate ongoing career advancement opportunities on behalf of their clients. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the facilitation of ongoing career advancement opportunities on behalf of clients of State
vocational rehabilitation agencies is important. 
State vocational rehabilitation agencies are currently provided resources under the in-service training program
to carry out post-employment programs, such as the development of career advancement opportunities for their clients.

Comments:

 One commenter recommended that the order in which the priorities are listed in this notice be changed to give preference
for funding to one of the priorities that is not listed as number one. 


Discussion:

 The order in which the priorities appear in the notice is not related to importance or any preference. 


Changes:

 None.


Rehabilitation Training 


Priority_National Clearinghouse of Rehabilitation Training Materials 





Comments:

 Four of the commenters suggested specific criteria that a National Clearinghouse should address during the grant
competition: linkages with other clearinghouses, the provision of materials in alternative formats, adequate
facilities for storage and dissemination, and a project director experienced in both rehabilitation and information
systems. 


Discussion:

 The current selection criteria already include the concerns raised by the commenters and will provide the basis for
the evaluation of the proposals under this program. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter suggested that the proposed National Clearinghouse of Rehabilitation Training Materials be merged
with the National Rehabilitation Information Center, which is funded by the National Institute on Disability and
Rehabilitation Research. 


Discussion:

 While such a merger is not feasible at this time, the possibility of such a merger will be considered. 


Changes:

 None. 


Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs



Priority_Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs for Providers of Community Rehabilitation Services 





Comments:

 Ten of the commenters indicated their desire to have a project under this priority in their geographical region. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary will consider the needs of all regions as well as the geographical distribution of projects in selecting
grantees. Regions that are not announced for funding in FY 1995 will be considered for competitions in FY 1996 and FY
1997. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Six commenters expressed concern regarding the availability of training under this priority to direct service personnel
in rural areas, and several of these commenters recommended that projects under this priority be required to coordinate
training through existing programs in rural areas or use distance education strategies. 


Discussion:

 Projects funded under this priority are required to provide training for direct service personnel throughout a multi-State
geographical area. The use of distance education 
strategies and linkages with existing training programs serving rural areas is not precluded under this priority.



Changes:

 None.

<TEXT>
 



Comments:

 Two commenters expressed concern that the priority will discourage academic and certificate training, and one commenter
suggested that academic-type training be included under the priority. 


Discussion:

 The focus of this priority is on the provision of ongoing post-employment training in community rehabilitation programs.
The Secretary believes that the training proposed is appropriate to meet these needs. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Two commenters recommended that the priority emphasize human resource development principles. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the provision of quality post-employment training that will maintain or upgrade the
skills of persons engaged in community rehabilitation programs is career enhancing and reflective of human resource
development principles. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Two commenters suggested that programs funded under this priority provide technical assistance and demonstrate
institutional collaboration. 


Discussion:

 These activities may be carried out by projects funded under this priority. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter expressed concern that the priority will not provide training opportunities for professional persons,
such as vocational evaluators and work adjustment personnel, who are employed by community rehabilitation programs.



Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that the priority addresses the need for ongoing post-employment training for all personnel
employed by community rehabilitation programs. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter suggested that the priority be more responsive to individuals with disabilities by requiring the projects
funded under this priority to promote cooperation with local partnerships funded by the School-to-Work Opportunities
Act and with employment centers, and to include training in the evaluation of occupational and skill attainment.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that these activities are encouraged under the priority as projects are required to coordinate
their efforts with employment agencies and school-to-work projects, as well as to provide training to meet recurrent
and common training needs, which could include the evaluation of occupational and skill attainment. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter expressed concern that the term ``community rehabilitation programs'' may be perceived in many parts
of the country to include organizations serving mentally ill individuals, and in other parts of the country it may
be more narrowly defined to include only facilities or sheltered workshops.

Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the term ``community rehabilitation programs'' is inclusive of organizations serving
individuals with mental illness. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

One commenter suggested that the training under this priority be restricted to State vocational rehabilitation
personnel. 


Discussion: 

State vocational rehabilitation personnel are but one resource for individuals with disabilities. Other significant
resources include services and personnel provided by community rehabilitation programs. On-going post-employment
training targeted to these programs is necessary to achieve improved employment outcomes for persons with disabilities.
In addition, the Rehabilitation Act requires that a large portion of the training program allocation be used solely
for State agency personnel training. The purpose of this priority is to target funds specifically toward a population
of personnel that does not receive specific funding. 


Changes: 

None. 


Rehabilitation Short-Term Training Program 


Priority 1_Personnel Specifically Trained To Deliver Services in Client Assistance Programs 




Comments: 

One commenter indicated that the priority would be enhanced by inclusion of training in systemic advocacy. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that systemic advocacy is an important component of Client Assistance Programs and believes
that the priority as written allows for this type of training under this priority. 


Changes: 

None. 


Priority 2_Training Rehabilitation and Mental Health Personnel To Provide Improved Rehabilitation Services to
Individuals With Mental Illness 




Comments: 

One commenter indicated that the use of a strong peer-counseling role in the provision of support to consumers and
their families has been beneficial and should be a component of the proposed priority. 


Discussion: 

Training on the use of demonstrated beneficial strategies such as peer-counseling is authorized under the priority.



Changes: 

None.


Priority 3_Training Members of American Indian Tribes, State Vocational Rehabilitation Staff, and Rehabilitation
Educators on Services for American Indians With Disabilities 




Comments: 

One commenter expressed concern that the priority restricts training to States having high American Indian populations
when the needs of American Indians living in States with low populations are just as great. In addition, the commenter
indicated that, since the needs of these two groups are different, it will be difficult for States with low American
Indian populations to successfully replicate the training models developed. For these reasons, the commenter recommended
that the priority be opened to all States.

<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00164 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion

: The Secretary does not agree that the needs and issues of the individuals are different if the population of American
Indians is low in the State. Services still must be culturally appropriate for the individuals. The purpose of the
training is to develop the skills of rehabilitation counselors and other staff who work in State rehabilitation agencies
on how to work effectively with American Indians. The priority mandates that the project address the use of appropriate
rehabilitation methods, cultural differences, and development of mutual understanding and trust between the service
provider and recipient of services through the development of culturally sensitive rehabilitation training materials.
The Secretary does not agree that replication will be difficult since the size of the population within the State is
not considered to be a factor in using appropriate rehabilitation methods that respect the cultural differences.
The Secretary does agree, however, that the training should be made available to all States where there is a significant
population of American Indians since the State is required to provide vocational rehabilitation services to American
Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing in the State to the same extent as the State provides those
services to other significant segments of the population of individuals with disabilities residing in the State
(section 101(a)(20) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended). 


Changes:

 The priority has been changed to target States with significant rather than high American Indian populations. 


Comments:

 One commenter indicated opposition to the priority because of its focus on one specific population, stating that
such a focus would encourage division among the underserved and unserved. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary does not agree that focusing this priority on a population that is one of the most underserved and unserved
groups of individuals with disabilities would encourage division among unserved and underserved groups. The Secretary
believes that the cultural differences of American Indians requires special emphasis to improve services. 


Changes:

 None.


Comments:

 One commenter expressed concern over the train-the-trainer approach required by this priority and recommended
that the best approach to understanding the rehabilitation issues and ensuring sensitivity to cultural needs is
to use American Indians to help State agency personnel improve skills necessary for the provision of services. The
commenter believes that focusing on the development of local relationships and the use of available materials would
serve State agencies better and that a collaborative training approach would be more appropriate. 


Discussion:

 The inclusion of American Indians in the development of all aspects of the training and in the development of training
materials under this priority is mandatory. Additionally, nothing in this priority or in the train-the-trainer
approach would preclude the use of already available materials. The Secretary further notes that training in the
development of local relationships can be included in the training materials that address appropriate rehabilitation
methods in providing vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities. 


Changes:

 None. 


Training of Interpreters for Individuals Who Are Deaf and Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind 


General Comments 




Comments:

 Two commenters recommended that a significant effort and commitment be made to the training of oral interpreters
and that training become a funding priority. It was suggested that applicants for grants be asked to document how they
will interest people in oral interpreting training and to include information on the contents of the curriculum.



Discussion:

 The regulations in 34 CFR 396.1 describe the Training of Interpreters for Individuals Who Are Deaf and Individuals
Who Are Deaf-Blind program as a program that trains a sufficient number of skilled interpreters to meet the communication
needs of individuals who are deaf and individuals who are deaf-blind by training manual, tactile, oral, and cued speech
interpreters. The curriculum developed by the National Technical Institute for the Deaf for the training of oral
interpreters is included in the training program conducted by the two federally funded national interpreter training
projects and is also being used by the 10 regional interpreter training projects. In addition, within the curriculum
of each of the affiliate institutions, preservice training programs provide an introduction to oral interpreting
and other interpreting methodologies.

Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter recommended that research be conducted, perhaps under the auspices of National Institute on Disability
and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), in the area of sign-to-voice interpreting to identify the factors involved
in the development of competency in sign-to-voice interpreting. Concern was also expressed about the proliferation
of the interpreter certification systems, and commenters urged that a stronger link be established between current
projects involved in training of sign language interpreters and external practices for evaluation and certification
of sign language interpreters. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes the importance of competency in the area of sign-to-voice interpreting and believes that
it is the responsibility of the training projects to include this aspect of interpreting in their curricula. The comment
concerning the need for research in this area will be shared with appropriate individuals in NIDRR. Concerning the
need for stronger links between the training projects and the authorities responsible for evaluation and certification
of interpreters, 34 CFR 396.20 of the regulations on application content requires that an application include an
assurance that the project shall cooperate or coordinate its activities, as appropriate, with the activities of
other projects funded under this program. In addition, the Secretary points out that certain projects that are currently
funded are coordinating with external entities in the field for the certification of sign language interpreters.



Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter supported the priority to increase the focus on training of interpreters for individuals who are deaf-blind;
however, it was requested that the Department consider the maximum possible project period of 60 months as a full funding
cycle rather than assessing the project during its third year to determine whether there is a need to provide funding
beyond 36 months. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary believes that an assessment during
the third year of the project period is necessary to ensure that the project is meeting the objectives established
in its original application and to determine whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Two commenters suggested that the project period be permitted to extend beyond 60 months. 


Discussion:

 The project period is limited by the Act to no more than 60 months. Furthermore, the Secretary believes that the 
60-month project period will provide sufficient time to carry out the requirements of this priority.

Comments:

 One commenter requested that additional requirements be included under this priority to require adherence to the
Conference of Interpreter Trainers program standards, and that the project also include a program component that
shows an effort to recruit and train individuals who are deaf to become interpreters/transliterators for individuals
who are deaf-blind. 


Discussion:

 The regulations in  396.4 define ``qualified professional'' as an individual who has either met existing national
or State certification or evaluation requirements; or successfully demonstrated equivalent interpreting skills
through prior work experience. The Secretary believes that this definition gives the project the necessary flexibility
to determine the most appropriate certification or evaluation requirements for its purpose and geographic area.
The regulations in 34 CFR 385.44 require that any grantee who provides training must give due regard to the training
of individuals with disabilities as part of its effort to increase the number of qualified personnel available to
provide rehabilitation services. The Secretary believes that this requirement adequately responds to the recommendation
that the project make an effort to recruit and train individuals who are deaf to become interpreters/transliterators
for individuals who are deaf-blind. 


Changes:

 None. 


Priority 1_National Project with Major Emphasis on Interpreting for Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind 




Comments:

 One commenter suggested that the training program be located in proximity to a substantial population of individuals
who are deaf-blind. 


Discussion:

 The regulations in 34 CFR 396.20(b) require that the project's application include a description of the geographical
area to be served. The instructions accompanying the request for applications will emphasize further this requirement
to highlight the importance of the existence of an adequate target population to be served by the project in its geographical
area. 


Changes:

 None. 


Priority 2_National Project to Address the Interpreting Needs of Culturally Diverse Communities 




Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the purpose of the program as stated in the notice of proposed priorities be modified
by inserting between the words ``skilled interpreters'' and ``throughout'' the following phrase: ``particularly
those from culturally diverse backgrounds.'' 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that this suggestion has merit because it emphasizes the importance of recruiting potential
interpreters from those culturally diverse communities; however, the purpose of the program is stated in the regulations
and was simply repeated for informational purposes in the notice of proposed priorities. Consequently, it would
be necessary to propose the requested change in a notice of proposed rulemaking.

Comment: 

Two commenters voiced support for this priority and one of these two commenters recommended that the training projects
be housed in an Historically Black College or University (HBCU). The other commenter believed that the priority should
establish appropriate liaisons with postsecondary education institutions with significant enrollment of students
representing culturally diverse backgrounds, particularly Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates this support and notes that the regulations in 34 CFR 396.2 concerning eligibility for
an award would include applications for training grants from Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 


Changes: 

None. 


Rehabilitation Training 




Purpose of Program: 

The Rehabilitation Training program supports projects to ensure that skilled personnel are available to provide
rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities through vocational, medical, social, and psychological
rehabilitation programs, through supported employment programs, through independent living services programs,
and through client assistance programs. The program supports projects to maintain and upgrade basic skills and knowledge
of personnel employed to provide state-of-the-art service delivery systems and rehabilitation technology services.

Priority


Priority_National Clearinghouse of Rehabilitation Training Materials 
Background


The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) has funded a clearinghouse for rehabilitation training materials
since 1961. Over the years, the clearinghouse has facilitated the development and dissemination of material for
use in the training of rehabilitation personnel. Regulations for the Rehabilitation Training program in 34 CFR 385.42
state that a set of any training materials developed under the Rehabilitation Training program must be submitted
to any information clearinghouse designated by the Secretary. The project funded under this priority would be designated
to receive training materials developed by other projects during the project's duration. Users of the clearinghouse
cover the range of rehabilitation providers, but most frequently include State vocational rehabilitation agency
personnel, rehabilitation counselors, rehabilitation educators, community rehabilitation program personnel,
and advocates for individuals with disabilities. 
The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. 


Priority


The project must_
 Demonstrate experience and capacity to provide for a national clearinghouse of rehabilitation training
materials; 
 Identify and gather rehabilitation information and training materials for use in preparing pre-service
and in-service education and training for rehabilitation personnel; 
 Disseminate, in a cost-effective manner, rehabilitation information and state-of-the-art training materials
and methods to rehabilitation personnel to assist them in achieving improved outcomes in vocational rehabilitation,
supported employment, and independent living; and 
 Provide linkages and policies for the exchange of information and referral of inquiries with other existing
clearinghouses and information centers supported by the U.S. Department of Education, including the Educational
Resources Information Center and the National Rehabilitation Information Center.

Program Authority:

 29 U.S.C. 774.


Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs




Purpose of Program: 

The Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs are designed to support training centers that serve either a Federal
region or another geographical area and provide for a broad integrated sequence of training activities that focus
on meeting recurrent and common training needs of employed rehabilitation personnel throughout a multi-State geographical
area. 


For Further Information Contact: 

Beverly Steburg, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W., Room 3328 Switzer Building, Washington,

deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1-800-877-8339 between 8 a.m.
and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. 


Priority


Priority_Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs for Providers of Community Rehabilitation Services 
Background


In section 2(a) (2) and (5) of the Act, Congress reported findings that, as a group, individuals with disabilities
constitute one of the most disadvantaged groups in society subject to discrimination in many critical areas, including
employment. Furthermore, Congress found that individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most
severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate
services and supports are provided. 
Community rehabilitation programs, working closely with individuals with disabilities, their advocates, representatives,
families, labor unions, and employers, are a significant resource for addressing the national problem of unemployment
and underemployment of individuals with severe disabilities. Those programs serve an estimated two million individuals
with disabilities annually, many through referral arrangements with vocational rehabilitation State agencies.

Ongoing post-employment training is needed for all who work in community rehabilitation programs to achieve improved
employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities, especially volunteers, providers, and employers who fill
key roles in staffing, directing, and using these programs. 
In the past, RSA funded many nonacademic training programs that maintain or upgrade the skills of currently employed
individuals in community rehabilitation programs under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program. However,
final regulations for the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program 
(59 FR 31060) focus on the support of academic programs that award degrees or certificates. Therefore, support for
nonacademic training programs will be carried out under the other applicable training program authorities, such
as this Rehabilitation Continuing Education program, the Short-Term Training program, and the Experimental and
Innovative Training program. 
The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.

Priorities 


Priority 1_Personnel Specifically Trained to Deliver Services in Client Assistance Programs 


Background 


The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-569) made significant changes in rehabilitation service
provisions under Title I of the Act. Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) provide assistance in informing and advising
all clients and applicants of available benefits under the Act. Section 302 of the Act includes personnel specifically
trained to deliver services in CAPs to be among the personnel that the Rehabilitation Training program must consider
in reviewing personnel shortages and training needs. Through the 1992 Survey of Personnel Shortages and Training
Needs in Vocational Rehabilitation, CAP directors have reported critical training needs for both CAP administrative
and service-delivery personnel. 
The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. 


Priority 


The project must_
 Provide training to CAP personnel on an as-needed basis, including_(1) Management training on skills needed
for strategic and operational planning and direction of CAP services; and (2) Consumer advocacy training on skills
and knowledge needed by CAP staff to assist persons with disabilities to gain access to and to use the services and benefits
available under the Rehabilitation Act, particularly new Title I requirements; 
 Coordinate training efforts with training supported by the Center for Mental Health Services and the Administration
on Developmental Disabilities for protection and advocacy on common 
areas, such as financial management; and 
 Include both national and regional training seminars in each project year.

Priority 2_Training Rehabilitation and Mental Health Personnel to Provide Improved Rehabilitation Services to
Individuals With Mental Illness 
Background 


High turnover rates and inadequate academic preparation of service staff are continuing problems among programs
providing rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness (Pratt and Gill, ``Developing Interagency
In-Service Training,'' 
Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal, Vol. 16, No. 1, July, 1992). Ongoing research has documented the need for competency-based
training to promote the recruitment, career development, and retention of personnel who provide support and rehabilitation
services to persons with mental illness (``A Comprehensive Study of Human Resource Development Issues_Present
and Future_for Personnel Providing Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services,'' Project No. H133G10072, awarded
July 1, 1991, by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research to the International Association
of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services). 
Provision of rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness is complicated by the need for staff to
interact frequently with professionals in other agencies and disciplines. Cross-training of counselors, psychiatrists,
psychologists, social workers, evaluators, and other professionals is essential to effective interagency cooperation.
Rehabilitation and related staff must be knowledgeable about key legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,
the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Social Security Act. Increasingly, rehabilitation services involve
persons with severe mental illness making their own choices and family members having a role in rehabilitation programs.
Staff require training to be effective in consumer-directed rehabilitation. 
The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months. 


Priority 


Projects must_
 Develop training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing personnel in providing mental health and
vocational rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness; 
 Disseminate training materials on organizational coordination, resources, and organizational linkages,
including findings from RSA-supported demonstration projects, that will enhance employment outcomes of individuals
with mental illness served by the programs of vocational rehabilitation, supported employment, and independent
living; 
 Improve the skills of rehabilitation counselors, administrators, and related professionals, such as psychologists,
evaluators, and psychiatrists, in working with persons with mental illness disabilities in the development and
implementation of Individualized Written Rehabilitation Programs and vocational placements; 
 Develop instructional techniques for working with consumers and family members on problem-solving and decisionmaking
skills that will enhance employment outcomes; 
 Include information in curriculum materials on provisions of Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act that
are related to work incentives for individuals with disabilities and on employment-related provisions of the Americans
with Disabilities Act; 
 Provide training through special seminars, institutes, workshops, and other short-term courses in technical
matters relating to the delivery of rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness; 
 Provide training for three or more States; and 
 Demonstrate potential for replication based on project outcomes through the dissemination of training materials
and protocols. 


Priority 3_Training Members of American Indian Tribes, State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency Staff, and Rehabilitation
Educators on Services for American Indians With Disabilities 
Background 


The Act has a number of provisions that relate to the needs of American Indians with disabilities. Under section 101(a)(20),
States are required, as appropriate, to actively consult in the development of the State plan for vocational services
with American Indian tribes and tribal organizations and Native Hawaiian organizations.

<DOCNO> FR941205-2-00171 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941205-2-00074 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 101(a)(15) requires that States conduct continuing statewide studies of the needs of individuals with disabilities
and how these needs may be most effectively met, including outreach to minorities and those who have been unserved
or underserved. Vocational rehabilitation services are provided under section 130 of the Act to American Indians
residing on reservations. Under the Act, the term American Indians includes Eskimos and Aleuts. 
American Indians have one of the highest disability rates of all population groups. Yet, according to recent RSA statistical
data on the vocational rehabilitation program, when American Indians with disabilities receive vocational rehabilitation
services, they have a low rehabilitation success rate. 
Some of the major problems in providing services to American Indians include_(1) Lack of outreach efforts to rural
and isolated areas where many American Indians live; (2) Cultural differences that make use of standard rehabilitation
practices or methods less effective and may lead to lack of mutual understanding and trust between the provider and
recipient of services; (3) Language and communication barriers; and (4) Limited employment opportunities in rural
areas and on reservations. 
These problems are being addressed, in part, through the American Indian vocational rehabilitation services (section
130) discretionary grants. Increased cooperative efforts and sharing of information have occurred as a result of
linkages between the discretionary projects and State rehabilitation agencies. There is a great need, however,
for training methods and materials to improve the provision of services to American Indians with disabilities. Rehabilitation
counselors and other staff who work in State rehabilitation agencies that serve significant populations of American
Indians need training on how to work effectively with this population. In addition, institutions of higher education,
which prepare individuals to provide vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities,
have a need for culturally appropriate materials. 
The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months. 


Priority


The project must_

 Develop, with the active participation of American Indians, culturally sensitive rehabilitation training
materials that address the use of appropriate rehabilitation methods, cultural differences, and development of
mutual understanding and trust between service provider and recipient; 
 Use a ``train-the-trainer'' approach to train State rehabilitation unit in-service training educators
and rehabilitation educators on all materials developed in order to improve the skills and knowledge of personnel
providing vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities;

 Conduct seminars and workshops for rehabilitation counselors and upper management rehabilitation administrators
in States with significant American Indian populations on how to reach out to American Indian populations with disabilities,
including effective services planning in conjunction with section 130 American Indian vocational rehabilitation
services grants; 
 Provide training in State agencies with significant American Indian populations; and 
 Demonstrate potential for replication based on project outcomes through the dissemination of training materials
and protocols. 


Priority 4_Training Impartial Hearing Officers on Provisions of the Act 
Background


The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 contain several new requirements for due process applicable to State rehabilitation
agencies that provide services under Title I of the Act. For example, agency personnel shall presume that an applicant
can benefit from vocational rehabilitation services unless they can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence
that the applicant is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment
outcome. If an individual with a disability is dissatisfied with an eligibility determination or other decisions
affecting the nature, scope, onset, duration, or other conditions of services, the applicant or recipient is entitled
to a fair hearing before an impartial hearing officer under section 102(d) of the Act. 
An impartial hearing officer is defined in section 7(28) of the Act. Among the qualifications the impartial hearing
officer must have is knowledge of the delivery of vocational rehabilitation services, the State plan for rehabilitation
services, and the Federal and State regulations governing the provision of services. Hearing officers are required
in section 102(d)(2)(C) of the Act to be qualified to perform their official duties. 
One problem in training hearing officers is that there is a lack of an organized and accessible information base of
hearing decisions and appeals such as is commonly found in our judicial system. Those compilations relate hearing
decisions to State administrative case law, encourage the use of precedent in hearing decisions, provide evaluative
data to State agencies on policies and practices that require revision or remediation, and provide information for
use by the Federal Government in its monitoring responsibilities. A digest of hearing decisions and appeals, if published
nationally, would also be of great benefit to multiple agencies, constituent groups, and Client Assistance Programs.

The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months. The Secretary expects that the materials
developed under this project would be used by projects funded under the State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service
Training program, the Rehabilitation Continuing Education Program, and the Client Assistance Program training
projects. 


Priority


The project must_
 Provide seminars and workshops for impartial hearing officers that address the many changes in due process
requirements in the Act, including_(1) The rights and remedies for people with disabilities seeking services under
Title I of the Act; and (2) The conduct of impartial hearings; 
 Develop model materials and decision compilations (including, if appropriate, computer-accessed compilations)
for in-State and national dissemination of information on hearing decisions and appeals; and 
 Provide training that is national in scope and training approaches and materials that, when replicated and
adapted, are suited to train State rehabilitation agency staff and Client Assistance Program staff who have significant
involvement with hearings and hearing officers.

Training of Interpreters for Individuals Who Are Deaf and Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind 





Purpose of Program:

 The purpose of this program is to assist in providing a sufficient number of skilled interpreters throughout the country
for employment in public and private agencies, schools, and other service-providing institutions to meet the communication
needs of individuals who are deaf and individuals who are deaf-blind by_(1) Training manual, tactile, oral, and cued
speech interpreters; (2) Ensuring the maintenance of the skills of interpreters; and (3) Providing opportunities
for interpreters to raise their level of competence. 



For Further Information Contact:

 Victor Galloway, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue, S.W., Room 3228, Switzer Building, Washington,
D.C. 20202-2736. Telephone: (202) 205-9152. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the
deaf (TDD) may call the TDD number at (202) 205-8352. 



Priorities: 



Priority 1_National Project With Major Emphasis on Interpreting for Individuals Who Are Deaf-Blind 

Background



The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 expanded the purpose and scope of this program to include a requirement
that each funded project train interpreters for ``individuals who are deaf-blind'' as well as interpreters for ``individuals
who are deaf.'' Each project has the discretion to provide training for interpreters for these two disability populations
to the extent, and in the specific communication modes, appropriate to the needs of these populations in the geographical
area to be served by the project. To participate in major life activities, increased numbers of individuals who are
deaf-blind require skilled interpreting services. Interpreting for individuals who are deaf-blind is an intensive,
one-to-one exercise, requiring significant skill. Expertise in the training of interpreters for individuals who
are deaf-blind needs to be developed and made available to the field. A national project is needed that will give primary
focus to training interpreters for individuals who are deaf-blind to better enable regional projects supported
under this program to meet the communication needs of individuals who are deaf-blind. A national project is also needed
to assist in improving the training of interpreters for individuals who are deaf. 


There is also need for technical assistance to regional projects on curriculum development for interpreters to serve
deaf-blind individuals and on model methods of instruction for use in the training of interpreters. The Secretary
has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will
be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the
project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months.

Priority 



This project must_

 Be of national scope; 
 Concentrate on curriculum development for training interpreters for individuals who are deaf-blind in order
to improve the capabilities of regional projects; 
 Furnish technical assistance to the regional projects in training interpreters to meet the communication
needs of individuals who are deaf; 
 Establish cooperative relationships with the regional interpreter training projects to be funded by the
Secretary in fiscal year 1995; 
 Use collaborative training approaches, such as workshops and seminars, to address curriculum development,
classroom training of interpreters, preparation of interpreter trainers (faculty development), and other activities
that will increase the number of interpreters and the skills and knowledge of interpreters to meet the communication
needs of individuals who are deaf and individuals who are deaf-blind. 



Priority 2_National Project to Address the Interpreting Needs of Culturally Diverse Communities 

Background



A national project is needed that will provide technical assistance to interpreter training projects to improve
the recruitment of interpreters who are minority group members and to improve the training of interpreters to better
meet the special needs of minority individuals who are deaf or deaf-blind. This project would assist all other projects
funded under this program in increasing their efforts in these areas and in better meeting the interpreting needs
of different cultures. 

The interpreter service needs of minority group individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing is an issue that has been
raised nationally. An RSA-funded evaluation study reported that approximately 90 percent of graduates from the
interpreter training programs around the country are White, while 4 percent are African-American and 5 percent are
Hispanic. The National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf reported that, in a given year, of 2,057 interpreters
certified by their registry, only 20 were non-White persons. A Health Interview Survey, conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics in 1990-91, reported that of the 20 million individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing,
1.2 million are Afro-American and 900,000 are Hispanic. 

A national project is needed to concentrate on curriculum that will improve the skills of interpreters working with
minority group members. Strategies for the recruitment of minority interpreters also need to be developed and made
available to the field. 

The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least
36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third
year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. 



Priority 



This project must_

 Be of national scope; 
 Provide technical assistance to the regional interpreter training projects supported under this program
in recruiting and training interpreters to meet the communication needs of culturally diverse populations; 
 Develop curriculum to improve the knowledge of interpreters with respect to social and cultural concepts
of interpreting, such as body language, spatial considerations, and communication between individuals from different
cultures; 

 Establish cooperative relationships with the regional projects to be funded by the Secretary during fiscal
year 1995 by conducting workshops and seminars to improve curriculum development, classroom training of interpreters,
preparation of interpreter trainers, recruitment outreach to members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and
other activities that will increase the number and skills of interpreters to help meet the communication needs of
individuals from different cultures; and 

 In carrying out project activities, address at a minimum the needs of the minority populations referred to
in section 21 of the Rehabilitation Act, including African-Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asian-Americans.
