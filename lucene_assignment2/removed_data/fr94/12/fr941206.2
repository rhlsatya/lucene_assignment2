<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Determination.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, Sections 182, 
224, and 225, I have determined that the Census Bureau needs to collect 
data covering annual sales, year-end inventories, purchases, and accounts receivables to provide a sound statistical
basis for the formation of 
policy by various government agencies. These data also apply to a 
variety of public and business needs. This annual survey is a 
continuation of similar retail trade surveys conducted each year since 
1951 (except 1954). It provides, on a comparable classification basis, 
annual sales, purchases, and accounts receivable balances for 1994, and 
year-end inventories for 1993 and 1994. These data are not available 
publicly on a timely basis from nongovernmental or other governmental 
sources. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Census Bureau is authorized to take 
surveys necessary to furnish current data on the subjects covered by 
the major censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey will provide continuing and timely national
statistical data on retail trade for the period between economic censuses. The 1992 Economic 
Censuses are currently being tabulated. The data collected in this 
survey will be within the general scope and nature of those inquiries 
covered in the economic census. 


The Census Bureau will require a selected sample of firms operating 
retail establishments in the United States (with sales size determining 
the probability of selection) to report in the 1994 Annual Retail Trade Survey. We will furnish report forms to the
firms covered by 
this survey and will require their submissions within thirty days after receipt. The sample will provide, with measurable
reliability, 
statistics on the subjects specified above. 
This survey was cleared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act,
Public Law 96-511, as 
amended, and was cleared under OMB Control No. 0607-0013. We will 
provide copies of the form upon written request to the Director, Bureau 
of the Census, Washington, DC 20233. 
Based upon the foregoing, I have directed that an annual survey be 
conducted for the purpose of collecting these data.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Consideration.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census is 
considering a proposal to conduct the 1994 Transportation Annual Survey under the authority of Title 13, United States
Code, Sections 131, 182, 224, and 225. On the basis of information and recommendations received by the Bureau of the
Census, the data have significant application to the needs of the public and industry and are not available from nongovernmental
sources. We will provide national estimates of the dollar volume of revenue and expenses for the for-hire trucking
and public warehousing industries, as well as inventories of revenue-generating equipment for the trucking industry.





Effective with the 1994 survey, the Census Bureau proposes changes to the trucking questionnaires. We propose to
adopt a more descriptive name for this survey and add questions that will allow publication of data on miles traveled,
weight of shipments, and revenue from transborder shipments.



 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Census Bureau is authorized to conduct surveys necessary to furnish current data on subjects covered by the major
censuses authorized by Title 13 of the United States Code. This 
survey will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on 
the for-hire trucking and public warehousing industries for the period between the economic censuses. The next economic
census is in 1997. 
The data collected in this survey will be within the general scope, 
type, and character of those inquiries covered in the economic censuses. 
Preliminary information and recommendations received by the Bureau of 
the Census indicate that the data have significant application to the informational needs of government agencies,
the public, and the transportation industries. Furthermore, these data are not publicly available from other sources
on a continuing basis. 



The Bureau of the Census needs reports only from a limited sample of trucking and warehousing firms in the United States.
The probability of 
a firm's selection is based on revenue size (estimated from payroll). 
The sample will provide, with measurable reliability, statistics on the aforementioned industries. We will mail
report forms to the firms covered by this survey and require their submission within thirty days after receipt. 


This survey has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval in accordance with the Paperwork
Reduction Act, Public Law 96-511, as amended. Copies of the proposed forms are made available on request to the
Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233.

Foreign-Trade Zone 77, Memphis, TN; 
Application for Subzone Status 
Brother Industries (U.S.A.) Inc. 
(Typewriters and Word Processors) 
Bartlett, TN


An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the City of Memphis, Tennessee,
grantee of FTZ 77, requesting special-purpose subzone status at the typewriter and word processor manufacturing
facilities of Brother Industries (U.S.A.) Inc. (Brother) (a subsidiary of Brother International Corporation (BIC))
located in Bartlett, Tennessee. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones
Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November
22, 1994. 
The Brother facilities include a manufacturing site (231,000 sq. ft., 25 acres) located at Brother Boulevard and
Highway 64, Bartlett, and a nearby BIC warehouse (270,000 sq. ft., 20 acres) located at 3131 Appling Road, Bartlett.
Both sites are within the Bartlett Municipal Industrial Park. The facilities (520 employees) are used to manufacture
electric and automatic typewriters and word processors. Certain components are sourced from abroad, including
circuit boards, disk drives, signalling devices, motors, integrated circuits, capacitors, diodes, transistors,
resistors, wire, cable, springs, steel fasteners, pulleys and gears. It is estimated that foreign status 
merchandise would represent 50 to 60 percent of total product value. 
Zone procedures would exempt Brother from Customs duty payments on parts and materials used in finished products
that are exported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to choose the finished product duty rates (zero
to 2.2%). The duty rates on components average 4 percent. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures
would help improve the plant's international competitiveness. 
In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the
application and report to the Board. 
Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is [60 days
from date of publication]. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be
submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 21, 1995). 
A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations.

ACTION: 

Notice of Opportunity to Request Administrative Review of Antidumping or Countervailing Duty Order, Finding, or
Suspended Investigation.







BACKGROUND: 

Each year during the anniversary month of the publication of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, finding,
or suspension of investigation, an interested party, as defined in section 771(9) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
may request, in accordance with section 353.22 or 355.22 of the Department of Commerce (the Department) Regulations
(19 CFR 353.22/355.22 (1993)), that the Department conduct an administrative review of that antidumping or countervailing
duty order, finding, or suspended investigation.





OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST A REVIEW: 

Not later than December 31, 1994, interested parties may request administrative review of the following orders,
findings, or suspended investigations, with anniversary dates in December for the following periods:

In accordance with sections 353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the regulations, an interested party as defined by 353.2(k)
may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested
party must specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting
a review, and the requesting party must state why it desires the Secretary to review those particular producers or
resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which were produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.

Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: John Kugelman,
in room 3065 of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with section 353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the regulations,
a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list.

The Department will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping (Countervailing) Duty Administrative Review,'' for requests received
by December 31, 1994. If the Department does not receive, by December 31, 1994, a request for review of entries covered
by an order or finding listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs
Service to assess antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond
for) estimated antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal
from warehouse, for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

This notice is not required by statute, but is published as a service to the international trading community.

Best Information Available (BIA) 



In investigations involving imports from non-market economy countries, unless respondents request and qualify
for separate rates, we apply the same rate to all exports from that country. Since neither respondent in this case qualified
for separate rates, they will be treated as a single respondent for purposes of assigning an antidumping margin. 

Although the respondents did attempt to cooperate with the Department's requests for documents during their respective
verifications, they were not able to provide the full range of documentation necessary for the Department to establish
the accuracy and completeness of the information provided (see verification reports). Therefore, the Department
must assign a dumping margin on the basis of BIA, pursuant to section 776 (b) and (c) of the Act. 

In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department applies a methodology which has been upheld by the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit in 

Allied-Signal 

v. 

United States, 

996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Specifically, in the case where there is only one respondent, and that respondent has
been cooperative, the Department assigns as BIA the higher of (a) the estimated margin found in the preliminary determination,
or (b) the margin in the petition. (Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other
than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992, 19033 (May 3, 1989)).
Accordingly, the Department is using as BIA the estimated margin calculated in the preliminary determination (

i.e., 

163 percent). 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we attempted to verify information provided by respondents by using standard
verification procedures, including the examination of sales and accounting records, and selection of original
source documentation containing relevant information. However, as noted above, we were not able to verify the accuracy
and completeness of the respondents' submissions. 



Critical Circumstances 



On June 10, 1994, we preliminarily found that critical circumstances exist for the two respondents in this investigation.


Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act, we based the preliminary decision on a finding of (1) a petition margin (123.02
percent) in excess of 25 percent, and (2) a massive increase in imports. It should be noted that the second part of this
finding, a massive increase in imports, was based on BIA because one respondent, Nikopol, did not provide adequate
information (59 FR 14852, June 17, 1994). 

For the final determination, we have received no information that would lead us to change our preliminary determination
of critical circumstances. We have continued to use BIA as the basis for our determination with regard to a massive
increase in imports, and we determine that critical circumstances exist for all exporters in this investigation.




Interested Party Comments 





Comment 1: 

The petitioners assert that the Department should assign a BIA margin at a rate higher than the petition rate of 125.3
percent because the petition rate was not high enough to induce the respondents to prepare for the verifications.
The petitioners propose that BIA should be based on the amended preliminary determination margin of 163.00 percent
because that margin is based on data supplied to the Department by the respondents.

DOC Position: 

We agree with the petitioners. (See the BIA section of this notice.) 


Suspension of Liquidation 


Consistent with section 734(f)(2)(A) of the Act, the suspension of liquidation of all entries, entered or withdrawn
from warehouse for consumption, of silicomanganese from Ukraine, will not now be reimposed. Suspension of liquidation
will be reinstated only if the International Trade Commission (ITC) issues an affirmative injury determination
and the Department terminates the agreement suspending this investigation. 


ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. The ITC will now determine,
within 45 days, whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry.
If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist, the proceeding will be terminated.
If the ITC determines that such injury does exist, the suspension agreement will remain in force and the Department
will not issue an antidumping duty order. Consistent with section 734(f)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department will not
issue an order, so long as the agreement remains in force. 


Notification to Interested Parties 


This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. 
This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act, 19 USC 1673d(d), and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements
for Telecommunications



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications
is being proposed. This proposed standard specifies a uniform grounding and bonding infrastructure for Federal
buildings. The grounding and bonding infrastructure is consistent with the cabling topology specified in FIPS PUB
174, Federal Building Telecommunications Wiring Standard (ANSI/EIA/TIA-568-1991), and installed
in accordance with FIBS PUB 175, Federal Building Standard for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces (ANSI/EIA/TIA-569-1990).


This proposed FIPS adopts a voluntary industry standard (ANSI/TIA/EIA-607-1994) that was developed
with Federal participation and coordinated by the Federal Telecommunications Standards Committee, an interagency
committee administered by the National Communications System. The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from
the public, manufacturers, and State and local governments so that their views can be considered prior to the submission
of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval.
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with
the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.
Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications (ANSI/TIA/EIA-607-1994) from Global Engineering
Documents, Suite 400, 1990 M Street, NW, Washington, DC 20036, telephone 1-800-854-7179 or 202-429-2860;

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 



(date) 



Announcing the Standard for Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications 



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.


1. Name of Standard. Federal Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications. (Former Draft
Federal Standard 1093). 

2. Category of Standard. Telecommunications Standard; Grounding and Bonding. 

3. Explanation. This standard, by adoption of ANSI/TIA/EIA-607-1994, Commercial Building Grounding
and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications, specifies the requirements for a uniform telecommunications
grounding and bonding infrastructure that should be followed within Federal buildings where telecommunications
equipment is installed. The standard provides the requirements for a ground reference for telecommunications systems
within the telecommunications entrance facility, the telecommunications closet, and equipment room; it also provides
the requirements for bonding and connecting pathways, cable shields, conductors, and hardware at telecommunications
closets, equipment rooms, and entrance facilities. 

This standard supports the telecommunications infrastructure which encompasses telecommunications equipment
spaces, cable pathways, grounding, wiring, termination hardware, and other devices, and which provides the basic
support for the distribution of all forms of information within a building or campus. 

The grounding and bonding approach described in this standard is consistent with the cabling topology specified
in Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 174, Federal Building Telecommunications
Wiring Standard (ANSI/EIA/TIA-568-1991) and installed in accordance with Federal Information Processing
Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 175, Federal Building Standard for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces (ANSI/EIA/TIA-569-1990).


4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce. 

5. Maintenance Agency. National Communications System, Office of Technology and Standards. 

6. Related Documents. 

a. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations subpart 201-20.303, Standards, and subpart 201-39.1002,

b. Federal Standard 1037B, Glossary of Telecommunications Terms.
c. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 174, Federal Building Telecommunications
Wiring Standard (Former Draft Federal Standard 1090).
d. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 175, Federal Building Standard for Telecommunications
Pathways and Spaces (Former Draft Federal Standard 1091).
e. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 176, Residential and Light Commercial Telecommunications
Wiring Standard (Former Draft Federal Standard 1092).
f. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 187, Administration Standard for the Telecommunications
Infrastructure of Federal Buildings (Former Draft Federal Standard 1094).
At the time of publication of this standard, the editions indicated above were valid. All publications are subject
to revision, and parties to agreements based on this standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying
the most recent editions of these publications.
7. Objectives. The purpose of this standard is to facilitate the planning, design, and installation of telecommunications
grounding systems within a Federal government building with or without prior knowledge of the telecommunications
systems that will subsequently be installed. This telecommunications grounding and bonding infrastructure supports
a multivendor, multiproduct environment as well as the grounding practices for various systems that may be installed
on customer premises.
8. Applicability. This standard shall be used by all departments and agencies of the Federal Government in the design,
maintenance, renovation, or retrofit of telecommunications grounding systems within new or existing Federal buildings.
Existing building wiring systems, especially those installed prior to the emergence of digital communications
and voice/data integration, may not readily accept application of this standard. Modernization of the existing
pathway, space, and wiring systems to meet the FIPS 174, FIPS 175, FIPS 176, and FIPS 187 infrastructure standards
may require a significant monetary expenditure. Agencies should conduct a thorough facility analysis of existing
and renovated buildings to determine the cost of applying the standards, and develop a migration plan where cost savings
can be achieved. This plan will help to ensure timely and efficient completion of the conversion process. The result
of following this standard will be a telecommunications infrastructure that supports advanced technology and is
compatible with modern telecommunications equipment. This standard is not intended to hasten the obsolescence
of telecommunications grounding systems currently in use in Federal facilities; nor is it intended to provide systems
engineering or applications guidelines.

<DOCTITLE>Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Scoping</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 1455b, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement
(PEIS) on the approval of state coastal nonpoint pollution control programs.



The requirements of 40 C.F.R. parts 1500-1508 [Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations to implement
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)] apply to the preparation of the PEIS. Specifically, 40 CFR 1501.7 requires
an early and open ``scoping'' process. This notice is part of NOAA's action to comply with the scoping requirement.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990 requires states with coastal zone management
programs that have received Federal approval under section 306 of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) to develop
and implement coastal nonpoint pollution control programs (coastal nonpoint programs). Coastal states are required
to submit their coastal nonpoint programs to NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval by July,
1995. Once approved, these programs will be implemented through changes to the state nonpoint source pollution program
approved by EPA under section 319 of the Clean Water Act and through changes to the state coastal zone management program
approved by NOAA under the CZMA. To assist states in the development of their programs, NOAA and EPA jointly published
a program development and approval guidance document.



EPA also published a technical guidance document specifying management measures for sources of nonpoint pollution
in coastal waters. This management measure guidance addresses five source categories of nonpoint pollution: agriculture,
forestry, urban, marinas, and hydromodification. Management measures are also included for wetlands protection,
riparian areas, and vegetated filter strips. In addition to these management measures, additional management measures
must be developed and implemented by each state for land uses and critical areas adjacent to impaired or threatened
coastal waters.

NOAA proposes to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS). This PEIS will assess the environmental
impacts associated with the implementation of the requirements of the section 6217 program. The PEIS will form the
basis for the subsequent NEPA documents (environmental impact statements or assessments) NOAA will prepare on each
of the 29 state coastal nonpoint programs submitted for approval. When a state program is proposed, a subsequent NEPA
document will be prepared which addresses the state-specific environmental impacts arising from that method of
implementing the program. These subsequent NEPA documents will present a summary of the issues addressed in the PEIS
and, as appropriate, incorporate by reference the analyses presented in the PEIS.

Possible alternatives to the proposed action of approval of the state coastal nonpoint programs include: (a) Conditional
approval of the programs; and, (b) denial of program approval.

Based on discussion with the EPA and other involved Federal agencies and comments received in response to this notice,
NOAA will develop the draft PEIS. The final PEIS will be published in July, 1995. Comments on the draft PEIS will be solicited
and evaluated in accordance with 40 CFR Part 1503.

The following preliminary table of contents for the PEIS has been developed for discussion purposes:

1. Cover Sheet and Abstract.

2. Summary.

3. Table of Contents.

4. Purpose of and Need for the Action._As part of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, states with
approved coastal zone programs are required to develop and implement coastal nonpoint programs. Coastal states
are required to submit their coastal nonpoint programs to NOAA and the EPA for approval by July, 1995. NOAA and EPA must
review the programs within six months.

5. Alternatives, including proposed action._This section will evaluate reasonable alternatives to the approval
of the state programs.

6. Affected Environment._This section will describe the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of
the marine and terrestrial environment within the boundaries of the 6217 management areas that NOAA recommended
after its review of each state's existing coastal zone boundary and coastal watersheds. Land and water uses within
the areas will also be described.

7. Environmental Consequences._This discussion will identify direct and indirect impacts associated with each
management measure and with the implementation of the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program, including any
adverse environmental impacts which cannot be avoided. The relationship between the proposed action and the enhancement
of long-term productivity and the irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources will be described.

8. List of Preparers.

9. List of Agencies, Organizations and Persons to Whom EIS Sent.

10. Index.

11. Appendices.

Imports charged to these category limits for the period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 shall be charged
against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that
period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.

The limits set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future according to the provisions of the current bilateral
agreement between the Governments of the United States and Jamaica.

In accordance with the provisions of the Special Access Program, as set forth in 51 FR 21208 (June 11, 1986), 52 FR 26057
(July 10, 1987) and 54 FR 50425 (December 6, 1989), you are directed to establish guaranteed access levels for properly
certified cotton, man-made fiber and other vegetable fiber textile products in the following categories which are
assembled in Jamaica from fabric formed and cut in the United States and re-exported to the United States from Jamaica
during the twelve-month period which begins on January 1, 1995 and extends through December 31, 1995.



 

Any shipment for entry under the Special Access Program which is not accompanied by a valid and correct certification
and Export Declaration in accordance with the provisions of the certification requirements established in the directive
of February 19, 1987 shall be denied entry unless the Government of Jamaica authorizes the entry and any charges to
the appropriate designated consultation levels or specific limits. Any shipment which is declared for entry under
the Special Access Program but found not to qualify shall be denied entry into the United States.


In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign
affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).

Supplemental Record of Decision (SROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Mather Air Force Base (AFB), California


On November 21, 1994, the Air Force issued the Supplemental Record of Decision (SROD) for Mather Air Force Base (AFB),
California. The decisions included in this SROD have been made in consideration of the Mather AFB Disposal and Reuse
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and released
to the public on April February 18, 1994, and other relevant considerations.
Mather AFB was closed on September 30, 1994. This SROD finalizes the Mather AFB disposal decisions begun with the issuance
of the Record of Decision for the Disposal Reuse of Mather AFB on March 31, 1993.
The major methods which will be utilized to dispose of the approximate 5,716 acre base are: public airport conveyance
(approximately 2,875 acres), public park conveyance (approximately 1,432 acres), and public or negotiated sale
(approximately 899 acres
The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are consistent with the community's
redevelopment plan for the base. The ROD announced that any potential environmental impacts would result directly
from reuse and redevelopment by others. Likewise, most of the mitigation of environmental impacts would be the responsibility
of future owners and developers. The Air Force has tried to take all practical measures to avoid or minimize environmental
harm that may occur as a result of its disposal action.
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John P. Carr, Program Manager, Northwest Region. Correspondence
should be sent to AFBCA/NW, 1700 N. Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209-2809.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement for Homestead Air Force
Base (AFB), FL</DOCTITLE>



On October 26, 1994, the Air Force issued the Record of Decision (ROD) for the disposal of a portion of Homestead Air
Force Base (AFB), Florida. The decisions included in this ROD have been made in consideration of the Homestead AFB
Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection
Agency on February 18, 1994, and other relevant considerations.

Homestead AFB was realigned on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (DBCRA) (Public
Law 101-510) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. This
ROD documents the Homestead AFB disposal decisions.

The methods which will be utilized to dispose of the approximate 2,014 acre closure portion of the base are: public
airport conveyance (approximately 1,880 acres), homeless assistance public health conveyance (approximately
75 acres), transfers to U.S. Departments of Labor (approximately 40 acres) and the Treasury (approximately 19 acres).
The bank and credit union will be provided the opportunity to purchase the land underlying the buildings they have
constructed. Base utilities will be disposed of separately. Not yet resolved is whether the Florida Army National
Guard will require property for an armory. That matter is under consideration at the Department of the Army and will
require Department of Defense approval.

The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are consistent with the community's
redevelopment plan for the base. Data County prepared the plan, with the assistance of the broader community, and
further refined the plan through the County's proposed Airport Master Plan, which it submitted to the Federal Aviation
Administration.

The ROD announced that any potential environmental impacts would result directly from reuse and redevelopment by
others. Likewise, most of the mitigations of environmental impacts would be the responsibility of future owners
and developers. The Air Force has tried to take all practical measures to avoid or minimize environmental harm that
may occur as a result of its disposal action.

Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. Patrick W. McCullough, Program Manager, Southeast
Division. Correspondence should be sent to AFBCA/SE, 1700 N. Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209-2809.

Snettisham Project; Wholesale Power Rates


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Alaska Power Administration, Department of Energy


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rate adjustment for the Snettisham Project, notice of public forum and opportunity for review
and comment.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Alaska Power Administration (APA) is proposing to adjust the rates for the Snettisham Project. The present rate of
32.1 mills per kilowatthour is insufficient to meet the Snettisham Project's repayment criteria. APA proposes to
raise the rate for firm energy to 34.4 mills per kilowatthour beginning May 1, 1995, for a period of up to five years.
Rates for non-firm energy deliveries under both the oil displacement and wood-heat displacement programs would
not change. The final proposal may differ from the present. The proposed rates will be submitted to the Deputy Secretary
of Energy for interim approval and to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for review and final approval.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed rates apply for power sold from the Snettisham Hydroelectric Project to the electric utility serving
the Juneau area and a State-owned hatchery at the Snettisham Project.


Details of the proposed rates, including supporting studies, are available for inspection at Alaska Power Administration,
2770 Sherwood Lane, Suite 2B, Juneau, Alaska. A public information and comment forum is scheduled to be held January
12, 1995, at 7:00 PM, in Room 320 of the Super 8 Motel, 2295 Trout Street, Juneau, Alaska. APA is requesting that the parties
interested in attending the public information and comment forum notify APA of this intent in writing by January 5,
1995. If APA has not received any written notices of intent to attend the forum the APA Administrator will cancel the
forum, as allowed in 10 CFR 903.15(c) and 10 CFR 903.16(c). Authorities for the proposed rate action are the 1962 Flood
Control Act (Public Law 87-874), the Water Resource Development Act (Public Law 94-587) and the Department
of Energy Organization Act (Public Law 95-91). Alaska Power Administration is developing these rates in accordance
with DOE financial reporting policies, procedures and methodology (DOE Policy RA 6120.2 [September 20, 1979]),
and the procedures for public participation in rate adjustments found in 10 CFR Part 903 (1987) as amended.
The present rates went into effect in October 1991. Since the last rate action, sales have been significantly lower
than projected and the actual cost of the Crater Lake Addition to the Snettisham Project was higher than estimated.
The proposed rate results in a seven percent rate increase. This is below the rate of inflation from 1991 to 1994.
Firm sales from the Snettisham Project were six percent (53 GWh) less than projected in August of 1991. Non-firm sales
were down nine percent (4 GWh). The reduced sales resulted in revenues that were four percent ($1.1 million) less that
forecasted in August 1991. The actual cost, to date, for the Crater Lake Addition is 7 percent ($5 million) higher than
estimated in August of 1991.
The sales forecast APA used in August of 1991 was based on loads during a historically normal weather year. APA has based
its new sales forecast on a more conservative approach using warmer than normal weather load patterns. This results
in lower sales projections due to reduced heating loads. APA believes this will result in more stabile rates for the
Snettisham Project.
The Administration continues to advocate divestiture of APA, and a legislative proposal to authorize the divestiture
is under Congressional consideration. This proposed rate action continues present rate policies under existing
law.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: The proposed rate action will have no significant environmental impact within the meaning
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The proposed action meets the requirements of a categorical exclusion
as defined in 40 CFR 1508.4 and is listed as a categorical exclusion for DOE in 10 CFR 1021 Appendix B4.3. An Environmental
Assessment and an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.

<DOCTITLE>Kittitas Reclamation District; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


November 30, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has
reviewed the application for a license for the Taneum Chute Hydroelectric Project, located on the Kittitas Reclamation
Districts', Taneum Chute irrigation canal near the city of Ellensburg, Washington, and has prepared a Draft Environmental
Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future
environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental
protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect
quality of the human environment. 
Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. 
Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC., 20426. Please affix ``Taneum
Chute Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 10625-001'' to all comments. For further information, contact Gaylord
W. Hoisington at (202) 219-2756.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Principles of Integrated Resource Planning for Use in Resource Acquisition and Transmission Planning
</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Western Area Power Administration, DOE. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed principles and request for public comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposes to use principles of integrated resource planning (IRP) in
its acquisition of resources (supply-side and demand-side) and in its transmission planning program. Western has
developed the proposal contained in this notice for public consideration. After considering public comment on this
proposal, Western will adopt final principles of IRP as the policy under which project-specific resource acquisition
and transmission planning procedures will be developed. These project-specific procedures will be developed through
separate public processes.

3. Evaluation criteria will address cost, environmental impact, dependability, dispatchability, risk, diversity,
and the ability to verify demand-side alternatives. Evaluation criteria will be reviewed as the need for resources
changes or when long-term commitments to purchase power expire. 
4. Evaluation criteria will be consistent with Western's power marketing policy, which states that Federal power
is to be marketed in such a manner as to encourage the most widespread use thereof at the lowest possible rates to consumers
consistent with sound business principles. The policy, found in Delegation Order No. 0204-108 
(58 FR 59716, November 10, 1993), is derived from section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s. 
5. Resource acquisition planning will be consistent with power marketing plans and associated contractual obligations.

6. Resource acquisition decisions will be documented and made available to Western's power customers and the public.

II. Transmission Planning Principles: Western's transmission planning is conducted to assess the capability of
the Federal transmission system to provide adequate and reliable electric service to its customers and the interconnected
power grid. The principles of IRP that will apply to Western's transmission planning are as follows: 
1. Western will conduct early and wide public involvement to confirm the purpose and need of a proposed transmission
project. Western proposes that a public meeting be held early in the planning process once the need for system modifications
has been identified and prior to start of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. 
2. At the public meeting, Western will describe the need to be met and seek comments on alternative ways to address the
need, including demand-side management, new construction, or upgrade of existing facilities. 
3. Western will notify interested parties, including power customers, residents of the area, environmental groups,
various resource suppliers including renewable generation entities, and other transmission utilities in the area,
as well as other participants in the project if it is a joint project. 
4. Alternatives that are feasible will be evaluated for cost, general environmental impacts, and system reliability
concerns in coordination with interested parties. 
5. The results of this evaluation will be made available to Western's power customers and the public. 
Transmission facilities needed for reliability will be based on mitigating problems related to power system operations
or replacing unsafe, aged, worn out, or inefficient equipment. 
Western is committed to join the Western Regional Transmission Association and has joined the Southwest Regional
Transmission Association (SWRTA). Both groups will promote coordinated planning and efficient use of transmission
capacity and will provide another means for involvement by Western's customers. As appropriate, Western can invite
other interested parties to attend SWRTA meetings as guests of Western. It is anticipated that some form of regional
transmission group will be established in the Mid-continent Area Power Pool. This will also facilitate public involvement
in considering Western's future transmission needs. 


Public Process


The public process to determine the principles of integrated resource planning that Western will incorporate into
its resource acquisition and transmission planning processes begins with publication of this notice.
Comments on these proposed principles are being sought during a 90-day comment period. Following this comment period,
the principles to be adopted will be published in the 

Federal Register

. This public process ends with publication of final principles in the 

Federal Register

. Final principles will be effective 30 days after publication. 


Environmental Evaluation


Western is seeking comment on the IRP principles outlined in this notice through a public process. Methods, procedures,
and criteria for implementing these principles have yet to be developed and will be project-specific. Western is
committed to initiating an appropriate public process under NEPA and its implementing regulations for these project-specific
actions at the earliest possible time. The potential environmental effects of the methods, procedures, and criteria
will be evaluated in addition to analyzing the effects of the acquisition of resources in these subsequent processes.



Determination Under Executive Order 12866


DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order
12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly,
no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given in accordance with the provision of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 300f et seq., 
and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B, the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR), that the State of Minnesota
is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) primacy program. The Minnesota Department of Health
(MDH) has adopted drinking water regulations for Lead and Copper, 44 synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs), 12 inorganic
chemicals (IOCs), and 8 volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) that correspond to the NPDWR for Lead and Copper, SOCs,
IOCs, and VOCs, and promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460-26564),
on January 30, 1991 (56 FR 3526-3597), as amended on July 1, 1991 (56 FR 30266-30281), and on July 17, 1992
(57 FR 31776-31849). The USEPA has completed its review of Minnesota's PWSS primacy program revision and has
determined that these sets of state program revisions are not less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations.



The USEPA has determined that the Minnesota rule revisions meet the requirements of the Federal rule. Therefore,
the USEPA has determined that these sets of state program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal
regulations and is proposing to approve the MDH's rule revisions. 
All interested parties are invited to submit written comments on these proposed determinations, and may request
a public hearing on or before January 5, 1995. If a public hearing is requested and granted, the corresponding determination
shall not become effective until such time following the hearing, at which the Regional Administrator issues an order
affirming or rescinding this action. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional
Administrator. 
Requests for public hearing should be addressed to: Ron Murawski, (WD-17J), U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. 
Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: 
(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing.
(2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in the Regional Administrator's determinations and of
information that the requesting person intends to submit at such hearing. 
(3) The signature of the individual making the request; or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization or other
entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity. 
Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time scheduled for the hearing. Such
notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of Minnesota. A notice will be sent to the person(s) requesting
the hearing as well as to the State of Minnesota. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information
regarding the time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further
information. The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review
of the hearing record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order. 
Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and should the Regional Administrator not elect
to hold a hearing on his own motion, these determinations shall become effective on January 5, 1995. Please bring this
notice to the attention of any persons known by you to have an interest in these determinations. 
All documents related to these determinations are available for inspection between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, at the following offices:

These 65 parties collectively have agreed to pay $3,930,469.96 subject to the contingency that EPA may elect not to
complete the settlement if comments received from the public during this comment period disclose facts or considerations
which indicate the proposed settlement is inappropriate, improper, or inadequate. Money collected from 

de minimis 

parties will be used for past response costs incurred at or in connection with the Site, projected future response
costs to be incurred at or in connection with the Site, and includes a premium to cover the risk that unknown conditions
are discovered or information previously unknown to EPA is received. 

EPA is entering into this agreement under the authority of sections 122(g) and 107 of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes
early settlements with 

de minimis 

parties to allow them to resolve their liabilities at Superfund Sites without incurring substantial transaction
costs. Under this authority, EPA proposes to settle with a number of potentially responsible parties at the Eastern
Diversified Superfund Site, each of whom is responsible for less than four percent of the volume of hazardous substance
disposed of at the Site. EPA issued a draft settlement proposal on June 6, 1994, invited comments and challenges to
the volumetric ranking. On July 29, 1994, EPA issued a final settlement proposal embodied in the Administrative Order
on Consent which included several modifications made in response to comments by 

de minimis 

parties in letters to EPA and during negotiations with the Agency. The proposed settlement reflects and was agreed
upon based on conditions known to parties on July 29, 1994. 

De minimis 

settling parties will be required to pay their volumetric share of the Government's past response costs and the estimated
future response costs at the Eastern Diversified Metals Site excluding any federal claims for natural resource damages
or any State claims. 

The settlement as it is now proposed includes an adjustment to the volumetric share of an eligible 

de minimis 

party; this adjustment was made after the final settlement proposal was sent to all eligible parties on July 29, 1994,
in response to additional evidence provided by this party or discovered by EPA. The party affected is Schiavone-Bonomo,
a/k/a Schiavone-Bros. 

The Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relating to this Agreement for thirty (30) days
from the date of publication of this Notice. A copy of the proposed Administrative Order on Consent may be obtained
from Harry R. Steinmetz (3HW11) in EPA's Region III Office, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107, (telephone:
215/597-1192).

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>


November 25, 1994.


The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW, Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 418-0214. Persons wishing
to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10214
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.




OMB Number:

 3060-0496.




Title:

 ARMIS Operating Data Report. 


Report Number:

 FCC Report 43-08.


Action:

 Extension of a currently approved collection. 


Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit. 


Frequency of Response:

 Annual reporting requirement. 


Estimated Annual Burden:

 50 responses, 160 hours average burden per response, 8,000 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 FCC Report 43-08 is one of several reports comprising the automated reporting system. It is an annual report
which consists of statistical schedules previously contained in FCC Form M which are needed by the Commission to monitor
network growth, usage, and reliability. The information contained in the automated reports provides the necessary
detail to enable this Commission to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities. Automated reportingeatly enhances
the Commission's ability to process and analyze the extensive amounts of data that are needed to administer its rules.
Automating and organizing data as submitted to the Commission facilitates the timely and efficient analyses of revenue
requirements and rate of return, provides an improved basis for auditing and other oversight functions and enhances
the Commission's ability to quantify the effects of policy proposals. This submission is an extension of the current
OMB approval - no changes to requirements.





OMB Number:

 None. 




Title:

 Application for AM Broadcast Station License. 


Form Number:

 FCC Form 302-AM.


Action:

 New collection. 


Respondents:

 Non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 400 responses; 639.88 hours average burden per response; 255,952 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 On 7/16/92, the OMB approved for use a new FCC Form 302-FM (3060-0506) to be used by licensees and permittees
to apply for a new or modified FM license. The FCC Form 302-FM was created through the Total Quality Management
(TQM) process. At the time of approval, the current FCC Form 302 was to be used only for the AM and TV services. At this
time, the Commission is separating the AM and TV services into separate forms. The FCC Form 302-TV will keep the
current OMB control number (3060-0029). The FCC Form 302-AM is being submitted as a new collection. Licensees
and permittees of AM broadcast stations are required to file FCC Form 302-AM to obtain a new or modified station
license, and/or to notify the Commission of certain changes in the licensed facilities of these stations. Additionally,
when changes are made to an AM station which alter the resistance of the antenna system, a license must initiate a determination
of the operating power by the direct method. The results of this are reported to the Commission using the FCC Form 302-AM.
The data is used by FCC staff to confirm that the station has been built to terms specified in the outstanding construction
permit, and to update FCC station files. Data is then extracted from FCC Form 302-AM for inclusion in the subsequent
license to operate the station.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention






Assessment of Knowledge of the Relationship Between Folic Acid Consumption and the Prevention of Spina Bifida and
Anencephaly



Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1995 funds for
a sole-source grant with the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation for the evaluation of the effectiveness of public
health programs to prevent birth defects through an assessment of the current state of knowledge among reproductive-age
women relative to folic acid consumption and the prevention of spina bifida and anencephaly. Approximately $75,000
is available in FY 1995 to fund this project. It is expected that the award will begin on or about February 1, 1995, and
will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period up to three years. Funding estimates are subject to
change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability
of funds. 

The primary purpose of this project is for the March of Dimes to provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge
and behavior among U.S. women of reproductive age relative to folic acid consumption and the prevention of SBA, as
well as other pregnancy-related health issues. 

The assessment will be done by conducting a study of reproductive-age women (ages 18-45). It is envisioned that
results from the study will be used to direct planning for national, State and local SBA prevention programs, and will
provide a baseline from which to later evaluate progress in knowledge and behavior relative to folic acid consumption.


The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Environmental Health, Maternal and Infant Health,
and Surveillance and Data Systems. (To order a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

Authority: 

This program is authorized under Section 301 (42 U.S.C. 241) of the PHS Act.

Smoke-Free Workplace 


The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all
tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of
the American people. 


Eligible Applicant 


Assistance will be provided only to the March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation, White Plains, New York for this project.
No other applications are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to the March of Dimes
Birth Defects Foundation. 
The March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation is the most appropriate and qualified institution to conduct the work under
this grant for the following reasons: 
1. The Genetic Testing and Gene Therapy Survey, completed in 1992, was commissioned, managed, and disseminated by
the March of Dimes. Based on 1,000 telephone interviews with a cross section of adults, the survey has been instrumental
in the development of public policy and educational interventions since its release. The experience gained by the
March of Dimes during the conduct of this national survey makes it the 

only

 national volunteer organization with the level of expertise required to undertake and disseminate an analogous
survey of reproductive-age women's awareness of folic acid and other pregnancy-related issues. 
2. The history of success of the research efforts supported by the March of Dimes is incomparable. The March of Dimes
has played a key role in significant advances in the understanding and prevention of birth defects since Dr. Jonas
Salk, with funding from the March of Dimes, developed the vaccine that led to the conquest of polio in the 1950's. 
3. The March of Dimes is the 

only 

volunteer organization which has as its primary goal the improvement of the health of babies by preventing birth defects
and infant mortality. This organizational goal parallels the CDC's health promotion and prevention goals outlined
in ``Healthy People 2000.'' 
4. During the promotion of preventions such as Polio, Rubella and Rh vaccines, a remarkable climate of trust was established
between the March of Dimes and women of childbearing age. The credibility and name recognition earned by the March
of Dimes through these past efforts greatly increases the likelihood that women will participate in an assessment
of the level of knowledge and behavior regarding the consumption of folic acid.

Disability_Workers' Compensation Offset_Excluding Legal Expenses Incurred by Claimant in Connection With Initial
Award of Workers' Compensation Benefits_Washington 


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Social Security Ruling. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling
94-6. The issue is whether legal expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with an initial workers' compensation
(WC) award in the State of Washington were properly excluded by the Social Security Administration (SSA) from the
WC offset calculation required by section 224 of the Social Security Act. SSA regulations provide that legal expenses
paid or incurred in connection with a WC award or settlement are excluded to the extent such expenses are consonant
with State law. Washington State law appears to permit an attorney who successfully represents a claimant in obtaining
an initial award of WC benefits to charge a fee of up to 30 percent of the benefits awarded. Therefore, such attorney
fees, if paid or incurred by the claimant, may be excluded from the WC offset provisions. Although this Ruling concerns
the State of Washington, it clearly illustrates SSA's longstanding policy in these matters. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). 



Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,
disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based
on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations. 

Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases. 

If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect.

Section 224 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 424a) disability_workers' compensation offset_excluding legal
expenses incurred in connection with initial award of workers' compensation benefits_Washington 



20 CFR 404.408(d) 




Section 224 of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires an offset of title II disability insurance benefits if the
worker is also entitled to workers' compensation (WC) benefits. Social Security Administration (SSA) regulations,
20 CFR 404.408(d), further provide that legal expenses paid or incurred in connection with a WC award or settlement
are excluded from the computation of the WC offset to the extent such expenses are consonant with State law. 

Under the WC laws of the State of Washington, an attorney may charge a reasonable fee of not more than 30 percent of the
increase in the award secured by the attorney's services. An ``increase'' in a Washington WC award can include initial
awards that increase the amount of the WC from zero to the amount awarded. Therefore, such attorney fees, if paid or
incurred by the worker, may be excluded from the WC offset provisions of section 224 of the Act. 

A question has arisen as to whether legal expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with an initial WC award in
the State of Washington were properly excluded from SSA's offset calculation. 

Pursuant to SSA regulations at 20 CFR 404.408(d), legal expenses paid or incurred in connection with a WC settlement
are excluded to the extent such expenses are consonant with State law. This regulation reflects Congress' intent
that, since workers' compensation awards are generally understood to include compensation for legal expenses,
for the purposes of offset, SSA would not include any part of the WC lump sum or benefit which is equal to the amount of
such expenses paid or incurred by the worker. (See S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965).) Under the WC laws of
the State of Washington, an attorney may charge a reasonable fee of not more than 30 percent of the increase in the award
secured by the attorney's services. 

We believe one could reasonably consider the initial award to be an increase in the workers' compensation award from
nothing to the amount awarded. Under such an interpretation, the attorney who successfully represents a claimant
in obtaining an initial award of workers' compensation benefits would be permitted to charge a fee of up to 30 percent
of the benefits awarded. 

There are three reasons supporting this interpretation. 

First, contact with the appropriate Washington State agencies revealed no prohibition on charging attorney fees
in connection with establishing the initial award of benefits. 

Second, there have been a number of cases presented to SSA in which attorney fees were charged to the claimants for services
in obtaining the initial award of WC benefits. We do not believe it would be appropriate to conclude, without compelling
evidence, that these WC attorneys acted in direct contravention of the State's WC laws. 

Third, in 

Regnier 

v.

 Department of Labor and Industries, 

749 P.2d 1299, 1301 (Wash. 1988), Washington's highest court described R.C.W. 51.52.120 as allowing the department
``to determine what is a reasonable fee for a lawyer to charge a claimant for assistance in 

establishing

 an industrial insurance claim,'' a description which would seem clearly to encompass the obtaining of an initial
award of benefits. (Emphasis added.) 

Because Washington State law lacks a clear prohibition on the charging of attorney fees in connection with initial
claims for WC benefits, other than the 30 percent cap, the amounts up to that limit paid by the claimants to their attorneys
for services in the WC claims may be considered to be consonant with State law and thus are excluded for purposes of SSA's
offset pursuant to 20 CFR 404.408(d).

<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Social Security Ruling.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling
94-5p. This Ruling explains the continued longstanding policy that payments made by the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) to an individual who acts as a fiduciary for another are not income or resources to the fiduciary for the
purpose of determining his or her eligibility for or amount of benefits under the supplemental security income (SSI)
program. 



The Commissioner also gives notice that this Ruling supersedes SSR 82-31. SSR 82-31 (C.E. 1981-1985,
p. 777) contained policy in addition to that concerning VA payments to fiduciaries, regarding the treatment of veterans
benefits made to SSI claimants where VA augments the benefits because the recipient has dependents. The policy on
the treatment of VA augmented benefits is no longer applicable because of regulations promulgated on this date.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). 

Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,
disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based
on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations. 

Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases. 

If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect.

Policy Interpretation Ruling 


Title XVI: SSI Treatment of Department of Veterans 
Affairs Payments to Fiduciaries 



This Ruling supersedes Program Policy Statement (PPS) No. 65 (Social Security Ruling (SSR) 82-31, Title XVI:
SSI Treatment of Veterans Administration Payments to SSI Eligibles/Fiduciaries, Cumulative Edition 1981-1985,
p. 777). 

Purpose: To state supplemental security income (SSI) policy with respect to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
payments made to fiduciaries. 

Citations (Authority): Section 1612(a)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act; 20 CFR 416.1102 and 416.1121, 38 U.S.C.
Veterans Benefits. 

Pertinent History: Social Security Administration (SSA) policy provides that VA disability compensation or pension
benefit received by an eligible individual is unearned income to that individual (and is a resource if retained into
the month following that of receipt). Income and resources are used in determining SSI eligibility. Income is used
in determining the amount of SSI benefits payable. 

Benefits which are paid to an individual as a fiduciary (a party who receives and manages benefits on behalf of another)
are not available for the fiduciary's own use and, therefore, are not counted as unearned income of the fiduciary in
the month of receipt or as a resource thereafter for the purpose of determining the fiduciary's eligibility for or
amount of SSI benefits. 

There are situations where a person may be receiving VA benefits as a beneficiary and also as a fiduciary for another.
For example: A World War II disabled veteran in receipt of his own VA compensation may also be in receipt of VA benefits
in a separate check as a fiduciary on behalf of his incompetent Vietnam veteran son; a widow in receipt of her own VA pension
may also be in receipt of VA benefits in a separate check as a fiduciary on behalf of her grandchild; or the child of a deceased
veteran may be in receipt of dependents' educational assistance, and also in receipt of dependency and indemnity
compensation as a fiduciary on behalf of his or her brother or sister. 

Policy Statement: Payments made by the VA to an individual in his or her capacity as a fiduciary on behalf of another
are not income or resources to the fiduciary for the purpose of determining the fiduciary's eligibility for or amount
of benefits under the SSI program. For SSI purposes, such VA payments are income or resources of the individual for
whom the VA payments are made. 
Effective Date: This is longstanding SSA policy which continues to apply to VA payments to fiduciaries. 

Documentation: Appointment of a fiduciary and the amounts being paid must be documented. When a person is receiving
payment as a fiduciary, the check legend will show the name of the fiduciary followed by a phrase which indicates the
fiduciary's relationship. The most common phrases are ``wife of,'' ``guardian of,'' and ``custodian of the child(ren)
of.'' Other documentation may include a VA award letter which shows the same name and phraseology cited above or a copy
of VA Form 27-4703, Fiduciary Agreement. 

Cross-References: Program Operations Manual System, Part 05, sections SI 00810.120, and SI 00830.300-00830.320.

ACTION: 

Notice of redelegation and designation of authority, and of supersedure of authority.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In this notice, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates authority to three
positions within the Single Family Mortgage Division_the Assistant General Counsel, the Chief Attorney for the
Loan Management and Claims Section, and the Chief Attorney for the Loan Origination Section. In addition, the Assistant
Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates authority to Matthew C. Forman, Evelyn M. Wrin,
and Jeffrey H. Swartzbaugh. The authority redelegated to each of the named positions and individuals is the authority
to convey and execute certain single family mortgage documents relating to real or personal property or any interest
therein acquired pursuant to the National Housing Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 204(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(g)) empowers the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
to delegate his or her authority to convey and to execute deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions
of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein acquired
by the Secretary pursuant to the National Housing Act. These responsibilities were delegated to the Assistant Secretary
for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, with authority to redelegate, on June 18, 1976 at 41 FR 24755.


In the past, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner has exercised his authority to redelegate
these responsibilities. However, the most recent redelegation designates five individuals who are no longer available
to carry out these duties. Therefore, it is necessary to supersede that redelegation, and to redelegate authority
to new positions and individuals. In this redelegation and designation, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal
Housing Commissioner lists the positions and individuals authorized to convey and execute certain deeds and other
documents relating to real or personal property or any interest therein acquired pursuant to the National Housing
Act.
Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates as follows:


Section A. Authority Redelegated


The authority to convey and to execute deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages,
and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein acquired by the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to the National Housing Act is redelegated to the following positions and
individuals, each of whom is hereby designated Assistant Federal Housing Commissioner:
1. The Assistant General Counsel for the Single Family Mortgage Division;
2. The Chief Attorney for the Loan Management and Claims Section, Single Family Mortgage Division;
3. The Chief Attorney for the Loan Origination Section, Single Family Mortgage Division; and
4. Matthew C. Forman, Evelyn M. Wrin, and Jeffrey H. Swartzbaugh, each of whom is an attorney in the Office of the General
Counsel.


Section B. Authority Superseded


This Redelegation and Designation of Authority supersedes the Redelegation of Authority at 50 FR 20859, dated May
20, 1985.





Authority:

 Sec. 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (42 U.S.C. 3535(d); sec. 204(g) of the National Housing
Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(g)); 36 FR 5005 (1971); 41 FR 24755 (1976).

AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of redelegation of authority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In this notice, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates to the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs, who retains this authority and redelegates to the Director, Office
of Insured Multifamily Housing Development, the authority to endorse for mortgage insurance Secretary-held multifamily
mortgage loans. This responsibility is being redelegated to assist in the management of the workload.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In recent years, the volume of FHA-insured multifamily mortgages that have reverted to FHA, primarily through defaults
has grown substantially. Servicing these assigned multifamily mortgages has consumed a disproportionately large
share of FHA staff time and resources. This, in turn, has diminished FHA's capacity to monitor the privately-held
multifamily mortgages it insures, which thereby increases the potential for further defaults and losses. 




HUD has determined to sell the multifamily mortgages it now owns so that the Agency can focus more of its asset management
staff and resources toward proactive oversight of the Agency's insured mortgage portfolio. To assist in carrying
out the responsibilities attendant to selling Secretary-held multifamily mortgages, pursuant to this delegation
and redelegation, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-FHA Commissioner is redelegating authority to endorse for
mortgage insurance Secretary-held multifamily mortgage loan documents. This redelegation will assist the Agency
in managing its workload generated through the sale of multifamily mortgages.

Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates as follows:



Section A. Authority Redelegated



The Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates to the Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Multifamily Housing Programs, who retains this authority and redelegates to the Director, Office of Insurance
Multifamily Housing Development, the power and authority to endorse, or under his or her direction to direct the endorsement
of documents necessary to effectuate mortgage insurance for Secretary-held multifamily mortgages.



Section B. Authority to Further Redelegate



The authority redelegated pursuant to Section A., above, may be further redelegated.







Authority:

 Sec. 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (42 U.S.C. 3535(d).




Dated: November 22, 1994.

Notice of Revocation and Redelegation of Authority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice revokes the Redelegation of Authority published within the 

Federal Register

 Notice of Revocation and Redelegation of Authority (59 FR 18282), published April 15, 1994; this notice revokes all
powers and authorities currently redelegated by the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner,

Nothing in this revocation and redelegation of authority affects the power and authority previously redelegated
to the Directors of the HUD-FHA Debt Management Centers in Albany, NY, Seattle, WA, and Chicago, IL, including
the redelegation of authority published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 7, 1994 at 59 FR 34857 (which superseded in its entirely the redelegation of authority signed on October 25,
1991 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 1, 1991 at 56 FR 56236).

This notice then redelegates to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing, the Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Multifamily Housing, and to housing officials in Field Offices as appropriate and specified below, those powers
and authorities necessary to carry out Office of Housing_Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs. Any revocation
or modification of this redelegation of authority, other than further redelegations as provided for in this notice,
will be published in the 

Federal Register.

 Some powers and authorities still rest with the Assistant Secretary-Federal Housing Commissioner, or other
Headquarters officials. Only program powers and authorities listed in this delegation are redelegated. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In November of 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance
and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy
by empowering HUD's employees to more effectively serve these customers. In implementing these objectives, the
Secretary determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational
levels full authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program
officials at Headquarters.



On April 15, 1994, the Department published a Notice revoking and redelegating program authority to meet the objectives
of the reorganization for the Office of Housing (59 FR 18282). That notice indicated that HUD would be issuing further
guidance to field staff concerning their specific functions and responsibilities under the programs. This document
contains that guidance, and revokes the redelegation contained within the April 15 notice. 

Under the reorganization, field offices are categorized by Housing as AA (Super A), A, B, C+, C, and D offices. Each
of the field offices are listed below by these categories. The geographic areas that constitute the specific jurisdictions
of each field office will be addressed in a notice to be published and distributed separately from this delegation.
The program areas of the Office of Housing_FHA include single family housing programs, multifamily housing programs,
and nursing home and hospital mortgage insurance programs. This notice lists the programs in each of these program
areas (see Part II below headed PROGRAMS) and the program functions (see Part III below headed FUNCTIONS) which are
being redelegated. Depending on the category of the field office and other factors, there are slight variations,
as further specified below, as to which program area is being handled in a particular field office and as to which HUD
officials are being redelegated the authority to carry out the program functions.

Notice of Renewal of the Public Advisory Group Charter; Exxon Valdez Oil Spill



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary.



</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is published in accordance with 41 CFR Part 101-6, section 101-6.1015(a), Committee establishment,
reestablishment, or renewal.



Following the recommendation and approval of the EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council, the Secretary of the Interior
hereby renews the EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Public Advisory Group Charter to continue for two years, to October 22, 1996.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





On March 24, 1989, the T/V EXXON VALDEZ ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound in Alaska spilling approximately
11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil. Oil moved into the Gulf of Alaska, along the Kenai coast to Kodiak Island
and the Alaska Peninsula_some 600 miles from Bligh Reef. Massive clean-up and containment efforts were initiated
and continued to 1992. On October 8, 1991, an agreement was approved by the United States District Court for the District
of Alaska that settled claims of the United States and the State of Alaska against the Exxon Corporation and the Exxon
Shipping Company for various criminal and civil violations. Under the civil settlement, Exxon companies agreed
to pay to the governments $900 million over a period of 10 years.

The EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council was established to manage the funds obtained from the civil settlement
of the EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill. The Trustee Council is composed of three State of Alaska trustees (Attorney General;
Commissioner, Department of Environmental Conservation; and Commissioner, Department of Fish and Game) and three
Federal representatives appointed by the Federal Trustees (Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture; the Administrator
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior).

The Public Advisory Group was created by Paragraph V.A.4 of the Memorandum of Agreement and Consent Decree entered
into by the United States of America and the State of Alaska on August 27, 1991, and approved by the United States District
Court for the District of Alaska in settlement of 

United States of America

 v. 

State of Alaska,

 Civil Action No. A91-081 CV. The Public Advisory Group was chartered by the Secretary of the Interior on October
23, 1992, and functions solely as an advisory body, and in compliance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee
Act (5 U.S.C. App. (1988)).

The Public Advisory Group was established to advise the Trustee Council, and began functioning in October 1992. The
Public Advisory Group consists of 17 members representing the following principal interests: Sport hunting and
fishing, environmental, public-at-large (5), recreation users, local government, science/academic, conservation,
subsistence, commercial fishing, aquaculture, commercial tourism, forest products, and Native landowners. Members
were appointed to serve a two-year term.

To carry out its advisory role, the Public Advisory Group makes recommendations to, and advises, the Trustee Council
in Alaska on the following matters:

All decisions related to injury assessment, restoration activities, or other use of natural resource damage recovery
monies obtained by the governments, including all decisions regarding:

a. Planning, evaluation and allocation of available funds;

b. Planning, evaluation and conduct of injury assessment; and

c. Planning, evaluation and conduct of restoration activities.

Trustee Council intentions regarding the importance of obtaining a diversity of viewpoints are stated in the Public
Advisory Group Background and Guidelines (March 1993, updated June 1994): ``The Trustee Council intends that the
Public Advisory Group be established as an important component of the Council's public involvement process.'' The
Council continues, stating their desire that ``* * * a wide spectrum of views and interest are available
for the Council to consider as it evaluates, develops, and implements restoration activities. It is the Council's
intent that the diversity of interests and views held by the Public Advisory Group members contribute to wide ranging
discussions that will be of benefit to the Trustee Council.''

In order to ensure that a broad range of public viewpoints continues to be available to the Trustee Council, and in keeping
with the settlement agreement, the continuation of the Public Advisory Group for another two-year period is recommended.



Certification



I hereby certify that the renewal of the Charter of the Public Advisory Group, an advisory committee to make recommendations
to and advise the EXXON VALDEZ Oil Spill Trustee Council in Alaska, is necessary and in the public interest in connection
with the performance of duties mandated by the settlement of 

United States

 v. 

State of Alaska

, No. A91-081 CV, and is in accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980, as amended and supplemented.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice is to advise the public that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing to do a plan amendment for the
Virgin River Management Framework Plan (MFP) located in Washington County, Utah. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The BLM is proposing to amend the Virgin River MFP which included lands in Washington County, Utah. The proposed amendment
would be to make certain public land available for disposal pursuant to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, as
amended (43 U.S.C. 869 et seq.), for a local government entity in Washington County for the purpose of constructing
wastewater-treatment lagoons. The city of Springdale has requested expansion of existing sewer lagoons which service
Zion National Park, Springdale, and Rockville. The present lagoons no longer meet demand, and it is anticipated that
during the upcoming spring tourist season, the lagoons will far exceed current capacity. A conformance review was
conducted; and, while the request was found not consistent with the Virgin River MFP, the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) believes that it has merit and therefore proposes to conduct an environmental assessment to determine environmental
consequences and impacts on the existing planning decisions and the proposed amendment. 


The public land being considered for disposal, comprising 73.25 acres, is described as follows: 


Salt Lake Meridian, Utah


T. 42 South, R. 11 West, 


Section 4, lots 17, 18 and 20; 
Section 5, lots 9 and 10 the SE1/4NE1/4SW1/4NE1/4, E1/2SE1/4SW1/4NE1/4, and the NE1/4NE1/4NW1/4SE1/4.

Expiration of Deferred Enforced Departure for Nationals of El Salvador



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of the expiration of deferred enforced departure (DED) for nationals of EL Salvador.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (``the Service'' or ``INS'') will allow the expiration on December 31,
1994, of the deferred enforced departure (DED) previously granted to certain nationals of El Salvador. After consultation
with appropriate agencies of the Government and consideration of the totality of the impact of the expiration of DED
for Salvadorans, it has been concluded that the political and human rights situation inside El Salvador has improved
significantly and can no longer serve as a basis for the continuation of DED.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Background



Section 303 of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-649, dated November 29, 1990, designated El Salvador
for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for a period of eighteen (18) months beginning January 1, 1991, and ending June
30, 1992. Eligible nationals of El Salvador who registered under this special TPS program were required to register
by October 31, 1991, and to reregister as required in order to extend TPS benefits.

Temporary Protected Status ended on June 30, 1992. However, on June 26, 1992, the Commissioner of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service announced in the Federal Register at 57 FR 28700 that the deportation of eligible nationals
of El Salvador who had registered for TPS would not be enforced before June 30, 1993. On June 8, 1993, the Service announced
in the Federal Register at 58 FR 32157 a further extension until December 31, 1994, of deferred enforced departure
(DED) for eligible Salvadorans. The two announcements were made at the direction of former President Bush and President
Clinton respectively. Both these grants of DED were based on the serious negative effects that a large repatriation
would have had on the then evolving situation in El Salvador.


After consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government and consideration of the totality of the impact of
the expiration of DED for Salvadorans, it has been concluded that the political and human rights situation inside
El Salvador has improved significantly and can no longer serve as a basis for the continuation of DED.


Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization



In order to ensure an opportunity for Salvadoran beneficiaries of DED to apply for an employment authorization document
(EAD), the Service is granting an automatic extension until September 30, 1995, of the validity of any EAD which expires
on December 31, 1994, and was previously issued to a DED Salvadoran pursuant to 8 CFR 274a.12(a)(11). Affected Salvadorans
should apply for their new EADs at least 3 months before the expiration of the automatic extension (that is, no later
than June 30, 1995) in order to ensure continuous employment authorization.


Employers of DED Salvadorans



Employers of DED Salvadorans whose employment authorization is automatically extended may not refuse to accept,
for purposes of verifying or reverifying employment eligibility until September 30, 1995, an employment authorization
document (EAD), Form I-688B, bearing an expiration date of December 31, 1994, (or extension sticker punched
for December 1994) and containing a notation ``274a.12(a)(11)'' or ``274a.12(a)(12)'' on the face of the document
under ``Provision of Law.'' Employers are reminded that this action does not affect the right of a worker to present
any other legally acceptable document as proof of work authorization.


Impact of Decision


The Service believes that the decision to end DED will have a delayed and gradual impact on members of the Salvadoran
community in the United States who currently hold DED status. Under the settlement agreement reached in 

American Baptist Churches

 v. 

Thornburgh,

 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (``

ABC

'') affected Salvadorans will be able to maintain legal employment authorization pending a review of their asylum
applications. Those 

ABC

 class members who have not filed asylum applications will have an opportunity to do so. In addition to the rights afforded
under the 

ABC

 agreement, many Salvadorans have adjusted and will continue to adjust status to lawful permanent residence on the
basis of family relationships and other grounds.
All Salvadorans who initially registered for TPS, regardless of whether they later registered for DED, are 

ABC

 class members. As 

ABC

 class members, they are entitled to certain rights under the agreement. On or about March 31, 1995, the Service will
send class members a notice advising that they must submit an initial asylum application (Form I-589) with the
INS appropriate service center within 90 days, if they have not filed an asylum application previously. A previously
filed asylum application may be supplemented. Class members also have the option of filing a new asylum application
even if they had previously filed for asylum. Class members may supplement a previously filed or newly filed asylum
application until the date of the decision by the asylum officer.

Obtaining Further Employment Authorization




With Salvadoran DED ending, 

ABC

 class members may obtain further employment authorization based on a ``pending'' asylum application. Special procedures
apply to class members who seek work authorization under the agreement. Class members seeking employment authorization
must identify themselves as 

ABC

 class members. They must have an asylum application on file or must file a completed asylum application (Form I-589)
with Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Eligible class members who apply for employment
authorization under this agreement are not subject to the ``non-frivolous'' standard required under 8 CFR 208.7(a).
Form I-765, with or without an asylum application as appropriate, must be filed directly with the service center
having jurisdiction over the applicant's place of residence for asylum-related applications. However, if the original
asylum application was filed with an immigration judge in exclusion or deportation proceedings, applications for
employment authorization and asylum should be filed at the appropriate local INS office until directed otherwise.

Class members generally must pay the employment authorization application fee, currently seventy dollars ($70).
However, when an 

initial

 application for employment authorization is filed based on an asylum application which is found to satisfy the non-frivolous
test, such an initial employment authorization application can be filed and approved without payment of the filing
fee under the general asylum regulations now in effect. Also, eligible class members who can demonstrate that they
fall within the poverty guidelines at 45 CFR 1060.2 will not be required to pay the fee.

In summary, new asylum applications are 

required

 only from those who have 

never

 filed for asylum before. All other class members may choose to rely on any asylum application filed previously. Class
members may supplement a previously filed or newly filed asylum officer. Applicants who must have continuous documentation
of employment authorization should apply as early as possible with the appropriate service center or local office.
It is not necessary to wait until the planned 

ABC

 notices are sent or until the class member's individual 

ABC

 notice is received. Such an application for employment authorization must be based on an asylum application.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No
Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of 10 CFR part 50. Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.1.(a), Type A Tests, issued to Facility Operating License No. DPR-63,
the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (the licensee) for operation of the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No.
1, located in Oswego, New York.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of the Proposed Action



This Environmental Assessment has been prepared to address potential environmental issues related to the licensee's
application of August 26, 1994. The proposed action would exempt the licensee from the requirement of 10 CFR part 50,
Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.1.(a), to the extent that a one-time schedular extension would permit the second 10-year
period for performance of the third Type A test be extended to correspond with the end of the current inservice inspection
interval (ISI).



The Need for the Proposed Action



During the first 10-year service period (1974-1984) Type A tests were conducted as required by 10 CFR part 50
Appendix J. Due to the lengthy outage for the replacement of reactor recirculation piping, the first ISI 10-year interval
was extended to June 1986. In addition, an extended refueling outage (January 1987 to July 1990), caused the second
10-year ISI interval to be extended to December 1998. These actions decoupled the Type A test schedule from the ISI
schedule.

Unlike Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME Code), Appendix
J of 10 CFR part 50 does not contain any provisions for adjusting the 10-year service period for extended outages. Two
Type A tests have already been performed (May 1990 and April 1993) during the current second 10-year service period.
The current 10-year service period ends December 1994. The next refueling outage (RFO13) is currently scheduled
for February 1995. Performing the Type A test during the 1995 refueling outage would result in only 22 months of operation
since the last Type A test. Appendix J could be interpreted to require another Type A test during the last outage in the
ISI interval. NMPC has proposed to extend the second 10-year service period to correspond with the end of the current
ISI interval. Due to Nine Mile Point Unit 1's 24-month operating cycle, the final refueling outage of the current ISI
interval is scheduled for 1997 (RFO14). 

Granting the proposed Exemption would result in an interval of approximately 46 months between successive Type A
tests. Such an interval would be consistent with the NRC staff's current position (as reflected in the NRC's Improved
Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-1433) of requiring Type A tests to be performed every 40 

#

 10 months. It would also bring the Appendix J Type A test schedule back into alignment with the 10-year ISI schedule.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed one-time exemption would not increase the probability or consequences of accidents previously analyzed
and the proposed one-time exemption would not affect facility radiation levels or facility radiological effluents.
The licensee has analyzed the results of previous Type A tests performed at the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit
No. 1, and has provided the methodology used in extrapolating the previous Type A test data to the proposed one-time
increase in the surveillance interval. The licensee has provided a sound basis for concluding that the proposed one-time
extension of the Type A test interval would maintain the containment leakage rates within acceptable limits while
bringing the Type A test schedule back into alignment with the 10-year ISI schedule. Accordingly, the Commission
has concluded that the one-time extension does not result in a significant increase in the amounts of any effluents
that may be released nor does it result in a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation
exposure. Therefore, there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed
exemption.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves Type A testing on the containment.
They do not affect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission
concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request for exemption. Such action would not reduce the environmental impacts of plant
operations.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
Related to the Operation of Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1,'' dated January 1974.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the New York State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed exemption.

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's letter dated August 26, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains,
New York 10610.

<DOCTITLE>Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations for Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-44 and DPR-56, issued to Philadelphia Electric
Company (the licensee), for operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Units 2 and 3, located in York
County, Pennsylvania.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system of site access control such that
photograph identification badges can be taken offsite.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated September 8, 1994 as supplemented by letter
dated October 28, 1994, for exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection
of licensed activities in nuclear power plant reactors against radiological sabotage.''



The Need for the Proposed Action



Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection
system and security organization. 

Paragraph (1) of 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies that ``licensee shall control all points of
personnel and vehicle access into a protected area * * *'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that
``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected
areas without escort.'' It also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be
authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance
into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected 

area * * * ''.



Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of the PBAPS is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination
badge and keycard. (Hereafter, these are referred to as badges). The security officers at the entrance station use
the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees
and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at the entrance/exit location
and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at the entrance/exit location. In accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plants'
physical security plans, neither licensee employees nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite.

The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at the entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badges with them when departing the site.

An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors to take their badges offsite instead of returning
them when exiting the site.

The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action. Under the proposed system, each individual who
is authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand
geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control system. When an individual enters the badge into
the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system would record the individual's hand image.
The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared with the previously stored template to verify
authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their
badge with them when they depart the site.



Based on a Sandia repot entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91_0276
UC_906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on its experience with the current photo-identification system,
the licensee stated that the false acceptance rate of the proposed hand geometry system is comparable to that of the
current system. The licensee stated that the use of the badges with hand geometry system would increase the overall
level of access control. Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area,
the proposed system would provide for a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual,
as a result of taking the badge offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas. The licensee
will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent
to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plan for PBAPS will be revised to include implementation
and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees and contractors to take their
badges offsite.

<PARENT> FR941206-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The access process will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. A numbered picture badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escorts.
Badges will continue to de displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluent that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action involves features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluent and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not change any current environmental impacts. The environmental
impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are similar.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement
related to the operation of Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3,'' dated April 1973.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the State of Pennsylvania regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letters dated September 8, 1994 and October
28, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building,

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to the report from the National Performance Review (NPR), the Office of Federal Procurement Policy has
been working with various senior level individuals in the Executive Branch to implement the recommendations relating
to acquisition regulatory reform. Thus far our primary focus has been the governmentwide regulation, the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR). We are now seeking comments and suggestions related to agency supplementation from
the public.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the NPR which required simplification of the procurement
process through regulatory reform. Up to this point, the focus of this reform effort has been the governmentwide regulation,
the FAR. In the course of developing a plan for regulatory reform of the FAR, we have learned that there is almost a consensus
that a problem exists with agency supplementation. In many cases the supplementation is not only that issued by procurement
offices but also directives issued by other offices within agencies and departments which have an impact on procurement.






Consequently, we are now seeking from the public comments and suggestions related to agency supplementation. Also,
providing examples will make comments far more useful. In particular, we would like to know the following: 

1. Do you believe that a problem exists with agency supplementation? If so, please describe specifically what you
believe the problems are that the supplements create. Please provide examples where possible.

2. Is the problem with other directives within the agency or department which impact procurement as well as the FAR
supplement? Please give examples.

3. If you have answered question 1 and/or 2 in the affirmative, do these problems exist in both Defense and the civilian
agencies?

4. What recommendations would you offer to resolve any problems you have described? Please be specific and give examples
where possible.

The adoption of Rule 11Ac1-3 requires enhanced disclosure of payment for order flow practices on customer confirmations,
and account statements, as well as opening new accounts.

The proposed amendments to Rule 11Ac1-3 require broker-dealers receiving payment for order flow to provide
customers additional information regarding the value of the compensation received. It is anticipated that approximately
2,206 broker-dealers will spend a total of 46,381 burden hours complying with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements
of the proposed amendment to Rule 11Ac1-3.

The amendments to Rule 15c2-12 make it unlawful for a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer to act as
an underwriter of an issue of municipal securities unless the issuer or its designated agent has undertaken in a written
agreement or contract for the benefit of the holders of such municipal securities to provide certain information
to information repositories, and prohibits brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers from recommending
transactions in municipal securities unless they have procedures in place that provide reasonable assurance that
they will receive promptly any notices of material events with respect to those securities. It is anticipated that
approximately 12,003 brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, issuers of municipal securities, and nationally
recognized municipal securities information repositories or state information depositories will spend a total
of 95,860 hours complying with Rule 15c2-12 annually.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Relating to Amendments to the NASD's Proposed NPROVE System for Price Improvement and Execution of Small Orders</DOCTITLE>



November 29, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on November 21, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''
or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') an amendment
to a proposed rule change previously published for comment.
 The amendment is described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission
is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change, as amended, from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The NASD is amending its proposed rules governing the operation of The Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View and Execution
System (``NPROVE''), a new system developed by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (Nasdaq) for the execution of small-sized
customer orders that provides individual investors enhanced limit order protection and important price improvement
opportunities through an enhanced automated system. Specifically, the NASD is proposing a variety of amendments
to NPROVE designed to: (1) Enhance the operational efficiency of the system; (2) increase the breadth of exposure
of limit orders entered into the system priced between the inside bid or offer, which increased limit order exposure
will facilitate greater opportunities for order interaction within the inside market on Nasdaq; (3) further improve
the opportunities for price improvement available through NPROVE; (4) expand the types of orders (

i.e.

, short sales) that may be entered into NPROVE, and, thereby, afford a broader spectrum of retail orders in Nasdaq an
opportunity to take advantage of NPROVE's price improvement and limit order protection features; and (5) facilitate
the efforts of NASD members to provide their customers with the same quality of order execution that they would have
received had their orders been entered into NPROVE. Following is the text of the proposed rule change. (Additions
are italicized; deletions are bracketed.)



Rules of Operation and Procedures for the NPROVE System


(1) Definitions



a.-g. No change.

h. The term ``preferenced order'' shall mean an order entered into NPROVE and directed to a particular market maker


or an order entered by a market maker that is self-preferenced.

 Each market maker has the ability to select order entry firms from which it will accept preferenced orders.



(2)-(3) No Change

(4) Participant Obligations in N

PROVE



a. Market Makers

1. No change.

2. Participation as an NPROVE market maker obligates the firm, upon presentation of [preferenced or] a designated

, unpreferenced 

market order or marketable limit

 order[s] 

(as that term is defined in subsection (5)c. below)

 through the service, to execute [those] 

such

 order[s]; provided, however, that for 

a designated,

 unpreferenced order[s], the NPROVE market maker shall have an opportunity,

a

 consistent with Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act to decline the order[; if no action is taken the order
will be automatically executed against the market maker]. The market maker may decline to execute the 

designated,

 unpreferenced NPROVE order only if the market maker has executed an order (or is in the process of executing an order)
in the security and has updated its quotation (or is in the process of updating its quotation) for the security. 

An N



PROVE market maker that receives an undesignated, unpreferenced market order or marketable limit order (as that
term is defined in subsection (5)c. below) through N



PROVE also may decline such order consistent with Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act. If a market maker rejects
a designated, unpreferenced N



PROVE order and no other market maker accepts the order within the 15-second period, upon expiration of the 15-second
period, the system will automatically execute the order against the market maker next in rotation who received the
order on an undesignated basis that has not rejected the order. 

[If a market maker rejects the NPROVE order, it will be displayed to all other market makers at the inside quotation
simultaneously and executed against the market maker that accepts the order, or if no market maker accepts the order,
the next market maker in rotation that has not rejected the order will receive the execution.] If all market makers
reject 

an unpreferenced

 [the] order because they have had an execution (or are in the process of effecting a trade) and have updated their quotations
(or are in the process of updating their quotations), the order will be 

automatically executed against the market maker next in rotation at the new inside quotation

. [delivered to the first market maker at the new inside quote on Nasdaq and that market maker will not be able to reject
that order].













With the exception of those instances where a market order or marketable limit order has matched with a limit order
and is processed according to the procedures contained in subsection (5)c. below, participation as an N



PROVE market maker obligates the firm, upon presentation of a preferenced market order or marketable limit order
through the service, to automatically execute such order at the inside bid or offer displayed by Nasdaq when the order
is processed through N



PROVE

. NPROVE market makers 

are 

[will also] not [be] permitted to reject orders preferenced to the firm pursuant to a preferencing arrangement acknowledged
by the market maker.

The system will transmit to the market maker on the Nasdaq Workstation screen and printer, if requested, or through
a computer interface, as applicable, an execution report generated following each execution.









3. 

Notwithstanding subsection (5)c. below, a

[A]n NPROVE market maker that improves the best bid or offer in Nasdaq is eligible to receive all unpreferenced orders
entered into NPROVE 

on an exclusive basis

 (for a specific period of time or number of executions as established by the NASD

b

) so long as the market maker manually accepts the orders prior to automatic execution of the orders.





4.-6. No change.

7. 

Aside from market makers entering self-preferenced orders into N



PROVE, f

[F]or each security in which a market maker is registered, the market maker may not enter orders on an agency basis into
NPROVE, unless a locked or crossed market exists for that security. This prohibition against use of NPROVE does not
obviate the market maker's duty to give its agency orders best execution in the prevailing market, according to the
Board of Governor's Interpretation on Executions of Retail Transactions, Article III, Section 1 of the NASD Rules
of Fair Practice.

8. No change.
9. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (8) above, (i) a market maker that obtains an excused withdrawal
pursuant to Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws prior to withdrawing from NPROVE may reenter NPROVE according to
the conditions of its withdrawal; and (ii) a market maker that fails to maintain a clearing arrangement with a registered
clearing agency or with a member of such an agency, and is thereby withdrawn from participation in ACT and NPROVE for
Nasdaq [National Market] securities, may reenter NPROVE after a clearing arrangement has been reestablished and
the market maker has complied with ACT participant requirements. Provided however, that if the Association finds
that the ACT market maker's failure to maintain a clearing arrangement is voluntary, the withdrawal of quotations
will be considered voluntary and unexcused pursuant to Schedule D and these rules.

10. No change.

b. NPROVE Order Entry Firms

1.-5. No change.
[6. No short sales may be entered into NPROVE.]



(5) Execution of NPROVE Orders



a. Orders in Nasdaq equity securities entered into NPROVE may be preferenced or unpreferenced. 

Preferenced market orders will be automatically executed against the preferenced market maker pursuant to subsection
(4)a.2. above. Preferenced limit orders to buy (sell) will not be treated as preferenced orders unless the limit order
price is at or above (below) the inside offer (bid), in which case the orders will be automatically executed against
the preferenced market maker pursuant to subsection (4)a.2. above. Preferenced odd-lot orders (orders of less than
100 shares) that are market orders or marketable limit orders also will be automatically executed against the preferenced
market maker. 

[Preferenced orders will be delivered to the designated market maker. Except as provided in subparagraph (c) below,
unpreferenced orders will be delivered to market makers at the current inside bid or offer in rotation.]



Unpreferenced market orders and limit orders will be processed according to the procedures established in subsections
(5)b. and c. below. Unpreferenced o

[O]dd-lot orders [(orders of less than 100 shares)] 

that are market orders or marketable limit orders

 will be automatically executed in NPROVE 

against the market maker next in rotation at the inside market

 and execution reports will be delivered to the order entry firm and the market maker.

b. Limit orders may be entered into NPROVE. A limit order priced at the Nasdaq inside market 

(e.g., the bid side for a sell order)

 when the order is delivered to an NPROVE market maker will be handled as a market order. Limit orders priced 

away from

 [outside] the Nasdaq inside 

bid or offer (as the case may be)

 [market] will be stored in the NPROVE limit order file, and when the inside market equals or betters the limit price,
the order will be handled as a market order. Limit orders priced 

within

 [better than] the inside market upon entry 

or thereafter

 will establish the 

minimum

 price at which subsequent incoming market orders on the other side of market 

will

 [may] be priced and executed (e.g., a sell order priced between the best bid and offer would improve the price of an incoming
buy order). 

All Nasdaq Level 2 and 3 subscribers

 [Market makers] will receive notification 

on their quote retrieval screens

 of the existence of a limit order priced better than the inside market 

along with an indication of which side of the market it is on.

 [on their quote retrieval screens,] 

regardless of whether the limit order is preferenced or unpreferenced

 [; provided, however, that notification of the existence of a preferenced limit order will only be delivered to the
designated market maker]. 

A separate dissemination of N



PROVE limit orders priced between than the inside market consisting of the price of the highest priced limit order
to buy and the price of the lowest priced limit order to sell and the aggregate size of all orders at such prices also will
be made available to securities information processors.

 A limit order priced better than the inside market on Nasdaq shall be automatically executed against a subsequent
limit order on the opposite side of the market at a price equal or superior to the limit price of the initial limit order
(a sell (buy) limit order priced at or below (above) a limit order to buy (sell)), up to the size of the initial limit order
or the subsequent limit order, whichever is smaller, and without the participation of a market maker.

c. Market orders may be entered into NPROVE. 

For preferenced market orders, if there is no limit order residing in N



PROVE priced between the inside market on the opposite side of the market from the market order, the order will be automatically
executed against the preferenced market maker at the inside bid or offer (buy orders will be executed at the best offer
and sell orders at the best bid) displayed in Nasdaq when the order becomes subject to N



PROVE's order execution methodology. For unpreferenced market orders, except as provided in subsection (4)a.3.
above, if there is no limit order residing in N



PROVE priced between the inside market on the opposite side of the market from the market order, the order will be broadcast
to all N



PROVE market makers at the applicable inside market (i.e., market makers at the inside bid will receive market orders
to sell and market makers at the inside offer will receive market orders to buy) displayed in Nasdaq when the order becomes
subject to N



PROVE's order execution methodology for acceptance within 15 seconds, with the market maker next in rotation for
an N



PROVE execution receiving an indicator that the system will execute the order against him should be fail to reject
the order or if no other market maker accepts the order (for purposes of these rules, market orders with such notifications
appended to them are referred to as ``designated, unpreferenced orders'' and orders without such a notification
are referred to as ``undesignated, unpreferenced orders''). If a market maker rejects a designated, unpreferenced
N



PROVE order and no other market maker accepts the order within the 15-second period, upon expiration of the 15-second
period, the system will automatically execute the order against the market maker next in rotation who received the
order on an undesignated basis that has not rejected the order. If all market makers decline the order consistent with
Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act, the order will be automatically executed against the market maker next
in rotation at the new inside quotation.

 [A market order will be delivered to a market maker for execution at the current inside market (buy orders will be executed
at the best offer and sell orders at the best bid)].

If a limit order has previously been entered into NPROVE at a price superior to the best bid or offer, the incoming market
order will be repriced to 

a price equal to the limit order price plus 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to buy or the limit order price
minus a 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to sell

 [match the price of the limit order] and will be displayed for 15 seconds to all market makers whose current quotation
equals the applicable inside quote[, in the case of an unpreferenced market maker in the case of a preferenced order].
If no market maker accepts the incoming market order within the 15-second period, the market order will be automatically
executed against the limit order 

at the limit order price. In addition, if adding (subtracting) 1/16th of a point to the price of a limit order to buy (sell)
would cause the acceptance price of the market order to sell (buy) to be at or above (below) the current inside offer
(bid), then the market order and the limit order will be automatically executed against each other at the limit order
price without the participation of a market maker.

 [All market orders entered into NPROVE will be executed in compliance with market maker obligations as established
in subsection (4).]

(6)-(9) No Change


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the amendment
to the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements
may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A),
(B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


On March 28, 1994, the NASD proposed rules governing the operation and procedures for a new service for the delivery,
handling and execution of individual investors' small-sized agency orders.
 The NPROVE service, operated by Nasdaq, will provide automated executions of individual investors' small agency
orders in Nasdaq equity securities, and will offer small retail investors new opportunities for price improvement
of market orders. The new service will also heighten protections for individual investors' limit orders while enhancing
the ability of market makers to monitor and maintain competitive quotations accessible to investors participating
in an automated execution environment.





The purpose of this proposal is to modify NPROVE to further enhance the operational efficiency of the system and enhance
the limit order protection and price improvement benefits of NPROVE to retail investors. As described in more detail
below, the NASD proposes to enhance the operational efficiency of NPROVE by collapsing the current proposal for three
rounds of NPROVE order processing for unpreferenced orders into one 15-second round. With this streamlined order
execution procedure, NPROVE will be less susceptible to the development of order queues during peak volume periods
and retail investors will have greater assurance that they will receive a timely execution through NPROVE. The NASD
also proposes to further enhance the price improvement opportunities afforded small retail investors through NPROVE
by modifying NPROVE's order processing algorithm for the execution of matched market orders and limit orders. In
addition, the NASD proposes to modify the limit order processing features NPROVE to provide for a broader, more detailed
dissemination of NPROVE limit order information. With these changes, market participants will have a greater opportunity
to interact with limit orders in NPROVE, thereby enhancing the limit order protection and price improvement features
of NPROVE. Following is a more detailed description of these proposed changes.


1. Collapsing of NPROVE Order Processing Rounds


As currently designed, the execution of unpreferenced market and marketable limit orders may involve up to three
15-second rounds in NPROVE.
 In light of these three rounds of NPROVE order processing, some comment letters submitted to the SEC regarding NPROVE
have expressed concern that it may take 45 seconds to process each order entered into NPROVE.
 These commenters believe that executing NPROVE orders in 45-second intervals will create substantial order queues
that will paralyze the system and result in investors receiving significantly delayed executions through NPROVE
at prices wholly unrelated to the quotes that were displayed when their orders were entered into the system.






Given market makers' obligations to adhere to Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act, the NASD believes most
NPROVE orders would be executed during Round 1 and that it would be extremely rare for an NPROVE order to ever go beyond
Round 2 order processing. As a result, the NASD does not believe that the commenters concerns are realistic. Nevertheless,
while the NASD does not believe that prolonged order queues will develop under the current configuration of NPROVE,
the NASD thinks it is appropriate to take prudent steps to ensure that such order queues do not develop. Accordingly,
with one limited exception discussed below, the NASD proposes to collapse the three rounds of NPROVE order processing
into one 15-second round.

Specifically, under the revised order processing methodology, unpreferenced market orders entered into the system
will be broadcast to all NPROVE market makers at the applicable inside market for acceptance within 15 seconds, with
the market maker next in rotation for an NPROVE execution receiving an indicator that the system will execute the order
against him should he fail to reject the order or if no other market maker accepts the order (market orders with such
notifications appended to them are referred to as ``designated, unpreferenced orders'' and orders without such
a notification are referred to as ``undesignated, unpreferenced orders'').
 If a market maker rejects a designated, unpreferenced NPROVE order and no other market maker accepts the order within
the 15-second period, upon expiration of the 15-second period, the system will automatically execute the order against
the market maker next in rotation who received the order on an undesignated basis that has not rejected the order. If
all market makers decline the order consistent with Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act, the order will be
automatically executed against the market maker next in rotation at the new inside quotation. Thus, with this proposal,
Rounds 1 and 2 would be effectively collapsed into one round and Round 3 would be eliminated because orders rejected
by all market makers would be executed automatically at the new inside market.





Accordingly, with this one-round order processing format, the NASD believes even more strongly that significant
order queues will not occur in NPROVE, during normal trading days or peak volume days, and that investors will receive
timely executions at prices at or superior to the quotes displayed when they entered their orders into NPROVE.

The NASD proposes, however, to retain the ability of NPROVE market makers to improve upon the inside bid or offer and
achieve a ``priority market maker'' status; thus, providing a meaningful incentive for market makers to narrow their
spreads. In particular, as currently proposed, when a market maker improves its bid or offer to better the inside best
bid or offer and it becomes a ``priority market maker.'' Thereafter, for a short period of time (initially established
as five minutes or five executions, whichever occurs first, after one or more market makers have changed their quote
to equal the improved price) all unpreferenced NPROVE orders will be directed only to that market maker for acceptance
within 15 seconds. The priority market maker will retain its ``priority'' status only if it does not reject an order,
allow the system to automatically execute an order after 15 seconds, or a new inside has been established. Even if other
market makers adjust their quotes to match the new inside quote established by the priority market maker, the priority
market maker will be able to maintain its priority status, provided the priority market maker manually accepts each
order within 15 seconds.

Because of the retention of the ``priority market maker'' feature, it is conceivable that an order rejected by a priority
market maker could take 30 seconds to receive an execution in NPROVE. The NASD notes, however, that this potential
delay will be limited to a single order directed to a priority market maker and that a delay will occur only if the market
maker declines the order in compliance with Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act. If a priority market maker
allows one order to execute against him automatically after 15 seconds or it manually accepts all orders, all orders
sent to the market maker on a priority basis will receive an execution within 15 seconds. Moreover, unless the priority
market maker declines an order at the last second, the maximum length of time the order will be delayed will be less than
30 seconds. Accordingly, in weighing the de minimis costs to the marketplace resulting from the possibility that
a maximum of one order directed to any given priority market maker will be delayed for no more than 30 seconds, if at all,
against the benefits to the marketplace derived from providing market makers with an incentive to narrow their spreads
and improve the prices at which individual investors may execute their orders, the NASD believes it is appropriate
and consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to retain the priority market maker feature of NPROVE.



2. Automatic Execution of Preferenced Market Orders



Consistent with the NASD's desire to minimize the potential for order queues in NPROVE, the NASD is proposing to modify
NPROVE to provide that preferenced market orders or marketable limit orders will be automatically executed against
the preferenced market maker at the inside bid or offer displayed on Nasdaq when the order is processed through NPROVE.
 As explained in more detail in Section 5 below, preferenced market orders will only be automatically executed if they
did not match against a limit order residing in NPROVE.





3. Modifications to NPROVE's Execution Algorithm for Limit Orders to Provide Greater Limit Order Protection and
Enhanced Price Improvement Opportunities



As currently proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE at a price between the spread, the next incoming market
order on the opposite side of the market (

e.g.,

 the limit order is to sell stock and the market order is to buy stock) would automatically ``pass over'' or read the limit
order file to see if there are any orders residing in the limit order file at prices superior to the best bid or offer in
the Nasdaq marketplace. If a limit order resides in the file at a superior price, then the market order will be flashed
on the screen at that superior price for acceptance within a brief 15-second period, instead of at the inside bid or
offer. In that event, all market makers at the inside quotation would have the opportunity for 15 seconds to execute
the market order at the superior limit price. If no market maker elected to execute the order at that improved price,
the system would execute the orders against each other at the limit price.

<TEXT>
 

Several comment letters submitted to the SEC regarding NPROVE have expressed concern that this order processing
methodology places limit orders at an unfair disadvantage.
 In particular, these commenters maintain that the limit orders, which provide liquidity to the marketplace at prices
inside the best bid or offer, are disadvantaged because market makers can trade through them by taking out the market
order at the limit order price within 15 seconds and deprive the limit order of an execution for an indefinite period
of time. To address this concern, the NASD is proposing to modify NPROVE to provide that market makers must improve
upon the limit order price if they want to execute the matched market order.
 Specifically, under the proposal,
 if a limit order is residing in NPROVE priced superior to the best bid or offer, any incoming market order on the opposite
side of the market will be repriced to a price equal to the limit order price plus 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit
order to buy or the limit order price minus a 1/16th of a point in the case of a limit order to sell. The market order will
then be displayed for 15 seconds to all market makers whose current quotation equals the applicable inside quote.
 If no market maker accepts the incoming market order within the 15-second period, the market order will be automatically
executed against the limit order at the limit order price. In addition, if adding (subtracting) 1/16th of a point to
the price of a limit order to buy (sell) would cause the acceptance price of the market order to sell (buy) to be at or above
(below) the current inside offer (bid), then the market order and the limit order will be automatically executed against
each other at the limit order price without the participation of a market maker.










The NASD believes the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the concern that matched limit orders could remain
unexecuted while market makers are able to trade at the limit order price without executing the limit order and the
need to preserve the liquidity of the market by ensuring that market makers have an ability to interact with customer
orders. In this connection, the NASD notes that one of the cornerstones of the success of Nasdaq's competing dealer
system has been the availability of market maker capital to satisfy investors' liquidity demands and that this capital
is critically dependent on the ability of market makers to interact with customer order flow. The NASD also notes that
the proposal will provide an even greater opportunity for price improvement for market orders matching against limit
orders, as market makers will have to accept them at a price at least a 1/16th of a point superior to the price at which
they otherwise would have matched against the limit orders. In sum, the NASD believes the proposal significantly
enhances the price improvement and limit order protection features of NPROVE and eliminates the possibility that
a pending limit order will remain unexecuted while other public customer orders receive executions at the order's
limit price, while preserving the liquidity and orderliness of Nasdaq by allowing a minimal, yet essential, opportunity
for market makers to interact with retail order flow.



4. Broader Dissemination of NPROVE Limit Order Information



The NASD is proposing several amendments to NPROVE and other Nasdaq services to achieve a broader, more detailed dissemination
of NPROVE limit order information. The NASD believes these system modifications will facilitate the ability of market
participants to readily observe and react to limit orders entered into NPROVE priced better than the inside market,
which, in turn, will maximize order interaction in NPROVE and maximize the price improvement and limit order protection
benefits available to investors through NPROVE.

First, the NASD proposes to create a separate feed of NPROVE limit order information to vendors. This feed will consist
of the price of the highest priced limit order to buy and the price of the lowest priced limit order to sell that are inside
the best bid or offer displayed in Nasdaq, along with the aggregate size of all limit orders at such prices. Second,
the NASD proposes to modify the ``NPRV'' indicator displayed when a limit order is residing in NPROVE between the spread
to indicate which side of the market the limit order is on. Third, the NASD is proposing to modify the functionality
of Nasdaq Workstation I and Nasdaq Workstation II so that subscribers can readily obtain information on all limit
orders residing in NPROVE, including those limit orders priced within the inside market on Nasdaq. This ready display
of NPROVE limit order information will be accomplished with one key stroke in the Nasdaq Workstation I environment
and one mouse click in the Nasdaq Workstation II environment. Fourth, the NASD is proposing to develop a separate feed
of NPROVE transaction information and limit order information to registered market makers. Specifically,, the
feed to the market makers will include all NPROVE orders, cancellations, corrections, and executions. With this
information, which is in response to a comment letter received by the SEC regarding NPROVE,
 market makers will be able to assure their customers that they are receiving the same quality of execution that they
would have received had their orders been entered into NPROVE. Accordingly, with this feed, while a market maker's
customer order may not interact directly with a limit order in NPROVE, it would benefit indirectly from the existence
of the limit order in NPROVE. In sum, the NASD believes these changes will enhance the limit order protection and price
improvement benefits available to retail investors through NPROVE.





5. Modifications to the Processing of Preferenced Limit Orders



As currently proposed, while preferenced limit orders are able to take advantage of the limit order protection feature
of NPROVE, the existence of these orders are known only to the preferenced market makers. Unlike unpreferenced limit
orders, when a preferenced market order is entered between the spread, it does not activate the NPROVE limit order
indicator and it is not retrievable by other market makers in the summary scan of pending NPROVE limit orders. In addition,
when a preferenced limit order is matched against an incoming market order, the matched market order is only displayed
to the preferenced market maker for acceptance. Accordingly, in order to afford preferenced limit orders the same
opportunity for order interaction that is afforded unpreferenced limit orders, the NASD proposes to amend NPROVE
to provide that preferenced limit orders priced within the inside bid or offer on Nasdaq will be processed the same
way as unpreferenced limit orders.
 However, once the price of a preferenced limit order to buy (sell) is at or above (below) the inside offer (bid), it will
be automatically executed against the preferenced market maker. The NASD also proposes to amend the NPROVE rules
to reiterate and clarify that market makers may enter orders into NPROVE on self-preferenced basis and that these
orders will be processed like preferenced orders.

6. Inclusion of Short Sales in NPROVE



As currently proposed, short-sales would be prohibited through NPROVE, just as they are prohibited through the NASD's
Small Order Execution System rules currently in effect. In light of the SEC's approval of the NASD's proposed short-sale
rule in June 1994,
 coupled with NPROVE's order acceptance feature that enables market makers to handle exposure to transactions such
as short sales by permitting them to reject trades if they have already traded, however, the NASD believes it is appropriate
to permit short sales through NPROVE. By so doing, the NASD will expand the spectrum of retail orders that are available
to take advantage of NPROVES's price improvement and limit order protection benefits. Nevertheless, while NPROVE
will provide a 15-second period for a market maker to react to an NPROVE order, the NASD remains concerned that this
15-second period is sufficiently short the there remains a risk of destabilizing short term trading through the service.
Accordingly the NASD will review the volume and impact of short sales effected through NPROVE on an on-going basis
to determine whether it is appropriate in the interests of maintaining fair and orderly markets to continue to allow
short-sales through NPROVE.





The NASD believes that the proposed NPROVE system, as amended, is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9),
15A(b)(11), and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public
interest. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that rules of an association not impose any burden on competition not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section 15A(b)(11) requires the NASD to formulate rules
governing the quality of fair and informative quotations. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) finds that it is in the public interest
to, among other things, assure economically efficient execution of securities transactions. The fundamental purpose
of NPROVE is to assist individual investors in achieving prompt, efficient executions of their small orders, to provide
individual investors an opportunity for price improvement within an automated execution environment, and to afford
individual investors an automated and effective means to protect their limit orders. The integrity and efficiency
of Nasdaq for public investors and market-making participants is critical and the NASD believes that NPROVE will
provide benefits to both constituencies. The design of NPROVE is not anti-competitive as it treats all unpreferenced
orders uniformly; to the extent that preferenced orders are distinguished, by entering into preferencing arrangements
with known customers, market maker's effectively waive the protections offered by the system. NPROVE may also enhance
the quality of quotations in the Nasdaq market as market makers participating in the service may be encouraged to narrow
the spread and improve the best inter-dealer quotations in Nasdaq in order to be first in priority and continue to receive
unpreferenced order flow through NPROVE.

Lastly, the NASD believes that NPROVE is fully consistent with the significant national market system objectives
contained in Section 11A of the Act. The facilities of NPROVE would advance these objectives by offering efficient
execution of investors' small orders, by maintaining market maker participation through the automated delivery
of orders with the ability to reject those orders if trades have already occurred, and by offering the opportunity
for price improvement to NPROVE orders. The system's functionality will more accurately reflect market makers'
affirmative obligations to provide liquidity to the market, without depriving market makers of legitimate exceptions
from the firmness requirements contained in Rule 11Ac1-1 promulgated under the Act.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes it reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will:

A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Granting Partial, Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Transfer of Customer Accounts</DOCTITLE>



November 30, 1994.



On October 12, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 On November 9, 1994, the NASD filed with the Commission Amendment No. 1.
 The proposed rule change will amend the NASD's rules to provide for three business day settlement of securities transactions
and will amend the NASD's rules on the transfer of customer accounts between broker-dealers. The Commission published
notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 On November 18, 1994.
 No comments have been received on the notice. As discussed below, the Commission is approving on an accelerated basis
that portion of the proposed rule change relating to the transfer of customer accounts.









I. Description



The proposal amends the NASD's Uniform Practice Code (``UPC'') Section 65 which sets forth the procedures for the
transfer of customer accounts from one broker-dealer (``carrying member'') to another broker-dealer (``receiving
member''). The proposed rule change for Section 65 was developed in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''),
National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''), and the Securities Industry Association Customer Account
Division. Under the proposed language of Section 65, upon receipt from the customer of signed account transfer instructions
a receiving member must immediately submit the transfer instructions to the carrying member. The proposal will reduce
from five to three business days the time frame for the carrying member either to validate or to take exception to the
transfer instructions for all accounts including retirement plan accounts.
 The proposal will require that the carrying member complete all transfers in four rather than five business days after
validation of the transfer instructions. The proposal also (1) will more clearly define the reasons why the carrying
member may take exception to account transfer instructions,
 (2) will require the use of an automated facility for the transfer of mutual fund positions and residual credits when
both the carrying and the receiving members are participants in a registered clearing agency which has automated
facilities for such transfers, (3) will set forth time frames for the resolution of claims,
 (4) will require that partial transfers be processed through the automated facilities of a registered clearing agency
when both the carrying and receiving members are participants in a registered clearing agency which has automated
facilities for such transfers, and (5) will require that for a minimum of six months after an account transfer is completed
residual credit balances must be transferred within ten business days after accrual.

II. Discussion



The Commission believes the portion of the proposed rule change relating to the transfer of customer accounts is consistent
with Section 15A of the Act and, therefore, is approving that portion of the proposal. Specifically, the Commission
believes the proposal is consistent with Section 15A(b)(6)
 of the Act which requires that the rules of the NASD be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,
and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.





By amending its rules to shorten the time frames for customer account transfers in order that its rules correspond
with the rules of the NYSE and the NSCC, the NASD's proposed rule change should foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, and settling securities. By shortening the time it takes to transfer
securities from one broker-dealer to another, the proposal also should assist investors by giving them greater flexibility
in the selection of a broker-dealer through which to hold securities and by giving them enhanced control over their
assets. Shortening the time it takes to transfer securities to a broker-dealer also should facilitate transactions
in securities.

NASD has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the portion of the proposed rule change relating
to customer account transfers prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of the notice of filing. On September
2, 1994, the Commission approved the NYSE's proposed rule change to implement corresponding changes to the NYSE's
procedures for transferring customer accounts.
 The NYSE amendments relating to the automated transfer of mutual fund positions and residual credit processing become
effective 180 days from approval 

i.e.,

 on March 3, 1995) while all other provisions become effective 90 days from approval 

i.e,

 on December 2, 1994). Because many broker-dealers are subject to both the NYSE's rules and the NASD's rules and because
of systems changes NSCC has made to its customer account transfer system, it is important that the rules of the NYSE
and the NASD's rules and because of systems changes NSCC has made to its customer account transfer system, it is important
that the rules of the NYSE and the NASD do not conflict. In order to permit the NASD's rules to become effective simultaneously
with the NYSE's rules, the Commission is granting accelerated approval to the portion of the proposed rule change
relating to customer account transfers. Thus, sections 65(m)(2) and 65(m)(3), relating to automated transfer of
mutual fund positions and residual credit processing, will became effective on March 3, 1995, and all other amendments
to Section 65 will become effective on December 2, 1994.





III. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the portion of the proposed rule change relating to customer
account transfers is consistent with Section 15A of the Act.



It is therefore ordered.

 Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the portion of the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NASD-94-56)
containing the amendments to Section 65 be and hereby is approved.

For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Amendments to Exchange Rule 104.13</DOCTITLE>


November 29, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on October 26, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change consists of amendments to NYSE Rule 104.13 regarding investment account transactions of
specialists and related parties. The text of the proposed rule change is as follows, with language to be deleted in
brackets and language to be added in italics:


Rule 104


.13 Investment Transactions


(a) Any transactions effected for 

the benefit

 of any of the following [accounts] persons in stocks in which a specialist is registered must be for investment purposes:


* * * * *


(d) [Specialists should not originate orders in the stocks in which they are registered for any accounts over which
they exercise investment discretion.] 

No specialist, and no member, allied member, approved person (other than an approved person entitled to an exemption
from this rule pursuant to Rule 98) affiliated with such specialist, officer, employee or person active in the business
of the specialist shall originate orders in stocks in which such specialist is registered for any account over which
they exercise investment discretion.
(e) Transactions in a stock in which a specialist is registered effected for trust accounts, including ``blind''
accounts, for the benefit of such specialist or any person specified in paragraph (a) shall be subject to the provisions
of this rule. Transactions in a fund which invests broadly in securities and which may from time to time invest in a securities
in which a specialist is registered, shall not be subject to this rule.


Rule 98 Guidelines


(a) * **
The Exchange Rules listed below impose certain restrictions on an approved person who is associated with the specialist
member organization.


* * * * *


 Rule 104.13 provides that any transaction for the [account] benefit

 of an approved person associated with a specialist member organization, in any stock in which a specialist in the specialist
member organization is registered, must be for investment purposes and effected in a stabilizing manner

, and precludes an approved person from originating an order in such stock for any account over which such approved
person exercises investment discretion.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


Rule 104.13 requires that transactions effected in speciality stocks for the accounts of specified persons affiliated
with or related to a specialist must be for investment purposes and executed in accordance with certain restrictions
relating to the price at which transactions may take place, known as ``tick'' restrictions. The accounts specified
in the rule include accounts of employees or parties active in the business of the specialist, the spouse or children
residing in the same household as a specialist or persons active in the specialist business, and any approved person
(individual or entity in a control relationship) of the specialist, other than an approved person entitled to an exemption
pursuant to Exchange Rule 98.





The Exchange believes it is appropriate to amend Rule 104.13 to make it clear that the investment account transaction
requirements contained in the rule apply to transactions effected ``for the benefit of'' the parties specified in
the rule, rather than simply to transactions effected for the ``account'' of such parties. This would apply, for example,
to situations where transactions may not be effected directly for the ``account'' of one of the parties specified
in the rule, but may be effected for an account in which one of these specified parties has a beneficial interest. The
rule would also make it clear that specialists, and persons associated with specialists, may not originate orders
in specialty stocks for any accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.

<PARENT> FR941206-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Exchange also is proposing to amend NYSE Rule 104.13 to make it clear that the rule applies to transactions effected
for the benefit of trust accounts, including so-called ``blind'' trust accounts, of any person specified in the rule.
NYSE Rule 104.13 would be further amended to provide that transactions in a broad-based fund, which may from time to
time invest in a specialty stock in the course of investing in numerous stocks, would not be subject to the rule.
The Exchange also is proposing to amended the Guidelines to Rule 98 to reflect the amendments to NYSE Rule 104.13 noted
above.


2. Statutory Basis


The basis for the proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) of the Act that an Exchange have rules
that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market and, in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposed amendments are
consistent with these objectives in that they ensure that the restrictions contained in Rule 104.13 are appropriately
applied to accounts that benefit the persons subject to its provisions.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition





The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition that
is not necessary or appropriate in futherance of the purposes of the Act.





C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(a) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interests persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-38
and should be submitted by December 27, 1994.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Depository Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change
Establishing Procedures Whereby PHILADEP Interfaces With The Depository Trust Company's Same-Day Funds Settlement
Services</DOCTITLE>



November 29, 1994.




On December 3, 1991, the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``PHILADEP'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-PHILADEP-91-03) under Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 to codify PHILADEP's accommodation procedures whereby a PHILADEP participant can gain access to same-day funds
settlement (``SDFS'') services provided by The Depository Trust Company (``DTC''). Notice of the proposal was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 28, 1993.
 No comment letters were received. On September 27, 1994, PHILADEP amended the proposal in the following respects:
 (i) PHILADEP seeks to increase the number of transactions
 that may be processed in the system to one hundred (100) per day as opposed to the limitation of fifty (50) per day that
was set forth in the notice of proposed rule change and (ii) PHILADEP will approve a transaction once the participant
acknowledges the transaction and approves it unless the PHILADEP Interface Department determines that the participant
needs to make a prepayment or pledge additional collateral to its account at PHILADEP to ensure that the transaction
will not cause the participant to exceed its net debit cap or collateralization control.
 These amendments are technical in nature and do not require republication of notice and filing. For the reasons discussed
below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change subject to the following limitations: (i) PHILADEP's
program is limited to one PHILADEP participant and, (ii) the number of transactions that may be processed is limited
to one hundred per day.










I. Description


To accommodate a PHILADEP participant that desires to settle its SDFS transactions through the facilities of a securities
depository registered with the Commission, PHILADEP has become a participant in DTC's SDFS system. Consequently,
PHILADEP will be the conduit for its participant's SDFS transactions. PHILADEP, as a participant in DTC's SDFS, will
be required to make a deposit to DTC's SDFS Fund. PHILADEP will collect the SDFS Fund deposit from the participant taking
part in PHILADEP's SDFS system. PHILADEP has no beneficial interest in any SDFS transactions and will not initiate
any such transactions for its own account. Therefore, the extent of activity and concomitant collateral necessary
to be posted to support such activity pursuant to the PHILADEP/DTC agreement will be collected directly from the PHILADEP
participant generating the SDFS activity. In addition, the settlement debits and credits created by the activity
in PHILADEP's account at DTC will be collected from or paid to the PHILADEP participant.
DTC will charge PHILADEP its normal SDFS service fees, and PHILADEP will pass these fees to its participant making
use of the linked service. This participant must execute a separate agreement with PHILADEP explicitly agreeing
to abide by PHILADEP's relationship with DTC in connection with the provisions of SDFS services. Specifically, PHILADEP
requires its participant to abide by DTC's rules and procedures governing the SDFS system. For example, DTC's SDFS
security eligibility rules, instruction forms, processing cut-off windows, and risk controls are all directly
incorporated as requirements to be followed by PHILADEP and its participant. PHILADEP's participant is provided
with copies of DTC's SDFS procedures manual and is instructed to follow these procedures. Interdepository delivery
orders cannot occur unless PHILADEP has an adequate SDFS securities position at DTC.
To enhance further the risk reduction measures built into DTC's SDFS system (

e.g.,

) net debit caps and collateralization controls), PHILADEP has established additional safeguards consistent with
DTC's SDFS procedures with respect to its participant using the SDFS system. Each SDFS transaction authorization
request on a delivery to be received from DTC is directed by PHILADEP's Interface Department to the PHILADEP participant
for verification and approval or cancellation of the request.
 If the participant acknowledges the transaction and approves it,
 PHILADEP will verify that the transaction will not cause PHILADEP to exceed its net debit cap or collateralization
controls at DTC, and concomitantly will not cause the participant at PHILADEP to exceed its net debit cap and collateralization
controls at PHILADEP.
 Only if the participant has sufficient funds and collateral in its account will PHILADEP authorize the delivery to
be completed and credit the securities to the participant's account. If the participant has insufficient funds or
collateral in its account, the transaction will recycle, and PHILADEP will contact the participant and allow the
participant to post additional funds or collateral to permit the transaction to complete processing.

<TEXT>
 

When the PHILADEP participant must deliver SDFS securities, the PHILADEP participant sends instructions via facsimile
to PHILADEP's Interface Department on or before the established cut-off times that are consistent with DTC established
procedures. PHILADEP, on behalf of its participant, then sends notification of the delivery to DTC, but only after
PHILADEP confirms that its participant has a current position in the subject security. Once DTC determines the transaction
will not cause its participant or PHILADEP to exceed their respective net debit caps or collateralization controls
and allows the transaction to be completed, PHILADEP will credit the participant's account. Finally, PHILADEP and
DTC reconcile PHILADEP's positions in SDFS eligible securities on account at DTC each day, and PHILADEP reconciles
its individual participant's positions that reflect that aggregate. 

Because PHILADEP's SDFS system is offered as an accommodation to its participant, PHILADEP will restrict use of the
system to the one participant currently using the system and will restrict the number of transactions that may be processed
in the system to one hundred per day.
 Future expansion of the SDFS system is dependent, among other things, upon PHILADEP's operational capabilities
and will require the filing of a proposed rule change under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. 





II. Discussion



The Commission believes that PHILADEP's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and specifically with
Sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and (F).
 Sections 17A(b)(3)(A) and (F) require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules be designed to facilitate
and promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding
of securities and funds in the clearing agency's custody or control or for which it is responsible. The Commission
believes that PHILADEP's proposal to incorporate the safeguards proposed in DTC's SDFS system (

e.g. 

collateralization controls, net debit caps, receiver-authorized delivery, and SDFS Fund deposit) should help
protect PHILADEP from the failure of the PHILADEP participant to meet its settlement obligation to PHILADEP. For
example, the collateralization control requires that the participant have sufficient collateral in its account
to cover any projected net settlement debit. This assures that the transactions do not result in financial loss to
PHILADEP. The net debit cap helps to protect against abnormal intraday debit peaks that are out of line with the participant's
prior month's average daily activity level. The third safeguard is the receiver-authorized delivery instructions
which allow the participant to monitor deliveries directed to its account before the deliveries are posted to its
account. The SDFS Fund protects PHILADEP from losses from defaults by providing a source of liquidity in the SDFS system.
These incorporated safeguards will not operate independently but will function as an interdependent set of controls
that will help ensure the safety of PHILADEP's interface with DTC. 





Section 17A(b)(3)(F) also requires that the rules of a clearing agency foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
The Commission believes that PHILADEP's proposal is consistent with this section of the Act because the interface
will provide the PHILADEP participant with the ability to have its transaction in SDFS securities efficiently processed
through the facilities of a clearing agency thus avoiding the inefficiencies inherent in the settlement of SDFS securities
outside the automated facilities of a securities clearing agency. 



III. Conclusion



The Commission finds that PHILADEP's proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act and particularly with
Section 17A and the rules and regulations thereunder. 



It is therefore ordered, 

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PHILADEP-91-03)
be, and hereby is, approved. 




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Anchor National Life Insurance Company (``Anchor National''), Variable Annuity Account Three (the ``Separate
Account'') and SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. (``SCS'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) for exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of mortality and expense risk
charges and a distribution expense charge imposed under certain individual flexible premium deferred variable
annuity contracts (``Contract'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations




1. Anchor National is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of California. The Separate
Account was established by Anchor National on May 24, 1994, to fund variable annuity contracts. SCS, a broker-dealer
registered under the Exchange Act of 1934, is the distributor for the Contracts.

2. The Contracts provide for accumulation of contract values and payment of annuity benefits on a fixed and variable
basis. They will be initially funded through five portfolios of the Separate Account. Each portfolio invests its
assets in the shares of one of five available series of Westcore Variable Trust (``Trust'').

3. The Contracts are available for retirement plans which do not qualify for the special federal tax advantages available
under the Internal Revenue Code and for retirement plans which do qualify for the federal tax advantages available
under the Internal Revenue Code. Purchase payments under the Contracts may be made to the general account of Anchor
National under the Contracts' fixed account option (``Fixed Account''), the Separate Account or allocated between
them. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Contract is $5,000 for non-qualified contracts ($2,000 for qualified
contracts). Additional purchase payments may be made in amounts of at least $250 ($100 if made in connection with an
automatic payment plan).

4. If the Contract owner dies during the accumulation period, a death benefit will be payable to the beneficiary upon
receipt by Anchor National of due proof of death. The death benefit is reduced by premium tax incurred by Anchor National,
if any. The death benefit is equal to the greatest of: (1) The total dollar amount of purchase payments made prior to
the death of the Contract owners, reduced by any partial withdrawals and partial annuitizations; or (2) the contract
value at the end of the valuation period during which due proof of death (and an election of the type of payment to the
beneficiary) is received by Anchor National; or, where permitted by state law, (3) in the case of a Contract owner who
was less then age 70 at the date of Contract issue and after the seventh Contract anniversary, the contract value at
the seventh Contract anniversary, increased by any purchase payments made and reduced by any partial withdrawals
and partial annuitizations since that anniversary. 

5. An annual contract administration charge of $30 is charged against each Contract. The amount of this charge is guaranteed
and cannot be increased. This charge reimburses Anchor National for expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining
records relating to a Contract. The contract administration charge will be assessed on each anniversary of the Contract
date that occurs on or prior to the annuity date. In the event that a total surrender of contract value is made, the charge
will be assessed as of the date of surrender without proration. This charge is not assessed during the annuity period.
The contract administration charge is at cost with no margin included for profit.

<PARENT> FR941206-2-00077 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

6. During the accumulation period, amounts allocated to the Separate Account may be transferred among the portfolios
and/or the Fixed Account. After the annuity date, transfers may be made from the Separate Account to the Fixed Account
but not from the Fixed Account to the Separate Account. The first fifteen transactions effecting such transfers in
any contract year are permitted without the imposition of a transfer fee. A transfer fee of $25 ($10 in Pennsylvania
and Texas) is assessed on the sixteenth and each subsequent transfer within the contract year. This fee will be deducted
from contract values which remain in the portfolio (or, where applicable, the Fixed Account) from which the transfer
was made. If such remaining contract value is insufficient to pay the transfer fee, then the fee will be deducted from
transferred contract values. The transfer fee is at cost with no anticipation of profit.

7. A contingent deferred sales charge (``withdrawal charge'') may be imposed upon certain withdrawals. Withdrawal
charges will vary in amount depending upon the contribution year of the purchase payment at the time of withdrawal.
The withdrawal charge begins at 7% and declines 1% per year to 0% after seven years. The withdrawal charge is deducted
from remaining contract value so that the actual reduction in contract value as a result of the withdrawal will be greater
than the withdrawal amount requested and paid. For purposes of determining the withdrawal charge, withdrawals will
be allocated first to investment income, if any (which may generally be withdrawn free of withdrawal charge), and
then to purchase payments on a first-in, first-out basis so that all withdrawals are allocated to purchase payments
to which the lowest (if any) withdrawal charge applies.

8. Purchase payments no longer subject to the withdrawal charge and earnings under a Contract may be withdrawn at any
time free of the withdrawal charge. In addition, there may be a free withdrawal amount for the first withdrawal during
a contract year after the first contract year. The additional free withdrawal amount is equal to 10% of purchase payments
made more than one year prior to the date of withdrawal that remain subject to the withdrawal charge and that have not
previously been withdrawn, less earnings under the Contract.

9. Anchor National deducts a distribution expense charge from each portfolio of the Separate Account during each
valuation period which is equal, on an annual basis, to 0.15% of the net asset value of each portfolio. This charge is
designed to compensate Anchor National for assuming the risk that the cost of distributing the Contracts will exceed
the revenuers from the withdrawal charge. In no event will this charge be increased. The distribution expense charge
is assessed during both the accumulation period and the annuity period, however, it is not applied to contract values
allocated to the Fixed Account.

10. Annuity payments will not be affected by the mortality experience of persons receiving such payments or the general
population The annuity rates may not be changed under the Contract. For assuming the risks (1) that the life expectancy
of an annuitant will be greater than that assumed in the guaranteed annuity purchase rates, (2) for waiving the withdrawal
charge in the event of the death of the Contract owners, and (3) for providing the death benefit prior to the annuity
date, Anchor National deducts a mortality risk charge from the Separate Account. The charge is deducted from each
portfolio of the Separate Account during each valuation period at an annual rate of 0.90% of the net asset value of each
portfolio. If the mortality risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual costs of assuming the mortality risks,
Anchor National will bear the loss; however, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be a gain to
Anchor National. To the extent Anchor National realizes any gain, those amounts may be used at its discretion, including
offsetting losses experienced when the mortality risk charge is insufficient. The mortality risk charge may not
be increased under the Contract.



11. Anchor National bears the risk that the contract administration charge will be insufficient to cover the cost
of administering the Contracts. For assuming this expense risk, Anchor National deducts an expense risk charge from
the Separate Account. The charge is deducted from each portfolio of the Separate Account during each valuation period
at an annual rate of 0.35% of the net asset value of each portfolio. If the expense risk charge is insufficient to cover
the actual cost of administering the Contracts, Anchor National will bear the loss; however, if the charge is more
than sufficient, the excess will be a gain to Anchor National. To the extent Anchor National realizes any gain, those
amounts may be used at its discretion, including offsetting losses when the expense risk charge is insufficient.
The expense risk charge may not be increased under the Contract.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Act the Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from
any provision or provisions of the Act or from any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

2. Section 27(c)(2) of the Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor or underwriter
for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificates unless proceeds of payments on such certificates
(other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions. Section 26(a)(2)
and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality and expense risk
charges or distribution expense charges.

3. Applicants represent that the mortality risk is assumed by virtue of the annuity rates and the death benefit guaranteed
in the Contract; the annuity rates cannot be changed after issuance of the Contract. Applicants also represent that
the contract administration charge will not increase regardless of the actual costs incurred. If the mortality or
expense risk charges or the distribution expense charges are insufficient to cover the actual costs, Anchor National
will bear the loss. To the extent that the charges are in excess of actual costs, Anchor National, at its discretion,
may use the excess to offset losses when the charges are not sufficient to cover expenses.

4. Applicants assert that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Anchor National under the Contracts and reasonable in amount as determined by industry practice with respect to
comparable annuity products. Applicants state that these determinations are based on their analysis of publicly
available information about similar industry practice, and by taking into consideration-such factors as current
charge levels and benefits provided, the existence of expense charge guarantees and guaranteed annuity rates. Anchor
National undertakes to maintain at its home office a memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, setting
forth in detail the methodology used in making these determinations.

5. Anchor National has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Separate Account's distribution
financing arrangement will benefit the Separate Account and its investors. Anchor National represents that it will
maintain and make available to the Commission upon request a memorandum setting forth the basis of such conclusion.
Anchor National further represents that the assets of the Separate Account will be invested only in management investment
companies which undertake, in the event they should adopt a plan for financing distribution expenses pursuant to
Rule 12b-1 under the Act, to have such plan formulated and approved by their board of directors, the majority
of whom are not ``interested persons'' of the management investment company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19)
of the Act.

6. With respect to the distribution expense charge, Applicants represent that the aggregate amount of any withdrawal
charges imposed and distribution expense charges paid, will not at any time exceed 9% of purchase payments previously
made and that Anchor National will monitor each Contract owner's account for the purpose of ensuring that this limitation
is not exceeded Applicants undertake to include, in the prospectus forming part of the registration statement for
the Contracts, statements (1) describing the purpose of the distribution expense charge, and (2) that the staff of
the Commission deems such charge to constitute a deferred sales charge.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested in the application is necessary and appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act.





For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by The Chicago
Stock Exchange, Incorporated to Consolidate its MAX and SuperMAX Rules</DOCTITLE>


November 28, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 3, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-CHX-94-20).
The proposed rule change is described in Items I, II, and III below, which items have been prepared by the Exchange.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The CHX, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act''), proposes to add Rule 37 (b)
and (c) to Article XX, relating to the Exchange's Midwest Automated Execution System (the ``MAX''), and the automated
execution system within MAX in which a Specialist may voluntarily choose to participate on a stock by stock basis (the
``SuperMAX'').


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the CHX included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B)
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(i) Purpose


The purpose of the proposed change is to incorporate the operation of MAX and SuperMAX into the CHX Rules. Currently,
MAX and SuperMAX are only described in notices and approval orders. The proposed rule would consolidate this information
into a single rule. The approval orders upon which this rule filing is based are, among others: Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 32631 (July 14, 1993), 58 FR 39069 (July 21, 1993); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19629 (March
24, 1983), 48 FR 14105 (April 1, 1983); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27727 (February 22, 1990), 55 FR 7396 (March
1, 1990); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12451 (May 14, 1976), 41 FR 20932 (May 21, 1976); Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 22985 (March 7, 1986), 51 FR 9562 (March 19, 1986); Securities Exchange Release No. 32668 (July 22,
1993), 58 FR 40449 (July 28, 1993); and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34155 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 29838 (June 9,
1994).


(ii) Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No comments were solicited or received by the Exchange.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration
or enforcement of an existing rule of the Exchange and therefore has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing
of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such
action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purpose of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
a written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the CHX. All submissions should refer to file number SR-CHX-94-20 and should be submitted by December
27, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Examination Specifications for the General Securities Registered Representative (Series 7) Examination, and
the Corresponding Content Outline</DOCTITLE>



November 29, 1994.



I. Introduction



On October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-94-50) to revise the General Securities Registered Representative
(Series 7) Examination Specifications and the corresponding Content Outline.






The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34843 (October 14, 1994),
59 FR 53001 (October 20, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change
contingent upon the filing of the revised Examination Specifications and Content Outline by other appropriate self-regulatory
organizations (``SROs''), and approval of those filings by the Commission.



II. Description of the Proposal



The Phlx proposes to use the Series 7 as amended, as the appropriate qualification examination for persons seeking
registration as general securities representatives. The Series 7 Examination was created in 1974 as an industry-wide
qualification examination for persons seeking registration as general securities representatives. The Series
7 Examination is generally required under SRO rules for persons who are engaged in the solicitation, purchase, or
sale of securities for the accounts of customers. The purpose of the Series 7 Examination is to ensure that registered
representatives have the basic knowledge necessary to perform their functions and responsibilities. The Series
7 Specifications detail the areas covered by the examination and break down the number of examination questions culled
from each area, while the Content Outline details the subject coverage and question allocation of the examination.

Revision of the Series 7 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline was initiated in April 1993 by an industry
committee of SROs and representatives from broker-dealers in order to update the examination in view of changes in
the securities industry, including changes in relevant rules and regulations, the development of new securities
products, and changes in the job of registered representatives as firms offer an increasingly wide range of financial
services.
 The Examination Specifications and Content Outline for the Series 7 have not been revised since 1986.




The industry committee updated the existing statements of the critical functions of registered representatives
to ensure current relevance and appropriateness and drafted statements of tasks expected to be performed by entry-level
registered representatives and conformed the existing Content Outline to the task statements. The Content Outline
reflects the revised content of the examination. Under the proposed rule change, the total number of questions in
the Series 7 Examination will remain at 250, and the revised examination will cover all financial product areas covered
on the present Series 7 Examination as well as several new products, including collateralized mortgage obligations
(``CMOs''), long term equity anticipation securities (``LEAPS'') and CAPS,
 with reduced emphasis on direct participation programs.





The Commission anticipates that the other appropriate SRO participants also will file the revised specifications
for approval by the Commission. The Phlx, and these other SROs, may use the revised Examination, Specifications and
Content Outline after the Commission has approved the proposed rule changes of the other appropriate SRO participants.

III. Discussion



After careful review, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with
the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 6(c)(3)(B) provides that a national
securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a person associated with
a member in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the exchange, and may require any person associated
with a member, or any class of such persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with procedures so established.





The Commission also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15(b)(7) of the Act
 which stipulates that prior to effecting any transaction in, or inducing the purchase or sale of any security, a registered
broker or dealer must meet certain standards of operational capability, and that such broker or dealer must meet certain
standards of training, experience, competence, and such other qualifications as the Commission finds necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.





The Commission believes that revising the Series 7 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline should help
to ensure that only those securities representatives with a comprehensive knowledge of current Exchange rules,
as well as an understanding of the Act, will be able to solicit, purchase or sell securities for the accounts of customers.
The Commission believes that the revised areas covered by the Examination, Specifications and Content Outline are
appropriate subject matters and include a sufficiently broad range of topics to ensure an appropriate level of expertise
by representatives. Additionally, the revised examination tests relevant subject matters in view of changes in
applicable laws, rules, regulations, products, and industry practices. By ensuring this requisite level of knowledge,
the Phlx can remain confident that securities representatives have demonstrated an acceptable level of securities
knowledge to carry out their responsibilities.



The Commission has determined that the Content Outline for the revised Series 7 Examination is sufficiently detailed
and covers appropriate information so as to provide an adequate basis for studying the new topics covered on the revised
examination. The revised Content Outline should help ensure that those persons taking the revised examination understand
the full range of subject matters included in the examination.



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.



IV. Conclusion





It is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PHlx-94-50) is approved contingent upon the filing of
the Examination Specifications and Content Outline by the other appropriate SROs and the approval of these findings
by the Commission.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Examination Specifications for the General Securities Sales Supervisor (Series 8) Examination, and the Corresponding
Content Outline</DOCTITLE>


November 29, 1994.


I. Introduction


On October 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-94-51) to revise the General Securities Sales Supervisor
(Series 8) Examination Specifications and the corresponding Content Outline.






The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34842 (October 14, 1994),
59 FR 53002 (October 20, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change
contingent upon the filing of the revised Examination Specifications and Content Outline by other appropriate self-regulatory
organizations (``SROs''), and approval of those filings by the Commission.


II. Description of the Proposal


The General Securities Sales Supervisor (``Series 8'') Examination is an industry-wide qualification examination
for securities sales supervisors. The Series 8 examination is generally required under rules of the self-regulatory
organizations (``SROs'') for persons who are engaged in the supervision of general securities branch offices (

i.e., 

branch office managers) and of general securities registered representatives. The Series 8 examination tests a
candidate's knowledge of securities industry rules and regulations and certain statutory provisions applicable
to general securities sales supervision. The Series 8 Content Outline details the subject coverage and question
allocation of the examination. The Examination Specifications detail the areas covered by the examination and break
down the number of examination questions culled from each area.
Revision of the Series 8 Examination, Examination Specifications, and Content Outline was recently undertaken
by an industry committee composed of representatives from SROs (the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the National Association of Securities Dealers
and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange) and representatives from broker-dealers, including branch office managers,
compliance personnel and corporate executives, in order to update the examination in view of changes in relevant
laws, rules and regulations, the development of new products, and to reflect various changes in industry practices.
The committee reviewed the examination specifications, content areas and item bank and developed some new questions
in new areas.
The revised examination continues to cover the areas of knowledge required to supervise sales activities in securities,
however, the focus of the content of the examination has been shifted to concentrate more closely on supervisory duties.
Accordingly, certain questions have been deleted from the examination which deal with routine calculations and
basic product knowledge and questions on new federal and SRO rules and regulations have been incorporated into the
exam, as well as questions on new products, supervision and changes in industry practices. The revised Examination
Specifications and Content Outline reflect the revised content of the examination. The examination will remain
a six-hour, two-part, 200 question examination.
The Phlx also is adopting a new paragraph to Phlx Rule 748, Supervision, to expressly incorporate a supervisory examination
into Exchange rules. Specifically persons delegated supervisory responsibility pursuant to Rule 748 (b) and (c)
will be required by proposed paragraph (d) to meet the Exchanges' qualification requirements, including successful
completion of a supervisory examination deemed acceptable by the Exchange. This requirement is substantially similar
to existing provision of other exchanges.
 Currently, Rule 748 requires member or participant organizations to supervise all registered representatives
and each office, department or business activity. In addition, a general partner or principal executive officer
must be designated to assume overall responsibility for internal supervision of the organization and compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including establishing written supervisory procedures delegating supervisory
responsibilities and instituting a supervisory review procedure.

With respect to qualifications for supervisory personnel, Rule 748 merely requires employees with delegated supervisory
responsibility to be ``qualified,'' and persons responsible for any group of employees to ``reasonably discharge''
those duties. The proposed new language is intended to bridge this gap by expressly requiring supervisory personnel
to qualify with the Exchange by successfully completing the appropriate examination, which will be indicated in
the Exchange's memorandum to its membership. The Exchange notes that although options activity and personnel, including
foreign currency options, are also subject to Rule 748, additional supervisory requirements for option accounts
apply.






The Commission anticipates that the other appropriate SRO participants also will file the revised Specifications
and Content Outline for approval by the Commission. The Phlx and these other SROs, may use the revised Examination,
Specifications and Content Outline after the Commission has approved the proposed rule changes of the other appropriate
SRO participants.



III. Discussion



After careful review, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with
the requirements of Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act.
 Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section 6(c)(3)(B) provides that a national
securities exchange may examine and verify the qualifications of an applicant to become a person associated with
a member in accordance with procedures established by the rules of the exchange, and may require any person associated
with a member, or any class of such persons, to be registered with the exchange in accordance with procedures so established.





The Commission believes that revising the Series 8 Examination, Specifications and Content Outline should help
to ensure that only those securities sales supervisors with a comprehensive knowledge of current Exchange rules,
as well as an understanding of the Act, will be able to supervise general securities branch offices and registered
representatives. The Commission believes that the revised areas covered by the Examination, Specifications and

level of knowledge, the Phlx can remain confident that securities sales supervisors have demonstrated an acceptable
level of securities knowledge to carry out their responsibilities.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.



IV. Conclusion





It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-94-51) is approved contingent upon the filing of
the Examination Specifications and Content Outline by the other appropriate SROs and the approval of those filings
by the Commission.

<USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with 49 CFR Sections 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received from the Burlington Northern Railroad a request for waiver of compliance with certain requirements
of the Federal rail safety regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved,
the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioners arguments in favor of relief. 


Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) (Waiver Petition Docket Number SA-94-10) 


The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR Part 231).

BN requests a waiver from 49 CFR 231.4_Fixed-end low-side gondola and low-side hopper cars; (a)(3)(ii) states: ``The
brake shaft shall be located on end of car, to the left of and not more than 22-inches from center.'' This regulation
has been applied to coiled steel cars that have end platforms, commonly identified as a coiled steel gondola. 
BN is requesting that the wording be adopted as used in 
49 CFR 231.6_Flat cars (3)(ii): ``The brake shaft shall be located on end of car to the left of center, or on side of car
not more than 36 inches from right-hand end thereof.'' 
BN states that modern flat cars, particularly double stack cars, have used handbrakes in complete compliance with
49 CFR 231.6(a)(3)(ii), which locates the handbrake lower to the ground and closer to the side sill than allowed by
other specified car types. This has led to a handbrake application that makes it possible to apply or release the handbrake
from the ground when the car is stopped, or while riding the car when it is moving. Additionally, coil cars have been
built that have an end platform and appear similar to a flat car, especially toward the end of the car. Historically,
the handbrake has been mounted to the end of the trough bulkhead, inboard of the end platform. This requires a person
to climb onto the car to operate the handbrake. At this location the handbrake is very susceptible to damage when the
coils are loaded into the car. By lowering the handbrake and moving it outboard on the end sill, the handbrake is out
of the way of the loading process and less likely to be damaged. The BN request is to locate the handbrake on the end sill
and toward the side sill in excess of the 22-inches from the cars center line on coil cars having platforms with a AAR
gondola mechanical designation. This request is to include all coil cars equipped with end platforms. 
Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-94-10) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before January 13,
1995 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as
far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington,
DC 20590.

Cooper Tire and Rubber Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance 



The Cooper Tire and Rubber Company (Cooper) of Findlay, Ohio, determined that some of its tires failed to comply with
49 CFR 571.109, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 109, ``New Pneumatic Tires,'' and filed an appropriate
report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Cooper also petitioned to be exempted from
the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance
is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 29, 1994, and an opportunity was afforded for comment (59 FR
38659). This notice grants the petition. 
Paragraph S4.3(a) of FMVSS No. 109 specifies that each tire be labeled with ``[o]ne size designation, except that
equivalent inch and metric size designations may be used.'' 
During the periods of the 8th week through the 18th week of 1994, Cooper produced 8,097 175/70R13, Cooper Sport 1000
Metric GT, polyester/steel belted, tubeless, black sidewall, radial tires with incorrect size designations. These
tires were incorrectly stamped near the beads with a designation of 175/75R13 in characters 0.156 inch in height,
whereas they should have been stamped 175/70R13. However, the tires are correctly labeled with 175/70R13, in characters
0.400 inch high, on the mid-sidewall area. Cooper has recovered 1,281 of these tires to correct them prior to sale.
At the time it petitioned the agency, 6,816 remained unaccounted for. 
Cooper supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following, and also provided mold stamp
drawings which show the two areas on each side of the subject tires where the size is molded into them. 
The tires in question are incorrectly stamped on both sides, in the area of the sidewall closest to the bead, with the
designation 175/75R13. The tires are correctly stamped on both sides in the mid-sidewall of the tire with the correct
designation 175/70R13 in characters 0.400 inch in height. In addition, each tire contains an adhesive paper tread
label which is attached to the tread area of each tire indicating the correct size of 175/70R13. 
The mislabel on each tire is incorrect only as to the aspect ratio (or series), that is 75, of the tire. The cross section
width of 175, the designation of radial, and the rim diameter of 13 are all correct. Also the maximum load and inflation
stampings on both sidewalls of each tire are correct for a 175/70R13 tire. 
Further, a 175/75R13 [tire] has never been produced by Cooper, has never been standardized by the Tire and Rim Association,
and to the best of [Cooper's] knowledge, has never been produced by anyone, therefore, the possibility of misapplication
does not exist. 
The tires produced from this mold during the aforementioned time period comply with all other requirements of 49 CFR
571. 
No comments were received on the petition. 
The mislabeled aspect ratio does not affect the ability of the tire to be identified in the event of a recall. It has no
effect upon the performance of the tire. The correct aspect ratio appears elsewhere on the tire, on both sides, and
in larger characters. This minimizes the presence of the noncompliance. Moreover, there has never been a 175/7513
tire standardized by the Tire and Rim Association, nor has Cooper produced one. Therefore, there is no possibility
of misapplication. 
In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Cooper has met its burden of persuasion and
that the noncompliance with FMVSS No. 109 herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly,
the Administrator exempts Cooper from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements
of 49 U.S.C. 30120.

 

(49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50, 501.8).

<DOCTITLE>First Brands Corporation, Grant Of Petition For Determination Of Inconsequential Noncompliance </DOCTITLE>



First Brands Corporation (FBC) of Danbury, Connecticut determined that some of its brake fluid failed to comply with
49 CFR 571.116, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116, ``Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids,'' and filed an appropriate
report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573. FBC also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements
of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. 
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on April 7, 1994, under the designation of Docket No. 94-19, and
an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 16685). On April 26, 1994, the docket was redesignated 94-22 (59 FR
21800). This notice grants the petition. 
Paragraph S5.1.7, 

Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature,

 of Standard No. 116 states: 
When brake fluid is tested according to S6.7, at the storage temperature and for the storage times given in Table II_

(a) The fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification; 
(b) Upon inversion of the sample bottle, the time required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid shall not
exceed the bubble flow times shown in Table II; and 
(c) On warming to room temperature, the fluid shall resume the appearance and fluidity that it had before chilling.


Table II of S5.1.7 states that when the brake fluid is stored at ^40
  

#

 2
  C. for 144 hours 

#

 4.0 hours, the maximum bubble flow time is 10 seconds. When stored at ^50
  

#

 2
  C. for 6 hours 

#

 0.2 hours, the maximum bubble flow time is 35 seconds. 
NHTSA notified FBC that a sample of Prestone Brake Fluid, AS-400, failed to meet the no-crystallization requirements
of S5.1.7 (NHTSA file NCI 3293). FBC's initial investigation determined that the brake fluid was packaged on May 4,
1993, at its subsidiary, Paulsboro Packaging, Inc., and that the fluid was manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation
(UCC) and identified as UCC's PM6060, lot 

#

 0319083. FBC further stated: 
All [of the] product in FBC's distribution system packaged from the specific lot 

#

 0319083 was placed on hold and all packaging of Brake Fluid PM6060 was ceased pending a full investigation and implementation
of corrective measures. 
FBC produced 202,704 units (12.0 fl.oz.) from lot 

#

 0319083, and currently has 61,752 units on hold at various warehouses. 


Based on review of all data and consultation with UCC, it is FBC's opinion that the noncompliance will not affect product
performance in a motor vehicle or create a safety concern. 

FBC is recommending that no recall of [the] product outside of FBC's distribution system be made. It is further recommended
that the product in inventory (61,752 units) also be released for sale. 
FBC also stated that it has elected to convert to an alternative UCC brake fluid identified as PM6340, which has a freeze
point of ^65
  C., and will provide an added margin to meet the requirements of S5.1.7, Standard No. 116. 
In support of its petition, FBC attached a letter from UCC, dated January 17, 1994. The UCC letter describes the results
of tests it performed on samples of the noncompliant brake fluid: 
Specifically with regard to the DOT ``Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature'' test (FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7),
Union Carbide Corporation, using the DOT FMVSS 116 procedure, performed the test at ^40
  C for 6 days [144 hours] and ^50
  C for 6 hours. Following completion of the tests: 



at ^40
  C for 6 days, the sample passed all requirements. The sample met the requirements for appearance at low temperature,
bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity properties. 
^at ^50
  C for 6 hours, the sample passed the requirements of bubble travel time and room temperature appearance-fluidity
properties. Upon completion of the 6 hours at ^50
  C, some crystallization was noted in the sample. 
_attempts were made to isolate the crystallized material. It was a soft, non-abrasive gel that was difficult to isolate
as it flowed with the brake fluid.




Union Carbide Corporation also conducted the test of FMVSS 116, Section 5.1.7 on the sample with rigorous temperature
control at ^49
  C 

#

 2
  C to more closely realize the ^48
  C limit of the test's specified temperature range (Section 5.1.7 test parameter: ^50
  C 

#

 2
  C). The sample was clear, showed no crystals, had a bubble travel time of approximately 5 seconds and regained
its appearance and fluidity at room temperature. These results were confirmed by a second run at the same conditions.

in the liquid could be observed was determined to be ^62 
 C. 

From the results obtained and observations made, we are confident that this brake fluid will perform and provide braking
under the low temperature conditions of the FMVSS 116 standard, section 5.1.7 and offer the following reasons in support
of this: 


 


_The fluid passed the ^40 
 C/6 day fluidity and appearance test. 

_The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at low temperature (^40 
 C). 

_The fluid showed appropriate viscosity at ^50 
 C (bubble travel time of [approximately] 5 seconds against a requirement of 35 seconds [maximum]). 

_Any crystallization observed was a soft, non-abrasive gel that flowed with the brake fluid. Further, the phenomenon
is fully reversible. 

_The Pour Point of the sample was measured as ^62 
 C.

 


No comments were received on the petition. 

The agency has reviewed FBC's petition and supporting data. In two of UCC's low temperature tests of the noncompliant
fluid there was no crystallization; however, in another test, five crystals were formed. The crystallization was
described as ``a soft non-abrasive gel.'' As such, it appears similar to the ``slush-like crystallization'' which
occurred in Dow Corning's fluid. As Dow Corning persuasively argued, this type of crystallization will readily disperse
under slight agitation or warming and will not adversely affect brake system performance. In contrast are crystals
that are either water-based ice, abrasive, or have the potential to clog brake system components. NHTSA accepted
the distinction and granted the petition (59 FR 52582). In its view, the same conclusion is sustainable in this case.


In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that FBC has met its burden of persuasion and that
the noncompliance with Standard No. 116 herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly,
the Administrator exempts FBC from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements
of 49 U.S.C. 30120. However, granting of FBC's petition does not constitute an exemption from 49 U.S.C. 30112(a),
the prohibition against offering for sale, selling, and introducing into interstate commerce motor vehicle equipment
that does not meet all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Thus, FBC cannot release the 61,752 units
in inventory for sale in the United States, and must dispose of the noncompliant fluid in a manner that does not violate
49 U.S.C. 30112(a).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



Under 49 U.S.C.  30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C.  30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register

.

G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&K'') (Registered Importer 90-007)
has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E (Model ID 201.036) passenger cars are eligible for
importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&K believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz
190E that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer,
Daimler Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.

G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1990 Mercedes-Benz
190E, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its
U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E is identical to its U.S.
certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline Tensile Properties of Unknown Steel Pipe, Grant of Waiver; Amoco
Pipeline Co. 



Amoco Pipeline Company (Amoco) petitioned the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for a waiver
from compliance with a pipeline safety standard regarding determination of tensile properties of unknown steel
pipe (49 CFR 192.107(b)(1)). This standard provides certain methods of establishing the yield strength of pipe that
is manufactured in accordance with a specification not listed in Section I of Appendix B to Part 192 or whose specification
or tensile properties are unknown. This petition applies to approximately 35 miles of 16 inch pipeline in the State
of Missouri. 

Amoco requested the waiver for a section of pipeline that is being converted from liquid to natural gas service. The
pipeline is composed of 17 miles of 0.250 inch wall thickness, A.O. Smith electric weld pipe, constructed in 1948 and
18 miles of 0.281 inch wall thickness, National seamless pipe, constructed in 1952. Although it is believed that both
sections consist of Grade B pipe, no documentation verifying this is available. Hazardous liquids were transported
through this line until 1993, when it was purged with inert nitrogen gas. The pipeline, which was internally inspected
in 1988, has not been hydrostatically tested. 

The petition requests that the tensile strength determination procedures contained in Section II-D of Appendix
B to Part 192, as referenced in 49 CFR 192.107(b)(1), be waived in favor of the tensile strength determination methods
contained in 49 CFR Part 195.5(a)(1) with consideration to applicable class location factors contained in 49 CFR
192.111. Furthermore, the petition states that the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP), will be established
by reducing the test pressure as required by 49 CFR 192.619(a)(2)(ii) for the class location. A recent amendment to
49 CFR Part 195.5(a), Docket PS-127; Amendment 195-52, allows determination of design pressure by pressure
testing a hazardous liquid pipeline to yield in accordance with ASME B31.8, Appendix N. The design pressure is calculated
as eighty percent of the yield strength, as determined by the pressure test. 

In an August 31, 1992, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Docket PS-124; Notice 1, RSPA proposed similar amendments
to 49 CFR 192.14(a)(1). Since RSPA has received no comments opposing the rulemaking and a rule change is forthcoming,
RSPA, by this order, finds that the requested waiver of 49 CFR 192.107(b)(1) is appropriate and is not inconsistent
with pipeline safety. Therefore, Amoco Pipeline Company's petition for waiver from compliance with 49 CFR 192.107(b)(1)
is granted, effective December 12, 1994.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Cost-of-Living Adjustments and Headstone or Marker Allowance Rate </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As required by law, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is hereby giving notice of cost-of-living adjustments
(COLAs) in certain benefit rates and income limitations. These COLAs affect the pension and parents' dependency
and indemnity compensation (DIC) programs. These adjustments are based on the rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
during the one-year period ending September 30, 1994. VA is also giving notice of the maximum amount of reimbursement
that may be paid for headstones or markers purchased in lieu of Government-furnished headstones or markers in Fiscal
Year 1995 which began on October 1, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under 38 U.S.C. 2306(d), VA may provide reimbursement for the cost of non-Government headstones or markers at a rate
equal to the actual cost or the average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones or markers during the fiscal
year preceding the fiscal year in which the non-Government headstone or marker was purchased, whichever is less.




Section 8041 of Pub. L. 101-508 amended 38 U.S.C. 2306(d) to eliminate the payment of the monetary allowance
in lieu of VA-provided headstone or marker for deaths occurring on or after November 1, 1990. However, in a precedent
opinion (O.G.C. Prec. 17-90), VA General Counsel held that there is no limitation period applicable to claims
for benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 2306(d). 

The average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones or markers during any fiscal year is determined by dividing
the sum of VA costs during that fiscal year for procurement, transportation, Office of Memorial Programs and miscellaneous
administration, inspection and support staff by the total number of headstones and markers procured by VA during
that fiscal year and rounding to the nearest whole dollar amount. 

The average actual cost of Government-furnished headstones or markers for Fiscal Year 1994 under the above computation
method was $100. Therefore, effective October 1, 1994, the maximum rate of reimbursement for non-Government headstones
or markers purchased during Fiscal Year 1995 is $100. 



Cost-of-Living Adjustments 



Under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 5312 and section 306 of Pub. L. 95-588, VA is required to increase the benefit
rates and income limitations in the pension and parents' DIC programs by the same percentage, and effective the same
date, as increases in the benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act. The increased rates and
income limitations are also required to be published in the 

Federal Register

. 

The Social Security Administration has announced that there will be a 2.8 percent cost-of-living increase in social
security benefits effective December 1, 1994. Therefore, applying the same percentage, the following increased
rates and income limitations for the VA pension and parents' DIC programs will be effective December 1, 1994:

Parents' DIC:
DIC shall be paid monthly to parents of a deceased veteran in the following amounts (38 U.S.C. 1315):





No DIC is payable under this table if annual income exceeds $9,143.


One parent who has remarried.

 If there is only one parent and the parent has remarried and is living with the parent's spouse, DIC shall be paid under
Table 2 or under Table 4, whichever shall result in the greater benefit being paid to the veteran's parent. In the case
of remarriage, the total combined annual income of the parent and the parent's spouse shall be counted in determining
the monthly rate of DIC.


Two parents not living together.

 The rates in Table 3 apply to (1) two parents who are not living together, or (2) an unmarried parent when both parents
are living and the other parent has remarried. The monthly rate of DIC paid to each such parent shall be $273 reduced
on the basis of each parent's annual income, according to the following formula:

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is hereby giving notice of the weighted average poverty threshold in 1993
for one person (unrelated individual) as established by the Bureau of the Census.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

VA published a final regulation amending 38 CFR 4.16(a) in the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1990, pages 31579-80. The amendment provided that marginal employment generally shall be deemed
to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the Bureau of the Census as
the poverty threshold for one person. VA noted that the weighted average poverty threshold in 1988 for one person (unrelated
individual) as established by the Bureau of the Census was $6,024 and stated we would publish subsequent poverty threshold
figures as notices in the 

Federal Register

.


The Bureau of the Census recently published the weighted average poverty thresholds for 1993. The threshold for one
person (unrelated individual) is $7,363.

Public Telecommunications Facilities Program: Availability of Funds



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of funds.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), U.S. Department of Commerce, announces
that applications are available for planning and construction grants for public telecommunications facilities
under the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP), which is administered by NTIA.





Applicants for grants under the PTFP must file their applications on or before Wednesday, February 15, 1995.

 NTIA anticipates making grant awards by September 30, 1995.

Approximately $25.3 million is available in fiscal year 1995 for PTFP grants. The amount of a grant award will vary,
depending on the application project. For fiscal year 1994, NTIA awarded $21.2 million in funds to 140 projects. The
awards ranged from $4,102 to $850,000.

Prospective PTFP applicants should be aware that the Congress has appropriated funds for a related NTIA grant program.
The program, which is part of the National Information Infrastructure effort, is called the Telecommunications
and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP). The TIIAP's funds may be used for the planning and construction
of telecommunications networks or for the purchase of telecommunications services and facilities that enhance
the delivery of social services, such as education, culture, health care, public information, public safety, and
other related services. The TIIAP program funds demonstration projects that support the formation of an advanced
nationwide, telecommunications and information infrastructure incorporating the widest variety of information
technologies. The Congress appropriated $64 million for the TIIAP in FY 1995. Formal announcement of the TIIAP program
for FY 1995 will be made at a later date in a separate 

Federal Register

 notice. The TIIAP is distinct from the PTFP, which is the subject of this Notice. The PTFP or its predecessor programs
have been in operation since 1962.

The Final Rules and Policy Statement for the PTFP were published on November 22, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 59168 (1991)). These
rules, codified at 15 CFR part 2301, will be in effect for FY 1995 PTFP applications. Parties interested in applying
for financial assistance should refer to these rules and to the authorizing legislation (47 U.S.C. 390-393
and Pub. L. 103-317) for additional information on the program's goals and objectives, eligibility criteria,
evaluation criteria, and other requirements.






Authority:

 The Public Telecommunications Financing Act of 1978, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 390-393 (Act), and Pub. L. 103-317.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Application Forms and Regulations




To apply for a PTFP grant, an applicant must file a timely and complete application on a current form approved by the
Agency. 

The current application form expires on October 31, 1997, and no previous versions of the PTFP Application Form may
be used. 

(In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the current application form has been cleared under OMB control
no. 0660-0003.)

All persons and organizations on the PTFP's mailing list will be sent a copy of the current application form and the
Final Rules. Those not on the mailing list may obtain copies by contacting the PTFP at the address or telephone, fax,
computer bulletin board, or Internet numbers noted above. Prospective applicants should read the Final Rules carefully
before submitting applications. Applicants whose applications were deferred in FY 1994 will be mailed pertinent
PTFP materials and instructions for requesting reactivation.

Applicants should note that they must comply with the provisions of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs.'' The Executive Order requires applicants for financial assistance under this program
to file a copy of their application with the Single Points of Contact (SPOC) of all states relevant to the project. Applicants
are required to serve a copy of their completed application on the appropriate SPOC on or before February 15, 1995.
Applicants are encouraged to contact the appropriate SPOC well before the PTFP closing date.

NTIA requires that all applicants whose proposed projects need authorization from the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) must tender an application to the FCC for such authority on or before February 15, 1995. (An application is tendered
to the FCC when it has been received by the Secretary of the FCC.) However, applicants are urged to submit it with as much
lead time before the PTFP closing date as possible. The greater the lead time, the better the chance the FCC application
will be processed to coincide with NTIA's grant cycle. NTIA will return the application of any applicant that fails
to tender an application to the FCC for any necessary authority on or before February 15, 1995.

Indirect costs for 

construction

 applications are not supported by this program. The total dollar amount of the indirect costs proposed in a 

planning

 application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and approved by a cognizant Federal
agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or 100 percent of the total proposed direct costs dollar amount
in the application, whichever is less.

All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD-511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension,
and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.'' Applicants are further advised
that:

(1) 

Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension.

 Prospective participants (as defined at 15 CFR Part 26, Section 105) are subject to 15 CFR Part 26, ``Nonprocurement
Debarment and Suspension'' and the related section of the certification form;

(2) 

Drug Free Workplace.

 Grantees (as defined at 15 CFR part 26, Section 605) are subject to 15 CFR Part 26, Subpart F, ``Government-wide Requirements
for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants)'' and the related section of the certification form;

(3) 

Anti-lobbying.

 Persons (as defined at 15 CFR Part 28, Section 105) are subject to the lobbying provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, ``Limitation
on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,'' and the lobbying
section of the certification form, which applies to applicants/bidders for grants, cooperative agreements, and
contracts for more than $100,000, and loans and loan guarantees for more than $150,000, or the single family maximum
mortgage limit for affected programs, whichever is greater; and

(4) 

Anti-lobbying Disclosures.

 Any applicant that has paid or will pay for lobbying using any funds must submit an SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying
Activities,'' as required under 15 CFR Part 28, Appendix B.

For awards granted by NTIA, the recipient shall require applicants/bidders for subgrants, contracts, subcontracts,
or other lower tier covered transactions at any tier under the grant award to submit, if applicable, a completed Form
CD-512, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower
Tier Covered Transactions and Lobbying'' and disclosure form, SF-LLL, ``Disclosure of Lobbying Activities.''
Form CD-512 is intended for the use of recipients and should not be transmitted to the Department. An SF-LLL
completed by any tier recipient or subrecipient should be submitted to the Department in accordance with the instructions
contained in the award document.

Approving a request to amend an award to increase funding or to extend the period of performance is at the total discretion
of the Department.

Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and DOC policies, regulations, and procedures
applicable to Federal assistance awards. In addition, unsatisfactory performance by the applicant under prior
Federal awards may result in the application not being considered for funding.

Applicants are reminded that a false statement on the application may be grounds for denial or termination of funds
and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001.



Special Note:

 As originally stated in the August 20, 1987, PTFP Final Rules (52 FR 31496 (1987)), and as reaffirmed and clarified
in a November 22, 1991, PTFP Policy Statement (56 FR 59168 (1991)), NTIA has established a policy which is intended
to encourage stations to increase from 25% to 50% the matching percentage for those proposals that call for equipment
replacement, improvement, or augmentation. There are, however, some exceptions to this general policy direction.
Small community-licensee stations, for example, will not be subjected to this policy. The same is true of a station
that is licensed to a large institution (e.g., a college or university) that can document that it does not receive direct
or in-kind support from the larger institution. Also, a showing of extraordinary need or an emergency situation will
be taken into consideration as justification for grants of up to 75% of the project cost for such proposals. Nonetheless,
except in these instances, the presumption of 50% funding will be the general rule for the replacement, improvement,
or augmentation of equipment.

A point of clarification is in order: NTIA expects to continue funding projects to activate stations or to extend service
at up to 75% of the total project cost. NTIA will do this because applicants proposing to provide first service to a geographic
area ordinarily incur considerable costs that are not eligible for NTIA funding; such costs include those for construction
or renovation of buildings and other similar expenses.



II. Documentation Concerning Discrimination Complaints



The NTIA Administrator is hereby extending a blanket waiver to all PTFP FY 1995 applicants and grant recipients exempting
them from the requirements contained at 15 CFR 2301.5(d)(2)(xvii) and 2301.21(b)(1-2). Based on its experience,
NTIA has found these requirements to be too burdensome and generally not pertinent to the PTFP's selection criteria.
This blanket waiver means that FY 1995 PTFP applicants will not be required to provide a detailed list and explanation
of any complaints of discrimination currently pending or decided against the applicant before any court or governmental
agency. Moreover, FY 1995 PTFP grant recipients, once their projects are completed, will not be required to submit
such documentation on their Annual Status Reports; nor will recipients have to provide the special academic certification
concerning their admissions policies or their policies regarding the receiving or providing of services. Applicants
are reminded, however, that they are still obligated to comply with the general Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination,
as stated in 15 CFR 2301.22(b)(15) and in Assurance No. 36 of the PTFP Application Form.

III. Eligible and Ineligible Costs


Eligible equipment for the 1995 grant round includes apparatus necessary for the production, interconnection,
captioning, broadcast, or other distribution of programming, including but not limited to studio equipment; audio

equipment, transmission line, translators, microwave equipment, mobile equipment, satellite communications
equipment, instructional television fixed service equipment, subsidiary communications authorization transmitting
and receiving equipment, cable television equipment, and optical fiber communications equipment.
NTIA recognizes that digital technology will be an important means for the more efficient creation and distribution
of programming in the future. Consequently, public broadcasters seeking to replace, upgrade, and buy new equipment
which employs digital technology will be permitted, when appropriate, to use PTFP funds for such purposes.
The following list provides clarification regarding several equipment and other cost areas that will be helpful
in preparing applications. NTIA reserves the right to eliminate any costs, whether specified here or not, that it
determines are not appropriate prior to the awarding of a grant.

B. Other Expenses



(1) Construction Applications: NTIA generally will not fund salary expenses, including staff installation costs,
pre-application legal and engineering fees. Certain ``pre-operational expenses'' are eligible for funding. (

See

 15 CFR 2301.1.) Despite this provision, NTIA regards its primary mandate to be funding the acquisition of equipment
and only secondarily funding salaries. (A discussion of this issue appears in the PTFP Final Rules, 56 FR 59172 (1991).)
(2) Planning Applications. (a) Eligible: Salaries are eligible expenses for all planning grant applications, but
should be fully described and justified within the application. Planning grant applications may lease office equipment,
furniture and space, and may purchase expendable supplies under the terms of Section 392(c) of the Act. (b) Ineligible:
Planning grant applications cannot include the cost of constructing or operating a telecommunications facility.

(3) Audit Costs. (a) Non-Profit Organizations: Non-profit organizations receiving payments of more than $25,000
in Federal funds during a one-year period are required to have an audit conducted in accordance with Federal guidelines.
Audits for non-profit organizations are performed in one of two ways. An NTIA/PTFP-specific audit can be performed
if the organization receives funds solely from NTIA. If the organization receives funds from more than one Federal
source during the year that the audit is conducted, an organization-wide audit must be performed under OMB Circular
A-133. (Note that Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding is not considered a Federal source.)
Federal guidelines allow NTIA/PTFP to include an amount for audit costs as part of a grant award. NTIA/PTFP policy
permits non-profit organizations to include up to $5,000 for audit costs in an application. Because audit costs may
vary depending on the size and scope of an organization's operations, NTIA/PTFP recommends that applicants obtain
estimates from auditors to determine the appropriate amount to include in their applications. Construction Grant
Applicants should list the amount requested for audit costs in Part II, Section D_Other Project Costs, 1. Outside
Services of the PTFP Application Form. Planning Grant Applicants should include the amount on line 7, Other, in Part
III_Budget Information for Planning Grant Applicants of the PTFP Application Form.

(b) Government Agencies, Indian Tribes, and Educational Institutions: State and local governments, Indian tribes,
and educational institutions are also subject to federal audit requirements if they receive over $25,000 in Federal
funds during a one-year period. NTIA/PTFP can allow only an amount for audit costs equal to the NTIA/PTFP percentage
of all Federal funds received by an entity. It is expected that the NTIA/PTFP percentage of the Federal funds received
by state and local governments and educational institutions would be minimal in any one year, and NTIA/PTFP does not
anticipate that these entities will include an amount for audit costs in their applications. These entities are not
precluded from including such an amount in their applications, however, and the merit of such requests will be reviewed
on a case-by-case basis.



IV. Purchase of American-Made Equipment and Products



Prospective PTFP applicants are hereby notified that they will be encouraged to purchase, to the greatest extent
practicable, American-made equipment and products with funding provided under this program in accordance with
Congressional intent as set forth in the resolution contained in Public Law 103-317, Sections 607 (a) and (b).



V. Selection Process and Project Period


PTFP grants are awarded on the basis of a competitive review process. Before being selected for a grant award, a given
application for PTFP funding will undergo many stages of review, all of which apply the program's Funding Criteria
listed in the Final Rules (15 CFR 2301.13 and 2301.14). The review includes the following: an evaluation by PTFP staff;
a technical assessment by staff engineers; a review by outside readers, all of whom have demonstrated expertise in
either public broadcasting or distance learning; and a rating by National Advisory Panels, composed of representatives
of the major national public radio and television organizations. In addition, NTIA gives ``special consideration''
to the applications according to the level of involvement of women and minorities in the control and operation of the
applicant's station or project or the degree to which the project's programming will be specifically directed towards
meeting the needs and interests of minority groups or women. Documentation of substantial involvement by minorities
or women may increase a given application's competitiveness.
