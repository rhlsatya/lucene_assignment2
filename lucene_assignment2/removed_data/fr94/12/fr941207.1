Temporary Schedule C Positions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise its regulations which permit agencies to establish temporary
Schedule C positions in order to assist a department or agency head during the period immediately following a change
in presidential administration, when a new department or agency head has entered on duty, or when a new department
or agency is created. Agencies currently differentiate between identical temporary and new temporary Schedule
C positions. They are also subject to an overall limit of new positions they may establish, which was set over 10 years
ago. To simplify the Schedule C appointment process and respond to agency needs, OPM proposes to merge the two temporary
Schedule C authorities into a single temporary appointing authority, and to adjust agencies' position quota to a
more realistic level. OPM is also codifying a requirement in law which deals with the detailing of Schedule C incumbents
to the White House.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Currently, 5 CFR 213.3302 authorizes agencies to establish, without prior OPM approval, temporary Schedule C positions
in order to facilitate the orderly transition of duties during a Presidential transition, changes in department
or agency heads, or changes resulting from the creation of a new department or agency. These temporary positions may
be either (1) identical to existing Schedule C positions (ITC's) if intent to vacate these positions has been put in
writing by management or the present incumbent(s), or (2) new temporary Schedule C positions (NTC's) when it has been
determined that the department or agency heads' needs cannot be met through the establishment of a position identical
to an existing Schedule C position. Individual appointments may be made for up to 120 days, with one extension of an
additional 120 days. It has been OPM policy to permit agencies to make new ITC/NTC appointments up to a year after a Presidential
transition or the agency head comes on board.



In order to maintain a reasonable rate of temporary Schedule C positions within Government, every agency has a quota
of NTC positions it may establish. Current regulations set the limit on the number of NTC positions established by
an agency not to exceed 25 percent of the total number of permanent Schedule C positions authorized for that agency
as of March 31, 1980.

The regulations governing temporary Schedule C appointments have been in effect since 1981 and no longer meet agencies'
needs. In addition to general confusion over the distinction between the two types of temporary Schedule C appointments,
some agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to live within a NTC quota that is based on the number of Schedule
C positions that existed over 10 years ago. During 1993, OPM granted several exceptions to individual agency NTC quotas,
by way of a variation under section 5.1 of civil service rule V, to meet agencies' needs. To facilitate the appointment
process and alleviate processing delays, OPM proposes the following changes:



New Temporary Authority



The ITC and NTC authorities would be replaced by a single temporary transitional Schedule C (TTC) authority to assist
agencies with their staffing needs during a Presidential transition, changes in agency heads, or at the time a new
agency is created. This new authority will incorporate established policy in effect for ITC and NTC appointments,
such as the time limits for making new appointments (within 1 year after the changeover) and the length of individual
appointments (up to 120 days with one 120-day extension). No prior OPM approval would be required to make appointments,
but agencies would be subject to an overall limit on the number of positions they could fill. Agencies would also have
to notify OPM within 5 working days when a position has been encumbered, and within 3 working days when it has been vacated.



Agency Quotas



In order to maintain a reasonable number of temporary Schedule C positions, the number of temporary transitional
Schedule C positions established by an agency could not exceed either 50 percent of the highest number of permanent
Schedule C positions filled by that agency at any time over the previous 5 years, or three positions, whichever is higher.
This would create a fluctuating quota of positions directly related to the agency's Schedule C activity.



Miscellaneous



Since FY 91, the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act has required agency heads to
certify to OPM, when requesting Schedule C exception, that the agency's Schedule C position was not created solely
or primarily for the purpose of detailing the incumbent to the White House. With the sunset of the Federal Personnel
Manual, we are incorporating this provision of law into the Schedule C regulations. The proposed regulations also
include editorial changes to eliminate an obsolete reference to Schedule C delegation agreements which have not
existed since 1981, and to renumber and change the order of existing paragraphs.

The proposed regulations also contain a conforming amendment to part 316, section 316.403, which deals with provisional
appointments, to change the terminology of ITC and NTC appointments to temporary transitional.

p. 185.









2. Section 213.3301 is revised and section 213.3301b is removed to read as follows:





 213.3301

Positions of a confidential or policy-determining nature.







(a) Upon specific authorization by OPM, agencies may make appointments under this section to positions which are
policy-determining or which involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other
key appointed officials. Positions filled under this authority are excepted from the competitive service and constitute
Schedule C. Each position will be assigned a number from 213.3302 to 213.3999, or other appropriate number, to be used
by the agency in recording appointments made under that authorization.




(b) When requesting Schedule C exception, agencies must submit to OPM a statement signed by the agency head certifying
that the position was not created solely or primarily for the purpose of detailing the incumbent to the White House.




(c) The exception from the competitive service for each position listed in Schedule C by OPM is revoked immediately
upon the position becoming vacant. An agency shall notify OPM within 3 working days after a Schedule C position has
been vacated.



3. Section 213.3302 is revised to read as follows:




 213.3302

Temporary transitional Schedule C positions.



(a) An agency may establish temporary transitional Schedule C positions necessary to assist a department or agency
head during the 1-year period immediately following a change in presidential administration, when a new department
or agency head has entered on duty, or when a new department or agency is created. These positions may be established
only to meet legitimate needs of the agency in carrying out its mission during the period of transition associated
with such changeovers. They must be of a confidential or policy-determining character and are subject to instructions
issued by OPM.



(b) The number of temporary transitional Schedule C positions established by an agency cannot exceed either 50 percent
of the highest number of permanent Schedule C positions filled by that agency at any time over the previous 5 years,
or three positions, whichever is higher. In the event a new department or agency is created, the number of temporary
transitional positions should be reasonable in light of the size and program responsibility of that department or
agency.




(c) Individual appointments under this authority may be made for 120 days, with one extension of an additional 120
days. They may be deemed provisional appointments for purpose of the regulations set out in parts 351, 831, 842, 870,
and 890 of this chapter if they meet the criteria set out in   316.401 and 316.403 of this chapter.



(d) An agency shall notify OPM within 5 working days after a temporary transitional Schedule C position has been encumbered,
and within 3 working days when it has been vacated. The agency must also submit to OPM a statement signed by the agency
head certifying that the position was not created solely or primarily for the purpose of detailing the incumbent to
the White House.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 737-100 and -200 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 737-100 and -200 series airplanes. This 
proposal would require various inspections for cracks in the outboard chord of the frame 
at Body Station (BS) 727 and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A; and repair or 
replacement of cracked parts. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks in 
those outboard chords. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
such fatigue cracking, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the outboard 
chords, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane.

Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103, Attention: Rules Docket 
No. 94-NM-159-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056. 


Discussion 


The FAA has received several reports of cracking on Boeing Model 737-100 and 
-200 series airplanes in the outboard chord of the frame at Body Station (BS) 727 where 
Stringer 18A is attached. There also have been reports of cracking in the outboard chord 
of Stringer 18A. These cracks were found on eight airplanes that had accumulated 
between 39,000 and 54,100 flight hours, and between 56,200 and 73,200 flight cycles. 
The cracks have been determined to be caused by fatigue that was initiated by fretting of 
adjacent parts. Fatigue cracks in the chords, if not detected and corrected in a timely 
manner, could result in reduced structural integrity of the structure, and subsequent rapid 
decompression of the airplane. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
737-53A1166, dated June 30, 1994, which describes procedures for the following 
repetitive inspections: 
1. Close visual inspections to detect cracking of the edge of the forward flange of 
the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727; 
2. High frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking of the 
fastener holes in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727; 
3. Pulse echo shear wave (PESW) inspections to detect cracking in the area of the 
two forward lower fastener holes in the outboard chord where Stringer 18A is attached; 
and 
4. HFEC inspections to detect cracking of the outboard surface of the outboard 
chord of Stringer 18A at Station 727 and of the surface around the heads of two fasteners. 
The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for either the installation of a 
time-limited repair or the replacement of the chords, if any crack is found in the outboard 
chord of the frame at BS 727. (The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service 
Bulletin 737-53-1088 as an additional source of service information for replacement of 
the outboard chords.) In addition, the alert service bulletin describes procedures for 
installation of a preventative modification, which, when accomplished, eliminates the 
need for repetitive inspections. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require various 
inspections for cracks in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727 and in the outboard 
chord of Stringer 18A; and repair or replacement of cracked parts. The proposed AD 
would also provide for an optional terminating action for the required inspections. The 
actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin 
described previously. 
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these 
circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane 
was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability 
provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or 
repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner 
or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance 
with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such 
approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
There are approximately 999 Boeing Model 737-100 and -200 series airplanes of 
the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 296 airplanes of U.S. 
registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work 
hours per airplane to accomplish each of the proposed inspections, and that the average 
labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
inspection requirements of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$71,040, or $240 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 
Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that would 
be provided by this AD action, it would take approximately 50 work hours to accomplish 
it, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost 
approximately $3,680 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this 
optional terminating action is estimated to be $6,680 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 


Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. 


The Proposed Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the 
Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation 
Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 
11.89. 


 39.13 

[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:





Boeing: 

Docket 94-NM-159-AD. 





Applicability:

 Model 737-100 and -200 series airplanes; line numbers 1 through 
999, inclusive; certificated in any category. 





Note 1: 

This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding 
applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in 
the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, 
altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the 
owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (h) to request approval from 
the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration 
eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe 
condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect 
of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case 
does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the 
applicability of this AD.






Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent reduced structural integrity of the outboard chords, and subsequent 
rapid decompression of the airplane, accomplish the following: 
(a) For airplanes on which the upper outboard chord has been replaced in 
accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 737-53-1088: Prior to the accumulation of 
30,000 total flight cycles since replacement of the upper outboard chord, or within 4,500 
flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform close 
visual, pulse echo shear wave (PESW), and high frequency eddy current (HFEC) 
inspections to detect cracks in the outboard chord of the frame at Body Station (BS) 727 
and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A , in accordance with Part I of the 
Accomplishment Instructions of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-53A1166, dated 
June 30, 1994. 
(b) Repeat the inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD as follows, until 
the optional terminating action described in paragraph (g) of this AD is accomplished: 
(1) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this AD, the airplane has accumulated 27,000 or more flight cycles, but fewer than 50,000 
flight cycles, since the replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection 
within 15,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 
15,000 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 50,000 or more flight cycles since 
the replacement of the outboard chord; then perform the inspections required by 
paragraph (b)(2) of this AD. 
(2) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this AD, the airplane has accumulated 50,000 or more flight cycles, but fewer than 60,000 
flight cycles, since the replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection 
within 7,500 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 
7,500 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 60,000 or more flight cycles since 
the replacement of the outboard chord; then perform the inspections required by 
paragraph (b)(3) of this AD. 
(3) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this AD, the airplane has accumulated 60,000 or more flight cycles, but fewer than 70,000 
flight cycles, since the replacement of the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection 
within 5,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 
5,000 flight cycles until the airplane has accumulated 70,000 or more flight cycles since 
the replacement of the outboard chord; then perform the inspections required by 
paragraph (b)(4) of this AD. 
(4) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this AD, the airplane has accumulated 70,000 or more flight cycles since replacement of 
the outboard chord: Perform the next inspection within 3,000 flight cycles. Repeat the 
inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles. 
(c) For airplanes on which the outboard chord has not been replaced or on which 
only the lower outboard chord has been replaced in accordance with Boeing Service 
Bulletin: 737-53-1088: Perform close visual, pulse echo shear wave (PESW), and high 
frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracks in the outboard chord of the 
frame at BS 727 and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A, in accordance with Part I of 
the Accomplishment Instructions of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-53A1166, dated 
June 30, 1994. Perform these inspections initially at the time specified in paragraph 
(c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4), as applicable. Repeat these inspections thereafter at the 
intervals specified in paragraph (d) of this AD. 
(1) For airplanes that have accumulated 27,000 or more total flight cycles, but 
fewer than 50,000 total flight cycles, as of the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to 
the accumulation of 4,500 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD.

the accumulation of 1,500 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD. 
(4) For airplanes that have accumulated 70,000 or more total flight cycles as of 
the effective date of this AD: Inspect prior to the accumulation of 500 flight cycles or 
within 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first. 
(d) Repeat the inspections required by paragraph (c) of this AD as follows, until 
the optional terminating action described in paragraph (g) of this AD is accomplished: 
(1) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this AD, the airplane has accumulated 27,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than 
50,000 total flight cycles: Perform the next inspection within 15,000 flight cycles. 
Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 15,000 flight cycles until the 
airplane has accumulated 50,000 or more total flight cycles; then perform the inspections 
required by paragraph (d)(2) of this AD. 
(2) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this AD, the airplane had accumulated 50,000 or more total flight cycles, but fewer than

by paragraph (b)(4) of this AD. 
(4) If, at the time of the most recent inspection required by paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this AD, the airplane had accumulated 70,000 or more total flight cycles: Perform the 
next inspection within 3,000 flight cycles. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals 
not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles. 
(e) If any crack is found in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A during any 
inspection required by this AD, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with a method 
approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Transport Airplane 
Directorate. 
(f) If any crack is found in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727 during any 
inspection required by this AD, accomplish paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this AD, as 
applicable, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-53A1166, dated 
June 30, 1994. 
(1) For any crack that extends from the forward edge of the chord or from the 
forward fastener hole, but that does not extend past the second fastener hole, accomplish 
either paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (f)(1)(ii) of this AD. Thereafter, perform initial and repetitive 
inspections in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD. 
(i) Prior to further flight, install the time limited repair. Prior to the accumulation 
of 4,500 flight cycles or within 18 months, after accomplishing the time-limited repair, 
whichever occurs first, replace the outboard chord. Or 
(ii) Prior to further flight, replace the outboard chord. 





Note 4: 

Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 737-53A1166 references Boeing Service 
Bulletin 737-53-1088 as an additional source of service information for procedures to 
replace the chord.

Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, LA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), the Coast Guard is considering
a change to the regulation governing the operation of the vertical lift span drawbridge across the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway, mile 35.6, at Larose, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. The proposed regulation would require that from 7 a.m.
to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, the draw of the bridge would
remain closed to navigation for passage of vehicular traffic during peak traffic periods. At all other times the draw
would open on signal for passage of vessels. Presently, the draw is required to open on signal at all times. This action
would relieve traffic congestion on the bridge during these periods, and still provide for the reasonable needs of
navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments



Interested parties are invited to participate in the proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge and give
reasons for concurrence with or any recommended change in this proposal. Persons desiring acknowledgement that
their comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Eighth Coast Guard District
at the address under ADDRESSES

. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.

The Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of
final action on this proposal. The proposed regulation may be changed in the light of comments received. 



Drafting Information 



The drafters of this regulation are Mr. John Wachter, project officer, and LT Elisa Holland, project attorney. 



Background and Purpose 



The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has requested the new regulation because vehicular
traffic crossing the bridge during the proposed closure periods has increased dramatically during recent years
and severe congestion occurs during peak traffic hours. The proposed regulation would allow for the uninterrupted
flow of vehicular traffic, while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation. 



Discussion of Proposed Rules 



The Louisiana State Route 1 vertical lift span bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 35.6, at Larose,
Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, has 35 feet vertical clearance above mean high water in the closed to navigation position
and 73 feet vertical clearance above mean high water in the open to navigation position. The horizontal clearance
is 125 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of tugs with tows, fishing vessels, sailing vessels, oil field work
boats and recreational craft. Data provided by LDOTD show that from June 1993 through May 1994, the number of vessels
that passed the bridge during the proposed closure period from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. average 1.3 vessels per day. The number
of vessels that passed the bridge during the proposed 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. closure averaged 1.4 vessels per day. 

Data show that approximately 658 vehicles cross the bridge during the proposed 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. closure period and
approximately 1,247 vehicles cross the bridge during the proposed 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. closure period. 



Regulatory Evaluation 



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). 

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 



Small Entities 



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. 

Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected
to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Collection of Information 



This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

). 



Federalism Implications 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



Environment 



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated
under

 Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 By this notice, the FAA solicits comments from the public, including Part 135 operators that conduct scheduled operations
for compensation or hire in airplanes with passenger seating configurations of 10 to 30 seats and aircraft manufacturers,
on the recent recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) related to commuter airline
safety. The FAA seeks comment on any aspect of the NTSB recommendations, without limit, including the potential safety
benefits and financial costs, if any, for each of the NTSB recommendations. Comments received on the recommendations
enumerated in this notice will assist the FAA in determining future regulatory action and may point out specific exceptions
or alternatives that should be considered. Comments received will be considered by the FAA in the rulemaking process,
as applicable.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 On November 15, 1994, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued 10 recommendations to the Federal Aviation
Administration as a result of the NTSB's study of commuter airline safety. The FAA is considering rulemaking for each
area where rulemaking is appropriate. In announcing these recommendations, the NTSB stated that the standards for
safety should be based on the characteristics of the flight operations, not the seating capacity of the aircraft and
that passengers on commuter airlines should be afforded the same regulatory safety protections granted to passengers
flying on Part 121 airlines. 



With this notice, the FAA is soliciting comments on the following recommendations and the FAA's response thereto:

1. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations such that:

 All scheduled passenger service conducted in aircraft with 20 or more passenger seats be conducted according
to the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121.

 All scheduled passenger service conducted in aircraft with 10 to 19 passenger seats be conducted in accordance
with 14 CFR Part 121, or its functional equivalent, wherever possible.

2. Require principal operations inspectors to periodically review air carrier flight operations policies and practices
concerning pilot tasks between flights to ensure that carriers provide pilots with adequate resources (such as time
and personnel) to accomplish those tasks.
3. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations contained in 14 CFR Part 135 to require that pilot flight time accumulated
in all company flying conducted after revenue operations * * * such as training and check flights,
ferry flights and repositioning flights * * * be included in the crewmember's total flight time accrued
during revenue operations.
4. Revise within 1 year the pilot training requirements for scheduled Part 135 operators such that:
 All pilot training for aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats be conducted in accordance with Subparts N and
O of 14 CFR Part 121.
 All pilots are provided mandatory crew resource management training that incorporates the principal components
of effective CRM training, as outlined in Advisory Circular AC 120-51A, ``Crew Resource Management Training.''
 All flightcrew members complete the initial operating experience currently required only of pilots-in-command
under Part 135.244.
5. Issue within 6 months a final rule of 14 CFR Part 142 concerning the certification and operation of training centers.
6. Revise the certification standards for Part 25 and for Part 23 (commuter category) aircraft to require that a flight
simulator, suitable for flightcrew training under Appendix H of Part 121, be available concurrent with the certification
of any new aircraft type.
7. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations to require all flight attendants to participate, during recurrent training,
in emergency drills that allow them the opportunity to use emergency equipment and to practice procedures under simulated
emergency conditions.
8. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations to require that all air carriers operating under Parts 121 and 135 establish
a safety function, such as outlined in Advisory Circular AC 120-59, ``Air Carrier Internal Evaluation Programs.''
9. Establish a joint industry/government task force, such as an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC),
comprising representatives from the FAA, air carriers, aircraft manufacturers, and the academic community to review
the qualification standards and training curriculum of air carrier inspectors. The intent of the task force should
be revisions to the qualifying and training standards for air carrier inspectors that will (a) increase their familiarity
with air carrier operations and maintenance in general, as well as the specific operations of the air carriers they
inspect; and (b) enhance their knowledge of the Federal Aviation Regulations and provide for more standardized interpretation
and enforcement of the regulations.
10. Enhance the level of safety at airports served by commuter airlines by:
 Seeking legislative action within 6 months to include in the Airport Certification Program all airports served
by air carriers that provide scheduled passenger service.
 Revising and expanding 14 CFR 135, following enactment of the legislative action described in Safety Recommendation
A-94-203, to permit scheduled passenger operation only in airports certificated under the standards
contained in Part 139, ``Certification and Operations: Land Airports Serving Certain Air Carriers.''
The FAA requests that commenters be as specific as possible and provide as much detail in comments as necessary to facilitate
regulatory decisionmaking. The format that would be most useful to the FAA is a subpart by subpart analysis of the impact
of possible rulemaking. Cost information is also particularly useful.
Because of the timeframe recommended by the NTSB, the FAA requests that commenters be timely in their response to this
notice. The agency does not anticipate an extension of the comment period, so that regulatory changes may be proposed
in a responsive timeframe.
The FAA anticipates that comments provided in response to this notice will assist the agency in adopting or modifying
the NTSB recommendations to establish a regulatory framework that will enhance safety in the commuter airline industry
while not being overly burdensome on that industry.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to designate critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl (

Strix occidentalis lucida

), a subspecies federally listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). A total
of 1,931,264 hectares (ha) (4,770,223 acres) of critical habitat is proposed. This proposed critical habitat designation,
if made final, would provide additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities
that are funded, authorized, or carried out by any Federal agency. As information is received by the Service from the
Indian Tribal Governments, the Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Team (Team), Federal and State agencies, and the general
public, revisions may be made to this proposal to incorporate that new information. In addition, section 4 of the Act
requires the Service to consider economic impact and any other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on
the size and scope of critical habitat. An economic analysis is currently being prepared and notice of its availability
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and local newspapers. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Summary of Proposed Action 



This rule proposes to designate critical habitat on certain lands in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, which
now provide habitat or may provide habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, and that are managed for timber harvest. The
Team has developed a draft Recovery Plan that identifies commercial timber harvest as the main management regime
presenting a threat to Mexican spotted owl habitat. 

On February 14, 1994, certain environmental groups and an individual filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in
Arizona against the Department of the Interior for failure to designate critical habitat for the Mexican spotted
owl. 

Dr. Robin Silver, et al. v. Bruce Babbit, et al., 

CIV-94-0337-PHX-CAM. On October 6, 1994, the Court ordered the Service to, ``publish a proposed
designation of critical habitat, including economic exclusion pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1533(b)(2), no later than
December 1, 1994, * * * [and] publish its final designation of critical habitat, following the procedure
required by statute and Federal regulations for notice and comment, no later than May 27, 1995.'' The Service plans
to review the information which has been assembled and analyzed by the Team as it makes final determination about designation
of critical habitat. It is anticipated that the draft recovery plan will be available for public review and comment
in December 1994.

The Service is also pursuing conservation agreements and management programs with various Indian Tribal Governments
and the U.S. Forest Service. If agreements can be reached and implementation ensured so that special management consideration
or protection is not necessary, the Service may consider excluding those areas from critical habitat. Such management
agreements should include commitments to implementation of the recovery plan for the species or equivalent protection.




Background 



The Mexican spotted owl is a medium-sized bird ranging from parts of central Colorado and Utah, south through Arizona,
New Mexico, and western Texas, then south through Mexico to the States of Michoacan and Puebla. Mexican spotted owl
habitat typically consists of dense, multi-storied, montane forests with closed canopies, and deep, cool, fractured
canyons. The Mexican spotted owl is threatened by destruction and modification of habitat caused by even-aged timber
harvest methods and wildfires, and decreased habitat suitability and potential increased predation associated
with habitat fragmentation. 



Previous Federal Actions 



The entire spotted owl species (

Strix occidentalis

) was classified on the Service's 1989 Animal Notice of Review (54 FR 554; January 6, 1989) as a category 2 species. A
category 2 species is one for which listing may be appropriate, but for which additional biological information is
needed to support a proposed rule. The northern spotted owl subspecies (

S. o. caurina

) was listed as a threatened species on June 26, 1990 (55 FR 26194), and its critical habitat was designated on January
15, 1992 (57 FR 1796). The California spotted owl subspecies (

S. o. occidentalis

) remains a category 2 candidate. 

On December 22, 1989, the Service received a petition submitted by Dr. Robin D. Silver requesting the listing of the
Mexican spotted owl as an endangered or threatened species under the Act. On February 27, 1990, the Service found that
the petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may be warranted and initiated a status
review. In conducting its review, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 11413) on March 28, 1990, requesting public comments and biological data on the status of the Mexican spotted
owl. On December 6, 1990, the Mexican Spotted Owl Status Review Team completed a draft report, and on February 20, 1991,
the Service made a finding, based on the contents of the report, that listing the Mexican spotted owl pursuant to section
4(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act was warranted. Notice of this finding was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 11, 1991 (56 FR 14678). A proposed rule to list the Mexican spotted owl as threatened without critical habitat
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 4, 1991 (56 FR 56344). 

In the November 4, 1991, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might bear on whether the Mexican spotted owl should be listed. The comment period
was reopened from May 11, 1992, to September 1, 1992 (57 FR 20073; May 11, 1992) to allow submission of additional comments.
Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested
parties were directly contacted and requested to comment, and newspaper notices inviting public comment were published
in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The Service held six public hearings, which were announced in the proposed
rule. A notice of the hearing dates and locations was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 2, 1992 (57 FR 35), and in notices published in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado newspapers. Interested
parties were directly contacted and notified of the hearings. 

After a review of all comments received in response to the proposed rule, the Service published a final rule to list
the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14248). Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires
that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species
is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical
habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation
is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an
area as critical habitat. At the time of listing, the Service found that, although considerable knowledge of Mexican
spotted owl habitat needs had been gathered in recent years, habitat maps in sufficient detail to accurately delineate
these areas were not available. Subsequent to listing, the Service began gathering the data necessary to develop
this proposed rule. 

On June 25, 1993, and again on August 16, 1993, the Service received petitions to remove the Mexican spotted owl from
the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (delist). In subsequent petition findings published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 49467, 59 FR 15361) the Service addressed the issues raised in the petitions and determined that the petitioners
did not present substantial information indicating that delisting the Mexican spotted owl was warranted. The petitioners
have legally challanged this decision in Federal District Court in New Mexico in 

Coalition of Arizona/New Mexico Counties for Stable Economic Growth v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service,
et al.,

 CIV 94-1058-MV. 



Habitat Characteristics 



The physical and biological habitat features essential to the conservation of the Mexican spotted owl, referred
to as the primary constituent elements, include those that support nesting, roosting, foraging, and dispersal.
These elements were determined from studies of Mexican spotted owl habitat, including habitat structure, habitat
use, and prey preferences, throughout the range of the owl.

The vegetative communities and structural attributes used by the Mexican spotted owl vary across its range. The vegetative
communities consist primarily of warm-temperate and cold-temperate forests, and, to a lesser extent, woodlands
and riparian deciduous forests. The mixed-conifer community appears to be most frequently used in portions of its
range (Skaggs and Raitt 1988; Ganey and Balda 1989). 
Mixed-conifer forests contain several species of overstory trees. The most common are white fir (

Abies concolor

), Douglas fir (

Pseudotsuga menziesii

), and ponderosa pine (

Pinus ponderosa

). Less common species are southwestern white pine (

P. strobiformis

), limber pine (

P. flexilis

), aspen (

Populus tremuloides

), and corkbark fir (

Abies lasiocarpa 

var.

 arizonica

). 
The understory within mixed-conifer communities provides important roosting sites for Mexican spotted owls. The
understory usually contains the same conifer species found in the overstory, with Gambel oak (

Quercus gambelii

), maples (

Acer grandidentatum 

and

 A. glabrum

), and New Mexico locust (

Robinia neomexicana

) also present. Montane riparian canyon bottoms used by owls in the mixed-conifer zone may contain box elder (

Acer negundo

), narrowleaf cottonwood (

Populus angustifolia

), maples (

Acer 

spp.), and alders (

Alnus 

spp.). 
In southeastern Arizona, owl habitat types include mixed-conifer and Madrean Evergreen Forest and Woodland (Ganey
and Balda 1989; Duncan and Taiz 1992). Below the mixed-conifer vegetative zone are found two series of Madrean Evergreen
Woodland: the upper oak-pine occurs at 1,675 to 2,200 meters (5,500 to 7,200 feet), and the lower evergreen oak (encinal)
occurs at 1,525 to 1,980 meters (5,000 to 6,500 feet). Within these vegetative zones, and particularly at lower elevations,
Mexican spotted owls are usually found in steep, forested canyons with rocky cliffs. 
At the northern edge of their range in northeastern Arizona, southwestern Colorado, and southern Utah, Mexican spotted
owls occur during the breeding season between 1,340 and 2,160 meters (4,400 to 7,100 feet) in canyon habitats within
pinyon-juniper woodland (

Pinus edulis 

and

 Juniperus osteosperma

) or mixed-conifer forests. Canyon habitat is characterized by the cool, humid conditions found in the deep, steep-walled,
fractured structures of sandstone slickrock. Canyons frequently contain riparian and conifer pockets, and adjacent
slopes and mesa tops are vegetated by a variety of plant associations. Although no studies have been completed, preliminary
studies show most Mexican spotted owl activity during the breeding season occuring within and adjacent to canyons.
Owls roost in the riparian and coniferous pockets of canyon bottoms, on ledges, or in cavities in the slickrock canyon
walls (Guti&eacute;rrez and Rinkevich 1991; van Riper and Willey 1992). 
Characteristics associated with forested Mexican spotted owl habitat usually develop with increasing forest age,
but their occurrence may vary by location, past forest management practices, forest type, and productivity. Although
Mexican spotted owl habitat is variable over its range, some general attributes are common to the subspecies' life-history
requirements throughout its range. The attributes of nesting and roosting habitat typically include a moderate
to high canopy closure (60 to 80 percent); a multi-layered canopy with large overstory trees of various species; a
high incidence of large trees with various deformities (e.g., large cavities, broken tops, mistletoe infections,
and other evidence of decadence); large snags; accumulations of fallen trees and other woody debris on the ground;
and sufficient open space below the canopy for owls to fly. 
Forest habitat characteristics are best expressed in older mixed-conifer forests. These characteristics may also
develop in younger stands, especially when the stands contain remnant large trees or patches of large trees from earlier
stands. Certain forest management practices may also enhance tree growth and mature stand characteristics where
the older, larger trees are allowed to persist. Ganey and Balda (1988) found an average of 402 ha (995 acres) of old-growth
forest within the 847 ha (2,092 acre) average home range for 3 pairs of radio-monitored owls in northern Arizona. Fletcher
(1990) reported an average of 62 ha (154 acres) of old-growth forest and an average of 465 ha (1,149 acres) of suitable
habitat within the management territories established by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) for 359 Mexican spotted
owl sites in Arizona and New Mexico. Mexican spotted owl use of old growth may vary greatly among regional habitat types,
forest types, and elevational ranges.

Forest habitat required for Mexican spotted owl nesting and roosting appears to be more restricted than that required
for foraging. Ganey and Balda (1994) found significant owl selectivity in habitat use in a comparison of the habitat
characteristics of roosting, foraging, and randomly available sites. Roosting sites had larger logs, greater canopy
cover, and higher densities and basal areas of both trees and snags than foraging sites and random sites. 

Spotted owls apparently use a wider array of habitat types for foraging than for nesting and roosting, including fairly
open and non-contiguous forest, small openings, pure ponderosa pine forests, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Use of
these components may be determined by their availability and by their proximity to the more characteristic habitat
attributes previously described. However, Ganey and Balda (1994) found a greater selectivity in habitat used for
foraging than for random sample sites. As did roosting sites, foraging areas had larger logs, greater canopy cover,
and higher densities and basal areas of both trees and snags than random sites. Owls also consistently avoided foraging
in forests in which the overstory had been partially harvested. 
Little is known about the habitat requirements for dispersal. Habitat that meets the species' needs for nesting and
roosting may also provide for foraging and dispersal. However, habitat that supports foraging or dispersal does
not always provide constituent elements required for nesting and roosting. The definition of the term ``dispersal''
is frequently limited to post-fledging movements of juveniles. For the purposes of this rule, the Service considers
the term to include all movement, including winter shifts in territory and dispersal from natal areas, and to encompass
the important biological concepts of connectivity within and between clusters of Mexican spotted owl territories.
Although habitat that allows for dispersal may be marginal or unsuitable for nesting or roosting, it provides connectivity
between blocks of nesting habitat both locally and over the Mexican spotted owl's range that is essential to demographic
interaction and genetic flow. Thus, dispersal habitat includes unoccupied habitat of varying quality that may support
intermittent use as a ``stepping stone'' between occupied areas. 

Mexican spotted owls occur in relatively isolated mountain ranges, often separated by wide expanses of Sonoran,
Chihuahuan, and Great Basin desert and other nonforested lands. Preliminary studies of juvenile owl dispersal in
southern Utah (Willey 1993) and New Mexico (Peter Stacey, University of Nevada, Reno, 

in litt., 

1993) have shown movements across a wide variety of habitat types, including both riparian areas and vegetation types
considered too open for consistent use by Mexican spotted owls. In Southern Arizona, spotted owls occur in isolated
clusters separated by desert habitat. It is probable that these small clusters are not self-sustaining, but depend
on immigration from other areas to maintain demographic and genetic viability. 

The results of a 3-year telemetry study of owls and habitat in southern Utah indicate seasonal shifts in habitat use
(van Riper and Willey 1992, Willey 1993). During the breeding season, about 25 percent of adult owl locations occurred
outside of steep canyon terrain. During the fall and winter seasons, about half of the locations occurred on mesa-tops,
benches, and warm slopes above the canyons. Movement out of the relatively cool canyons used in summer months to warmer
areas used in winter may be related to the thermoregulatory requirements of the species. Movements out of the summer
home ranges during the winter season were highly variable. A few owls moved completely out of their summer ranges,
several shifted into adjacent areas with some overlap of seasonal ranges, and others remained within the same area
year round. 


Current Situation 



Federal, State, tribal, and private lands contain habitat for the owl. Federal agencies involved include the Forest
Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Department
of Defense. Tribes include the Navajo, San Carlos Apache, White Mountain Apache, Southern Ute, Jicarilla Apache,
Hualapai, and the Mescalero Apache. Efforts to estimate habitat acreage and survey effort for owls have varied among
agencies and tribes, with the most intensive work being done by the Forest Service. 
Currently, land-managing agencies characterize Mexican spotted owl habitat under the term ``suitable.'' Suitable
habitat is often identified only as habitat able to sustain the combined nesting, roosting, and foraging needs of
the Mexican spotted owl. The definition often excludes additional habitat used only for foraging and may underestimate
the total habitat available within an owl territory and across the species' range. 
Forest Service land in Arizona and New Mexico contains 1,267,000 ha (3,130,000 acres) of suitable habitat, with an
additional 421,000 ha (1,040,000 acres) described as being capable of returning to suitable condition (L. Henson,
Southwest Regional Forester, 

in litt., 

1993). Forest Service land in Colorado is estimated to have about 356,000 ha (880,000 acres) of forested suitable
habitat. Recent estimates of suitable canyon habitat in Utah national forests is about 58,000 ha (143,000 acres)
(Kate Grandison, Dixie National Forest, 

in litt., 

1994). No capable acreage figure is available for Utah and Colorado. Combining all Forest Service suitable habitat
with the capable habitat in the Southwest Region (Arizona and New Mexico) yields a total of habitat acreage of 2,102,000
ha (5,193,000 acres) on Forest Service lands in the four-State area. 
The Forest Service began Mexican spotted owl inventories in New Mexico and Arizona in 1988. Inventories began in Colorado
in 1989, and in Utah in 1990. About 1,012,000 ha (2,500,000 acres) had been inventoried in the Forest Service Southwest
Region as of the end of the 1993 survey season (USFS 1993). Utah and Colorado national forests have inventoried 354,000
ha (875,000 acres) and about 202,000 ha (500,000 acres), respectively (K. Grandison, 

in litt., 

1994).

The Southwestern Region of the Forest Service establishes areas around known owl locations, called management territories
(MTs). Each MT represents the occurrence of either a single owl or pair of owls, and is based on either confirmed nest
or roost locations, or nighttime calling responses. Forest Service inventories through 1993 resulted in the establishment
of 740 MTs in Arizona and New Mexico (Heather Hollis, Forest Service Southwest Regional Office, pers. comm., 1994).
Four MTs have been established from the six sites with owl detection records in Utah (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994).
No MTs have been established for the six owl sites in Colorado (John Verner, Pike/San Isabel National Forests, pers.
comm., 1994). 
There is potentially up to 435,000 ha (1,075,000 acres) of Mexican spotted owl habitat on Indian reservations. The
actual amount of habitat may be lower because estimates supplied by the BIA Forestry Division were developed from
timber-type maps containing little information about understory conditions or slope. The estimates may also omit
minimally forested or nonforested canyon habitat acreage. Information available to the Service on owl survey efforts
on Indian lands is as follows:




 The White Mountain Apache Tribe's Mexican spotted owl conservation plan states that approximately 54 owl
sites have been located on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation; 

 Owl surveys on the Navajo Reservation have resulted in the confirmation of owls at 26 sites (13 pairs and 13 singles)
(John Nysted, Navajo Fish and Wildlife Department, pers. comm., 1994); 
 The Jicarilla and the Hualapai wildlife departments conducted owl surveys in 1993; however, no owls were detected;
and 
 Current owl records exist for the San Carlos and Mescalero Apache Reservations, but only limited information
is available on population estimates.

 

A total of 297,000 ha (734,000 acres) of potential owl habitat occurs on BLM lands in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New
Mexico (BLM, Colorado State Office, 

in litt. 

1990; BLM, Utah State Office, 

in litt. 

1990; BLM, New Mexico State Office, 

in litt. 

1990; Ted Cordery, Arizona BLM, pers. comm., 1992). In 1993, a total of 25 owl records were known from BLM lands. There
were 15 locations in Utah, 7 locations in Colorado, and 1 location in New Mexico. There are several historical records
and two current records for sites on BLM lands in Arizona. 
Most Mexican spotted owl habitat in national parks and monuments consists of minimally forested, steep, shaded canyons
in the northern part of the owl's range. It is difficult to estimate acreage for this type of habitat. The NPS estimated
that 23 parks and monuments in the Southwest contained between 96,000 and 177,000 ha (238,000 to 438,000 acres) of
Mexican spotted owl habitat (NPS, Southwest Region, 

in litt. 

1990; NPS, Rocky Mountain Region, 

in litt. 

1990; J. Ray, NPS, Grand Canyon National Park, pers. comm., 1990). As of 1993, the NPS had records of a total of 32 sites
in Utah and 2 sites in Colorado. 
Between 72,000 and 82,000 ha (177,000 to 202,000 acres) of New Mexico and Arizona State lands contain forests and canyons
that could be suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat. Several historical and recent records exist for New Mexico State
lands. In Arizona, surveys conducted by the Arizona State Land Department and the Coconino National Forest resulted
in the establishment of three MTs on Forest Service land. No information was available on suitable Mexican spotted
owl habitat on State lands in Utah and Colorado. However, a single owl was recorded on Utah State lands in 1992. 
Private lands in Arizona and New Mexico are currently estimated to contain up to 53,000 ha (130,000 acres) of owl habitat
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). No estimates exist for owl habitat acreage on private lands in Colorado and
Utah. This is partly due to the difficulty in assessing the extent of existing canyon habitat in the Colorado Plateau
physiographic province, and partly a result of the insufficient amount of owl surveys accomplished to accurately
determine the limit of the species' range.

The land-managing agencies and tribes estimate a total of 3,100,000 ha (7,666,000 acres) of suitable Mexican spotted
owl habitat within the United States. These estimates of habitat availability for nesting and roosting activity
are derived from median figures where estimates were given as an acreage range and include capable habitat estimates
where available. The approximate proportion of Mexican spotted owl habitat in the Southwest is: Forest Service,
68 percent; Tribal, 14 percent; BLM, 10 percent; NPS, 4 percent; the States of Arizona and New Mexico, 2 percent; and
private lands, 2 percent. 
The percentage of habitat for each category of ownership is considered fairly accurate. However, the total acreage
of owl habitat is likely overestimated. The error is a consequence of inadequate information on land status and questions
about the types of vegetative communities that provide owl habitat. Several agencies expressed uncertainty about
the accuracy of their habitat estimates. 
The Service estimates that there is approximately 2,425,000 ha (5,988,000 acres) of owl habitat suitable for nesting
and roosting. This estimate excludes most of the ponderosa pine community type because this vegetation type is not
significantly used by nesting and roosting Mexican spotted owls. However, the Forest Service does consider ponderosa
pine forest to be suitable habitat when it has the correct structural attributes (K.W. Fletcher, Forest Service Southwest
Region, pers. comm., 1992), but the forest stand maps and inventory databases do not separate suitable from unsuitable
stands in ponderosa pine. Forest Service Mexican spotted owl inventory data place approximately 50 MTs in ponderosa
pine habitat, which would add about 40,000 ha (100,000 acres) to the suitable habitat base in Arizona and New Mexico
(Forest Service, 

in litt. 

1992). 


Definition of Critical Habitat 


The Service is required to base critical habitat proposals upon the best scientific and commercial data available
and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular
area as critical habitat. The Service may exclude areas from critical habitat designation when the benefits of exclusion
outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat, provided the exclusion will not result in the
extinction of the species (Section 4(b)(2) of the Act). 
Critical habitat is defined in Section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied
by a species . . . on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation
of the species, and (II) that may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas
outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed . . . upon a determination
by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,''
as defined in Section 3(3) of the Act, means ``. . . to use and the use of all methods and procedures which
are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant
to this Act are no longer necessary,'' i.e., the species is recovered and can be removed from the list of endangered
and threatened species. 


Role in Species Conservation 


Proposed designation of critical habitat includes areas subject to commercial timber harvest, the primary threat
to the species. The Service considers the protections that result from the listing of the species as threatened, such
as the jeopardy prohibition under section 7 and the prohibition of take under section 9 of the Act, to be adequate protection
in areas where other, localized threats may be present. 
The use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should
identify lands that may be needed for a species' eventual recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat
is proposed or designated at the time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know precisely what may be
needed for recovery. In this regard, critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery.
The Service is continuing to work with the Recovery Team to determine those areas and management approaches considered
necessary for the recovery and conservation of the species.

The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to recovery, but, through regulations under section
7 of the Act, may assist the Service and all Federal agencies in contributing toward the species' conservation. Critical
habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary
constituent elements), regardless of whether they are currently occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the
public and land-managing agencies to the importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical habitat
also identifies areas that may require special management considerations or protection, and provides additional
protection to areas where significant threats to the species have been identified. Critical habitat receives protection
from destruction or adverse modification through required consultation under section 7 of the Act with regard to
actions carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal agency. Section 7 also requires conferences on Federal actions
that are likely to result in the adverse modification or destruction of proposed critical habitat. Aside from the
added protection provided under section 7, the Act does not provide other forms of protection to lands designated
as critical habitat. 
Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan for a listed species. Designation does not establish
numerical population goals, prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside of critical habitat), nor
does it have a direct effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management recommendations for
critical habitat are most appropriately addressed in recovery plans, management plans, and through section 7 consultation.

Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the conservation of a species. Areas not currently containing
all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may also be essential for the long-term
recovery of the species, particularly in certain portions of its range, and may be designated as critical habitat.
However, not all areas containing the features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to a species'
survival. Areas not included within critical habitat boundaries that contain one or more of the primary constituent
elements are still important to a species' conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act, and other
conservation laws and regulations. 
The steps used to determine proposed critical habitat are summarized in the following sections on Primary Constituent
Elements, and Criteria for Identifying Candidate Critical Habitat Units. 


Primary Constituent Elements 


In determining which areas to propose as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological attributes
that are essential to a species' conservation and which may require special management considerations or protection
(section 3(5)(A)(i), of the Act). Such physical and biological attributes are described in 50 CFR 424.12. They include,
but are not limited to, the following: 



 Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; 
 Food, water, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; 
 Cover or shelter; 
 Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing of offspring; and 
 Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological
distributions of a species. 
The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl are those areas that include, but
are not limited to, the habitat components which provide or which have the potential to provide for nesting, roosting,
foraging, or dispersal. Forested habitats used for nesting and roosting are typically characterized as supporting
mature stand attributes including high canopy closure, multi-canopied structure, coniferous vegetation (sometimes
including a hardwood understory), large diameter trees, high densities of live trees, snags and large logs. Canyon
habitats for nesting and roosting are generally sparsely vegetated, steep-walled areas, often containing rock
outcrops and crevices. Nesting and roosting habitat also supports owl foraging activity; however, a wider array
of habitat attributes may be found in areas used solely for foraging and/or dispersal, including fairly open and non-contiguous
forest, small openings, woodlands, and rocky slopes. 
Areas of proposed critical habitat include both ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' forest habitat. Several definitions
of ``suitable'' are currently used by different land-managing agencies; however, the term ``suitable'' generally
refers to habitat that supports the combined activities of nesting, roosting, and foraging. In the Southwest, ``suitable''
habitat is often interpersed with ``unsuitable'' habitat that may be important for foraging. This critical habitat
proposal is not limited to habitat that meets ``suitable'' definitions, but includes habitat with any of the primary
constituent elements described above. 


Criteria for Identifying Candidate Critical Habitat Units 


The primary objective in proposing critical habitat is to identify existing and potential Mexican spotted owl habitat
considered essential for the conservation of the species, and in need of special management considerations or protection.
The Service has focused on available nesting and roosting habitat to identify locales that provide a nucleus for delineation
of critical habitat units. Additional habitat was added as needed to develop units based on the criteria described
below. In its proposal of critical habitat, the Service has considered all habitat types needed by the species through
its definition of the primary constituent elements. 
Using aerial photography, Mexican spotted owl habitat and forest type maps, and field verification, the Service
identified areas to be considered for designation as critical habitat. Because habitat maps available to the Service
were generally based on the varying definitions of ``suitable habitat'' used by the agencies, the major focus was
on habitat that provides nesting, roosting, and some foraging attributes. To assist in these determinations, the
Service relied upon the following principles developed by the Interagency Scientific Committee (Thomas 

et al.

 1990) for the northern spotted owl, and by others working in the field of conservation biology:



_Develop and maintain large contiguous blocks of habitat to support multiple reproducing pairs of owls; 
_Minimize fragmentation and edge effect to improve habitat quality; 
_Minimize distance to facilitate dispersal among blocks of breeding habitat; and

_Maintain range-wide distribution of habitat to facilitate recovery.

 

Several qualitative criteria were considered when determining whether to select specific areas as potential critical
habitat. The following discussion describes the criteria and provides an explanation of their use in selecting specific
areas. 
(1) 

Currently Suitable Habitat: 

The Service concentrated on the existence of currently suitable Mexican spotted owl forested habitat (primarily
nesting and roosting, but also foraging) that contains one or more of the primary constituent elements. The Service
evaluated the quality of existing habitat based on available habitat maps and delineated the best available habitat
(i.e., the least fragmented, most contiguous forest habitat) in the critical habitat units. 
(2) 

Large Contiguous Blocks of Habitat: 

The Service identified, where available, large, contiguous blocks of habitat or areas that mostly consist of Mexican
spotted owl habitat. Areas were selected so that critical habitat units would include as little low-quality habitat
as possible. 

(3) 

Dispersal Distances: 

The widely-spaced nature of most Mexican spotted owl territory clusters generally determined the distances between
proposed critical habitat units. However, where a unit was developed to provide additional unoccupied habitat to
enhance the probability of cluster persistence, units were oriented to minimize inter-unit distances and facilitate
potential dispersal. 
(4) 

Occupied Habitat: 

In evaluating potential critical habitat units, the Service gave primary consideration to habitat currently occupied
by pairs or resident singles; however, some unoccupied areas were selected if they were important for other reasons
(e.g., territory cluster contiguity and linkage). The Service may designate unoccupied areas when such areas are
essential for the conservation of the species (section 3(5)(A)(ii) of the Act). Some units were selected based on
habitat suitability although no surveys had yet been conducted. All areas selected, however, have potential for
supporting Mexican spotted owls. 
(5) 

Rangewide Distribution: 

The Service is proposing critical habitat units throughout the existing United States range of the Mexican spotted
owl to maintain genetic variation and cluster linkage. 
(6) 

Special Management or Protection: 

Section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act defines critical habitat as areas ``which may require special management considerations
or protection.'' The Service evaluated the need for special management in terms of the existing situation (e.g.,
current quality of existing habitat), the relative importance of territory clusters, or current management activities,
and threats. For example, the Fort Apache Indian Reservation is managed under an uneven-age timber harvest prescription,
unlike the even-age management cited as a threat to the Mexican spotted owl. The White Mountain Apache Tribe has developed
a conservation strategy that the Service believes will adequately protect the Mexican spotted owl on the Fort Apache
Indian Reservation. Thus, the Service has determined that additional special management consideration or protection
is not needed, and the area is not proposed as critical habitat. All other areas selected are included in this proposal
because of their need for special management or protection. However, the Forest Service and other Indian tribes have
begun work with the Service to develop and implement conservation agreements or management plans to conduct timber
harvests while providing adequate protection to the owl and its habitat. 
In addition, the Service evaluated the adequacy of existing protection under the Act to determine whether critical
habitat would provide a necessary incremental benefit to the species. For example, significant protection already
exists under section 7 of the Act, such as the prohibition of jeopardy to the species, the minimization of project impacts
through mandatory reasonable and prudent measures to minimize incidental take, etc. The Service considers commercial
timber harvest to be the primary threat to the Mexican spotted owl, and thus identified areas (proposed critical habitat
units) where commercial timber harvest is planned or authorized. In those areas, the designation of critical habitat
can provide protection above the current protection under the Act by protecting unoccupied habitat. It is important
to note, however, that other areas are essential to the species' recovery, and their exclusion from proposed critical
habitat designation does not imply otherwise. Although other threats to Mexican spotted owls have been mentioned,
such as oil and gas leasing, grazing, recreation, etc., the Service has been unable to find evidence that these threats
are significant to the Mexican spotted owl population as a whole. Rather, these activities are best dealt with through
section 7 consultation on the species. 
(7) 

Adequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms: 

The Service considered the existing legal status of areas (i.e., reserved areas such as wilderness or parks) and has
not proposed reserved areas as critical habitat. In general, the current classification of wilderness areas and
parks provides adequate protection against potential habitat-altering activities because they are primarily
managed as natural ecosystems. These lands are often essential to the conservation of the species, as they provide
important links and contain large areas of habitat in relatively pristine condition. However, these lands by themselves
do not provide adequate habitat to support a viable range-wide Mexican spotted owl population. The Service considered
their relative contribution to the Mexican spotted owl's conservation but generally did not include them in critical
habitat because of their current classification unless they were inclusions within larger surrounding critical
habitat units. 


Proposed Critical Habitat Designation 


The Service has identified 112 proposed critical habitat units totaling 1,931,264 ha (4,770,223 acres) in Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The approximate acreage of proposed critical habitat by land ownership is shown in
Table 1. 


Management Considerations 


Forest Practices 


Management direction for lands with Mexican spotted owl habitat varies within and between Tribal governments and
Federal and State agencies. A management emphasis for timber production is in effect on much of Forest Service and
tribally managed land. Some BLM Mexican spotted owl habitat is managed primarily for natural resources extraction,
including timber, but is still available for wildlife and recreation. National Park Service lands are managed for
recreation and preservation of natural values. State lands within owl habitat are typically checkerboarded with
Federal lands and are usually not large enough to support owl territories of their own. State lands are managed with
similar resource management emphases as BLM land. Management emphasis on private lands providing Mexican spotted
owl habitat is unknown.

Although the Forest Service is undergoing a process to change its dominant silvicultural practices to uneven age
systems, its current management plans call for harvestable timberland in Arizona and New Mexico to be primarily managed
under an even-aged system using shelterwood management. Commercial forests on the Navajo Indian Reservation have
also been managed under shelterwood prescriptions (James Carter, BIA, pers. comm., 1990). Other commercial forests
on Indian lands in the Southwest are managed primarily as uneven-aged stands by use of selective logging. Under the
shelterwood system, a stand is scheduled for a series of harvests culminating in a full rotation cycle in 120 years
or less. This cycle length maximizes timber production, but does not provide enough time for stands to reach the mature
to old-growth conditions characteristic of forested Mexican spotted owl habitat, and results in forest age distributions
unnaturally skewed toward younger stands. The conversion of complexly structured forest stands to evenaged stands
was identified by the Service (USFWS 1991, USFWS 1993) as the greatest threat facing the Mexican spotted owl. 
The Service has determined habitat loss trends from current National Forest plans, which provide the only available
projections on timber harvest trends into the future. Half of all shelterwood management on National Forests is occurring
in forests not suitable for breeding (primarily pure ponderosa pine), and the other half in suitable forest habitat.
The Forest Plans project that an estimated 0.4 percent of Mexican spotted owl habitat will be made unsuitable for breeding
each year in the future if timber extraction continues as outlined under current forest plans. 
Uneven-aged management like that employed by the White Mountain Apache Tribe maintains and promotes development
of complex forest structures. Methods include individual tree selection and group selection. Individual tree selection
entails the harvest of trees selected from a size-distribution curve appropriate for forest type, site conditions,
and desired regeneration levels. Trees of various size and age classes are retained, and multi-storied attributes
and vertical diversity are maintained. Group selection creates openings in the forest stand up to a hectare (1 to 2
acres) in size, developing small even-aged clumps of trees and within-stand horizontal diversity. The Service considers
the use of uneven-age management the silvicultural method most compatible with maintenance of Mexican spotted owl
habitat.

The States of Arizona, Utah, and Colorado list the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species. Capture, handling,
transportation, and take of Mexican spotted owls are regulated by game laws and special licenses for live wildlife.
These State laws and licensing requirements regulate hunting, recreation, and scientific investigation. Habitat
protection is not provided through State laws and regulations. 
The Service is aware of Mexican spotted owl protection guidelines that have been developed by two Indian nations.
The guidelines for the Mescalero Apache Reservation establish a 29 ha (72 acre) buffer zone around active Mexican
spotted owl roost or nest sites. No management activities may occur within the buffer zone during the reproductive
season. After the reproductive season, the buffer is reduced to a 46-meter (150-foot) radius encompassing 0.66 ha
(1.6 acres) around significant roost areas and a 61-meter (200-foot) radius encompassing 1.17 ha (2.9 acres) around
nests. 
The Fort Apache Indian Reservation is managed under a conservation plan approved by the Tribal Council. This plan
designates two levels of owl protection. The first level protects clusters of owls and their intervening habitat,
and the second level focuses on individual owl sites. This management strategy is largely based on a landscape rather
than site-by-site approach. 
Most Federal agencies have policies to protect State-listed threatened or endangered species, and some agencies
also protect species that are candidates for Federal listing. For instance, the NPS Organic Act protects all wildlife
on national parks and monuments. However, general policies often do not include standards and guidelines to measure
policy success. 
Prior to listing, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) provided the only Federal protection for the Mexican spotted
owl. Under the provisions of the MBTA, it is unlawful to pursue, hunt, take, capture, or kill in any manner any migratory
bird unless permitted by regulations. Although the Mexican spotted owl typically remains in its summer range throughout
the year, it is included on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. 
An interagency agreement for purpose of ensuring population viability of the spotted owl (

Strix occidentalis

), including the Mexican spotted owl, was signed by the Service, BLM, NPS, and Forest Service on August 12, 1988 (U.S.
Department of Interior 1988). Under this agreement, each agency agreed to manage its lands to provide owl habitat,
to carry out habitat and population inventories sufficient to assess long-term trends, and to carry out research
activities sufficient to provide empirical information on the validity of planning assumptions. The degree to which
this agreement has been implemented has varied within and among agencies. 
Specific management policies for the Mexican spotted owl have been developed by the BLM in Colorado and New Mexico.
The policy in Colorado states, ``In areas with a confirmed nest or roost site, surface management activities will
be limited and will be determined on a case by case basis to allow as much flexibility as possible outside of the core
area.'' Management policy in New Mexico states that habitat core areas and territories of appropriate size will be
established and preserved wherever Mexican spotted owls are found. 

Detailed guidelines for Mexican spotted owl management have been developed by the Forest Service Southwest Region.
The guidelines were first issued as Mexican spotted owl Interim Directive (ID) No. 1 in June 1989, and reissued as Mexican
spotted owl ID No. 2 in June 1990. Utah and Colorado national forests adopted ID No. 2 in 1991. The guidelines expired
December 26, 1991, but the Forest Service is continuing to manage under ID No. 2. The IDs require establishment of a
Mexican spotted owl MT around each nest or roost site. Each MT (except those on the Gila and Lincoln National Forests)
has a core area of 182 ha (450 acres) and an overall size of 810 ha (2,000 acres). Activities within the core area are limited
to road construction. Within the MT, activities, including timber harvest, are limited to a maximum of 314 ha (775
acres). The intent of the guidelines is to retain at least 405 ha (1,000 acres) of suitable habitat within the MT after
proposed management activities are identified and located. Forest Service estimates indicate that suitable habitat
within MTs currently averages 466 ha (1,150 acres) for territories in New Mexico and Arizona. In Utah, MTs encompass
1,340 ha (3,350 acres) with a core of 350 ha (875 acres) (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994). 
Application of the IDs has not been uniform on all forests. Guidelines on two forests were modified. The core area was
reduced in size to 121 ha (300 acres) for the Lincoln National Forest under ID No. 1. Under ID No. 2, a core area of 182 ha
(450 acres) was established for all forests but the overall territory size was reduced to 607 ha (1,500 acres) for the
Lincoln and Gila National Forests. Both forests have significant Mexican spotted owl populations, which has resulted
in conflicts with timber harvest plans. The ID provides no protection for unoccupied suitable Mexican spotted owl
habitat, nor does it address forest activities not related to timber harvest.

The Service has examined spotted owl protective measures throughout the species' range. The management strategies
employed by various agencies and tribes have been developed independently without a common overall approach. These
strategies provide varying levels of protection to existing owl sites, but most do not conform to an overall, landscape
recovery strategy. In addition, there has been no assessment of the adequacy of these varied approaches in promoting
range-wide conservation of the Mexican spotted owl. Thus the Service has determined that the designation of critical
habitat in areas subject to timber harvest will help to preserve options until a long-term, range-wide management
strategy is developed and its implementation ensured. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Recovery Planning 


The Service appointed the Team in March 1993. Since that time the Team has assembled all available data on Mexican spotted
owl biology, the threats faced across the species' range, current protection afforded the species, etc. Using that
information, the Team developed the Draft Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan. Availability of that document will
be announced in the 

Federal Register

. 
The Draft Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan recommends a landscape management strategy that will conserve the species
as population and habitat trends are assessed. If made final, the recovery plan will guide management of this species
over the next 10-15 years. The Service will assess the value of critical habitat in implementing the recovery
plan, and that assessment may influence the final critical habitat rulemaking. 


Section 7 Consultation 


Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation to designate critical habitat, a brief description
and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by
such designation. Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat
as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival
and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying
any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 
Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely
to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies, and is in addition to,
the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued
existence of any listed species. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines
an action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse modification
of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate jeopardy
and incidental take of the species. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act
are found at 50 CFR 402. 


Conference on Current Activities 


Section 7(a)(4) of the Act and 50 CFR 402.10 of the regulations require Federal agencies to confer with the Service
on any action that is likely to result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. The Act
requires Federal agencies to reinitiate consultation on previously reviewed actions should conditions change
(e.g., if the Service designates critical habitat); consequently, some Federal agencies may request conference
with the Service on actions for which formal consultation has been completed. Conference reports provide conservation
recommendations to assist the agency in eliminating conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action. The conservation
recommendations in a conference report are advisory. 
If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, the Service may issue a formal conference report. Formal conference
reports on proposed critical habitat contain a biological opinion that is prepared according to 50 CFR 402.14, as
if critical habitat were designated. The Service may adopt the formal conference report as the biological opinion
when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information or changes in the action alter the content
of the opinion (see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).

Examples of Proposed Actions 


Areas which contain habitat used by the owl during its life cycle support a number of existing, proposed, and potential
activities. Commercial activities that may affect Mexican spotted owl critical habitat include timber harvest,
timber salvage harvest, other wood fiber utilization (e.g., paper, firewood), snag removal, construction of hydroelectric
facilities, and construction of ski areas and resort facilities. Additional activities include ``personal use''
commodity production, such as fuelwood gathering and Christmas tree cutting. Activities associated with land management
by involved agencies include campground and road construction, certain fire suppression activities such as fire
break construction and use of chemical fire retardants; silvicultural activities such as forest pest management
and stocking control; and military maneuvers. The Service recognizes that these activities may affect individual
owls and portions of their habitat. However, the Service has identified the timber management program as the activity
that constitutes the most significant threat to the survival of the species because of its scope across the landscape,
and because it is the predominant threat to habitat in the areas with the largest owl populations. The Service believes
that where there are other activities section 7 consultations on effects of projects to the species and other regulatory
mechanisms provide adequate protection. 
In evaluating proposed activities within critical habitat through section 7 analyses, the Service uses project
descriptions and biological assessments provided by the action agency, and focuses on the likely impacts of a project
on the constituent elements of the site and surrounding areas. The Federal agencies requesting consultation can
assist the Service in its evaluation of proposed actions by providing detailed information on the habitat configuration
of a project area, habitat conditions of surrounding areas, and information on known locations of Mexican spotted
owls. 
Proposed actions would be individually examined in terms of site-specific impacts to the primary constituent elements
and the reasons for which the critical habitat unit was designated. Certain proposed actions, such as the selective
harvest or commercial thinning of timber stands, may or may not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat, depending
on the type and extent of harvest and the pre-project condition of the site in relation to Mexican spotted owl habitat
needs. Activities that disturb, remove, or retard the development of the primary constituent elements within designated
critical habitat units may adversely modify the Mexican spotted owl's critical habitat. These activities may include,
but are not limited to, actions that would significantly reduce the canopy closure of a timber stand, modify multi-canopy
stand structure, significantly reduce the stand's average tree diameter, significantly alter tree size and age
class distribution and species composition, reduce the availability of nesting structures and sites, reduce the
suitability of the landscape to provide for safe movement, or reduce the abundance or availability of prey species.

In addition to site-specific analysis, Service evaluation of proposed Federal actions would also consider the additive
effects of past, on-going, and proposed actions. Proposed projects within critical habitat would also be examined
spatially to determine adverse modification of habitat across the surrounding landscape. The additive effects
of actions in proximity to the proposed project may collectively result in the appreciable reduction of the value
of a critical habitat unit. Conversely, an isolated proposed action within a spacious expanse of unmodified habitat
may not adversely affect the function for which a critical habitat unit was designed. 
An activity cannot cause adverse modification of critical habitat in an area that does not contain or have the potential
to contain the physical and biological features comprising the primary constituent elements. Due to limitations
in the fineness of the mapping effort, and the interspersed nature of suitable and unsuitable habitat types, some
such areas have been incidentally included in the proposed designation as inclusions within surrounding Mexican
spotted owl habitat. Furthermore, some activities may not be restricted due to critical habitat designation because
there would be no effect on the primary constituent elements. However, Federal projects that do not adversely modify
critical habitat may still affect Mexican spotted owls (e.g., through disturbance) and, therefore, may be subject
to review under section 7 of the Act. 
Some activities may be considered to be of benefit to Mexican spotted owl habitat and, therefore, would not be expected
to adversely modify critical habitat. Examples of activities that could benefit critical habitat may include some
protective measures such as fire suppression, prescribed burning, brush control, snag creation, and certain silvicultural
activities such as thinning. 


Other Conservation Measures 


Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and non-intentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners
regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat. The term ``take'', as defined by the Act, means
to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.
``Incidental take'' is take that results from, but is not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity.

<TEXT>
 

Section 7 and section 10(a)(1)(B) authorize the Service to allow the incidental taking of listed species through
otherwise lawful activities such as timber harvesting. Biological opinions completed as part of formal section
7 consultation may authorize a set amount of incidental take associated with Federal activities. For non-Federal
actions, Section 10 incidental take permit applications must be supported by a habitat conservation plan that identifies
conservation measures that the permittee agrees to implement to conserve the species, usually on the permittee's
lands. A key element of the Service's review of a conservation plan is a determination of the plan's effect upon the
long-term conservation of the species. A conservation plan would be approved and a section 10(a) permit issued if
it would minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking and would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival
and recovery of that species in the wild. 
The Service expects limited Federal involvement for projects on non-Federal lands and few formal section 7 consultations
on non-Federal lands that are included in proposed critical habitat. For those areas of non-Federal land within proposed
critical habitat, section 7 would apply only for actions that are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency.
The States and private individuals are still subject to the ``take'' prohibitions under section 9 of the Act, however,
and may enter into the section 10 conservation planning process where appropriate. 


Economic Analysis 


Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific and
commercial information available and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of designating a particular
area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat upon a determination that the benefits
of such exclusions outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of critical habitat. The exclusion of such
areas from critical habitat may not occur when it is determined such exclusion may result in the extinction of the species
concerned. An economic analysis is currently being prepared. The Service intends to make the economic analysis available
for public review and comment, and notice of its availability will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and local newspapers. 


Public Comments Solicited 


The Service intends that any final rule resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, governmental agencies, Indian nations, the scientific community,
industry, and any other interested parties concerning this proposed rule are hereby sought. Comments are particularly
sought concerning: 
(1) The reasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of
the Act; 
(2) Specific information on the amount and distribution of Mexican spotted owl habitat, and the number of owls and
distribution by landowner and land designation; 
(3) Specific information on the ability or values of proposed areas to support other listed, proposed, or candidate
species and the relation of this proposal to maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; 
(4) Current or planned activities in the subject areas and their possible impacts on proposed critical habitat; 
(5) Any foreseeable economic or other impacts resulting from the proposed designation of critical habitat;

(6) Economic values associated with benefits of designating critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl. Such benefits
include those derived from non-consumptive uses, e.g., hiking, camping, bird-watching; enhanced watershed protection;
improved air quality; increased soil retention; ``existence values'', and reductions in administrative costs;
and 
(7) The methodology the Service might use, under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, in determining if the benefits of excluding
an area from critical habitat outweigh the benefits of specifying the area as critical habitat. 
Comments received during the 60-day comment period on this proposed rule will be considered during preparation of
a final rulemaking. The final decision on the designation of critical habitat will take into consideration the comments
and any additional information received by the Service. 


Public Hearings 


Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested within 45 days of the date
of publication of the proposal. As indicated under 

DATES

, the Service will schedule public hearings on this proposal due to the anticipated number of requests for such hearings.

Parties wishing to make statements for the record should bring copies of their statements to the hearing. Oral statements
may be limited in length, if necessary. There are no limits to the length of a written statement presented at the hearing
or subsequently submitted for the record. Written comments will be accepted from any party until the close of the comment
period (see 

DATES

). Written submissions will be given the same weight and consideration as oral comments presented at any hearing.



National Environmental Policy Act 


The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Act.
A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). 


Required Determinations 


This document has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Based on the information
discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within proposed critical habitat areas,
it is not clear whether significant economic impacts will result from the critical habitat designation. There are
a limited number of actions on private lands that have Federal involvement through funds or permits that may be affected
by critical habitat designation. A final determination of the impacts of the proposal is not possible until the required
economic analysis is completed. The final rule will contain determinations of the effects of the proposed actions
in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs,
information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this proposed designation.
Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
