Upper Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Strategy, States of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada 



AGENCIES: 

Forest Service, USDA; Bureau of Land Management, USDI. 




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) and conduct planning activity which may amend
Forest Service Regional Guides and will amend Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land use plans. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) propose to develop a scientifically sound, ecosystem-based
strategy for management of the lands under their jurisdiction in the Upper Columbia River Basin (UCRB) in Idaho, Montana,
Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, and a small part of Washington that is administered by Region 1 of the Forest Service. This strategy
will modify existing land use plans. The modification will include a coordinated ecosystem management strategy
for National Forest System and BLM public lands. This strategy will be consistent with the ``Framework for Ecosystem
Management in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' that is being completed by the Scientific Integration Team of the
Eastside Ecosystem Management Project. The EIS that will accompany this strategy will use the information from the
``Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' and information received
from the public as a basis for issue determination and for evaluating alternative strategies. Additional information
may be collected as necessary. 



The strategy will be adopted in the form of decisions about desired ranges of future conditions for ecosystems, and
related standards and guidelines for management of National Forest System and BLM public lands on all or parts of the
UCRB. The EIS will consider alternative strategies for management of National Forest System and BLM-administered
lands and their effects in the entire UCRB. At a minimum: 

A. The strategy will include direction which will protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems within the range of threatened
or endangered anadromous fish through amendments to Forest Plans and Resource Management Plans. This direction
will supersede any interim direction resulting from the Environmental Assessment for the Implementation of Interim
Strategies for Managing Anadromous Fish-producing Watersheds in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, and Portions
of California (commonly referred to as ``PACFISH''). 

B. The strategy also will include other necessary guidance applicable to the Basin as a whole, or to broad subregions
within the basin. This guidance will address forest ecosystem health; rangeland ecosystem health; aquatic and riparian
ecosystem health; integration of social and economic considerations; population viability; and the long-term
sustainability of threatened, endangered, and sensitive species. The guidance also will be developed by examining
other issues identified by the public through the scoping process. This guidance will be adopted as amendments to
the Forest Service Regional Guides for Regions 1 and 4 and/or amendments to Forest Service and BLM land use plans. 

C. The third part of the strategy may identify changes to the ways current plans are implemented or budgets developed,
that can improve capability to achieve ecosystem management objectives. The strategy may also help establish priorities
for revising forest plans and developing or amending resource management plans. This part of the strategy does not
require environmental analysis, but may be addressed within the scope of this EIS. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The purpose of this action is to develop and analyze a scientifically sound, ecosystem-based strategy for management
of lands administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service and the United States
Department of the Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management that are in the UCRB in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah,
and Nevada and that portion of Washington administered by the Forest Service's Northern Region. The strategy will
focus on ecosystem health, including its forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian, landscape, and social/economic
components, with emphasis on population viability and the sustainability of threatened, endangered, and sensitive
species.

The EIS team will prepare a proposed action that responds to problems described in the statement of purpose and need.
Formal scoping meetings will follow the development of the proposed action. The purpose and need statement and proposed
action will serve to focus formal scoping meetings by giving the public a better understanding of the agencies' early
thoughts about, or initial approximations of, what the UCRB ecosystem strategy might be. The theme of the proposed
action will be the restoration of ecological resiliency in forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian ecosystems
within the UCRB. (Aldo Leopold, in his essay The Land Ethic, defines the health of the land as ``the capacity of the land
for self-renewal.'' We speak of ecological resiliency as the capacity of an ecosystem, including its physical, biological
and human components, for self-renewal. We do not imply that all human wants will be satisfied by a resilient ecosystem.)
Alternatives to the proposed action will be developed largely in response to public comments on the proposed action
in formal scoping meetings. 

This EIS will address all BLM lands within the Columbia River Basin east of Oregon and Washington and all National Forest
System lands in the Columbia River Basin within the agency's Northern and Intermountain administrative Regions.
(This includes National Forest System and BLM public lands in all of Idaho except the southeast corner that drains
into the Great Basin. It also includes the portion of the Panhandle National Forest in Washington, that portion of
Montana west of the Continental Divide, a small portion of west-central Wyoming, the north-west corner of Utah, and
the northeastern corner of Nevada.) The selected alternative may result in amendment to the Forest Service Regional
Guides for the Northern and Intermountain Regions and amendment of the land use plans for the Forest Service and Bureau
of Land Management as follows: 

Forest Service: Boise, Bridger-Teton, Caribou, Challis, Humboldt, Payette, Salmon, Sawtooth, and Targhee National
Forests in the Intermountain Region; and Panhandle, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Kootenai, Lolo, Flathead, Helena, Deerlodge,
and Bitterroot National Forests in the Northern Region. 

Bureau of Land Management: Boise, Burley, Idaho Falls, Salmon, Shoshone, and Coeur d'Alene Districts in Idaho; Butte
District in Montana; Rock Springs District in Wyoming; Salt Lake District in Utah; and Elko and Winnemucca Districts
in Nevada. 

The BLM Challis Resource Area (Salmon District), Bennett Hills Resource Area (Shoshone District), and Owyhee Resource
Area (Boise District) now are preparing Resource Management Plans (RMPs) that are expected to incorporate ecosystem
management strategies. Similarly, the Targhee National Forest is revising its forest plan, and the Clearwater National
Forest expects to revise its forest plan. The schedule for the Clearwater forest plan revision process will be announced
at the time a notice of intent for that purpose is published. These five planning efforts will continue. The Challis,
Bennett Hills, and Owyhee RMPs are expected to be completed in 1995. The Targhee forest plan revision is expected to
be complete in 1996, and the Clearwater forest plan revision is expected to be completed sometime after the completion
of the UCRB EIS. To the extent possible, those planning efforts will be coordinated with development of the UCRB ecosystem
management strategy. The UCRB EIS may lead to a Record of Decision that amends one or more of those five plans following
completion of on-going planning efforts. If the UCRB EIS is completed prior to completion of any of these five on-going
efforts, adjustments may be made to on-going efforts to ensure consistency with the UCRB ecosystem management strategy.


BLM lands subject to potential plan amendments through the UCRB effort total approximately 14 million acres in five
states. The National Forest System lands subject to potential plan amendment total approximately 31.5 million acres.


Concurrent with this EIS, a basin-wide assessment known as the ``Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management
in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' is under development. (The ``interior Columbia River Basin'' has been defined
as the lands in the continental United States tributary to the Columbia River east of the crest of the Cascade Mountain
Range.) This Scientific Assessment will cover broad ecosystems, and describe social, economic, and biophysical
processes and functions. The natural resources within this broad geographic area have been altered over time by many
factors including drought, fire suppression, global climate change, livestock grazing, mining, timber harvest,
urbanization, and water uses. The results of the Scientific Assessment will be used, in part, to analyze the effects
of past management and present management under current land use plans as a baseline to help determine the need to change
management direction, and to determine the effects of different approaches to ecosystem management. 

The EIS will analyze a number of alternatives. One will be no action, defined as current land use plan direction without
modification of any decision resulting from the Environmental Assessment for the Implementation of Interim Strategies
for Managing Anadromous Fish-producing Watersheds in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, and Portions of California
(commonly referred to as the ``PACFISH'' strategy). Another will be current management direction as modified by
any decision issued as interim direction resulting from the ``PACFISH'' environmental assessment. As indicated,
further alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during the public scoping process as defined
in the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations to
identify a range of reasonable alternatives. 
Issues that are expected to be addressed in detail through the development and analysis of alternatives (in addition
to the management of anadromous fish habitat) include ecosystem health and its forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian
components with emphasis on population viability and long-term sustainability of threatened, endangered, and
sensitive species. The use of public lands and resources in the production of goods and services within the context
of sustainability will also be examined. The evaluation of these alternatives and others will consider people's
expectations for public lands and resources, along with the capability of the ecosystems to provide and sustain these
values through time. Information will be used from the basin-wide Scientific Assessment, Tribal governments, state
and local governments, other federal agencies, and other appropriate sources. 

The direction being developed through this process will serve as an ecosystem management strategy to move from current
conditions to more ecologically sustainable and socially desirable conditions, leaving options available for
future generations. The strategy will, at least, establish desired ranges of future conditions for broad forest,
rangeland, and aquatic/riparian habitat types and inter-related social, economic and landscape systems. Achievement
of desired ranges of future conditions by practices and activities developed and implemented at the national forest
and BLM district level, will result in restoration of ecosystem health and restoration of ecological processes that
maintain ecosystems over time. Ecosystem restoration to, and maintenance within, sustainable ranges by identifying
appropriate goals and objectives and management practices, can also help promote viability of associated social
and economic systems. The strategy will be based on integration of social values, ecological capabilities, and economic
relationships, and will recognize treaty rights reserved by various Native American Tribes on ceded lands and will
fulfill United States government trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The strategy will (1) assure habitat condition
needed to support species viability within the context of desired ecosystem function and structure; (2) address
the needs of species and habitats of concern (currently listed or being considered for listing under the Endangered
Species Act or designated as sensitive species by the Forest Service or BLM); (3) support the needs of dynamic ecosystems
that change over time and space; and (4) recognize the role that disturbance mechanisms play in the evolution and maintenance
of ecosystems. 

Scoping meetings are tentatively planned for Coeur d'Alene, Moscow, Orofino, Grangeville, McCall, Salmon, Challis,
Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Twin Falls, Ketchum, and Boise in Idaho; Missoula, Libby, Kalispell, Hamilton, Helena,
and Butte, in Montana; Jackson, Wyoming; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Elko, Nevada. Specific dates, times and locations
for the meetings will be announced in local newspapers of general distribution. 

The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service will act as joint lead agencies to prepare the EIS. The two agencies
will consult with Tribal Governments and coordinate with state and local governments and other federal agencies.
The Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service will be consulted pursuant to the Endangered
Species Act. 

The responsible officials for National Forest System lands will be the Regional Foresters for the:

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency in October, 1995, and will be available
for public review at that time. A public comment period of 90 days will be provided for the draft EIS.
The UCRB EIS Team (Team) believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EISs must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the
reviewer's position and contentions. [

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC,

 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978)]. Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not
raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. [

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980)]. Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the 90-day comment period on the draft EIS, so that substantive
comments and objections are made available to the Team at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in the final EIS. 

To assist the Team in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft
EIS should be as specific as possible. It also is helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft
statement. Comments also may address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and
discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
It is expected that the final EIS will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency approximately 6 months after
the draft EIS is published. The record of decision for National Forest System Lands will be issued with the final EIS
and will be subject to Forest Service appeal regulations (36 CFR 217). The BLM's proposed plan amendment decision
will be published with the final EIS and will be subject to BLM protest regulations (43 CFR 1610.5-2). The BLM's
record of decision will be published following resolution of any protests.

and Salmon-Challis National Forests; Boise, Custer, Idaho, Lemhi and Valley Counties, ID


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare Environmental Impact Statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document the analysis. It will disclose
the environmental impacts of proposed actions to develop goals and objectives, describe desired future condition(s),
establish indicators and standards, delineate management zones, develop management prescriptions and establish
monitoring requirements for the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, an area of 2,361,767 acres in Central
Idaho. This Wilderness contains both the Middle Fork and Main Salmon Wild Rivers and the Upper Selway Wild River.



The action will amend the existing Land and Resource Management Plans as part of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
This new management direction will apply to projects implemented after site-specific analysis has been conducted.
The coordinated management direction established by the Record of Decision for the Final Environmental Impact Statement
will be incorporated into all land and resource management plans within the administrative boundaries of the Frank
Church-River of No Return Wilderness.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This EIS will update the existing Management Plans and the Land and Resource Management (Forest) Plans that govern
the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness by developing goals and objectives, describing Desired Future Conditions,
selecting indicators of wilderness conditions, establishing standards for these indicators, identifying possible
management actions for sites where standards could be or are being exceeded, delineating management zones, developing
management prescriptions and establishing monitoring requirements for the Bitterroot, Boise, Nez Perce, Payette
and Salmon-Challis National Forests lands within this wilderness area.



Preliminary issues identified to date include:
 What effect will management decisions have on the Wilderness' ecological values and the preservation of natural
biodiversity?
 How will exotic plants and animals be managed?
 Will expanding exotic plant and animal populations significantly affect wilderness values?
 Will management actions have an effect on fish habitat, particularly salmon and steelhead trout?
 Will natural fire regimes and fire management practices be affected?
 Will wildlife species and their habitats be impacted by this action?
 How will existing mining claims be affected by this action?
 Will it be possible to establish long term baseline monitoring of the wilderness resource after implementation
of this decision?
 How will research be affected by this decision?
 What will be the effects of human waste and litter impacts?
 Will it be possible to minimize user impacts and reduce crowding to ensure a positive wilderness experience?
 How will recreational activities be managed to allow for use while minimizing impacts to the natural resource
and wilderness experience?
 How can the Wilderness' cultural and historical values be protected and maintained while at the same time be
share with the public?
 How will unique qualities and management policies of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, such
as authorized motorboats on the main Salmon River and established aircraft use, be effected by this decision?
 How can stock use be managed while minimizing impacts to the natural resource and wilderness experience?
 How will the decision affect consistency and uniformity in regulations, cooperation among Ranger Districts
and accountability in management?

 How can outfitters and guides be encouraged to perpetuate the wilderness resource and wilderness experience?
 How can the state and private inholders be encouraged to manage their lands in a manner compatible with the surrounding
Wilderness?
 How can trails and trailhead facilities be managed to provide access while minimizing impacts to the resource?
 Can river traffic be managed in an equitable manner that minimizes impacts to the river and the river experience?
 What is the appropriate amount, type and level of development and maintenance for adjacent roads and roadside
facilities?
 How should aircraft access be managed?
 What is the appropriate level of development and maintenance for airstrips?
The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action. The Forest Service invites written
comments and suggestions on the issues related to the proposal and the area being analyzed. Information received
will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS and Final EIS. For most effective use, comments on potential issues should
be submitted to the Forest Service within 45 days from the date of publication of this Notice in the 

Federal Register

. Neutrally facilitated public meetings will be held in Grangeville, McCall, Boise, Pocatello, and Salmon, Idaho,
and Hamilton, Montana, on December 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, 1994, respectively, for the purpose of identifying issues,
developing Desired Future Conditions and mapping potential management zones. A response card will be mailed to the
persons and organizations on the ``Frankly Speaking'' mailing list. Similarly facilitated public meetings will
be held in Cascade, Idaho Falls, Lewiston, and Nampa, Idaho, and Missoula, Montana, to solicit comments on potential
indicators, standards and management prescriptions. Response cards will again be sent to the ``Frankly Speaking''
mailing list to solicit input on these topics. Agency-sponsored open house meetings will be held at the Forest Headquarters
offices of the Bitterroot, Boise, Caribou, Nez Perce, Payette and Salmon-Challis National Forests to gather comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The date, time and location of all of the above meetings will be published
in ``The Idaho Statesman'' (Boise, Idaho), ``The Missoulian'' (Missoula, Montana), ``The Lewiston Tribune'' (Lewiston,
Idaho), ``The Star News (McCall, Idaho), ``The Post Register'' (Idaho Falls, Idaho) and ``The Recorder-Herald''
(Salmon, Idaho).
Preparation of the EIS will include the following steps:
1. Define the purpose of and need for action.
2. Identify potential issues, desired future conditions and management zones.
3. Eliminate issues of minor importance or those that have been covered by previous and relevant environmental analysis.
4. Select issues to be analyzed in depth.
5. Identify prospective indicators, standards and management prescriptions.
7. Identify reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.

8. Describe the affected environment.
9. Identify the potential environmental effects of the alternatives.
10. Select monitoring requirements.
Steps 2, 3, and 4 will be completed through the scoping process.
Steps 5 will consider a range of alternatives developed from the key issues. One of these will be the ``No Action'' alternative,
in which the existing management direction would be maintained. Other alternatives will consider various combinations
of indicators, standards, management zones and management prescriptions in response to issues.
Step 8 will describe the physical, biological and social attributes of the area to be affected by this proposal, with
special attention to the environmental factors that could be adversely affected.
Step 9 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. This analysis will provide the rationale for amending
the Land and Resource Management (Forest) Plans and will be consistent with National Forest Management Act requirements.
The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed and documented. In addition, management
prescription or management zone specific mitigation measures will be identified and the effectiveness of these
mitigation measures will be disclosed.
The approximate boundary of the area used for this analysis is the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness which
includes almost the entire Middle Fork Salmon River drainage, the Main Salmon River drainage from Wheat Creek downstream
to the South Fork Salmon River, excluding Little Mallard and Robertson Creeks and that portion of the Main Salmon River
downstream from the South Fork Salmon River to Huntz Gulch on the South side of the river, the Big Creek drainage downstream
from Smith Creek, and the South Fork Salmon River downstream from Knob Creek. A total of 2,361,767 acres in four counties
(Custer, Idaho, Lemhi and Valley) is included in this Wilderness area. For a map, please refer to the ``Frank Church-River
of No Return Wilderness (North Half, South Half), available from the USDA, Forest Service, Intermountain Region,
Ogden Utah 84401.
The proposed management activities would be administered by the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Headquarters
in Lemhi County, Idaho.
Agency representatives and other interested people are invited to visit with Forest Service officials at any time
during the EIS process. Three specific time periods are identified for the receipt of formal comments on the analysis.
The three comment periods are, (1) during the scoping process, (2) during the draft indicators and standards identification
and management prescriptions development phase, and (3) during the formal review period of the Draft EIS.
The Draft EIS is estimated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in October 1995. At that time, the EPA will publish an availability notice of the Draft EIS in the Federal Register.
The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the Federal Register. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at
that time. To be most helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy
of the statement of merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' positions and contentions.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 192


(Date)


Announcing the Standard for Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS)


Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.
1. Name of Standard. Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) (FIPS PUB 192).
2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Information Interchange.
3. Explanation. This standard describes an application profile for the Government Information Locator Service
(GILS). This application profile is based primarily on the American National Standard for Information Retrieval
Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Open Systems Interconnection (ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1992),
developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The Government Information Locator Service
(GILS) is a decentralized collection of servers and associated information services that will be used by the public
either directly or through intermediaries to find public information throughout the Federal government.
This GILS Profile specifies the use of ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1992 in information service applications and provides
specifications for the overall GILS application, including the GILS Core and other aspects of the GILS server operating
in the Internet environment. This GILS profile will enable GILS client systems to interconnect and to interoperate
with any GILS server. This profile addresses intersystem interactions and information interchange for the GILS,
but does not specify user interface requirements, the internal structure of databases that contain GILS Locator
Records, or search engine functionality.
GILS servers will support search and retrieval by accepting a search query and returning a result set or diagnostic
messages. GILS servers may also support browsing by accepting a well-known search query and returning a list of Locator
Records in brief display format.
Some of the information resources pointed to by GILS Locator Records, as well as the GILS server itself, may be available
electronically through other communications protocols including the common Internet protocols that facilitate
electronic information transfer such as remote login (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and electronic mail.
The use of SMTP and MIME protocols or other communications paths is outside the scope of the GILS Profile.
The GILS Profile was developed by a group of industry and government experts in ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1992 implementations,
system implementations, and the organization of information. The specifications included in the GILS Profile reflect
the consensus of this group based on its work and input from a range of stakeholders.
4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.

Small Takes of Ringed Seals Incidental to On-Ice Seismic Activity


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of issuance of letters of authorization. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with section 101(a)(5) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) as amended, and implementing regulations,
notification is hereby given that letters of authorization to take ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic operations
in the Beaufort Sea off Alaska were issued on December 1, 1994 to BP Exploration, Western Geophysical, and Schlumberger,
all of Anchorage, AK.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 101(a)(5)(A) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et

 

seq

.) directs NMFS to allow, on request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals
by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical
region, if certain findings are made, and regulations are issued. Under the MMPA, the term ``taking'' means to harass,
hunt, capture or kill or to attempt to harass, hunt, capture or kill marine mammals.


Permission may be granted for periods up to 5 years if the Secretary finds, after notification and opportunity for
public comment, that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) of marine mammals and will
not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses. In addition,
NMFS must prescribe regulations that include permissible methods of taking and other means effecting the least practicable
adverse impact on the species and its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses, paying
particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds and areas of similar significance. The regulations must include
requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. Regulations governing the taking of ringed
seals incidental to on-ice seismic activities were promulgated on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4091) and remain in effect
until December 31, 1997.


Summary of Requests


NMFS received requests for letters of authorization on the dates specified from: (1) BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.,
900 East Benson Blvd. P.O. Box 196612, Anchorage, AK 99519-6612 (July 15, 1994, revised September 20, 1994);
(2) Western Geophysical/ Western Atlas International, Inc. 351 E. International Airport Road, Anchorage, AK 99518-1299
(November 4, 1994); and (3) Schlumberger, 500 W. International Airport Road, Anchorage, AK 99518 (October 31, 1994).
All letters request a take by harassment of a small number of ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic work in the Beaufort
Sea, AK.
Issuances of these letters are based on findings that the total takings will have a negligible impact on the ringed
seal species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of this species for subsistence
uses.

Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company; Proposed Recovery


December 1, 1994.


Take notice that on November 29 1994, Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company (Alabama-Tennessee), filed to recover
the net debit balance due and payable by Shippers on its system under Section 33.4 of the General Terms and Conditions
of the Alabama-Tennessee's FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1. According to Alabama-Tennessee, the amount
due results from a true-up performed by Alabama-Tennessee following the elimination of its Transportation Cost
Rate Adjustment (TCRA). Alabama-Tennessee states that its filing reconciles the remaining costs associated with
stranded upstream capacity still owed to Alabama-Tennessee, notwithstanding the elimination of its TCRA pursuant
to the Commission's November 9, 1994 order in Docket No. RP93-198, and certain refunds recently made by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline Company to be flowed through by Alabama-Tennessee.
Alabama-Tennessee proposes that it be permitted to recover this true-up adjustment through a one-time direct bill
to affected customers which it will show on regular invoices that it will tender for January, 1995 service when its
former resale customers' demand historically increases. Alabama-Tennessee states that by utilizing this approach,
any adverse effects that these customers might otherwise experience during the time these costs are being recovered
will be mitigated.
Alabama-Tennessee has requested that the Commission grant such waivers as may be necessary to accept and approve
the filing as submitted.
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capital Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

The license for Project No. 2188 was issued for a period ending November 30, 1994. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C.
808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at the expiration of a license term, to issue from year to year an annual license
to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the prior license until a new license is issued, or the project
is otherwise disposed of as provided in Section 15 or any other applicable section of the FPA. If the project's prior
license waived the applicability of Section 15 of the FPA, then, based on Section 9(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), and as set forth at 18 CFR 16.21(a), if the licensee of such project has filed an application for
a subsequent license, the licensee may continue to operate the project in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the license after the minor or minor part license expires, until the Commission acts on its application. If the licensee
of such a project has not filed an application for a subsequent license, then it may be required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b),
to continue project operations until the Commission issues someone else a license for the project or otherwise orders
disposition of the project.



If the project is subject to Section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that an annual license for Project No. 2188
is issued to Montana Power Company for a period effective December 1, 1994, through November 30, 1995, or until the
issuance of a new license for the project or other disposition under the FPA, whichever comes first. If issuance of
a new license (or other disposition) does not take place on or before November 30, 1995, notice is hereby given that,
pursuant to 18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license under Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed automatically without
further order or notice by the Commission, unless the Commission orders otherwise.


If the project is not subject to Section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that Montana Power Company is authorized
to continue operation of the Missouri-Madison Project No. 2188 until such time as the Commission acts on its application
for subsequent license.

Tennessee states that the revisions made by Tennessee comply with the Order in Docket No. RP91-203, November
9, 1994 (69 FERC   61,212) accepting tariff sheets implementing Tennessee's cost of service settlement and
with the order of November 18 in Docket Nos. RP94-309 et al. (69 FERC   61,234). In particular, Tennessee
has clarified, through the tariff sheet listed in Item A, which surcharges apply to the PTR Rate Schedule and clearly
stated the rate after current adjustment will be increased to reflect the applicable surcharges.

In Item B, Tennessee has reflected the removal of GSR costs from its IT rates for the period of September 1993 through
April 1994 and a reduction to the GSR components effective May 1 and August 1 (respectively). Tennessee is, however,
reserving its right to seek rehearing of the Commission's order but has adjusted the rates as specified by the Commission,
as demonstrated in Schedules 1-1.3.

In Item C, Tennessee modified the effective date of the settlement fuel rates for Rate Schedule NET shippers to November
1, 1992. This change does not apply to the Segment U rates which are subject to separate determination in Docket No.
RP92-132. Finally, in Item D, Tennessee has reflected the appropriate settlement rate for OSP under the T-180
Rate Schedule for the period November 1992 through September 1993 and from September 1993 to current.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Rate Filing</DOCTITLE>


December 1, 1994.



Take notice that on November 23, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 94, Substitute Original Sheet
Nos. 95A and 95B, Substitute First Revised Sheet Nos. 96 and 100, with a proposed effective date of November 1, 1994.
Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's letter order dated November 15,
1994.

Tennessee states that the Commission approved Tennessee's previous filing subject to a few modifications. The instant
filing implements those modifications. Specifically, Tennessee has clearly stated at Sheet No. 95B that any authorized
overrun transportation will be subject to the scheduling priorities of Section 5(e) of Article III of its General
Terms and Conditions, which clearly states that authorized overrun has a priority below firm transportation. Tennessee
has also modified the language of  3.4(b) to clarify that Tennessee will waive both the overrun charge and the
$25.00 penalty when overruns are authorized. Tennessee has also added the language that had been omitted from Section
8.1 of the FS Rate Schedule.

Tennessee also states that has made a few other changes in the instant filing to either clarify items or respond to customer
requests. Specifically, Tennessee has replaced the term ``excess deliverability'' with ``conditional deliverability''
wherever it appears in the FS Rate Schedule and replaced the term ``customer'' with ``Shipper'' wherever it appeared.
Tennessee has clarified that Section 3.4(e) applies to assignments as well as agency arrangements. Finally, Tennessee
has clarified that the requirement that a Shipper's Maximum Storage Quantity be between 30 and 150 times a shipper's
Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity applies exclusive of any conditional deliverability awarded in this docket.

While Tennessee does not believe any waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission
grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing.

Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state
regulatory commission.

Any person desiring to protest with reference to said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 211 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests
will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to this proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection.

of GSR costs allocated to its IT rates based on the original amortization period reflected in Docket Nos. RP93-151
and RP94-39. Tennessee states that it is filing concurrently in Docket Nos. RP91-203 and RP94-309

December 1, 1994.



Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas
77252-2511, CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), 445 West Main Street, Clarksburg, West Virginia 26301, and
National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, collectively
referred to as Applicants, jointly filed in Docket No. CP95-103-000 an application pursuant to Section
7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, for permission and approval to abandon an exchange service rendered pursuant to Tennessee's
Rate Schedule X-50, CNG's Rate Schedule X-10, and National Fuel's Rate Schedule X-8, all as more
fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Applicants state that this exchange service was authorized on August 10, 1972 in Docket No. CP72-203, and amended
on July 29, 1976. It is further stated, that this service was performed under the terms of an exchange agreement dated
October 28, 1975; under which CNG and National Fuel agreed to deliver up to 15,000 Mcf of natural gas per day to Tennessee.
National Fuel would deliver for its affiliate, The Sylvania Corporation, a percentage of the volumes of natural gas
from production at the Raisch Unit in the Adrian Pool to Tennessee's 24-inch line through CNG's
 existing facilities in Steuben County, New York, and receive in turn equivalent volumes of natural gas from Tennessee
for the account of Sylvania Corporation at the Ellisburg delivery point in Potter County, Tennessee. All gas delivered
to Tennessee by CNG would be considered gas delivered for the account of National Fuel until such time as CNG had returned
to National Fuel the volumes of gas reserves owned by Sylvania in the Raisch Unit.





No facilities are proposed to be abandoned in this proceeding.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before December
22, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for the Applicants to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

December 1, 1994.



Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Wyoming Interstate Company, Ltd. (WIC) filed a Motion To Place Rates Into Effect
accompanied by revised tariff sheets incorporating the new rates as revised to reflect a December 1, 1994 effective
date and a revised Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) rate previously effective October 1, 1994. WIC states that on June
29, 1994, the Commission accepted WIC's rate filing, and suspended its effectiveness until December 1, 1994 (67 FERC
  61,390). WIC's motion places those higher rates into effect on December 1, 1994, subject to refund and other
conditions, and its revised tariff sheets include those which were suspended and with respect to which no compliance
changes were required by the Commission's June 29, 1994 order.

WIC states that copies of this filing have been served on WIC's jurisdictional customers and public bodies, and the
filing is available for public inspection at WIC's offices in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR Section 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will
be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Rate Filing</DOCTITLE>


December 1, 1994.


Take notice that on November 23, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Second Revised Sheet Nos. 126, 128, 129, Substitute Original
Sheet No. 659D and Third Revised Sheet No. 125. Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the
Commission's October 27, 1994 order in the above-referenced docket approving Tennessee's proposed PAT Rate Schedule.
Tennessee requests an effective date for the above-referenced sheets of November 1, 1994.
Tennessee states that in its October 27 Order, the Commission conditioned its acceptance on Tennessee responding
to concerns that the Commission had with the filing. In response, the instant filing, eliminates the reference to
``Shipper's facilities'' in  3.2 of the PAT Rate Schedule at Sheet No. 125. Second, Tennessee has clarified
at Sheet No. 125 that scheduling under Rate Schedule PAT is subject to the same scheduling provisions as all other rate
schedules. Third, Tennessee made the changes requested by the New England Customer Group at Sheet No. 659D.
In addition to the above-described changes, Tennessee states that it has modified the nominations procedures to
allow shippers to nominate PAT Service on a monthly basis during the Winter Season instead of requiring them to nominate
on a seasonal basis. Tennessee has agreed to make this change at the request of shippers because monthly nominations
will provide shippers with additional flexibility.
Tennessee also states that, in response to concerns that certain restrictions on PAT service might not be necessary
or might be discriminatory, restricting PAT service to storage points is necessary at this time in order to avoid problems
with Tennessee's nomination and allocation system. Tennessee is willing to reevaluate the need for this restriction,
but does not feel that it can ensure smooth operations for this winter without it. Similarly, Tennessee states that
because all of Tennessee's storage interconnection points are covered by balancing agreements, the balancing agreement
requirement will not prevent anyone from using this service this winter. If, after one winter season of operations,
Tennessee removes the storage restriction, it will also reevaluate the need for the balancing agreement requirement.
While Tennessee does not believe any waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission
grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing.
Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state
regulatory commission.
Any person desiring to protest with reference to said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 211 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests
will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to this proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of an application to register the pesticide product Mole-Med, a mole repellent
containing an active ingredient not included in any previously registered product pursuant to the provisions of
section 3(c)(5) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33505), which announced that Mole Med Inc., P.O. Box 333, Aurora, IN 47001, had submitted an application
to register the pesticide product Mole-Med (EPA File Symbol 64439-R), ~containing the active ingredient castor
oil (CAS No. 8001-79-4) at 66 percent, an active ingredient not included in any previously registered
product. 

~~~~~

The application was approved on August 3, ~1994, as Mole-Med, to repel moles from lawns (EPA Registration Number 64439-1).

This registration is unconditional for 1-year. During that period the registrant will submit more information
on product effectiveness. If this requirement is not satisfied by August 15, 1995, EPA will automatically cancel
the registration.

~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of castor oil, and information
on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered
the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential
exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use
of castor oil when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. 

In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703-305-5805).
Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed
to the Freedom of Information Office (A-101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Such requests should:
(1) Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired.

<DOCTITLE>The Industrial Bank of Japan, Limited, Tokyo, Japan; Application to Engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>



The Industrial Bank of Japan, Limited, Tokyo, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank
Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3))
to purchase Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., Inc., New York, New York (Company), from Applicant's subsidiary bank, IBJ
Schroder Bank & Trust Company, New York, New York, and thereby engage in the following activities: 1) executing
and clearing, clearing without executing, executing without clearing, purchasing and selling through the use of
omnibus trading accounts, and providing investment advisory services to institutional customers with respect
to previously approved futures and options on futures contracts on financial commodities; 2) providing investment
advice pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4); 3) underwriting and dealing in securities as permitted by 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16);
4) trading foreign exchange in the spot market for nonhedging purposes; 5) trading over the counter options on U.S.
Treasury securities for nonhedging purposes; 6) trading options, futures, options on futures and forward contracts
in accordance with 225.142 to hedge foreign exchange and securities positions; and 7) acting as an agent for affiliates
in the purchase and sale of over the counter interest rate contracts, including swaps, forwards, options (including
caps, collars and floors), and any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks, and providing the above-listed
futures commission merchant services to affiliates. The activities will be conducted on a worldwide basis.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
Applicant states that the Board previously has determined by order or regulation that all of the proposed activities
are closely related to banking.

National Toxicology Program; Availability of the Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens



The HHS' National Toxicology Program (NTP) today announces the availability of the Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens.

The Annual Report on Carcinogens, prepared by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Public Health Service,
is issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health Service, (DHHS) pursuant to an amendment to the Public Health
Service Act (section 262, Pub. L. 95-622) which requires the Secretary to publish an annual report that contains
``a list of all substances (i) which either are known to be carcinogens and (ii) to which a significant number of persons
residing in the United States are exposed * * *.'' The law also states that the reports should provide
available information on the nature of exposures, the estimated numbers of persons exposed, and the extent to which
the implementation of Federal regulations decreases the risk to public health from exposure to these chemicals.

For the purpose of the Report, ``known'' carcinogens are defined as those substances for which the evidence from human
studies indicates that there is causal relationship between exposure to the substance and human cancer. Substances
``which may reasonably be anticipated to be carcinogens'' are defined as those for which there is limited evidence
of carcinogenicity in humans or sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.

Substances in the above categories, for which potential exposure of persons residing in the United States has been
demonstrated, are included in the Report. The Seventh Annual Report does not contain all known carcinogens or substances
reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens. Additional substances with identified carcinogenic properties as defined
above will be included in subsequent Annual Reports.

New entries in the Seventh Annual Report were chosen from those designated by the agencies participating in the preparation
of the Report, from those tested within the National Toxicology Program and the National Cancer Institute Carcinogenesis
Bioassay Program; or from those evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component
of the World Health Organization (WHO), located in Lyon, France.

The Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens Summary does not contain specific information on regulations promulgated
by regulatory health agencies. In most other respects, the information is the same as that in the full report. Copies
will be sent automatically to those on the mailing list; others may request a single copy without charge by writing
the NTP Central Data Management, MD A0-02, P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.

Copies of the complete Report are available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road,
Springfield, VA 22161. Tel: 800-553-6847. There is a $105.00 charge for the document plus a $8.00 per order
shipping and handling charge. Ask for Report No. PB 95-109781 when ordering.

Comments on the Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens are welcome. Corrections, suggestions, or any additional information
should be addressed to Annual Reports on Carcinogens, NTP Public Information Office, MD B2-04, P.O. Box 12233,
Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.

<DOCTITLE>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences: Validation and Acceptance of Alternative Testing Methods:
Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>



Introduction 



Section 1301 of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law No. 103-43) directed
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to establish an Applied Toxicological Research
and Testing Program to conduct applied research and testing regarding toxicology. The Act specified that the toxicology-related
activities to be carried out by the program would include: (i) Establishing criteria for the validation and regulatory
acceptance of alternative testing methods; and (ii) recommending a process through which scientifically validated
alternative methods can be accepted for regulatory use. The purpose of this announcement is to invite interested
parties to provide information for consideration in the formulation of these criteria and processes.



Background



In response to the directives in Public Law No. 103-43, the NIEHS has established the ad hoc Interagency Coordinating
Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) to develop recommendations relating to the validation
and acceptance of new and revised testing methods that would be useful to Federal agencies. Many new and revised test
methods represent alternative methods, models, and approaches in that they: (a) Result in the reduction of the total
number of animals required in a test; (b) incorporate refinements of procedures to lessen or eliminate pain or distress
to animals; or (c) provide for the partial or total replacement of animals with non-animal systems, or the replacement
of one animal species with another (e.g., a mammalian species replaced by a nonmammalian or invertebrate species).

The Committee's goals include recommending criteria and processes that will: (1) Encourage the development of new
methods and improvement of existing test methods to generate data useful for risk assessment; (2) lead to the scientific
validation of new and improved test methods; (3) increase the likelihood of regulatory acceptance of scientifically
valid new test methods; and (4) encourage the refinement and reduction of animal use in testing, and the replacement
of animals with non-animal methods and/or phylogenetically lower species, when scientifically feasible.



Action



Comments and information are invited from interested parties regarding criteria for the validation and acceptance
of alternative testing methods, and processes for the regulatory acceptance of scientifically validated alternative
methods. Information is sought regarding the following broad topics:




Types of information necessary to evaluate the practical utility of a test method; 

Essential components and processes applicable to the validation of test methods; 

Principles and criteria for assessing the validity of a test method; i.e., do considerations vary depending upon
whether the test is: (a) 

in vivo

 vs. 

in vitro;

 (b) a screen or a replacement; or (c) mechanistically-based or not; 

Factors relevant to the acceptance of validated test methods by regulatory and scientific agencies.




The Committee will consider such comments and information prior to the preparation of a draft document. Opportunity
for comment on the Committee's draft document will be announced at a later date, and a public meeting will also be announced.

Comments and information should be sent within 60 days of the publication of this announcement to Dr. William Stokes,
NIEHS, MD-A2-05, P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709. For further information
regarding this request, please contact Dr. Stokes by mail at the above address, by FAX at 919/541-0719, by telephone
at 919/541-7997, or by Internet e-mail at Stokes@NIEHS.NIH.GOV.

was based on a decision made by the CITES Standing Committee during meeting held in March, 1994, which asked CITES Party
countries to suspend imports in certain animal species from the affected countries. This action was required by CITES
Resolution Conference 8.9, adopted at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, in 1992,
which established a procedure for developing remedial actions and implementing them through import suspensions,
if voluntary compliance by exporting countries is not satisfactory.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Article IV, paragraph 2(a) of the CITES treaty allows commercial and noncommercial trade in species listed in CITES
Appendix II, but export permits for such trade may be issued only if a designated Management Authority of the country
has determined that the specimens were legally acquired, and if a designated Scientific Authority of that country
has advised the Management Authority that the export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Article
IV, paragraph 3 goes on to require that exports of Appendix II species be limited in any way necessary to ensure that
the population level of a species is consistent with that species' role in its ecosystem and that the population level
of that species be maintained well above the level where it might qualify for inclusion in Appendix I. 


Over the past decade, CITES parties have become increasingly concerned that certain Appendix II species are subject
to particularly high volumes of trade without sufficient biological data for Scientific Authorities to make the
necessary judgments that exports are not detrimental to the species, as required by Article IV. In 1983, CITES parties
adopted a resolution at the Fourth Conference of the Parties in Gaborone, Botswana, acknowledging that many parties
are not effectively implementing Article IV and thus risk losing the benefits of continued availability of these
resources. This resolution, Conf. 4.7, established a project to identify Appendix II species involved in significant
levels of international trade, and to develop and negotiate with exporting and importing countries whatever measures
were necessary to bring trade down to levels consistent with Article IV. 
In 1987, at the Sixth Conference of the Parties in Ottawa, Canada, parties charged the newly established CITES Animals
Committee with the task of establishing a list of Appendix II species being significantly affected by trade, reviewing
all available information, and formulating remedial measures for these species. The CITES Secretariat coordinated
or contracted for studies to develop lists of mammal, bird, and reptile species and collect relevant information
about these species, in cooperation with the IUCN World Conservation Union. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
cooperated with and provided financial support for a number of these studies.

At the Eighth Conference of the Parties in 1992, in Kyoto, Japan, CITES parties adopted a resolution developed by the
CITES Animals Committee which recognized that substantial trade in wild-caught animals was still going on contrary
to the provisions of Article IV, and that necessary remedial measures were not being properly implemented. This resolution,
Conf. 8.9, established a formal process for the Animals Committee to develop remedial measures, including ``zero
quotas'' (that is, temporary trade bans) when appropriate; for the Secretariat to communicate these recommendations
to the exporting countries; and, where exporting countries do not satisfactorily implement the measures, for the
CITES Standing Committee to call on parties to suspend imports of these species from the offending countries until
they are in compliance. 
During meetings of the Animals Committee in 1992 and 1993, attended by representatives of the Service, remedial measures
were developed and subsequently communicated to exporting countries by the Secretariat. The Standing Committee
reviewed reports from the Secretariat of compliance and noncompliance with these remedial measures during three
meetings in 1993 and 1994. The Service represented the United States in these meetings, with the Department of State.
During the last of these meetings, held in Geneva, Switzerland, in March, 1994, the Standing Committee directed the
Secretariat to issue a formal notice calling for a suspension of trade in particular Appendix II species from twelve
CITES parties. 
Accordingly, on April 21, 1994, the Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties number 800, calling for a suspension
of imports of these species from the affected countries. Implementation of these restrictions is necessary to stop
trade considered to be detrimental to the survival of the species and thus in contravention of the requirements of
CITES Article IV. CITES parties failing to implement these trade suspensions would be contributing to the decline
of the affected species, and would be subject to formal citation in the CITES Infractions Report and possible censure
by the CITES Conference of the Parties. 
Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is granted
the authority to detain, refuse clearance of, or seize any fish or wildlife or plants that are imported into the United
States in violation of CITES. Regulations contained in 50 CFR 14.53(c) indicate that refusal of clearance of imported
wildlife is warranted if there are reasonable grounds to believe that documentation for the clearance of such wildlife
is not valid. Similarly, regulations contained in 50 CFR 23.12(a)(2) require that all imports of Appendix II wildlife
into the United States be accompanied by a valid foreign export permit or re-export certificate, unless an exemption
applies. The Service agrees with notification to the Parties number 800 and believes that any permits issued for the
indicated species by the affected countries are not valid because required findings of ``non-detriment'' and/or
lawful acquisition have not been credibly demonstrated by the exporting countries in light of the significant trade
level in particular Appendix II species. 
The subjects of this notice are as follows: 


A. Subject 


Argentina: ban on imports of specimens of guanaco (

Lama guanicoe

). 


This is a Schedule III Notice

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 




Background._

These investigations are being instituted as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations by the Department
of Commerce that imports of unwrought pure magnesium from China, Russia, and Ukraine and imports of unwrought alloy
magnesium from China and Russia are being sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section
733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The investigations were requested in a petition filed on March 31, 1994, by Magnesium
Corporation of America (Magcorp), Salt Lake City, UT; the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 564,
Freeport, TX; and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 8319, Salt Lake City, UT.

of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.

The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than December 19, 1994.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments regarding the subject matter of the investigations to
the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than December 19, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Dresser Industries, Incorporated Guiberson-Ava Division Dallas, Texas; Notice of Affirmative Determination
Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>




On October 24, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's
Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at
the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was published in the Federal Register

 on October 14, 1994 (59 FR 50624).


Findings show that the company is engaged in on-site field supervision and consultation of down-hole equipment for
drilling.



Conclusion




After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.







Signed at Washington, D.C., this 22nd day of November 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Smith System Manufacturing Company Princeton, Minnesota; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application
for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>




By an application dated September 10, 1994, after being granted a filing extension, Local 

#

1996 of the Machinists Union (IAM), requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade
adjustment assistance (TAA). The denial notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792).

Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.

The investigation files show that the workers produce school and office furniture.

The union submitted annual U.S. import data from the Department of Commerce for furniture which would include the
products produced by Smith System. This impact data, however, was included in the Department's investigation.

The Department's denial is based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements
of the Trade Act was not met. worker separations were the result of a corporate decision to consolidate its production
of furniture at other domestic locations. During the consolidation period, employment at the Princeton plant decreased
while employment at the corporate transfer plants increased commensurately. There was no decline in corporate sales
during this period.



The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA Benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition
but only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like
or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to declines in sales or production and employment
at the workers' firm.




Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>James River Corporation Old Town, Maine; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration </DOCTITLE>



On November 16, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the 

Federal Register.



On reconsideration, the James River Corporation submitted new information showing that hardwood pulp sales by the
company declined in 1993 compared to 1992. The initial findings show substantial worker separations in 1993. 

U.S. imports of hardwood pulp increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992. 

Further findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer increased its imports of hardwood pulp
while decreasing its purchases from the subject firm. 



Conclusion 

After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the James River Corporation
workers in old Town, Maine were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive
with hardwood pulp producer at James River Corporation in Old Town, Maine.





``All workers of James River corporation in Old Town, Maine who became totally or partially separated from employment
on or after April 5, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Saft Aerospace Batteries, A Division of Saft America Gainesville, Florida; Formerly Gates Aerospace Batteries
Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc.; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm.

The certification notice was issued on September 2, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631-2).

At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation
findings show that the Gates Aerospace Batteries Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc., was the predecessor-in-interest
firm. Many of the workers had unemployment insurance (UI) taxes paid under the former firm.

Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to properly reflect this matter.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,951 is hereby issued as follows:






``All workers of Saft Aerospace Batteries, Gainesville, Florida, a division of Saft America (formerly Gates Aerospace
Batteries Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc., Gainesville, Florida) who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after January 1, 1994 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the
Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>F.C.I.; Freeman, South Dakota Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>


On September 9, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for NAFTA Transitional adjustment Assistance for former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on September 23, 1994 (59 FR 48914).
On reconsideration, it was found that F.C.I. ceased production of industrial back supports in January, 1994. Other
findings show substantial worker separations occurred in 1993 and 1994.
New findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer of industrial back supports from F.C.I. decreased
its purchases in 1994 and substantially increased its import purchases of back supports.


Conclusion


After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the F.C.I. workers
in Freeman, South Dakota were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with
the back supports produced at F.C.I. in Freeman, South Dakota.
In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the F.C.I. workers in
Freeman, South Dakota.



``All workers of F.C.I. in Freeman, South Dakota who were engaged in employment related to the production of back supports
who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after June 7, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the requirements of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as
amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published and issued another periodic report to Congress on
abnormal occurrences (NUREG-0090, Vol. 17, No. 2).
Under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which created NRC, an abnormal occurrence is defined as ``an unscheduled
incident or event that the Commission (NRC) determines is significant from the standpoint of public health or safety.''
NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection
against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences.

The report to Congress is for the second calendar quarter of 1994. The report identifies the occurrences or events
that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also
described.
This report addresses seven abnormal occurrences (AOs) at NRC-licensed facilities. Five involved medical brachytherapy
misadministrations, one involved a medical teletherapy misadministration, and one involved a medical sodium iodide
misadministration. Four AOs were reported by the Agreement States as of August 3, 1994. Two involved medical brachytherapy
misadministrations, one involved a radiation burn received by an industrial radiographer, and one involved a lost
well logging source.
The report also contains updates of seven AOs previously reported by NRC licensees and five AOs previously reported
by Agreement State licensees. Three ``Other Events of Interest'' are also reported. One involved a deliberate coverup
of an error in a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical administration at an NRC licensee, one involved an Order Suspending
License and Demand for Information at an NRC licensee, and one involved an overexposure of an industrial radiographer
at an Agreement State licensee.
A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.
(Lower Level), Washington, D.C. 20037, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout
the country.
Copies of NUREG-0090, Vol. 17, No. 2 (or any of the previous reports in this series), may be purchased from the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082.
A year's subscription to the NUREG-0090 series publication, which consists of four issues, is also available.
Copies of the report may also be purchased from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>


Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from November 14, 1994, through
November 25, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on November 23, 1994 (59 FR 60377).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By January 6, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local
public document room for the particular facility involved. 



Carolina Power & Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and 50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units
1 and 2, Brunswick County, North Carolina




Date of amendments request: 

October 25, 1994


Description of amendments request: 

The proposed change would delete the remainder of Appendix B, Environmental Technical Specifications, including
section 2/3.3.1, Water Level in the Discharge Canal, and Section 2/3.4, Meteorology. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 




Hydraulic - Water level in the Discharge Canal

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The deletion of the discharge canal specification of 4.5 [plus or minus] 1 ft mean sea level
(msl) with daily monitoring still leaves the operating restrictions delineated in Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report (UFSAR) Section 2.4.8.3.3 (4.5 [plus or minus] 2 ft msl) and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements to minimize the impact of the discharge canal on the local groundwater supply.
As stated in this UFSAR section, the effect on the local ground water regime will be minimal within this band. Level
recorders in the control room facilitate the continued monitoring the discharge canal level in excess of the Appendix
B Environment Technical Specification (ETS) listed daily surveillance. This change in no way affects the design
or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The discharge canal level is an environmental concern with the effects of a spill of radioactive
liquids (UFSAR Section 2.4.12.3) being a path to the intake canal, due to the areas natural gradient. With the estimated
travel time for the liquid to reach the canal (intake) at 60 years, and the large flow rate the degree of dilution is such
that this does not pose a threat to local wells. The amendment would not affect the operation or design of any plant equipment;
therefore, no new credible accidents are created. In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability
of the response systems to mitigate the consequences of any accident previously evaluated; therefore, no new or different
accident would result from this change.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The existence of these ETS
does not provide a margin of safety related to the nuclear operation of the site. No safety limits are affected by this
change. Therefore, this amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety.

Meteorology

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The deletion of the meteorology specification still leaves the program delineated in UFSAR
Section 2.3.3, Onsite Meteorological Measurements Program, and reporting/recording of the hourly meteorological
data required to support Technical Specification 6.9.1.10.a, Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report.
This program is based on the meteorological monitoring program described in Regulatory Guide 1.23, and NUREG-0654.
While the existing ETS 30 day reporting requirement for extended out-of-service time and shiftly manual acquisition
of data during batch or accidental releases are not otherwise covered, the program does contain the Regulatory Guide
1.23 reference to 90% data recovery and a backup phone line is available for data retrieval. This proposed amendment
in no way affects the design or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The meteorological monitoring program is specified in UFSAR Section 2.3.3. The amendment
would not affect the operation or design of any plant equipment; therefore, no new credible accidents are created.
In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability of the response systems to mitigate the consequences
of any accident previously evaluated nor would the amendment reduce the effectiveness of the Emergency Response
Plan; therefore, no new or different accident would result from this change.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The meteorological ETS does
not provide any additional margin of safety related to the operation of a nuclear plant. The meteorological program
established in the UFSAR covers the requirements stated in Appendix E to 10 CFR 50 by providing meteorological systems
adequate for determining the magnitude of, and for continuously assessing the impact of, the release of radioactive
materials to the environment. The meteorological instrumentation is used to measure environmental parameters
which may affect distribution of fission products and gases following a Design Basis Accident (DBA); however, it
is not a primary success path for the mitigation of a DBA. No safety limits are affected by this change. Therefore, this
amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety.

Date of amendments request: 

October 28, 1994


Description of amendments request: 

The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications to increase the surveillance test intervals and
allowable out-of-service times for selected instrumentation addressed in Section 3/4.3. The proposed changes
would permit specified channel functional tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly. Specifically,
the proposed changes would revise the surveillance test intervals and allowable out-of-service times for the reactor
protection system instrumentation, isolation actuation instrumentation, emergency core cooling system actuation
instrumentation, control rod withdrawal block instumentation, control room emergency ventilation system instrumentation,
anticipated transient without scram - recirculation pump trip system instrumentation, end-of-cycle recirculation
pump trip system instrumentation, and reactor core isolation cooling system actuation instrumentation, in accordance
with NRC-approved General Electric Company Licensing Topical Reports and NUREG-1433, Standard Technical Specifications,
General Electric Plants, BWR/4.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:





1) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The generic Licensing Topical Report, NEDC-30851P-A, assessed the impact of changing RPS surveillance test intervals
(STIs) and allowable out-of-service times (AOTs) on the RPS failure frequency, the scram frequency and equipment
cycling. Specifically, Section 5.7.4, ``Significant Hazards Assessment'' of NEDC-30851P-1 states:

``Fewer challenges to the safeguards system, due to less frequent testing of the RPS, conservatively results in a
decrease of approximately one percent in core damage frequency''. This decrease is based upon the following:

* Based on the plant-specific experience presented in Appendix J, the estimated reduction in scram frequency (0.3
scrams/yr) represents a 1 to 2 percent decrease in core damage frequency based on the BWR plant specific Probabilistic
Risk Assessments (PRAs) listed in Table 5-8.

* The increase in core damage frequency due to less frequent testing is less than one percent. This increase is even
lower (less than 0.01 percent) when the changes resulting from the implementation of the Anticipated Transients
Without Scram (ATWS) rule are considered. Therefore, this increase is more than offset by the decrease in CDF due to
fewer scrams.

* The effect of reducing unnecessary cycles on RPS equipment, although not easily quantifiable also results in a decrease
in core damage frequency.

* The overall impact on core damage frequency of the changes in allowable out-of-service time is negligible.''

From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes do not
significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase
in probability of a a scram failure due to RPS unavailablity is insignificant. The overall probability of an accident
is decreased as the time the RPS instrumentation logic operates undisturbed is increased, resulting in fewer inadvertent
scrams during testing and repair. The proprietary plant-specific analysis contained in this submittal (Enclosure
6) demonstrates that, although BSEP Units 1 and 2 differ from the generic plant analyzed in LTR NEDC-30851P-A, the
net effect of the plant-specific differences does not alter the generic conclusions.

The generic Licensing Topical Reports, NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 and NEDC 31677P-A, assessed the impact of changing
STIs and AOTs for BWR Isolation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Summary of Results,'' of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement
2 states:

``The results indicate that the effects on probability of failure to initiate isolation are very small and the effects
on probability or frequency of failure to isolate are negligible in nearly every case. In addition, the results indicate
that increasing the AOT to 24 hours for tests and repairs has a negligible effect on the probability of failure of the
isolation function. These combined with changes to the testing intervals and allowable out-of service times for
RPS and ECCS instrumentation provide a net improvement to plant safety and operations.''

and Section 5.6, ``Assessment of Net Effect of Changes,'' of NEDC-31677P-A states:
 
``A reduction in core damage frequency (CDF) of at least as much as estimated in the ECCS instrumentation analysis
can be expected when the isolation actuation instrumentation STIs are changed from one month to three months. The
chief contributor to this reduction is the channel functional tests for the MSIVs. Inadvertent closure of the MSIVs
will cause an unnecessary plant scram. This reduction in CDF more than compensates for any small incremental increase
(10% or 1.0E-07/year) in calculated isolation function failure frequency when the STI is extended to three months.''

From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes do not
significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase in probability
of an isolation failure due to isolation instrumentation unavailability is insignificant. For those parameters
common to RPS, the overall probability of an accident is actually decreased as the time the RPS instrumentation logic
operates undisturbed is increased, resulting in less inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The plant-specific
evaluation provided with this submittal (Enclosure 8) demonstrates that the conclusions of the generic analyses
are applicable to BSEP Units 1 and 2.

The generic Licensing Topical Report, NEDC-30936P-A (Parts 1 and 2), assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs
for all BWR ECCS Actuation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Technical Assessment of Changes,'' of NEDC-30936P-A
(Part 2) states:

``The results indicate an insignificant (less than 5E-7 per year) increase in water injection function failure frequency
when STIs are increased from 31 days to 92 days, AOTs for repair of the ECCS actuation instrumentation are increased
from one hour to 24 hours, and AOTs for surveillance testing are increased from two to six hours. For all four BWR models
the increase represents less than 4% increase in failure frequency. However, when other factors which influence
the overall plant safety are considered, the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety.''

From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes do not
significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase
in probability of a water injection failure due to ECCS instrumentation unavailability is insignificant and the
net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety. The plant-specific analysis contained in this submittal
(Enclosure 7) demonstrates that, although BSEP Units 1 and 2 differ from the generic model analyzed in LTR NEDC-30936P-A,
the net effect of the plant-specific differences does not alter the generic conclusions. The generic Licensing Topical
Reports, NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1, and GENE-770-06-1-A assessed the impact of changing Control Rod Block STIs
and AOTs on Rod Block failure frequency. GENE-770-06-1-A also assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on ATWS-RPT
and EOC-RPT failure frequency. Section 5 (Brookhaven National Laboratory's Technical Evaluation Report - Attachment
2 to the NRC SER) of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 states:

1``The BWR Owners' Group proposed changes to the Technical Specifications concerning the test requirements for
BWR control rod block instrumentation. The changes consist of increasing the surveillance test intervals from one
to three months. These test interval extensions are consistent with the already approved changes to STIs for the Reactor
Protection System. The technical analysis reviewed and verified as documented herein indicates that there will
be no significant changes in the availability of the control rod block function if these changes are implemented.
In addition, there will be a negligible impact on the plant core melt frequency due to the decreased testing.''

and Section 2.0, ``Summary'' of GENE-770-06-1-A states:

``Technical bases are provided for selected proposed changes to the instrumentation STIs and AOTs that were identified
in the BWROG Improved BWR Technical Specification activity. These STI and AOT changes are consistent with approved
changes to the RPS, ECCS, and isolation actuation instrumentation. These proposed changes do not result in a degradation
to overall plant safety.''

Based on the generic analysis in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs
that the proposed changes to Control Rod Withdrawal Block instrumentation do not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Also, based on the generic assessment in GENE-770-06-1-A,
the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes to the ATWS-RPT and EOC-RPT instrumentation
do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Bases contained in GE Topical Report GENE-770-06-2P-A, assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on BWR RCIC failure
frequency. Section 2.0, ``Summary'' of GENE-770-06-2P-A states:

``The STI and AOT changes to the RCIC actuation instrumentation are justified based on their small effect on the water
injection function unavailability and consistency with comparable changes to actuation instrumentation for the
other ECCS subsystems.''

On this basis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&L concurs that the proposed changes to RCIC instrumentation
do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not alter the physical characteristics or function of any plant systems or components and
they do not introduce any new mode of operation. Therefore, system and component performance would not be challenged
in a manner that could create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
3) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic studies contained in the LTRs and has concurred with the BWR Owners'
Group that the proposed changes do not significantly affect the probability of failure or availability of the affected
Instrument Systems. The proposed changes to AOTs provide realistic times to complete the required actions without
increasing the overall instrument failure frequency. Likewise, the extended STIs do not result in significant changes
in the probability of instrument failure. Furthermore, the proposed changes will reduce the probability of test-induced
plant transients and equipment failures. Finally, instrument setpoint drift will remain within present tolerances,
thereby assuring that the margin of safety, as demonstrated by applicable safety analyses, remains unchanged. Therefore,
it is concluded that the proposed changes would not result in a reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 4, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The requested amendment will change the testing frequency of the turbine overspeed protection valves from monthly
to quarterly.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The requested change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The requested change will have no influence on the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The accident of concern to this requested change is a turbine overspeed with missile generation
impacting safety related components or structures. The evaluation in WCAP-11525 shows that the probability of a
missile ejection incident will not be affected with the requested frequency reduction to the turbine overspeed protection
valve surveillance test. There is no change to the consequences of the event as the postulated accident event is unchanged.
Accordingly, the requested change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.

2. The requested change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The change affects the test interval for the turbine overspeed protection valves and does not change the
design, operation, or failure modes of the valves and other components in the turbine overspeed protection system.
Therefore, the requested change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. The requested change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The probability of turbine
overspeed with an extension of the testing interval has been determined to be within applicable acceptance criteria.
The change does not affect the design, operation, or failure modes of the valves or other components in the turbine
overspeed protection system. Accordingly, the requested change will not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Date of amendment request: 

November 7, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would allow an increase to the allowable nominal fuel enrichment from 4.2 to 5.0 weight percent
Uranium-235 (w/o U-235). The changes include: (1) increasing the allowable storage enrichment in Region 1 and allowing
the use of Integral Fuel Burnable Absorbers (IFBAs) for reactivity equivalencing, (2) revising the Region 2 discharge
burnup curve to include nominal fuel enrichments up to 5.0 w/o U-235, and (3) making editorial changes.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed changes to Section 5 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors
and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of
an accident. The fuel enrichment increase will not affect reactor operation or the core design methods. The physical
characteristics of the fuel assemblies are not changed, and fuel assembly movement will continue to be controlled
by approved fuel handling procedures. Reload core designs will continue to be performed on a cycle by cycle bases as
part of the reload safety evaluation process, using NRC approved codes and methods. Each reload design is evaluated
to confirm that the cycle core design adheres to the limits that exist in the accident analyses and Technical Specifications
to ensure that reactor operation is acceptable.

The proposed changes are consistent with the analysis performed in the ``Criticality Analysis of Byron and Braidwood
Station Fuel Storage Racks.'' The analysis was revised in June 1994 to include boraflex gaps and shrinkage. The revised
analysis is provided in the proposed Technical Specification amendment. The analysis methodology has been previously
accepted by the NRC and is consistent with the appropriate standards to establish the K

eff

 limit for storage racks and to calculate the maximum K

eff

. The reanalysis addresses the most limiting postulated accident of a misloaded fuel assembly and has shown that having
at least 300 ppm of soluble boron offsets any positive reactivity impacts for any of the postulated accidents. The
concentration of boron in the spent fuel pool water, which is administratively controlled, is sufficient to maintain
K

eff

 less than or equal to 0.95. The analysis is bounding for a dropped fuel assembly on top of a rack or between rack modules,
loss of cooling systems, and reduction the fuel pool temperature to less than 50
 F. The proposed changes do not impact any other accident previously evaluated in the [Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report] UFSAR. There is no postulated accident that could cause reactivity to increase beyond the analyzed conditions
in the spent fuel racks.

There is no impact on the ability of the Spent Fuel Pool cooling system to maintain the bulk pool temperature within
limits. The UFSAR analysis performed to calculate the maximum fuel cladding temperature and spent fuel pool cooling
include assumptions which bound the use of more highly enriched fuel assemblies. Although fuel enrichment is not
a specific assumption in any of these analyses, the heat load of a typical core offload may change with higher enrichments.
The average burnup of the offload will be increased since few assemblies will be used per cycle; however, the new heat
load will continue to be [bound] by the UFSAR analysis because the spent fuel pool racks have been analyzed for a total
core offload with all fuel assemblies having 4.5 years of operating time. 

The radiological consequences analysis continues to bound the licensed fuel burnup and enrichment at Byron and Braidwood
stations. The radiological consequences analysis results are a function of the core inventory of radioactive isotopes.
Since the maximum fuel burnup limits and fuel peaking factors will not be exceeded, the assumed fission product inventory
will remain valid; therefore, the limits of 10 CFR [Part] 100 continue to be met. Additionally, Byron and Braidwood
addressed the issue of the impact on the radiation levels at the pool surface to the worker during non-accident conditions.
These conditions are not changed as [a] result of this submittal, because the average fuel assembly burnup limit (isotopic
inventory) and maximum power produced in each fuel assembly will not be changed by the increased fuel enrichment.


B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. Each
reactor core design will continue to meet all design requirements; operation of the core will not be affected. No modifications
to the spent fuel pool are being pursued and the fuel parameters used in the analysis remain bounding. The method and
manner in which the fuel will be stored in the spent fuel pool has not changed. The proposed changes ensure that 17X17
(Optimized Fuel Assembly, VANTAGE 5, VANTAGE +, and PERFORMANCE +) fuel assemblies can be safely stored, maintaining
a K

eff

 less than or equal to 0.95 under full water density conditions, in both Regions 1 and 2 of the spent fuel pool. All design
criteria and criticality acceptance criteria continue to be met. The reanalysis addresses the most limiting postulated
accident (misloaded fuel assembly) and has shown that having at least 300 ppm of soluble boron offsets any positive
reactivity impacts for any of the postulated accidents. The level of boron in the spent fuel pool water, which is administratively
controlled, is sufficient to maintain K

eff

 less than or equal to 0.95. The reanalysis to increase the storage enrichment of fuel in Regions 1 and 2 of the spent fuel
pool does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Additionally, approval of this amendment will not create a new accident with regards to the new fuel storage vault
which is designed to handle the increased enrichment. The Byron and Braidwood new fuel vaults were previously analyzed
using NRC accepted criticality analysis methodology in June 1989. This analysis was performed to increase the storage
enrichment of the New Fuel Vault to 5.0 w/o U-235. The New Fuel Vault analysis was submitted to the NRC and is the current
licensing basis.

C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. All reactor design criteria
will continue to be met. The methodologies used in the accident analyses have been accepted previously by the NRC and
all criticality acceptance criteria have been met under all assumed conditions (normal and accident). The design
basis for preventing criticality outside the reactor is that, including uncertainties, there is a 95 percent probability
at a 95 percent confidence level that the effective neutron multiplication factor, K

eff

, of the fuel assembly array will be less than 0.95 as recommended by ANSI 57.2-1983 and OT Position Paper for Review
and Acceptance of Spent Fuel Storage and Handling Applications, dated April 14, 1978. The analyses for both Regions
1 and 2 fuel storage were verified to meet the above design basis. 

The criticality analysis for Regions 1 and 2 has been revised to allow for storage of fuel assemblies with enrichments
up to 5.0 w/o U-235. The proposed Technical Specification changes include those changes necessary to maintain K

eff

 less than or equal to 0.95, including conservative allowances for uncertainties and biases, when the pool is flooded
with unborated water. The proposed changes include a requirement for fuel assemblies with enrichments above 4.2
w/o U-235 to contain sufficient integral fuel burnable absorbers such that the maximum reference fuel K infinity
is less than or equal to 1.470 in unborated water at 68
 F due to restrictions on spent fuel storage. Should a postulated accident occur which causes a reactivity increase
in the Byron and Braidwood Spent Fuel Pools, K

eff

 will be maintained less than or equal to 0.95 due to the presence of at least 300 ppm of soluble boron in the spent fuel
pool. The proposed changes do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. 

The proposed changes ensure that the design basis for preventing criticality in the fuel storage areas is preserved,
and fuel cycle designs will continue to be analyzed using NRC accepted codes and methods to ensure the design bases
are satisfied.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

October 31, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would renew the existing license conditions for both plants to implement and maintain Integrated
Implementation Schedule (IIS) Program Plans (the Program Plan). The Program Plans provide a methodology to be followed
for scheduling plant modifications and engineering evaluations.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



YAPCO and NNECO have reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and conclude that the changes do
not involve a SHC [significant hazards consideration]. The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

Operation of the facilities in accordance with these proposed changes would require the implementation of the IIS
methodology described in the Program Plans. As such, it requires that CYAPCO and NNECO establish an administrative
means for tracking, prioritizing, and scheduling NRC-required plant modifications and engineering evaluations,
and licensee identified plant improvement projects. This methodology is intended to enhance plant safety by more
effectively controlling the number and scheduling of plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues required
for safe operation of the plants receive priority and are completed in a timely manner. Because the license conditions
address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, it does not affect directly the design or operation of the plant.
Therefore, no accident analyses are affected and the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences
of any previously evaluated accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed license conditions establish a requirement related to scheduling of modifications and engineering
evaluations. Because the license conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, they do not affect
directly the design or operation of the plants. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
 
The proposed license conditions renew administrative requirements intended to enhance public safety and reliable
plant operation. The proposed license conditions do not affect any accident analyses, directly modify the plant
configurations, or change the way the plants are operated. The methodologies are intended to enhance plant safety
by more effectively controlling the number and scheduling of plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues
required for safe operation of the plants receive priority and are completed in a timely manner. Because the license
conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, they do not affect directly the design or operation
of the plants. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in any margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

This amendment is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the 

Federal Register 

on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30242), which changed the Technical Specifications (TSs) Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate

System Functional Test and (B) Spray Header Visual Inspection
(15) Penetration Fire Barriers 
(16) Smoke Detectors/Electrical Penetration Area Inside Containment
(17) Functional Testing of Containment Sump Pumps
The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.''


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) Charging Flow Instrumentation

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not occur.

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Charging Flow instrumentation be changed from 18 months
(+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created.
 
 The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure
that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is
necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.

(2) Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump, and Reactor Cavity Continuous Level Instrument Channels

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the calibration and test frequency for the Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump and Reactor Cavity
continuous level monitoring instrument channels be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure
that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin is necessary to assure that protective safety functions
will occur so that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. 
(3) Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate Channel

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate channel be revised from 18 months
(+25%) to 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the existing technical specification limits and the
licensing basis Safety Analysis limit to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating
cycle. The existing margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit provides assurance
that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval
from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing Technical Specification limit and
the Safety Analysis limit. Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) Technical Specification
limits, will provide protective functions to assure that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists between the current Technical Specification limit
and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary
to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.

(4) Control Room Air Filtration System

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the surveillance frequency for the Control Room Air Filtration System be changed from every 18
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
For the flow tests, data from 1986 to date indicates that the Control Room Filtration System performed in an acceptable
manner when surveilled on an 18 month (+25%) basis. The only discrepancy was due to a hardware error and was independent
of the time between surveillances. Per Generic Letter 91-04, this past test history provides an adequate basis to
conclude that an extended operating cycle would have minimal impact upon the flow characteristics of the Control
Room Filtration System. The modification of the filtration system in 1993 only enhanced system performance.

With regard to the absorbance properties of the charcoal, previous test data highlights a problem occurring during
the 1986-1987 period which subsequent testing confirms was adequately resolved.

With the 1993 modification which increased the carbon bed thickness from 1'' to 4'', performance can only be enhanced.

Therefore, it is concluded that a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated will not be incurred by changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
 
A review of past historical surveillance data over 7 years indicates no failures which were time dependent. The modification,
which was performed in 1993, can only enhance performance of the system. New fans, an increased charcoal bed thickness,
and new HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters will increase the reliability of the system. Thus, it is concluded
that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than that previously evaluated has not been created.

3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Past test data validated the acceptability of the previous air filtration system for an extended surveillance interval.
The modification performed in 1993 will only enhance the reliability and performance of the air filtration system.
Thus, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the margin of safety is not involved.

(5) Post Accident Containment Venting System

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the surveillance frequency for the Post Accident Containment Venting system be revised from every
18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).

A review of past test history from 1986 to date indicates that the Post Accident Containment Venting System performed
in a satisfactory manner when the surveillance period was 18 months (+25%). There was one discrepant condition noted
in the 1989 test, which, based upon subsequent tests in 1991 and 1993, does not appear to have been age related. The 1989
observation concerning a gasket is considered to be a one time only event and unlikely to reoccur as a result of extending
the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 (+25%).

An added consideration, in terms of safety significance, is the fact that the Post Accident Containment Venting system
is diverse and redundant to the post accident hydrogen recombiners which are themselves redundant and the primary
means of reducing the post accident hydrogen concentration within containment. The venting system is not relied
upon for containment pressure control.

Due to the satisfactory past test history of the venting system, together with its secondary role as a means of controlling
post accident hydrogen concentration, it is concluded that a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated will not be incurred by changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%)
to 24 months (+25%).

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

A review of past historical surveillance data over 7 years indicates no failures which are considered to be time dependent.
Although one discrepant condition was observed in the 1989 test it was not repeated in subsequent surveillances.
Per Generic Letter 91-04, this constitutes a sufficient basis for revising the surveillance interval from 18 months
(+25) to 24 months (+25%). This extension in the operating interval is not expected to have an impact upon the availability
of the system. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated
has not been created.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

As past test data validates the presumption that an extended operating cycle will not impact the availability of the
Post Accident Containment Venting Systems, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the margin of safety is
not involved.

(6) Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel be revised from every
18 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will be set to provide protective functions
to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing
margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not
exceeded.

(7) Steam Generator Blowdown Flow Channel

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Steam Generator Blowdown Flow channel be revised from
every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure
that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated from occurring.
 
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing
margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not
exceeded.

(8) Liquid Waste Distillate Tank Level Channels

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Liquid Waste Distillate Tank level of tanks 13 and 14
be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will be set to provided protective functions
to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing
margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that safety analysis limits are not
exceeded.

(9) Primary Water Storage Tank Level Instrumentation

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Primary Water Storage Tank Level instrumentation be
changed from every 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month surveillance has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting form
a 30 month surveillance. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in surveillance interval will result in a channel statistical allowance which can be accommodated
over a 30 month operating cycle. Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) Technical Specification
limits, will provide protective functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The above changes in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin is necessary to assure that protective safety functions
will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.

(10) Flow Rate Monitors; Plant Vent (Unit 2) and Stack Vent (Unit 1)

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the flow rate monitors for the Plant Vent (Unit 2) and the Stack Vent
(Unit 1) be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the statistical error resulting from a 30 month
operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It
is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a statistical
allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will be calibrated to provide data to assure that safety
analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an previously
evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change in the surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a
channel statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to
the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that safety analysis limits
are not exceeded.

(11) Stack Vent Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-60)

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the stack vent noble gas activity monitor be revised from every 18
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).
 
The current monitor replaced the previous monitor and therefore there is only one refueling cycle surveillance data
available which proved to be satisfactory. The vendor recommends a calibration period based on user experience.
Insofar as the 18 month (+25%) surveillance has proven to be acceptable, extension to a 24 month (+25%) cycle is consistent
with the vendor's recommendation. Any additional uncertainty generated due to the extended surveillance is bounded
by the uncertainty inherent in a grab sample taken once per 24 hours which is the required compensatory action should
the monitor be inoperable. Since setpoints for alarms are not critical to either plant operation or safety, since
extensive margin is reflected between the setpoint and applicable limits, it is concluded that any additional uncertainty
involved in a longer surveillance cycle will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

This monitor measures the activity of potentially radioactive gaseous effluent through the stack vent. The alarm
setpoints are set at a point sufficiently above expected radioactivity levels to avoid unnecessary alarms and, at
the same time, far below discharge limits. The purpose of the monitor is to annunciate in the event an unexpected spike
in radioactivity level should occur so that corrective action can be taken prior to exceeding a discharge limit. The
margin that exists between the discharge limit and the setpoint is more than sufficient to accommodate any drift that
could be practically expected in a 24 month (+25%) operating cycle. 
In this capacity, the monitor does not have setpoints which are critical to plant operation or safety. Readings are
not used in a quantitative manner nor is accuracy important. It is important that the instrument remain operable and
respond to step changes in radioactivity level over the operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that an extended
operating cycle will not result in the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

Sufficient margin exists between plant setpoints and applicable limits to accommodate any realistic drift projected
to occur over a 30 month operating cycle. Furthermore, instrument indications are not used in a quantitative manner
nor is instrument accuracy of importance. Therefore, it is concluded that no significant reduction in the margin
of safety will result from an extended operating cycle.

(12) High Pressure Water Fire Protection System

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the system functional test of the High-pressure Water Fire Protection System be changed from every
18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
This system is a static system which is not normally required to operate. The main fire pumps are on standby and are not
in operation except for testing. Thus, almost no wear is induced as a function of time except that which results from
being in standby status which is minimal and slow acting. Under these circumstances, extending the operating cycle
between surveillances would be expected to have negligible affect upon system operability. It is therefore concluded
that there would be no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as a result of an extended
interval between surveillances.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

Extension of the plant operating cycle will primarily extend the time the pumps are in standby capacity. The potential
for system deterioration is minimal under these circumstances. Any deterioration that does occur will be slow acting
with respect to time. A significant deterioration would be detected by a monthly pump operating test. Thus, an extended
operating cycle is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form [from] any previously
analyzed.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

Extension of the operating cycle by several months only serves to extend the period of time when the pumps are in standby
status. Any deterioration under these circumstances will be slow acting. Significant deterioration would be detected
by the monthly operating test. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended interval between surveillances will involve
no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

(13) Fire Protection System Diesel Engine

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the Fire Protection System Diesel Engine Functional test be changed from every 18 months (+25%)
to every 24 months (+25%).

Except for periodic testing, the diesel is in a standby state and not subject to operational stress. Periodic testing
imposes limited wear as evidenced by the absence of major repairs during past maintenance. Extension of the operating
cycle for several months is expected to have virtually no impact upon diesel operability. Monthly testing would detect
any degradation. Thus it is concluded that there would be no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident as a result of an extended interval between surveillances.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

Extension of the plant operating cycle will, for the most part, only extend the time spent by the pumps in standby capacity.
The potential for system deterioration is minimal under these circumstances. Any deterioration that does occur
will be slow acting with respect to time. Significant deterioration in performance would be detected by the monthly
pump operating test. Thus, an extended operating cycle is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

Extension of the operating cycle by several months only serves to extend the period of time when the pumps are in standby
status. Any deterioration under these circumstances will be slow acting and significant deterioration would be
detected by the monthly operating test. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended interval between surveillances
will involve no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

(14) Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building, and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems; (A)
System Functional Test and (B) Spray Header Visual Inspection

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

(a) It is proposed that the functional test surveillance interval for the Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building
and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months
(25%).

(b) It is proposed that the Spray Header visual inspection interval be revised from every 18 months (25%) to 24 months
(+25%).

Extension of the surveillance interval for Electrical Tunnel and Diesel Generator Building Fire Protection System
functional tests will have virtually no impact upon the operability of these systems. These systems are accessible
during normal operation and other sections of the Technical Specifications (4.14.A.1.g.(i) and 4.14.B.1.a(i))
require that the system valve tests be conducted on an annual (12 month) basis. These annual tests would reveal any
system deterioration prior to the conclusion of the proposed extended surveillance interval.

For the Fan Cooler Fire Protection System as well as the Spray Header itself, evaluation of surveillance data from
the past five refueling outages indicates minor discrepancies which would not have impaired system operability.

It is therefore concluded that extension of the proposed surveillance interval will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
 
For the Electrical Tunnel and Diesel Generator Building, extension of the surveillance interval will have a negligible
affect as other portions of the Technical Specifications require the same surveillance on an annual basis. For the
spray header and the fan cooler fire protection system, historical surveillance data validates operability over
an 18 month (+25%) interval which lends confidence to conclude that operability will be maintained over a 24 month
(+25%) interval. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated has not been introduced.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

Extension of the surveillance for two systems will have minimal impact as the Technical Specifications impose more
frequent testing for system valves on an annual basis. For the Spray Header and Fan Cooler Fire Protection System,
as well as the fire protection system for the Diesel Generator Building and Electrical Tunnel, it can be stated that
these systems are static existing mainly in a standby capacity under which little deterioration would be expected.
Past surveillance data validates system reliability. It is therefore concluded that increasing the time interval
between inspections would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

(15) Penetration Fire Barriers 
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the visual inspection frequency of the penetration fire barriers listed in the Technical Specifications
be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).

The fire barrier penetration seals are static devices existing in standby status. Normal environmental conditions
exist during normal plant operations. The only deterioration expected would be that due to aging in a normal ambient
which would be minimal to non-existent. Evaluation of unacceptable seals detected during surveillances indicates
that initial seal installation was faulty and aging was not the cause. Surveillances during four refueling outages
confirm this evaluation. Accordingly, it is not expected that the proposed change in surveillance interval will
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

Past surveillances indicate that time is not a predominate failure mechanism. In the few unacceptable seals detected,
the initial installation procedure has been identified as the cause of the problems. Since the seals are static devices
which exist in a standby condition and experience normal ambient conditions during normal operation, this would
be the expected conclusion. In addition, the fire barriers are just one means of fire protection. Other means of fire
protection exist such as fire alarms, sprinklers and heat detectors which provide defense in depth. Thus, it is concluded
that the proposed change in the surveillance interval will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from that previously evaluated.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

Aging has not been identified as a principle contributor to seal failures. In addition, there exists additional means
of fire protection which provides defense in depth. Therefore, the proposed change in surveillance intervals is
not expected to involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

(16) Smoke Detectors/Electrical Penetration Area Inside Containment

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the surveillance interval for the smoke detectors located in the electrical penetration area
inside containment be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
Based on data taken from six surveillances from 1984 through and including 1993, these devices have proven to be highly
reliable. No test failures were observed during this period. Based on the guidance contained in Generic Letter 91-04,
this demonstration of reliable performance provides an adequate basis to conclude that the proposed extension in
the surveillance interval will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

Only 3 of the 5 detectors are required during normal operation. Past surveillance data from six refueling outages
indicate that it is reasonable to expect all 5 detectors will remain operable over the extended operating cycle which
provides margin. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated has not been created.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The proven reliability of these devices indicates that a significant reduction in the margin of safety would not be
involved in extending the operating cycle to 24 months (+25%).

(17) Functional Testing of Containment Sump Pumps

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the functional test of the Containment Sump Pump be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every
24 months (+25%).

No credit is taken within the FSAR for the Containment Sump Pumps as a means of mitigating the consequences of an accident.
During normal operation the pumps serve as a means of quantifying leakage inside Containment and therefore serve
a safety function in terms of accident prevention. However, in this capacity they are only one of several systems which
are capable of serving this function and their failure would not result in a loss of this capability.

In addition, evaluation of surveillance data back to 1986 indicates, with one exception, that the devices are very
reliable. In one instance, the pumps did not actuate or cause operation within the setpoint tolerance but did operate
as required. This was determined not to be a time dependent event.

It is therefore concluded that extending the interval between refueling surveillances will not result in a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
Past surveillances indicate that time is not a predominate failure mechanism. Also, there exists a Technical Specification
requirement to perform almost the same surveillance on a monthly basis in addition to every refueling outage. This
monthly test diminishes any potential risk in extending the operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

Past surveillance data indicates that pump operation is reliable. In addition, there are alternate means of providing
the safety function fulfilled by these pumps. Also, a monthly test is required which would detect any malfunction
prior to the end of an extended operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that extending the operating cycle by several
months will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

County, Florida




Date of amendment request: 

November 2, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments will upgrade existing TS 3/4.6.2.1 and TS 3/4.6.2.3 by adapting the combined specification
for Containment Spray and Cooling Systems, contained in the Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering
Plants, to the St. Lucie units. The changes account for plant-specific differences and include all related requirements
of NUREG-1432, Rev. O, specification 3.6.6A. Accordingly, the proposal is consistent with the Commission's Final
Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements (58 FR 39132).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:

(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed amendment will upgrade the existing Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) associated with the Containment
Cooling and Spray Systems to be consistent with NUREG-1432, Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering
Plants. The Containment Cooling and Spray Systems are not initiators of accidents previously evaluated, but are
included as part of the success paths associated with mitigating various accidents and transients. The redundancy
afforded by Containment Cooling and Spray Systems in conjunction with the requirements of the proposed LCO assures
that the safety function of these systems can be accomplished considering single failure criteria. Neither the design
nor the safety function of the Containment Cooling and Spray Systems have been altered, and the proposed amendment
does not change the applicable plant safety analyses. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
The changes are administrative in nature in that they do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification
of existing equipment, nor do they otherwise alter the design of St. Lucie Unit 1 & 2 systems. Therefore, operation
of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The safety function of the Containment Cooling System is to provide containment heat removal during normal operation
and accident conditions. The safety function of the Containment Spray System is to provide containment heat and iodine
removal during accident conditions. The proposed amendment, in conjunction with the redundancy afforded by the
Containment Cooling and Spray system design, assures that these safety functions can be accomplished considering
single-failure criteria. The bases for required actions and the action completion times specified for inoperable
Containment Cooling and Spray trains are consistent with the corresponding specifications in NUREG-1432. The safety
analyses for applicable accidents and transients remain unchanged from those previously evaluated and reported
in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed
amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Based on the above discussion and the supporting Evaluation of Technical Specification changes, FPL has determined
that the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 7, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change the number of diesel generators (emergency power supply) required to be operable
during Mode 5 with the loops filled and Mode 6 with greater than or equal to 23 feet of water above the reactor vessel flange.
In addition, changes to certain system specifications that are affected by the changes for the emergency power supply
were also proposed. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously
evaluated.

The equipment which is affected by the technical specification changes proposed here are not precursors to any accident
postulated to occur in Modes 5 and 6. Therefore, the probability of an accident is not increased. A design review has
demonstrated the ability of the required systems to perform their accident mitigation functions for the postulated
accidents during Mode 5 and 6 operation. Therefore, it is concluded that an increase in the consequences of the postulated
accidents will not result from the proposed Technical Specifications.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The system design, function, and performance is not affected by these specifications. No new equipment interactions
are created. Calculations and Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEA) have been conducted for selected mechanical
systems and show there are no failures which would cause situations where applicable accidents would not be mitigated
or which would cause new accidents. On this basis, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The electrical power system specifications support the equipment required to be operable, commensurate with the
current level of safety, including the equipment requiring a diesel backed power source. The design review results
demonstrate that operation in Modes 5 and 6, in accordance with the proposed Technical Specification changes, is
acceptable from an accident mitigation standpoint. The basic Modes 5 and 6 plant system functions are not changed.
On this basis, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 7, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would permit both containment personnel airlock doors to be open while moving fuel during
refueling operations.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?

The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.9.4, Containment Building Penetrations, would allow the containment
personnel airlock to be open during fuel movement and core alterations. The containment personnel airlock is closed
during fuel movement and core alterations to prevent the escape of radioactive material in the event of a fuel handling
accident. The containment personnel airlock is not an initiator to any accident. Whether the containment personnel
airlock doors are open or closed during fuel movement and core alterations has no affect on the probability of any accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed change does alter assumptions previously made in evaluating the radiological consequences of the fuel
handling accident inside the reactor containment building. The proposed change allows for the containment personnel
airlock to be open during refueling. The radiological consequences described in this change are bounded by those
given in the South Texas Project Safety Evaluation Report and General Design Criteria 19. All doses for the proposed
change are less than the acceptance criteria, therefore, there is no significant increase in the consequences of
an accident previously analyzed.

The proposed change will significantly reduce the dose to workers in the containment in the event of a fueling handling
accident by accelerating the containment evacuation process. The proposed change will also significantly decrease
the wear on the containment personnel airlock doors and, consequently, increase the reliability of the containment
personnel airlock doors in the event of an accident.

Since the probability of a fuel handling accident is unaffected by the airlock door positions, and the increased doses
do not exceed acceptance limits, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?

The proposed change affects a previously evaluated accident, e.g., a fuel handling accident inside containment.
The existing accident has been modified to account for the containment personnel airlock doors being opened at the
time of the accident. It does not represent a significant change in the configuration or operation of the plant and,
therefore, does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The margin of safety is reduced when the offsite and control room doses exceed the acceptance criteria in the STP SER.
As previously discussed in the response to question 1, the offsite and control room doses are below the acceptance
criteria. Therefore, this proposed change does not significantly reduce the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 8, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would require only one of the two battery chargers associated with each Class 1E 125 VDC Channel
I and Channel IV to be operable.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously
evaluated.

A single charger is able to maintain the operability of Channel I or Channel IV at the design loading with a single failure
condition. The proposed change does not alter equipment or assumptions made in previously evaluated accidents.
The consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not increased. On this basis, the proposed change does not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed change involves only the operability requirement for the second battery charger in Channel I and Channel
IV. The failure modes and operating modes would then be identical for all four STPEGS Class 1E DC channels. Failure
modes and effects analyses already performed for DC Channels II and III would thus become applicable to Channels I
and IV also. The change proposed by this Technical Specification revision is bounded by the failure modes and effects
analysis provided as Table 8.3-8 of the STPEGS UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report]. On this basis, the proposed
change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change involves only the operability requirement for the second battery charger in Channel I and Channel
IV. The number and capacity of DC channels required is not affected by the proposed change. The electrical loads supported
by these DC channels are not changed and the duration of their function is not impacted. On this basis, the proposed
change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 8, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would permit the substitution of an extended range neutron flux monitor for one of the source
range neutron flux monitors during refueling operations.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as
previously evaluated.
 
During refueling operations, the Source Range channels are used only for monitoring changes in core reactivity,
and does not provide inputs for automatically actuated equipment. The same function could be performed by an Extended
Range channel. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient
to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. By providing the intended redundant
core reactivity monitoring, neither the possibility or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are increased.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

During refueling operations, the Source Range Monitors are used simply as monitoring instrumentation. Extended
Range Monitors are capable of performing this function. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed
Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes.

The proposed change would require revision of STP refueling procedures. However, the physical movement of fuel assemblies
is within the scope of current refueling procedures. No new mechanism for fuel misloading or damage or boron dilution
would be created by the change. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change provides core reactivity monitoring comparable to that provided by the use of the Source Range
channels. The Extended Range channel is capable of detecting core reactivity changes and provides the intended redundancy.
The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the
detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. No margin of safety is compromised by this change. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Atomic Power Station, Lincoln County, Maine




Date of amendment request: 

October 24, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specifications Table 4.1-3 surveillance requirements for new emergency
feedwater flow instrumentation. Specifically, the currently installed analog feedwater flow transmitters would
be replaced by new, digital-type flow transmitters. The new digital flow emergency feedwater flow transmitters
are continuously self-checking and have a recommended calibration interval of 9 years. The licensee proposes to
verify flow whenever the system operates and send one transmitter back to the manufacturer for recalibration every
refueling outage.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's analysis
is presented below:
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the  probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
Performance of Technical Specifications Table 4.1-3 (items 10 a and b) ensures the emergency feedwater flow transmitters
are operable when required. The proposed change will continue to ensure operabililty and therefore will not increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
Emergency feedwater flow transmitter operability verification is maintained, with no change to the system's configuration.
Thus, there is no unique operating condition that could adversely affect system functional performance.
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
There is no change to any Final Safety Analysis Report Chapter 14 (Safety Analysis) event. There is no change to the
demonstration of component operability; thus, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a
margin of safety. 
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

October 7, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would remove from the Technical Specifications certain audit responsibilities of the Nuclear
Safety Audit Review Committee and certain review responsibilities of the Station Operation Review Committee relating
to the Emergency Plan and Security Plan and their implementing procedures. The proposed changes are consistent with
the guidance of Generic Letter 93-07.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below.
A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated
and do not change any facility design feature or equipment. Since there is no change to the facility or operating procedures,
there is no affect upon the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed.
B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because they do not affect the manner by which
the facility is operated. The proposed changes merely affect audit and review responsibilities and their deletion
or relocation to other controlled documents does not introduce new or different accident scenarios.
C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed
changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated or involve equipment or features which affect the
operational characteristics of the facility.
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO), Docket No. 50-245, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, New London
County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

October 14, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change clarifies the low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) requirements as required by Technical Specification
4.5.A.2. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



NNECO has reviewed the proposed change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and concluded that the change does not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

The LPCI flow surveillance requirement to demonstrate that three pumps can deliver 15,000 gpm does not relate to any
previously analyzed accident. There are no accident scenarios which rely upon three pumps or 15,000 gpm. The existing
scenarios are more limiting in that they rely on, at the most, two LPCI pumps. The actual testing of the pumps in accordance
with the [inservice testing] IST program and Technical Specification 4.13 will not change. The testing of the pumps
currently performed demonstrates that LPCI will function to mitigate the postulated accidents. Therefore, the
elimination of the requirement to demonstrate that three pumps can deliver 15,000 gpm will not involve an increase
in the probability or consequence of any previously evaluated accident. 
The elimination of a requirement to test the LPCI header instrumentation can not result in an increase to the probability
or consequence of an accident, since no such instrumentation exists, or is required.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed change will remove a requirement to perform a mathematical evaluation that provides no safety benefit.
There is no change in the test methodology currently performed. All four LPCI pumps are tested. Deleting the requirement
to verify that three LPCI pumps can produce 15,000 gpm flow does not create the possibility of a new or different type
of accident.

Deleting the requirement to test the LPCI spray header instrumentation can not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident, since there is no LPCI header instrumentation. This change corrects an error which was introduced
by an earlier License Amendment.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

This change to the LPCI testing requirements does not change any of the actual testing, or individual component requirements
which exist for the LPCI system. The change to remove the three pump, 15,000 gpm flow requirement eliminates the need
to calculate a value which provides no relevant information in ascertaining the ability of the LPCI system to perform
its required safety function. The existing testing ensures performance of the LPCI subsystem in accordance with
the accident analysis requirements. The intent of the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement remains
unchanged. Elimination of the requirement to test the LPCI header instrumentation corrects an error introduced
in an earlier License Amendment. No LPCI header instrumentation exists, therefore, no credit was taken for such instrumentation
in determining the margin of safety.

This change can not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since there are no changes to the surveillance
requirements for any of the individual components of the LPCI system.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed amendments would change the submittal frequency of the Radioactive Effluent Release Report from semiannual
to annual in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36a. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated 

The proposed license amendments are requested to implement a revision to 10 CFR 50.36a. The requested amendment[s]
does not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluents, nor do they affect any accident evaluations.
Also, the requested amendments do not involve any physical alterations to the plant with respect to radioactive effluents.
The proposed changes would only affect the reporting requirements concerning routine data for radioactive effluents.

Therefore, the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not affected by any of the proposed
amendments.

2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed

The proposed license amendments are requested to implement a revision to 10C FR 50.36a. The requested amendment[s]
does not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluents, nor do they involve any physical alterations
to the plant with respect to radioactive effluents. Also, the requested amendments do not change the method by which
any safety-related system performs its function. The proposed changes would only affect the reporting requirements
concerning routine data for radioactive effluents.

Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated would not
be created.

3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety 

The proposed license amendments are requested to implement a revision to 10 CFR 50.36a. The requested amendment[s]
does not alter any administrative controls over radioactive effluents, nor do they involve any physical alterations

Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-387 and 50-388 Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1
and 2, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania




Date of amendment request: 

October 25, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would add to the Susquehanna Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications, isolation signals to Table 3.6.3-1
for the containment isolation valves on the sample lines for the containment radiation monitoring (CRM) and wetwell
sample lines. This change is based on the licensee's design change for installation of a new CRM and wetwell sample
system. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The addition of the new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not affect any of the postulated initiating events identified
in Chapter 6 and 15 of the FSAR, the Design Assessment Report, the current Reload Analysis or the NRC Safety Evaluation
Report (NUREG 0776).

The new CRM and Wetwell Sample System with separate containment sample lines is isolated from the primary containment
under accident conditions. The power and control-power to the CRM from the Class 1E Division I and Division II sources
is through electrical isolation schemes so that failure(s) in the CRM under accident conditions is isolated from
the Class 1E systems.

The addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System with separate sample lines and isolation valves does represent
a change in the probability of occurrence of a malfunction of equipment. The addition of the auxiliary relay to the
Division I and Division II CAC System containment isolation logic does represent the source of another potential
malfunction in the logic due to the additional relay in the circuit. However, the increase in probability due to the
additional relay is considered to be so small or insignificant that the change is within the error bounds associated
with the original design calculations and does not constitute a significant increase in probability of the overall
system malfunction.

Thus, the addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not significantly increase the probability of occurrence
or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety, as previously evaluated in the
SAR.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
 
Chapter 6 and 15 of the FSAR, the Design Assessment Report, the current Reload Analysis and NUREG-0776 were reviewed
to determine if the proposed action had the potential of creating a postulated initiating event which was not within
the spectrum of events which transient or anticipated operational occurrences and accident conditions were analyzed.
The review did not identify a postulated initiating event which would create the possibility for an accident of a different
type. 

A random single failure in the CRM A or CRM B does not create a malfunction of a different type. A random single failure
in the existing containment isolation circuitry, the new isolation valve control circuitry or the new valve position
indication circuitry for the new containment isolation valves does not create a malfunction of a different type.
The consequences of random single failure of the CRM or the CRM and Wetwell containment isolation valve isolation
signal, control and indication circuitry is the same as the existing consequences.

Thus, the addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not create a possibility for an accident or malfunction
of a new or different type.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The operability of the primary containment isolation valves for the sample lines to the new CRMs and Wetwell Sample
Rack is governed by Technical Specification Section 3/4.6.3 entitled ``Containment Systems, Primary Containment
Isolation Valves'' with Table 3.6.3-1 establishing the maximum isolation time. The bases for operability of the
primary containment isolation valves is to ensure that the containment atmosphere is isolated from the outside environment
in the event of a release of radioactive material to the containment atmosphere or pressurization of the containment.
This is consistent with GDC 54 through 57 of 10 CFR 50, Appendix A. The bases for the containment isolation within the
time limits specified in Table 3.6.3-1 is for those isolation valves designed to close automatically to ensure that
the release of radioactive material to the environment is consistent with the assumptions used in the analyses for
a LOCA. The new CRM and Wetwell Sample Rack sample line isolation valves are solenoid valves which close immediately
on an accident signal. The proposed action does not affect the operability requirements of Section 3/4.6.3. The margin
of safety as defined in the Technical Specification for the containment isolation valves is not affected. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

November 11, 1994


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendment would modify the technical specifications (TS) by deleting accelerated testing and special
reporting requirements for CPSES Units 1 and 2 emergency diesel generators. These changes are based on Generic Letter
94-01, ``Removal of Accelerated Testing and Special Reporting Requirements for Emergency Diesel Generators,''
dated May 31, 1994.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?

Deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures has no relation to probability or consequences
of accidents. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

There are no initiating events in accidents previously evaluated that involve testing of EDGs. Therefore, deletion
of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously
evaluated.

A reduction in the number of test starts decreases EDG component stress and wear and decreases unavailability time
for maintenance and pre and post run checks. The resulting change in EDG reliability and availability is an improvement
toward ensuring the EDGs are capable of fulfilling their functional requirement to provide electric power for safe
shutdown of the plant during loss of offsite power. Furthermore, implementation of the maintenance rule provisions
for performance monitoring and root cause analysis for failures as a basis for establishing corrective actions establish
an alternate reliability basis that is at least equivalent to that established by accelerated testing. Therefore,
deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.



2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?



Deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures introduces no new failure modes for the EDGs or other
plant systems and therefore has no relation to creation of accidents. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for
special reporting of EDG failures does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

The frequency at which EDG testing occurs does not affect the potential failure modes of the EDGs, which have already
been assessed in the CPSES design. Therefore, deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.



3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?



Acceptance limits and failure values are not affected by the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures. Therefore,
deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.

The margin of safety impact associated with accelerated testing relates to EDG reliability and availability. A reduction
in the number of test starts decreases EDG component stress and wear and decreases unavailability time for maintenance
and pre and post run checks. The resulting change in EDG reliability and availability is an improvement toward ensuring
the EDGs are capable of fulfilling their functional requirement to provide electric power for safe shutdown of the
plant during loss of offsite power. Furthermore, implementation of the maintenance rule provisions for performance
monitoring and root cause analysis for failures as a basis for establishing corrective actions establish an alternate
reliability basis that is at least equivalent to that established by accelerated testing. Therefore, deletion of
accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not affect the failure values of any system or any event acceptance criteria. Higher cycle-specific
allowances ensure that remains below its limit between surveillances and within the bounds considered in the safety
analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request: 

November 8, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications to allow application
of a voltage-based repair limit for the steam generator (SG) tube support plate (TSP) intersections experiencing
outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC). 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



This proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed change will not:

1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no TSP restraint) at room temperature conditions show burst
pressures in excess of 5,000 psig for indications of ODSCC with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing
performed on five intersections pulled from the Kewaunee SGs with up to a 2 volt indication showed measured tube burst
in the range of 9,537 to 9,756 psig. Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5 volt indications
show burst pressures in excess of 6,300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material
properties and the minimum strength levels, tube burst capability significantly exceeds the safety factor requirements
of RG 1.121.

Tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions due to the presence of the TSPS.
Test data indicates that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes with through wall EDM notches 0.75 inch
long, when the notch is adjacent to the TSP. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operating conditions, the
criterion that must be satisfied to demonstrate adequate tube integrity is a safety margin of 1.43 times MSLB pressure
differential. From Figure 3-2 of EPRI report TR-100407, the BOC structural limit for 7/8 inch diameter tubing is 9.6
volts. Applying an allowance of 20% for NDE uncertainty and 50% for crack growth rate over an operating cycle results
in a voltage repair limit of 5.6 volts. The proposed repair limit of 2 volts is very conservative when compared to the
5.6 volts taking into account the low average growth rates experienced at Kewaunee and the high tube burst pressures.

Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, a plant specific calculation was performed
to determine the maximum primary-to-secondary leakage during a postulated MSLB event. The evaluation considered
both pre-accident and accident initiated iodine spikes. The results of the evaluation show that the accident spike
yielded the limiting leak rate. This case was based on a 30 rem thyroid dose at the site boundary and initial primary
and secondary coolant activity levels of 1.0 uCi/gm and 0.1 uCi/gm dose equivalent iodine-131, respectively. A leak
rate of 34.0 gpm was determined to be the upper limit for allowable primary to secondary leakage in the SG in the faulted
loop. The SG in the intact loop was assumed to leak at a rate of 0.1 gpm (150 gpd).

Application of the voltage-based repair limit will be supplemented with a projected EOC MSLB leakage calculation
and conditional burst probability assessment. The methodology for performing these calculations will be consistent
with that discussed in the draft GL until final guidance is published. Should the projected MSLB leakage be exceeded
indications will be repaired or removed from service until the projected leakage is less than or equal to 34.0 gpm.

Application of the voltage-based repair limit will not adversely affect SG tube integrity. Therefore, the proposed
amendment will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

Implementation of the proposed voltage-based repair limit will not reduce the overall safety or functional requirements
of the SG tube bundles. The tube burst criteria will be satisfied during normal operating conditions by the presence
of the TSPs. The RG 1.121 criteria that must be satisfied during accident loading conditions is 1.43 times MSLB differential
pressure. Conservatively, the existing data base of burst testing shows that the tube burst margins can be satisfied
with bobbin coil signal amplitudes of about 8.82 volts or less regardless of the depth of tube wall penetration.

The proposed repair criteria will be supplemented with a reduced operating leakage requirement of 150 gpd average
through either SG to preclude the potential for excessive leakage during operating conditions. The 150 gpd restriction
will provide for timely leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single
crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. The operating leakage limit
is based on leak-before break considerations, critical crack length and predicted leakage.

The SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained through inservice inspections and primary-to-secondary leakage
monitoring. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
Application of the voltage-based repair criteria has been demonstrated to maintain tube integrity commensurate
with the RG 1.121 criteria. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the staff for meeting GDCs 2, 14, 15, 31 and 32.
This is accomplished by determining the limiting degradation of SG tubing as established by inservice inspection,
beyond which tubes should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the repair criteria, even under the worst
case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSPs is not expected to lead to a SG tube rupture event during normal
or faulted conditions. The most limiting event would be a potential increase in leakage during a MSLB event. Excessive
leakage during a MSLB is precluded by verifying that the expected EOC crack distribution of ODSCC indications at TSP
locations would result in an acceptably low primary-to-secondary leakage. Therefore, the radiological consequences
from tubes remaining in service is a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 limits.

The combined effects of a LOCA plus SSE on the SGs were assessed as required by GDC 2. This issue was addressed for the
Kewaunee SGs through the application of leak-before-break (LBB) principles to the primary loop piping. Based on
the results of this analysis, it is concluded that the LBB is applicable to the Kewaunee primary loops and, thus, the
probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural
design basis of the plant. Excluding breaks in the primary loops, the LOCA loads from the large branch lines were also
assessed and found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in SG tube collapse. Based on these analysis results,
no tubes are expected to collapse or deform to the degree that secondary-to-primary in-leakage would be increased
over currently expected levels. On this basis no tubes need to be excluded from the voltage-based repair criteria
for reasons of deformation resulting from combined LOCA and SSE loadings.

Addressing the RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the voltage-based repair criteria will include a 100%
bobbin coil probe inspection of all TSP intersections with known ODSCC down to the lowest cold leg TSP identified.
This will be supplemented by a reduced operating leakage limit, enhanced eddy current data analysis guidelines,
MRPC inspection requirements and a projected EOC voltage distribution. It is concluded that the proposed change
will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Evergreen Fund, et al.; Notice of Application



December 1, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

The Evergreen Fund, The Evergreen Total Return Fund, The Evergreen Limited Market Fund, Inc., The Evergreen Growth
and Income Fund, The Evergreen Money Market Trust, The Evergreen American Retirement Trust, The Evergreen Municipal
Trust, The Evergreen Real Estate Equity Trust, The Evergreen Fixed Income Trust, The Evergreen Foundation Trust
(the ``Evergreen Funds''), and Evergreen Asset Management Corp. (the ``Adviser'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) of the Act to grant an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 18(f), 18(g),
18(i), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants request an order to permit the Evergreen Funds to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests
in the same portfolio of securities, and to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a contingent
deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') upon certain redemptions of shares.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Evergreen Fund, The Evergreen Total Return Fund, The Evergreen Growth and Income Fund, The Evergreen Money
Market Trust, The Evergreen American Retirement Trust, The Evergreen Municipal Trust, The Evergreen Real Estate
Equity Trust, The Evergreen Fixed Income Trust, and The Evergreen Foundation Trust are Massachusetts business trusts
and are registered open-end management investment companies. The Evergreen Limited Market Fund, Inc. is a Maryland
corporation and is a registered open-end management investment company. The Evergreen American Retirement Trust,
The Evergreen Municipal Trust, The Evergreen Real Estate Equity Trust, The Evergreen Fixed Income Trust, and The
Evergreen Foundation Trust (collectively, the ``Trusts'') currently offer their shares in separate series.

2. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Evergreen Funds and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Union
National Bank of North Carolina. The distributor of the Funds is Evergreen Funds Distributor, Inc., a subsidiary
of Furman Selz Incorporated. Applicants request relief on behalf of applicants and any existing
 or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof representing a separate investment
portfolio for which the Adviser, or an entity controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, serves now or
in the future as investment adviser (collectively, the ``Funds'').

<PARENT> FR941207-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. The Funds currently offer one class of shares (the ``Existing Class''). The Existing Class is not subject to any
sales or redemption charges and is not subject to any charges pursuant to a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b-1
under the Act. Shares of the Existing Class have been primarily sold to individuals and institutional investors through
referrals and general media advertisements. Applicants currently propose to establish a multiple class distribution
system that would authorize each Fund to sell four classes of its shares, Class Y, Class A, Class B, and Class C. Applicants
also propose that the Funds be able to create additional classes of shares in the future.
4. Applicants propose that the current shares of each Existing Class be redesignated as Class Y shares. Class Y shares
will not be subject to any sales charges or fees pursuant to a rule 12b-1 distribution plan or shareholder services
plan. Class Y shares will be sold solely to (a) all shareholders of record in one or more of the Evergreen Funds prior
to the commencement of the multi-class distribution, (b) institutional investors, and (c) investment advisory
clients of the Adviser or affiliates of the Adviser.
5. Class A, Class B, and Class C shares will be offered primarily to individual investors. Class A shares will be offered
with a front-end sales load and will be subject to a distribution fee under a rule 12b-1 distribution plan. Class
B shares will be offered without a front-end sales load, but will be subject to a CDSC and distribution fees under a rule
12b-1 distribution plan. After a specified period, Class B shares will convert to Class A shares. Class C shares
will be offered without a front-end sales load and also will be subject to a CDSC and distribution fees under a rule 12b-1
distribution plan. The Class C CDSC will only apply for the first year after purchase and Class C shares will have no
conversion privileges.
6. Each Fund may also enter into servicing agreements (``Shareholder Servicing Agreements'') with broker-dealers,
banks, and financial institutions with respect to each newly created class of shares to provide various shareholder
record keeping, administrative, personal, and support services to their customers. While it is currently anticipated
that payments made under Shareholder Servicing Agreements will be pursuant to a rule 12b-1 plan, a Fund may in
the future make such payments pursuant to a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder servicing plan in the event such a plan
is duly adopted by the Fund in accordance with condition 5 of this application. The services provided under a Shareholder
Servicing Agreement will augment (and not be duplicative of) the services provided by the Adviser or the Fund's custodian.
7. Each class of shares would be identical in all respects, except for: (a) The impact of expenses described in condition
1 below that are attributable only to certain classes (``Class Expenses''); (b) the fact that the classes will vote
separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b-1 distribution plan, and if applicable, any shareholder servicing
plan; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) any conversion feature applicable to a class
of shares; and (e) different class designations.
8. All classes of shares of a Fund will bear Fund or Trust expenses on the basis of the relative net asset value of the classes.
Expenses specific to a class will be allocated to that class. A Fund's investment adviser may choose to reimburse or
waive Class Expenses of certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed
by the Adviser may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously
expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder
expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.
9. In addition, the Adviser may voluntarily waive or reimburse Trust expenses and/or Fund expenses (with or without
a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Trust expenses and/or Fund
expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Trust expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited
to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Fund expenses that are waived
or reimbursed would be credited to each class of that Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Trust
expenses and Fund expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive
or reimburse Trust expenses or Fund expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.
10. Because Class Expenses and payments made under a rule 12b-1 distribution plan or non-rule 12b-1 shareholder
services plan may differ for each class, the per share net income of, and dividends on, each class may differ from the
net income of, and dividends on, the other classes of shares of a Fund. In addition, except for Funds that seek to maintain
a stable net asset value and declare dividends daily, the net asset value attributable to each class of shares of a Fund
may differ.
11. Shares of a class of one Fund will be exchangeable for shares of the same class of another Fund. Any exchanges will
comply with the provisions of rule 11a-3 under the Act.
12. Shares of certain classes, including Class B and Class C, may be subject to the imposition of a CDSC if they are redeemed
within a prescribed time after their purchase (the ``CDSC Period''). The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as a
specified percentage of the lesser of the net asset value at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption.
13. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing increases in the value of shares due to capital appreciation, redemptions
of shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions, or redemptions of shares held
by longer than the CDSC Period. In determining whether the CDSC is payable, it will be assumed that shares not subject
to the CDSC are redeemed first and that other shares are then redeemed in the order purchased. This will result in a charge,
if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate.
14. If a shareholder pays a CDSC upon redemption and a reinvestment occurs within a specified time period stated in
the prospectus in effect at the time the shares are sold, the shareholder may receive a credit, paid by the distributor,
for any CDSC paid.
15. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC on certain redemptions. Any waiver of the CDSC will comply
with the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d-1 under the Act.
16. Shares of some classes subject to a CDSC (``Convertible CDSC Shares'') retained by an investor past a prescribed
period following the purchase of Convertible CDSC Shares will convert into shares of other classes not subject to
a CDSC (``Non-CDSC Shares''). Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid
with respect to Convertible CDSC Shares also will be Convertible CDSC shares, but will convert to Non-CDSC Shares
on the earlier of a prescribed period following the date of such reinvestment or the conversion date of the most recently
purchased Convertible CDSC Shares not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions.
17. The sum of any front-end sales charge, asset-based sales charge, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales charge
as provided in Article III, Section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers
Inc. (``NASD'').

Applicant's Legal Analysis 


1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of shares might be deemed to result in the issuance of a ``senior security''
within the meaning of sections 18(g) of the Act and therefore might be deemed to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) and
to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation
of expenses and the voting rights in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any
group of shareholders.
2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a CDSC with respect
to certain redemptions of shares. Applicants believe that this request would allow shareholders the option of having
more investment dollars working for them from the time of their share purchases than if they invested in a class with
a front-end sales load.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and will be identical
in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The impact of the Class Expenses specifically attributable to the particular class which will be limited
to: fees payable pursuant to a rule 12b-1 distribution plan and/or shareholder servicing plan, if applicable;
transfer agent fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; fees and expenses
of a Fund's administrator that are identified and approved by the trustees or directors as being attributable to a
specific class of shares; printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as
shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders; ``blue sky'' registration fees incurred
by a class of shares; SEC registration fees incurred with respect to a class; the expense of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; litigation or other legal or audit expenses
relating solely to one class of shares; trustees' or directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one
class of shares; and any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to
one class and which are approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately
with respect to a Fund's distribution plan and/or shareholder servicing plan, if applicable, except as provided
in condition 17 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) the conversion feature applicable
only to Class B shares; and (e) the different class designation of each class of shares.
2. The trustees or directors of a Fund, including a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors, will approve
the multi-class distribution system. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees or directors of a Fund regarding
their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class distribution system will
reflect in detail the reasons for their determination that the proposed multi-class distribution system is in the
best interests of both a Fund and its shareholders.
3. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees or directors of each Fund, including a majority
of the trustees or directors who are not interested persons of a Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation
and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of trustees or directors,
and the trustees or directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the
purposes for which such expenditures were made.
4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees or directors of a Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the
Act and otherwise, will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes
of shares. The trustees or directors, including a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors, shall take
such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The adviser or distributor
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees or directors. If a conflict
arises, the adviser or distributor at its own cost will remedy such conflict by taking such steps as are necessary,
up to an including establishing a new registered management investment company.
5. Any shareholder services plan that may in the future be adopted with respect to a Fund will be adopted and operated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder
were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule
 12b-1.
6. The trustees or directors of a Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees or directors to justify any distribution
or servicing fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the disinterested trustees or directors in the exercise of their fiduciary
duties.
7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution and/or
shareholder service payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class
and any incremental transfer agency costs and other Class Expenses relating to a specific class of shares will be borne
exclusively by that class.

8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends, and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'')
who has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and
procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On
an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the
calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst,
an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' as defined and described in Statement
of Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and
the ongoing reports will each be a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar accounting standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 


9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value, dividends, and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between
the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 



10. The prospectus will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive
compensation for selling or servicing shares in a Fund may receive different compensation with respect to one particular
class of shares over another in the same Fund. 



11. Applicants will cause the distributor, and any successor to the distributor, to adopt compliance standards which
govern the circumstances under which each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants
will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. 




12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
or directors of each Fund with respect to the multi-class distribution system will be set forth in guidelines which
will be furnished to the trustees or directors. 



13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective
expenses 


 and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will
contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to each Fund
as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of
shares separately. 


14. The applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply
SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant
to its rule 12b-1 distribution plan or any shareholder services plan a Fund may adopt in the future in reliance
on the exemptive order. 


15. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.



16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class of shares 


 (``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion. 


17. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 distribution plans (or adopts or implements any amendment
to a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount of asset-based charges
that may be borne by Target Class shares for distribution or shareholder services, existing Purchase Class shares
will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class,
approve the proposal. The directors or trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase
Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material
respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously
were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors or trustees to implement
the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase
Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares
will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares (as well as other future classes
formed for other purposes) may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in
this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors or trustees reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the adviser or distributor.
Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal providing for the payment of higher distribution
and shareholder servicing fees with respect to Target Class shares may convert to Target Class shares subject to the
higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the proposal and the level of the higher distribution
and shareholder servicing fees under the amended Target Class Plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase
Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

Applicant's Representations



1. The Applicant was organized as a corporation under Maryland law on April 21, 1983 and dissolved as such on April 7,
1993.


2. On June 14, 1983, Applicant filed a registration statement under Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act and, on February 21,
1984, registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified investment management company. Also on June 14, 1983,
Applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, registering an indefinite number of shares
of Common Stock, $.01 par value. This registration statement was declared effective on February 21, 1984. The initial
public offering commenced February 21, 1984.


3. Applicant's only security holder was Phoenix Home Life Separate Account B (``Account B''). On August 5, 1992, Applicant's
Board of Directors unanimously approved the transfer of Applicant's assets and liabilities to Separate Account
P (``Account P'') of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company (``Phoenix-Home Life''). Account B and its depositor,
Phoenix-Home Life, voted all outstanding shares in favor of the reorganization, constituting more than two-thirds
of the shares outstanding that was required under Maryland law.

4. As of October 23, 1992, Applicant has one class of Common Stock outstanding, consisting of 1,239,689.6517 outstanding
shares. The aggregate net asset value of such shares and the net asset value per share were $13,615,073.83 and $10,9856,
respectively.

5. On October 26, 1992, Applicant's assets, consisting only of qualified plan assets, were transferred to Account
P, which contains only qualified plan assets. Account B became a contractholder of Account P. Account B and Account
P were not required to be registered under the 1940 Act in reliance on Section 3(c)(11) thereunder. In consideration
for the transfer, Account P assumed all of Applicant's liabilities and delivered to Applicant full and fractional
units of Account P equal to that number of full and fractional units of Account P as determined based on the relative
net asset values of Applicant and Account P as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on October 23, 1992 (the last
business day preceding the reorganization). Applicant distributed Account P units pro rata to Account B and simultaneously
Applicant's shares held by Account B were cancelled. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the transfer
of assets.

6. No assets were retained by Applicant after October 26, 1992, and no debts or other liabilities of Applicant remain
outstanding. Applicant has no security holders to whom distributions in complete liquidation have not been made.
Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding.


7. Phoenix-Home Life, the parent company to the Adviser and depositor of Account B and Account P, paid all of the direct
and indirect expenses of the reorganization, including any brokerage fees relating to transactions resulting from
the reorganization.

8. Other than as described above, during the past 18 months, Applicant has not, for any reason, transferred any of its
assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of the Applicant.

9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs.

10. Applicant has made all filings under the 1940 Act, including Form N-SAR filings, for each period for which
such filings were required.

Applicant's Representations 
 
 


1. The Applicant was organized as a corporation under Maryland law on June 3, 1970, and dissolved as such on April 7,
1993. 
 
2. On February 26, 1971, Applicant filed a registration statement under Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act and, on February
26, 1971, registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified investment management company. Also on February
26, 1971, Applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, registering 1,000,000 shares
of Common Stock, $10,00 par value. This registration statement was declared effective on September 14, 1971 as of
June 19, 1971. The initial public offering commenced September 14, 1971. 
 
3. On May 20, 1992, Applicant's Board of Directors unanimously approved the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
and Liquidation (``Plan'') and recommended it for shareholder approval. On September 21, 1992, at a Special Meeting
of Shareholders, 546,533.8323 shares out of the 690,437.4839 shares outstanding on the record date of August 4, 1992
(constituting more than the two-thirds of the shares outstanding that was required under Maryland law to approve
the Plan), voted in favor of the Plan. 
 
4. As of October 22, 1992, Applicant had one class of Common Stock outstanding, constituting 3,916,201.91 outstanding
shares. The aggregate net asset value and net asset value per share were $49,323,348.86 and $12.5949, respectively.
Applicant's only security holders were Phoenix Home Life Mutual insurance Company's (``Phoenix-Home Life'') Separate
Account B, Separate Account C, and Separate Account D (collectively, ``Separate Accounts''). 
 
5. On October 21, 1992, the Commission issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief from Section 17(a)

business trust organized on February 18, 1986 (``Growth Series''). 
 
6. On October 26, 1992, under the terms of the Plan, Applicant transferred its assets on the Growth Series. Under the
Plan, Applicant's security holders, the Separate Accounts, become Growth Series security holders. In consideration
for the transfer, the Growth Series assumed all of applicant's obligations and liabilities to the extent they existed
on or after the effective date of the reorganization and delivered to Applicant full and fractional shares of the Growth
Series, par value $1.00 per share, equal to that number of Growth Series share determined by multiplying the outstanding
number of Applicant's shares by the exchange ratio. The exchange ration was the number determined by dividing the
net asset value per share of Applicant's shares by the net asset value per share of the Growth Series shares, such values
determined as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on October 22, 1992 (the last business day preceding the reorganization).
Applicant distributed such Grow Series shares pro rata to its security holders and simultaneously Applicant's shares
held by its security holders were cancelled. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the transfer of
assets.

including any brokerage fees relating to transactions resulting from the reorganization. 
 
9. Other than as described above, during the past 18 months, Applicant has not, for any reason, transferred any of its
assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of the Applicant. 
 
10. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs. 
 
11. Applicant has made all filings under the 1940 Act, including Form N-SAR filings, for each period for which
such filings were required.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Creating the
Chicago Match System</DOCTITLE>



November 30, 1994.



I. Introduction



On August 6, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to establish rules for an institutional trading system, the Chicago Match,
 that integrates an electronic order match system with a facility for brokering trades.






On August 19, 1993, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 On April 4, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change.
 On June 7, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 3 to the proposed rule change.
 On July 11, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission published all of these amendments for comment on August 5, 1994.
 On July 27, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission amendment No. 5 to the proposed rule change.
 By letter dated September 15, 1994, the CHX submitted Amendment No. 6 to the proposed rule change, which addressed
trading halts.
 Finally, on September 20, 1994, the CHX submitted to the Commission amendment No. 7 to the proposed rule change to clarify
the language concerning the priority of the CHX quote in the Chicago Match.
 These amendments made a variety of non-substantive, clarifying changes to the proposal and are incorporated into
the discussion below.












The Commission received two comment letters from the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') on this proposal
 and two letters from the CHX supporting its proposal and addressing the NYSE's comments.
 This order approves the proposed rule change, including all the amendments.





II. Overview of Proposal


A. General Description


Chicago Match is an electronic order matching system that will cross orders entered by users during regular trading
hours for securities that are listed on the CHX or for which the CHX has unlisted trading privileges. The match will
occur once a day at mid-day. Users may be CHX members or non-members, and will likely include institutional customers,
broker-dealers, and Chicago Match market makers. Users will be able to enter orders directly into Chicago Match through
personal computers and modems. A CHX member must be responsible for controlling and clearing the orders entered by
non-members.





The Chicago Match will electronically match users' orders in an allocation procedure described below. If an electronic
match occurs, the trade will be priced at the market price
 at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute period and will be executed at that time. If a match does not occur,
users will still have the opportunity to find the other side of their orders through participating brokers.






The Chicago Match will primarily operate off the Exchange floor, but CHX market makers may enter guarantees through
their regular terminals on the Exchange floor. Other users will be able to place buy and sell orders directly and anonymously
into the electronic system through off-floor terminals. Quotations from the CHX trading floor will automatically
be fed into the Chicago Match on a real time basis.
 The system will not otherwise directly interact with the Exchange's regular auction process.




All Chicago Match users will enter into a user agreement
 with the Exchange to be bound by the Exchange's rules governing the Chicago Match. Prior to the time a non-member user
enters an order into the system, it will be required to submit to the Exchange the name of the Midwest Clearing Corporation
(``MCC'') member through which the user will clear its trades and provide the Exchange with a copy of a ``Give-Up Agreement''
with such member. CHX clearing members will clear Chicago Match transactions through their existing clearing arrangements.






Prior to the cross, users will enter the following information for each order:





 stock ticker symbol;
 number of shares to be bought or sold;
 capacity (buy, sell or sell short);
 limit price (optional);
 minimum trade size (optional);
 excluded category of contra parties;
 names of individual excluded users (optional);





 liquidity fee or credit (optional);
 linked order conditions (optional);

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941207-2-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941207-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 near match range and near match broker (optional);
 order visibility; and
 clearing firm.

At any time up until the cross, users can review, edit or cancel their orders.



B. Market Maker Guarantees



In addition to orders entered by users, Chicago Match will include guarantees by Chicago Match market makers. Theses
market makers will be Exchange members who register with the Exchange to be Chicago Match market makers. As such, they
will be obligated to guarantee a minimum execution size to all users of the system. The minimum size of the guarantee
will be ten thousand shares for the two hundred securities listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the
Exchange with the highest consolidated trading volume, five thousand shares for the one hundred securities with
the next highest trading volume and two thousand shares for all other securities.
 Market maker guarantees automatically will be entered into the Chicago Match at the start of the time for order entry.





C. Priority and Liquidity Fees and Credits



Chicago Match permits the use of liquidity fees and liquidity credits to determine the level of priority for order
matching. In the Chicago Match, the size of the liquidity fee or liquidity credit determines the level of priority
for order matching. Those users that are willing to pay the highest liquidity fee will have the highest execution priority
(except for orders that are a part of the CHX quote, which have the highest priority of all orders). Those users desiring
to be paid for providing liquidity will have the lowest priority. Liquidity fees and credits will only be paid when
an order with a liquidity fee is matched with an order with a liquidity credit. When a match occurs, a liquidity fee that
is equal to the size of the liquidity credit will be paid. In all other cases, no liquidity fees will be paid. Users enter
liquidity fees and credits when they enter orders. The Chicago Match will include a default liquidity fee or credit
to be associated with a specific Chicago Match guarantee by a CHX market maker.
 Chicago Match market makers can improve this liquidity fee or credit and increase the size of their guarantee before
the cross takes place. 





The Chicago Match will limit the size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits entered by users. If a liquidity fee is
greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer for the particular security at cross time it will
be reduced to 1/2 of the spread at cross time. For example, if 1/2 of the spread is 61/4 cents, and an order with a liquidity
fee of 10 cents is entered, the maximum liquidity fee that order can pay will be 61/4 cents. Liquidity credits, however,
will be treated differently than liquidity fees. The Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be entered
in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. For example, if the spread of the Consolidated
Best Bid and Offer at cross time was 1/2 (50 cents), the maximum liquidity credit allowed would be 25 cents. If an order
was entered with a liquidity credit greater than 25 cents, the user would have the option of either having the liquidity
credit reduced to half of the spread or having the order excluded from the match.



D. Order Execution



The CHX's publicly disseminated bid or offer will be entered into Chicago Match as an order.
 Once entered, these orders will have the highest priority for execution.







All matched orders will be executed at a random time within a predetermined ten minute window period at the market price
at such time. The Chicago Match will calculate the market price as the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid
and Offer regardless of the size of the spread. For example, if the Consolidated Best Bid and Best Offer of stock X was
20-201/8, the cross price would be 201/16.

Limited price orders, orders with a liquidity fee or credit entered in cents, and orders that are entered with a liquidity
fee or credit relative to the Consolidated Best Bid or Offer or as a computed quantity (in addition to liquidity fees
or credits entered in cents) will be eligible to be displayed over the system. The Exchange will assign numeric values
to these orders based on the then current Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. The Exchange anticipates that initially
it will update displayed information at least every fifteen minutes.






Chicago Match users also may enter linked orders, which are defined as orders whose execution are conditioned on the
execution (or non-execution) of one or more orders. For example, a user may only want to sell stock X if he can buy stock
Z. A user would than link his sell order of stock X to his buy order of stock Z. When the match occurs, the user's order to
sell stock X will only be executed if the user's order to buy stock Z is also executed. Otherwise, both orders will remain
unmatched. The Exchange believes that permitting the linking of orders, and permitting orders that specify a limit
price, will give money managers greater cash management capabilities. The CHX states that this flexibility will
increase the effective match rate of the system relative to that of other crossing systems.

<DOCNO> FR941207-2-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941207-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Immediately prior to the match, all orders for a particular security first will be sorted into groups and then each
group will be prioritized for execution. Except for orders that are part of CHX's quote, which will receive the highest
priority for execution, a group will consist of either all buy orders or all sell orders in a security that have the same
liquidity fee or credit. Groups will be prioritized by liquidity fee or credit. Groups will be matched starting with
the group of buy orders with the highest priority. This group will be matched with the group of sell orders with the highest
priority. If the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is the same, all orders in both groups will be matched. If
the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is not the same, orders in the group with the smaller aggregate size will
be allocated among orders in the group with the larger size on a pro-rata basis, except that orders that are represented
as part of the CHX quote will be entitled to complete execution before the remaining orders are allocated on a pro rata
basis. If this results in any order receiving an odd lot or a mixed lot (

e.g., 

265 shares), the amount of shares that order receives shall be rounded down to the nearest round lot (

e.g., 

200 shares). All the odd lots for a particular group shall be aggregated and then allocated to the largest order in the
group. If, after matching orders in a buy group with orders in a sell group, unmatched orders remain in the group of buy
orders, Chicago Match will continue to process of matching this group with successively lower priority groups of
sell orders until all of the orders in the group of buy orders are either matched or are unable to be matched.
After completion of the match described above, Chicago Match will continue to process of matching groups and orders
within those groups, in accordance with the rules described above, starting with successively lower priority buy
order groups until no more matches can be made. Once all of the matches are made, Chicago Match will determine whether
any matched orders are conditional orders and if so, whether their conditions are fully satisfied.
A user may enter conditional orders specified in proposed Rule 6(e) of Article XXXVII of the CHX Rules.
 The possible conditions include, 

inter alia, 

a limit price, linked order condition, minimum size, and/or names of excluded users.
 In the event that certain conditions are not fully satisfied, Chicago Match will remove that order (and any other orders
whose conditions are not fully satisfied). Chicago Match will then erase the match for all orders in that security
and will restart the matching process excluding all conditional orders whose conditions are not fully satisfied
in the last matching process.





E. Near Match Procedures and Floor Broker Participation



The Chicago Match will allow users to send orders that are not executed in the match to a broker in the event of a ``near
match.'' A ``near match'' occurs when a buyer and seller in the system did not match merely because their required liquidity
fees and credits differed.
 In the event of a ``near match,'' the user will receive an administrative message over the system asking whether the
user wants a predetermined broker to negotiate a trade with another user that has entered similar ``near match'' parameters.
If both parties of the near match wish to negotiate, then the broker (or brokers) will receive a negotiate message.
 Users enter their specific ``near match'' parameters when they sign on to the system.





In addition, the Chicago Match provides another function similar to the ``near match'' function. The system allows
floor brokers to enter a message that, after the daily match, will tell the users of unexecuted orders in a particular
stock of an indication of continuing interest in buying or selling that stock.
 A user would then be free to contact the floor broker to negotiate a trade. Users will have the ability to prevent indications
from appearing on their screens.






F. Fees


Users other than Chicago Match market makers will have the option of having their orders displayed to other users of
the system. If a non-market maker user elects to have its order displayed, the order will be displayed under certain
circumstances.
 Orders entered by Chicago Match market makers and orders that are part of CHX's quote will not be charged a transaction
fee. Users who display orders will be charged 1/2 cent per share, and all other users will pay 2 cents per share. The Exchange
fee is separate from any liquidity fees and credits.

<DOCNO> FR941207-2-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941207-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Chicago Match market makers will be paid 1/8 of a cent per share, per order, when they do not participate in a cross in
their issue so long as the liquidity parameter entered by the Chicago Match market maker is within a pre-determined
range.

 This 1/8 of a cent per share fee will be paid by the Exchange out of the 1/2 cent or 2 cent user fee it will receive from users
of the Chicago Match. The Exchange believes that this will provide the Chicago Match market maker with an incentive
to provide guarantees.







G. Reporting 



Those orders that have been executed in the cross will be transmitted in a timely manner by Chicago Match to the Exchange
for recordation and reporting to the Consolidated Tape. The CHX will report trades to the Consolidated Tape or Nasdaq,
with one trade report for each stock executed in the Chicago Match. That trade report will include the total number
of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to the cross price plus (or minus) the volume weighted average of liquidity
fees paid (or liquidity credit received) for that stock. Trades will then be cleared by the designated clearing firm.
After receiving an execution report, users will be able to reallocate trades to different clearing brokers, if desired.
Immediately after the cross, users will be notified if their orders have been executed. If an order was not executed,
the user may receive a ``near match'' administrative message, described above. 



H. Trading Halts 



The Chicago Match rules provides that in the event of a halt in trading pursuant to CHX Article IX, Rule 10A (trading
halts due to extraordinary market volatility),
 the Exchange may delay the cross time until trading is permitted under that rule.








I. Short Sales



In order to ensure that an order to sell short will have no market impact, no order to sell short will be permitted to be
executed if it includes a liquidity fee. Liquidity credits, however, will be allowed.






J. Surveillance 



To protect against any potentially manipulative activity, the Exchange will, among other surveillance procedures,
monitor quote changes prior to the match and shortly thereafter to identify unusual trading activity. In addition,
by varying the cross time each day, the Chicago Match was designed to make it inherently more difficult to manipulate
the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer in order to receive a more favorable execution. 



III. Comments and the CHX Response to Comments



A. The NYSE's First Comment Letter 



The Commission received two comment letters on the proposal from the NYSE recommending that the Commission disapprove
the creation of Chicago Match. The first NYSE comment letter, submitted before publication of the amendments to the
CHX proposal, summarizes the Chicago Match, raises concerns about investors' orders, and discusses why the NYSE
believes the CHX proposal is inconsistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act regarding the national market
system's (``NMS'') disclosure and market integration requirements.
 The NYSE asserts that the Chicago Match would be a facility of the CHX, a national securities exchange, and as such,
the Commission cannot approve the proposal unless it concludes that the Chicago Match is consistent with Sections
6 and 11A of the Exchange Act.
 The NYSE asserts that the Chicago Match is not a passive order crossing system but rather a private auction being conducted
outside existing exchange facilities that are designed to protect investors. 






The NYSE also believes that the CHX is attempting to operate a form of ``proprietary trading system'' (``PTS'') or
exempt exchange. The NYSE states that the Commission has limited the operation of PTSs and refused to allow national
securities exchanges to operate them. The NYSE asserts that if the Commission decides to approve the Chicago Match
and applies the standards applicable to exempt exchanges and PTSs, it should do so only after a formal review of its
PTS policy. The NYSE further asserts that if such review results in a change of Commission policy, the Commission should
announce that all national securities exchanges are free to offer private systems outside existing NMS regulations.


The NYSE expressed concern that the Chicago Match's failure to report the true price to the Consolidated Tape Association
(``CTA'') would mislead investors. The NYSE asserts that the true price of the executions includes liquidity charges.
 The NYSE disputes the CHX's characterization of the liquidity charges as ``fees,'' asserting that when one investor's
payment is simply passed through to the investor on the other side of the trade, the payment is actually a part of the
price of the security purchased. Thus, the NYSE asserts that the liquidity charges should be included in the price
of the transaction.







The NYSE states that the proposal raises two transparency concerns. First, the NYSE asserts that Exchange Act Rule
11Aa3-1
 requires all exchanges to file a transaction reporting plan for securities traded through its facilities. Such plan
must provide for the collection and dissemination of ``transaction reports'' that contain, 

inter alia, 

the price associated with a transaction in a security. The NYSE essentially argues that the original proposal left
open the possibility of liquidity fees not being reported as a part of the price, thus violating Rule 11Aa3-1.

Second, the NYSE asserts that the CHX is proposing a private auction market outside of the NMS quotation facilities.
The NYSE states that the Chicago Match raises market structure issues similar to the issues it claims are raised by
the ``Selectnet'' System operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'').
 The NYSE asserts that both Selectnet and Chicago Match are inappropriately driven by orders that are hidden from public
view and that do not have the opportunity to interact with trading interest from other markets. The NYSE further asserts
that the presence of the ``near match'' function emphasizes that the proposal is merely a hidden auction market conducted
outside of the NMS because the ``near match'' function allows the participants to have a broker negotiate the transaction
outside of the auction process. The NYSE concludes that, while the Commission has sanctioned this result in the case
of PTSs, there is no precedent for allowing a national stock exchange to operate such a ``hidden auction.''





The NYSE letter also asserts that the Chicago Match violates Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1-1 (the ``Firm Quote Rule''
or ``Quote Rule'').
 The NYSE states that, like the Selectnet trading interest, Chicago Match orders that are displayed to other Chicago
Match participants are bids and offers under the Commission's rules because ``bid'' and ``offer'' are defined as
the ``prices communicated by an exchange member * * * to any broker or dealer, or to any customer, at
which he is willing to buy or sell one or more round lots of a reported security.''
 The NYSE states that Chicago Match users are bidding for and offering stock in accordance with the definition in Rule
11Ac1-1 and because the trading interest is firm, the CHX must take these quotations into account in calculating
the best bid and offer that it provides to the Consolidated Quote System (``CQS'').








The NYSE believes that the original proposal would lead to a failure to protect displayed limit orders. The NYSE states
that the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') has rules discouraging trade throughs, 

i.e.,

 the trading of a stock in one market at a price inferior to that in another market. Similarly, the ITS ``Block Policy''
provides price protection for quotations at the quoted price when a Block Policy transaction prints at inferior prices.
The NYSE states that the Chicago Match proposal violates these price protection rules. The NYSE further asserts that
the Chicago Match would ``formally bifurcate the retail and institutional markets, allowing large institutional
investors to trade outside the current market, without providing price protection for publicly-displayed retail
customer limit orders.''






The NYSE asserts that the initial proposal
 would allow the Chicago Match to accept short sales and would therefore operate in violation of Exchange Act Rule 10a-1
(``Short Sale Rule''), which prohibits a short sale at a price below the last different reported price. The NYSE asserts
that the system would allow the seller to sell stock at a price that is actually below the price reported to the tape.





Finally, the NYSE argues that the Chicago Match should not be able to trade securities that are neither listed on the
Exchange nor traded pursuant to unlisted trading privileges (``UTP'').
 The NYSE states that pursuant to Sections 5, 6 and 12 of the Act, an exchange can trade only securities that are registered
under the Act (or exempt from registration), and then only if the securities are listed on the exchange or if the exchange
receives UTP.





B. The NYSE's Second Comment Letter



The NYSE filed a second comment letter with the Commission
 after publication of the first four amendments to the proposed Chicago Match rules.
 The second letter states that the proposed amendments fail to address the problems associated with Chicago Match.
The NYSE continues to believe that the Chicago Match will conduct an auction based on hidden liquidity charges. The
NYSE states that the proposal presents transparency concerns and would allow CHX specialists to trade ahead of customers.






First, the NYSE believes that the reporting methodology/plan proposed by the CHX continues to violate the Commission's
rules and the CTA plan. Because the final Chicago Match proposal fails to require a report of the price at which the transaction
would be executed, the NYSE states that the Chicago Match actually would provide inaccurate trading information,
thereby violating the reliability of the tape.

Second, the NYSE letter asserts that the Chicago Match will allow specialists to trade ahead of customer orders. The
NYSE argues that, because of liquidity credits, a specialist quote that is entered into the Chicago Match may be able
to have priority over customer orders entered into the system.



C. The CHX's Responses

<PARENT> FR941207-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In June of 1994, the CHX submitted a letter to the Commission responding to the NYSE's first comment letter.
 The CHX states that the NYSE requests that the Commission disapprove the Chicago Match because it is different from
floor based trading systems existing on traditional exchanges. The CHX believes that this fact alone should not warrant
Commission disapproval of the Chicago Match. The CHX states that, to the contrary, the ``National Market System envisions
the emergence of different trading vehicles and systems in response to market developments.''










The CHX asserts that the Chicago Match is not a hidden market but is designed to bring together buying and selling interest
on traditional exchanges with institutional trading interest that has preferred to do business on a more anonymous
basis. The CHX also asserts that, unlike a PTS, the Chicago Match is a part of a registered securities exchange and,
therefore, is subject to full Commission regulation, and unlike a PTS, the Chicago Match is integrated with the CHX
trading floor.

The CHX disputes assertions that the Chicago Match actually sponsors hidden quotations that must be disseminated
through CQS. The CHX asserts that buying and selling interest in the Chicago Match does not constitute bids or offers
within the meaning of the Firm Quote Rule. The CHX states that in order to constitute a bid or offer within the purview
of the Firm Quote Rule, an order must be disseminated at a specific price. The CHX states that none of the indications
in the Chicago Match are at a specific price; rather the execution price is a function of the Consolidated Best Bid and
Offer at the randomly selected execution time. As such, the indications are not required to be disseminated pursuant
to the Firm Quote Rule. The CHX asserts that, similarly, the CQS facilities that were designed by the NYSE are incapable
of processing indications without prices. Thus, even if CQS wanted to disseminate Chicago Match indications, it
could not do so.



The CHX response letter states that, without resolving the issue of whether liquidity fees are a part of the execution
price or not, these fees are reported in cents and thus not reportable on the Consolidated Tape.
 This point, however, has been largely addressed because, as previously noted, the CHX has finalized its tape reporting
process to include reporting of an average weight of liquidity fees. The cross price plus or minus the average liquidity
fee or liquidity credit for each stock stated in up to 1/256ths will be reported to the Consolidated Tape or Nasdaq.
In addition, the maximum liquidity fee or liquidity credit is limited to 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best
Bid and Offer at cross time, regardless of the size of the spread.






The CHX amended its proposal to address the NYSE's concern that trades executed in the Chicago Match could trade through
another market's published quotations if liquidity fees are deemed to be a part of the price. The amendment will change
the cross price of the match to the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer regardless of the size of the
spread and limit the maximum size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits. If a liquidity fee is greater than 1/2 of
the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time, it will be reduced to 1/2 of the spread at cross time.
The Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be received in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the
Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. The CHX states that these changes will eliminate the possibility of trading through
another market's published quotations.



The CHX states that it disagrees with the NYSE's assertions that the Chicago Match's plan to permit paired orders will
violate Section 12 of the Act. The CHX further states that, while it disagrees with the NYSE's view on this, it has filed
amendments to its rules to preclude orders from being entered in securities not traded on the CHX.






Finally, the CHX disagrees with the NYSE's concern that short sale orders will be displayed through the system and
thereby influence the market. The CHX states that short sale orders are currently displayed on every market whenever
a short sale offer is the best offer in the market. The CHX further states that the Short Sale Rule has never prohibited
the dissemination of quotations reflecting offers to sell short.


The CHX also disputes the NYSE's general argument that short sales through the Chicago Match should be prohibited.
The CHX states that the Chicago Match is a passive trading system that is derivatively priced. As such, trades executed
through the system cannot impact the market by exerting downward pressure on prices.



IV. Discussion



After careful consideration of the comments received, as well as applicable statutory provisions, the Commission
believes that the proposed Chicago Match is consistent with the Act, and in particular, Sections 6(b)(4), 6(b)(5),
and 11A of the Act. Separately, the Division of Market Regulation has granted the CHX exemptions for the Chicago Match
from the Short Sale Rule, the Firm Quote Rule, and Rule 11Ac3-3.

The Commission believes that the Chicago Match is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(B) of the Act which states that
new data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market
operations. The Chicago Match employs significant new information technology and an automated system that adds
to the existing trading facilities of the CHX. As a result, the Chicago Match will serve as an innovative adjunction
to the CHX's existing market structure.
The Commission historically has encouraged the creation of new electronic trading systems such as the Chicago Match
that may contribute to increased execution alternatives available to investors. At the same time, it is important
to ensure that new exchange trading systems are consistent with the investor protection and fair and orderly market
standards contained in the Act. The Commission believes that the Chicago Match achieves this objective.
The Chicago Match represents a blending of some of the attributes of off-exchange trading systems with the market
making and brokerage features of the CHX trading floor. In addition, it will blend the features of a unitary call market
with the continuous auction of the CHX floor. The operation of such a hybrid system will differ in important respects
from the traditional trading floor design. The Commission disagrees with assertions that these differences would
cause the Chicago Match to violate Exchange Act provisions. While the proposal does involve regulatory issues regarding
transparency, institutional access, and regulatory structure, for the reasons discussed below, the amended proposal
adequately addresses these issues and is consistent with the maintenance of free and open markets and investor protection
in accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.





First, the Commission believes that, contrary to the NYSE's assertions, the Chicago Match is properly regulated
as a facility of an exchange and not as a proprietary trading system.
 The Chicago Match will use exchange equipment, including software and lines as well as exchange personnel, to run
the system. The Chicago Match will also include CHX market maker participation as well as CHX's Midwest Clearing Corporation
to clear trades. Therefore, the Chicago Match will be using the CHX's premises, property, and services for effecting
and reporting Chicago Match transactions and, thus, will be using the facilities of an exchange as defined in Section
3(a)(2) of the Act.

<PARENT> FR941207-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Regulating the Chicago Match as a ``facility'' of the CHX is consistent with the approach the Commission has followed
in similar cases. For example, the NYSE's off-hours trading system is regulated as a facility of the NYSE and not as
a separately operated PTS.
 Indeed, if another exchange wanted to operate a similar system to Chicago Match, it would also be permissible as a facility
of that exchange.




Second, the Chicago Match adequately displays orders and reports prices. The NYSE, in its comment letters, expressed
concern that the Chicago Match transaction prices reported to the Consolidated Tape will be inaccurate due to the
use of liquidity fees and credits, and therefore, Chicago Match would violate Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act. Rule
11Aa3-1 provides for the collection and dissemination of ``transaction reports'' that contain, among other
things, the price associated with a transaction in a security. The Commission disagrees with the NYSE's concern and
instead believes that, as amended, the Chicago Match is consistent with rules regarding the dissemination of quotations
and reporting of transactions. The amended Chicago Match rules require the CHX to report one trade for each stock executed
in the Chicago Match. This report will include the total number of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to
the cross price plus (or minus) the volume weighted average of liquidity fees paid (or liquidity credits received)
for that stock. This approach will provide public disclosure of liquidity fees by including them, albeit in averaged
form, in the price reported to the tape. The Commission believes that this method informs market participants of the
value of the security including any liquidity fees or credits. The Commission further notes that the block market
currently reports in average prices. The Commission feels that this reporting will provide investors with adequate
transaction price information in compliance with Rule 11Aa3-1 of the Act.





In addition, the NYSE asserts that the Commission should not allow the CHX to operate Chicago Match because the bids
and offers on the system are hidden from view, thereby violating the Firm Quote Rule. The NYSE asserts that Chicago
Match orders that are displayed to other Chicago Match participants are bids and offers under Rule 11Ac1-1 of
the Act and, therefore, should be taken into account when the CHX is calculating the best bid and offer that it provides
to the CQS. The Commission disagrees with this assertion. 
While it is true that the Firm Quote Rule requires exchanges to collect bids, offers, quotation sizes and aggregate
quotation sizes from ``responsible brokers or dealers,'' as defined in the Act,
 for each reported security or each security admitted to unlisted trading privileges and make them available to quotation
vendors, the Commission does not believe that the provisions of this rule apply to the Chicago Match. First, users
of Chicago Match may not always be ``responsible broker-dealers.'' Second, the Firm Quote Rule contemplates bids
and offers at specific prices. The execution prices in the Chicago Match, however, are a function of the Consolidated
Best Bid and Offer at a randomly selected time in the future that is unknown to the users at the time the orders are entered.
Because the execution price also may vary with the addition of liquidity fees and credits, prices are essentially
unspecified. Third, the Firm Quote Rule contemplates dissemination throughout the trading day of bids and offer
quotations with respect to reported securities traded on the trading floor. This will not occur with the Chicago Match,
were orders can be entered and changed without being subject to execution until a single cross time.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission also believes that the near match function does not involve a hidden auction market, but rather is simply
a service provided to cross participants that fail to achieve execution in the match. This service is no different
than a broker negotiating a trade in the crowd on an exchange floor or off an exchange. In the near match function, willing
participants will have the option to have a near match broker call them to negotiate an order. There is no further participation
at this point with CHX or the Chicago Match.





Third, the CHX has addressed issues relating to its order execution priority. The NYSE expressed concern that trades
executed in the Chicago Match could trade through other markets' published quotations if liquidity fees or credits
are deemed a part of the price. The Commission believes that the amended Chicago Match rules address this issue. As
amended, the Chicago Match rules will limit the maximum size of liquidity fees or credits to one half of the best bid-offer
spread at the time of execution. Therefore, even if the liquidity fees and credits are counted as a part of the execution
price, no market's quotation will be traded through.
The Commission also disagrees with the NYSE's assertions that by granting the CHX quote priority the Chicago Match
will allow specialists to trade ahead of customer orders. The NYSE's concern arises in the case where the specialist
enters a proprietary quote. In this instance, it is possible that a specialist could be trading ahead of a separately-entered
customer order. The Commission believes that this possibility is not a significant concern in this context for two
reasons. First, a specialist could not trade ahead of customer orders that he was holding, but only orders that brokers
or other customers separately entered into the system. Second, a customer has the choice to enter an order by sending
it to the CHX floor (in which case it will be displayed) so that his order will be a part of the specialist's quotation
if the customer is concerned about the possibility of a specialist trading ahead of his order.
Fourth, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match, as finally amended, will not raise significant short-sale
issues under Rule 10a-1 of the Act.
 The Division has granted the Chicago Match, as amended, an exemption from this rule
 because the orders that are eligible to be entered into the Chicago Match are not susceptible to the abusive practices
that the rule was designed to prevent. The final Chicago Match rules do not allow short sellers to enter a liquidity
fee, and thus any order to sell short is less likely to be used for manipulative purposes. Moreover, the current Chicago
Match rules provide for order execution at midpoints between the spread, and therefore Chicago Match transactions
will not change the inside market price. In addition, the Chicago Match pricing system is strictly derivative in nature
and thus we believe it is unlikely to lend itself to short-sale abuses.







Fifth, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match has adequate controls over non-member access. The Act contemplates
that transactions on a national securities exchange would be conducted by ``members.'' Section 3(a)(3)(A) of the
Act refers to transactions being conducted by various categories of exchange ``members.'' Section 6(c)(1) of the
Act states that national securities exchanges shall deny membership to any person who is not a registered broker or
dealer or any natural person who is not, or is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.
 The Chicago Match, however, allows non-members to enter orders into the system if a CHX member is responsible for controlling
and clearing these orders.




The Commission believes that the Chicago Match does not violate the Act by allowing some limited non-member access
to its system. First, a non-member entering orders may only do so after arranging with a CHX member to be legally responsible
for the orders the non-member enters into the Chicago Match. The non-member must notify the CHX of this arrangement
with the CHX member.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941207-2-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941207-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, each non-member must enter into a Non-Member User's Agreement with the CHX wherein the non-member agrees
to be bound by the applicable rules of the Exchange. The CHX asserts that the Non-Member User's Agreement, by its express
terms, gives the Exchange control over non-member users. This agreement states that the CHX has ``the right to terminate
the user's use of, and access to, the Chicago Match, without prior notice for any reason * * * or no reason
whatsoever.'' The CHX states that this authority to remove the non-member user's Chicago Match terminal will allow
the Exchange to act quickly to react to any problems with a non-member user. 

Finally, the CHX asserts that there will be supervision over non-members through the use of the clearing agreement.
 This agreement provides that the clearing member agrees to clear all trades for the non-member users up to a specified
dollar amount. Each user's maximum user threshold will be programmed into the Chicago Match to prevent the non-member
user from exceeding its threshold. Orders that exceed the programmed threshold will be rejected and will not be included
in the match. Clearing members will review daily reports of trades in the system which will allow for the early detection
and correction of problems.
 






The Commission agrees with the CHX's assertions that non-member use of the Chicago Match can be analogized to non-member
access to the NYSE's Designated Order Turnaround System (the revised system is now referred to as ``SuperDot'').
 The NYSE's SuperDot System allows computer terminals to be placed with the customers of members who may then send their
orders directly
 to the NYSE for processing. SuperDot requires NYSE members to monitor customers' electronic orders and to provide
the exchange with an acknowledgment statement indicating their responsibility for orders.
 The Commission believes that: (1) the requirement that Chicago Match users gain access only through an arrangement
with a CHX member, which has legal responsibilities as to all user activities described above; (2) the Chicago Match's
clearing thresholds for non-members; (3) the ability to immediately terminate a user's access to Chicago Match;
and (4) the fact that CHX matches currently will occur only once a day,
 all serve to assure sufficient control by CHX members over the activities of non-members to satisfy the requirements
of the Act. 








Finally, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act which requires
the equitable allocation of reasonable dues and fees among members and persons using exchange facilities. The differentiation
of fees between displayed and non-displayed orders is reasonable in that it is intended to encourage the display of
orders. Likewise, the payment of fees to market makers is reasonably intended to provide incentives for market makers
to provide liquidity to the system and increase the match rate. 



V. Conclusion 



In summary, the Commission believes that the CHX has presented a proposal that satisfies the standards under the Act
relating to national securities exchanges. In analyzing the CHX proposal, the Commission recognizes that the Chicago
Match is a mixture that brings together features of a call market with the market making capabilities of the CHX floor.
Obviously, such systems represent certain challenges in fitting into the traditional regulatory mold envisioned
for an exchange system under the Act. For the reasons discussed above, however, we believe that the CHX has adequately
addressed the transparency, institutional access, and auction market trading concerns. The combination of the
limited nature of the proposal as a once-a-day call market, the integration of the CHX quote into the match, the limitations
designed to prevent trade throughs of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer, the reporting of trades to the tape including
average weighted liquidity fees and credits, the limitations of access through agreements with a CHX clearing member,
and the fee structure to encourage the display of orders during the match, all lead the Commission to conclude that
the proposal is consistent with the Act. 

It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX-93-19) be, and hereby is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to the Listing of Long Term Equity Options (``LEAPS'') With a Duration of up to 60 Months Until Expiration</DOCTITLE>


November 30, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on November 8, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 5.8 to permit the listing of options with a duration of up to 60 months (

i.e.

, five years). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list options with a duration of up to 60 months (

i.e.,

 five years). The Exchange presently has authority to list long-term equity options (``LEAPS'') that expire from
12 to 39 months from the time they are listed.
 The Exchange represents that there has been increasing member firm and customer interest in longer term instruments.
Therefore, the Exchange is proposing to amend Exchange Rule 5.8 to permit the listing of options that expire up to 60
months from the time they are listed. In addition, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 5.8 to allow up to ten additional
expiration months for LEAPS, as opposed to the six additional months currently allowed.




The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
 in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,
and to protect investors and the public interest.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Exchange consents, the Commission
will:



(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or 
(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested person are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the CBOE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-94-42
and should be submitted by December 28, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 by the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange Relating to Inter-Currency Spread Priority</DOCTITLE>


November 29, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on August 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to amend Rules 1033 and 1066 to allow spread priority for
eligible spreads between two different foreign currency options (``FCOs''). For example, a Deutsche mark call and
a French franc put could be executed as a spread, such that the bid/offer could be expressed as a net credit or debit and
a single execution could occur as long as at least one individual component (leg) of each spread is executed at a better
price than the established bid/offer and no leg is executed outside of the established bid/offer for that option contract.
In order to permit the execution of inter-currency spreads, a definition of this type of order is proposed to be added
to Phlx Rule 1066, as a subcategory of ``spread'' orders, which is a subcategory of ``hedge'' orders. Also, the Phlx
proposes to adopt new paragraph (i) to Rule 1033, which establishes spread priority principles for inter-currency
spreads. On November 18, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal to renumber a proposed paragraph due to
recent changes to Rule 1033.





The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Phlx, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Currently, an option spread is executable as a single transaction at a total net debit or credit with one contra-side,
pursuant to Phlx Rule 1033(d). Under this provision, an eligible spread can be afforded spread priority as long as
the net credit/debit improves the established market for the spread as measured by the aggregate price of the respective
legs if executed individually.
The Commission recently approved a Phlx proposal to expand the spread priority provisions applicable to FCOs to include
three-way, ratio, and multi-spread transactions.
 Specifically, that proposal expanded upon the existing requirement (in Rule 1033(d)) to improve the established
market as follows: at least one options leg must be executed at a better price than the established market for that option
as well as that no option leg be executed outside of the established market for that option.






The purpose of this proposal is to extend spread priority to spreads involving two different foreign currency options.
For example, a spread could be executed between any two FCOs, American-
 or European-style
 expiration, and any expiration date (regular, month-end, or long-term). Inter-currency spread priority pursuant
to the proposed rule change would not, however, be available for cross-rate, cash/spot, or the Exchange's customized
FCOs.

<TEXT>
 

According to the Phlx, absent spread priority, inter-currency spreads can be executed as contingency orders pursuant
to Phlx Rule 1066. For example, an FCO floor broker would quote a French franc market as well as a Swiss franc market,
in each respective trading crowd; then, the floor broker would announce ``99 bid for 99 Sep 99 French franc calls if
i can sell 99 Dec 99 Swiss franc puts at 99.'' However, each component of the spread, however, must be bid/offered individually,
which, according to the Exchange, generally means that each component is executed at a price better than the established
bid/offer. In addition, the Exchange believes that because each leg must be executed between the established market,
such contingency orders are more likely to be broken up by market interest in one leg, such that the end result may be
a different number of contracts for each leg.

Rule 1066(f)(1) defines a spread as an order to buy a stated number of option contracts and to sell the same number of
option contracts, in a different series of the same class of options. The Exchange now proposes to adopt Rule 1066(f)(1)(A)
to define inter-currency spreads because the existing definition requires that both orders be for the same class
of FCOs, which does not allow for spreads involving FCOs in different currencies.

The Exchange believes that executing inter-currency spreads subject to a spread priority provision is appropriate
for several reasons. First, inter-currency spreads provide a trading strategy for FCO market participants based
on the interplay between the currencies of two countries, similar to the advantages and opportunities associated
with cross-rate FCOs. The Exchange believes that the availability of such strategies should enhance liquidity in
existing FCOs.

Second, the Phlx emphasizes that inter-currency spreads are not a new trading strategy, as they are currently executable
as two separate, contingent orders. Instead, inter-currency spread priority is intended to facilitate the execution
of such orders, which, according to the Exchange, often proves to be difficult. For example, the execution of inter-currency
spreads as contingency orders may present a logistical problem as floor brokers must, in exercising due diligence,
shuttle between two trading crowds or, to prevent a trade from occurring while the floor broker is in the second crowd,
utilize two floor brokers to execute such an order.

The requirement in proposed Phlx Rule 1033(i) that each leg of an inter-currency spread be executed at or within the
market for the individual leg, and that at least one leg is executed at a price which improves the established market,
should, according to the Exchange, protect investors and the public interest as well as prevent manipulative acts
and practices. The Exchange states that this requirement is also consistent with Phlx Rule 118 which provides that
when a bid/offer is clearly established, no bid/offer outside that price shall be established. The Exchange further
believes that spread priority for inter-currency spreads should facilitate a more simplified execution procedure
for such orders.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5),
 in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:




(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to an Enhanced Parity Split for Index Option Trades</DOCTITLE>


November 30, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on November 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Phlx. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Phlx proposes to amend Exchange Rule 1014(g) and Commentary .17 thereunder in order to provide an enhanced parity
split for specialists trading index options. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the
Secretary, Phlx, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


On May 25, 1994, the Commission approved the Exchange's proposal to provide new options specialists units (``New
Units'') trading newly-listed equity options classes with an enhanced participation in parity equity option transactions
(``New Specialist Split'').
 On August 26, 1994, the Commission approved, as a one-year pilot program, the Exchange's proposal to provide an enhanced
parity split in certain assigned equity options classes for option specialists not qualifying for the New Specialist
Split.
 In each of those filings, the Phlx indicated that the enhanced parity splits would be applicable to equity options
specialists, however, the Phlx represents that the intent of the Exchange in proposing those rules was to limit the
proposals to options traded on the Phlx's Equity Option Floor, which would specifically include index options but
exclude foreign currency options. The Exchange represents that index options are traded on the Equity Options Floor
and that index option specialists are not separate and distinct from equity options specialists trading at the Exchange.
Accordingly, the Phlx hereby proposes to amend Phlx Rule 1014(g) and Commentary .17 thereunder in order to expand
the enhanced parity split proposals discussed above to expressly include transactions in index options traded on
the Exchange's Equity Options Floor. Because the Exchange represents that this was the original intent of the proposals
discussed above, the Exchange does not expect any new objections to be raised by amending its rules to extend the enhanced
parity split to trades in index options.






The Phlx believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade by providing specialists with additional
incentives to make deep and liquid markets in index options.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.

(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the Phlx proposal to expand its rules regarding enhanced parity splits for
specialists to include index options, in addition to equity options, does not create any regulatory concerns that
were not adequately addressed by the Phlx when the Commission approved the enhanced parity splits available to specialists
trading equity options.
 Index options trade on the Exchange's Equity Options Floor and are subject to trading rules substantially similar
to those applicable to equity options. Accordingly, the Commission believes that there is no regulatory reason to
distinguish between equity and index options with regard the availability of an enhanced participation for specialists
in parity option transactions.






The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

 in order to provide specialists trading index options with the same benefits available to specialists trading equity
options. Additionally, because one of the enhanced parity split proposals was approved as a one-year pilot program,
 the Commission believes it is appropriate to accelerate approval of the proposed rule change to provide the Exchange
with as much time as possible in order to gather data on the effect and utility of the pilot program prior to its expiration.
Accordingly, the commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the
proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.




IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-57
and should be submitted by December 28, 1994.


It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Phlx-94-57), as amended, is hereby approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change and
Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 to Proposed Rule Change To Implement
a ``Wheel'' for the Registered Options Trader Contra-Side Participation to AUTO-X Trades</DOCTITLE>



November 30, 1994.



On July 18, 1994, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change that implements a new procedure for assigning contra-side participants
to AUTO-X orders. On August 10, 1994, the Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register 

to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments were received. On October 28, 1994, PHLX filed with the Commission Amendment No. 1 in order to clarify certain
operations of the Wheel and to amend certain provisions of Floor Procedure Advice F-24.
 On November 15, 1994, PHLX filed with the Commission Amendment No. 2 which clarifies the interaction between the Wheel
and the trading crowd.
 This order approves the proposal, including Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 on an accelerated basis.









I. Description



The proposed rule change adopts Floor Procedure Advice F-24, AUTO-X Contra-Party Participation (The Wheel),
which establishes an automated mechanism for assigning floor traders (

i.e.,

 specialists and Registered Option Traders (``ROTs'')), on a rotating basis, as contra-side participants to AUTO-X
orders.

The AUTO-X system is the automatic execution feature of the Exchange's Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'') system.
 AUTO-X provides customers with automatic executions of eligible option orders at displayed markets.
 Currently, floor trader contraside participation defaults to the account of the specialist, and the addition of
ROTs or orders from the trading crowd or the specialist's limit order book as contra-side participants to AUTO-X orders
requires manual keypunch entries.
 The Wheel automatically includes eligible ROTs in AUTO-X executions and specifies how such trades will be split among
the specialist and ROTs. Customer orders, both on the limit order book and in the trading crowd, will continue to receive
priority in accordance with PHLX rules. An ROT, whether on the Wheel or not, also may have priority.
 If priority is established for the limit order book, a member of the trading crowd, or an ROT, the specialist will stop
the Wheel's operation and manually assign the trade to the contra-party with priority.








The specialist and any signed on ROTs will be listed on the Wheel.
 ROTs must sign on to the Wheel in person on the trading floor from terminals designated by the Exchange. ROTs may sign
on before 9:30 a.m. for the entire trading day or before 12:30 p.m. for trading after 12:30 p.m. An ROT may not sign on
after 12:30 p.m. for the first time that trading day.






Contra-side participation of AUTO-X orders are assigned to Wheel participants in circular rotation. The specialist
receives the first assignment of trades for the day in each respective option. Thereafter, the Wheel assigns trades
to ROTs in an order standardized for that day on a random basis.
 If there are five or more ROTs signed onto the Wheel, the specialist participates in the first trade of the day and every
fifth assignment thereafter. Each ten lot or order (whichever is smaller) constitutes an assignment. For AUTO-X
orders greater than ten contracts, each ten lot or remaining portion of the order constitutes an assignment. The procedure
for rotating trades among participants will be reviewed by the Exchange's Option Committee after six months.





An ROT may sign off the Wheel at any time during the trading day, which becomes effective for all listed options. An ROT
may sign off twice each trading day and still be eligible to sign on again that day; after the third sign off, that ROT
is no longer eligible for the Wheel that day. ROTs who sign on for the half-day session beginning at 12:30 p.m. may only
sign off once and still be eligible to sign on again that day. A floor official may modify the sign on/sign off procedures
in extraordinary circumstances.

II. Discussion


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act provides that the rules of the exchange must
promote just and equitable principles of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market, and in general to protect investors and the public interest.





The proposal will help the PHLX to provide an orderly market and to encourage small investor participation in the options
markets by facilitating the use of AUTO-X. AUTO-X enhances the Exchange's ability to execute small public
customer orders in a timely, accurate, and efficient manner. The manual assignment of contra-participation increases
the time needed to execute each trade through AUTO-X. During periods of heavy trading volume, this manual operation
may severely restrict AUTO-X's utility. Therefore, the automation of assignments of contra-parties for AUTO-X
trades should improve order processing and turnaround time. By not manually entering contra-participant information
for each trade, the Wheel should reduce opportunities for keypunching errors. In addition, the Wheel should generally
reduce the number of contra-participants for each trade.
 The reduction in the number of contra-parties to each contract may increase the efficiency of order processing. By
enhancing AUTO-X's utility, the proposal should assist in providing a free and open market.




Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the
date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 provides minor amendments to the procedure consistent
with the original proposal. Amendment No. 2 merely clarifies the interaction between the Wheel and the trading crowd
and limit order book. The Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the
full statutory period.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendments No. 1 and No. 2
to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all
subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission,
and all written communications relating to Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 between the Commission and any persons, other
than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  522, will be available
for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20549. Copies of such filing also will be available at the principal office of PHLX. All submissions should refer to
file No. SR-PHLX-94-32 and should be submitted by December 28, 1994.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed file change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5)
of the Act.





It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PHLX-94-32) be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

that their operations meet all applicable safety regulations by April 23, 1995, the date the new law becomes effective,
unless by that date they obtain an exemption as provided for by the law. An application for exemption will not stay the
effective date of the statute. The following is a notice from the Administrator advising all persons whose operations
may be affected by the change in the statutory definition of public aircraft.

Appendix_Notice to all Persons Whose Operations may be Affected by the Change in the Statutory Definition of Public
Aircraft


On October 9, 1994, Congress passed the Independent Safety Board Act Amendments, which contained a major change in
the definition of ``public aircraft.'' Under the previous statutory definition, pubic aircraft were exempt from
many types of FAA regulation.
Under the new statute, many of those aircraft will not be subject to FAA safety regulations. For example, when the law
becomes effective, aircraft used to transport passengers will, in some circumstances, no longer be considered public
aircraft. Therefore, the operators of such aircraft will need to meet civil aircraft requirements for certification,
maintenance, training, etc., unless they qualify for narrowly described exemptions. Aircraft operated by the Armed
Forces and intelligence agencies, however, will retain their public aircraft status unless operated for a commercial
purpose.

The new law will become effective on April 23, 1995. Attached for your information is a copy of the new law. If you intend
to use your aircraft in operations that will no longer be consistent with public aircraft status, then you should start
taking steps now to ensure that your operations meet all applicable safety regulations by the time the new law goes
into effect, or to request an exemption as described in the new law.


Although the FAA Administrator has certain authority to grant exemptions from the civil aircraft safety regulations
to ``units of government,'' the agency expects to invoke its exemption authority only when the public interest clearly
demands it. To obtain an exemption under the statute, a unit of government must show that granting the exemption is
necessary ``to prevent an undue economic burden on the unit of government,'' and that the aviation safety program
of the unit of government is ``effective and appropriate to ensure safe operations of the type of aircraft operated
by the unit of government.''

Earlier this year, the FAA announced that it would reconsider whether public aircraft status is lost when one government
reimburses another for the use of its aircraft. The FAA invited comments from interested parties. 

See 

59 FR 39192 (August 1, 1994). With Congress' passage of the new law, however, this point has been clarified. Now, if
there is such reimbursement, the aircraft will be civil aircraft unless the appropriate unit of government certifies
``that the operation was necessary to respond to a significant and imminent threat to life or property,'' and ``that
no service by a private operator was reasonably available to meet the threat.''
If you have questions about how the new law might affect your operations, you may contact Dave Catey, AFS-220,
(202) 267-8094. We would appreciate any assistance you can provide in getting this information to other persons
or organizations that may be affected by the change of law.

Act of 1974, as amended. HUD reserves the right to award grants under this NOFA up to the maximum amount authorized by
law. As of the date of this NOFA and subject to funding availability, HUD intends to award up to $300 million in EDI funds.
HUD may award in excess of $300 million if more funds become available. 



The Secretary invites applications from specific communities which qualify under Section II.(C) of this NOFA. In
addition, EDI grants must be used in connection with activities eligible for assistance and assisted under the HUD
Section 108 loan guarantee program (42 U.S.C. 5308)_to enhance the security of the Section 108 guaranteed loan or
to improve the feasibility of proposed Section 108 projects through techniques such as interest rate subsidies,
loan loss reserves, etc. 
This NOFA sets out program guidelines that will govern the application, application review, and award process for
EDI grants under this NOFA.

of designation as an Empowerment Zone pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, and which meets the eligibility requirements for
a nominated area pursuant to 24 CFR part 597, subpart B. 


Strategic Plan 

means a strategy developed and agreed to by the nominating local government(s) and State(s) and submitted in partial
fulfillment of the application requirements for designation as an Empowerment Zone pursuant to 24 CFR Part 597. 


(C) Background


This NOFA provides EDI grant funds to support those communities that submitted applications on behalf of areas that
qualify for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone and that have remaining authority to utilize Section 108 funds
of at least $40 million, or in the case of an urban Empowerment Zone application from joint entities, that have aggregate
Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities that submitted the Empowerment Zone application of at least $40
million. In the case of a joint Empowerment Zone application from two or more entities, HUD will accept a joint EDI application
from public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance pursuant to  570.702. However, each of
the joint applicants will be expected to execute separate EDI grant agreements and separate loan commitments and
issuance documents for their related Section 108 loan guarantees. EDI grant awards will not be made to designated
urban Empowerment Zone entities designated under that competition. 
EDI is intended to complement and enhance the Section 108 Loan Guarantee program (see 24 CFR 570.700-710 for
regulations governing the Section 108 program). This provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, and
large scale physical development projects. HUD is authorized pursuant to Section 108 to guarantee notes issued by
CDBG entitlement communities and nonentitlement units of general local government eligible to receive funds under
their State CDBG program.
The regulations governing the Section 108 program are found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. EDI grants shall also be subject
to the rules found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. 
Additionally, assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published
on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33866). Section 3 requires that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with Federal,
State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other contracting opportunities generated
from certain HUD financial assistance be directed to low- and very-low income persons. The eligible activities for
which funding is provided under this NOFA are consistent with the objectives of section 3. Public entities awarded
funds under this NOFA and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other
public construction must comply with the applicable requirements of the interim regulations published on June 30,
1994. 
The Section 108 program is authorized at $2.054 billion in loan guarantee authority in Fiscal Year 1995. Under the
Section 108 program, units of general local government and States, if applicable, pledge future years' CDBG allocations
as security for loans guaranteed by HUD. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all
guarantees made under Section 108. In the event that a Section 108 funded activity fails to generate sufficient funds
to repay the Section 108 loan and there are insufficient EDI grant funds or other assets available to be used to make
the payment, a community would be required to use its CDBG funds to make the loan payment. Without the availability
of an EDI grant, this potential disruption in availability of CDBG funds for program activities has made many communities
reluctant to utilize the Section 108 loan program. EDI minimizes the potential loss of future CDBG allocations by
either providing a loan loss reserve (for use in making Section 108 guaranteed loan payments if needed), lowering
the cost of borrowing under Section 108 (making full or partial interest payments), or providing other credit and
economic enhancements that reduce the risk that the pledged annual CDBG allocation would be required to fund repayment
shortfalls. 
Because economic development projects carried out in, or serving, the most economically and physically distressed
neighborhoods, such as those found in areas qualifying for urban Empowerment Zone designation, face the greatest
risk of loss of Section 108 loan funds, HUD intends to provide a maximum ratio of EDI grant funds to Section 108 loan funds
of one-to-one. An EDI grant can reduce the risk to future CDBG funds: 
(1) By directly enhancing the security of the guaranteed loan;

(2) By strengthening the economic feasibility of the projects financed with Section 108 funds (and thereby increasing
the probability that the project will generate enough cash to repay the guaranteed loan); 
(3) By enabling a speedy repayment of the Section 108 loan guarantee notes; or 
(4) Through a combination of these risk mitigation techniques. 
HUD envisions that the following project structures could be typical: 


Funding reserves_

The cash flow generated by an economic development project may be expected to be relatively ``thin'' in the early stages
of the project. The EDI grant can make it possible for debt service or operating reserves to be established in a way that
does not jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project. 
An example is a supermarket or neighborhood shopping center that is designed to provide basic services and jobs for
residents in the distressed neighborhood. The public entity must be prepared for the Section 108 loan repayments
required during the time period after completion of construction and during the lease-up phase when the shopping
center is not fully leased and generating sufficient revenues to support the Section 108 loan repayments. It may therefore
require the developer to establish with a trustee a reserve account (or accounts) that would be available to cover
operating expenses and/or debt service during this lease-up period. While such reserves are commonplace, their
cost may be so high as to make an already risky neighborhood shopping center project economically infeasible. The
increased cost resulting from establishing such reserves may be defrayed by the EDI grant. As with the letter of credit
example below, such reserves protect the CDBG program against the risk that CDBG funds will have to be used to cover
shortfalls in the intended source for repayment of the Section 108 loan. 


Over-collateralizing the Section 108 loan_

The use of EDI grant funds may be structured in appropriate cases so as to improve the chances that cash flow will be sufficient
to cover debt service on the Section 108 loan and directly enhance the guaranteed loan. One technique for accomplishing
this approach is over-collateralization of the Section 108 loan. 
An example is the creation of a loan pool made up of equal amounts of Section 108 and EDI grant funds. The community would
make loans to various businesses at an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate on the Section 108 loan. The total
loan portfolio would be pledged to the repayment of the Section 108 loan. If the total loan repayments from the loan
fund were twice the amount of the debt service on the Section 108 loan, the community could accumulate a loan loss reserve
that would mitigate virtually any risk to future CDBG funds. 


Direct enhancement of the security of the Section 108 loan

_The EDI grant can be used to cover the cost of providing enhanced security. An example of how the EDI grant can be used
for this purpose is by using the grant funds to cover the cost of a standby letter of credit, issued in favor of HUD. This
letter of credit will be available to fund amounts due on the Section 108 loan if other sources fail to materialize and
will, thus, serve to protect the public entity's future CDBG funds. 


Provision of financing to for-profit businesses at a below market interest rate

_While the rates on loans guaranteed under Section 108 are only slightly above the rates on comparable U.S. Treasury
obligations, they may nonetheless be higher than can be afforded by businesses in severely, economically distressed
neighborhoods. The EDI grant can be used to make Section 108 financing affordable. 
For example, a community's strategic plan to stabilize the economic viability of a severely distressed neighborhood
may provide financial loan assistance to both new and existing businesses at very low interest rates for some period
of time until each business has reached a stabilized and profitable level of operation. EDI grant funds would serve
to ``buy down'' the interest rate up front, or make full or partial interest payments, allowing the businesses to be
financially viable in the early start-up period not otherwise possible with Section 108 alone.

A combination of these techniques

_An applicant could employ a combination of these techniques in order to implement a strategy that carries out an economic
development project. 



(D) Timing of Grant Awards 



EDI applications will be evaluated concurrently with request(s) or application(s) for Section 108 guarantee commitments
or request(s) or application(s) for approval of amendments to previously approved Section 108 applications that
will be enhanced by the EDI assistance. (See II.B. of this NOFA.) HUD notification to the grantee of the amount and conditions
(if any) of EDI funds awarded based upon review of the EDI application shall constitute an obligation of grant funds,
subject to compliance with the conditions of award and execution of a grant agreement. 



(E) Limitations on Grant Amounts 



HUD expects to approve EDI grant amounts of up to $100 million each with the ratio of EDI to Section 108 funds of 1:1. Applicants
cannot request grants exceeding a one-to-one ratio of EDI funds to Section 108 funds. In the case of requested amendments
to an approved Section 108 loan guarantee commitment, the EDI assistance approved will be based on the increased amount
of Section 108 loan guarantee assistance. HUD reserves the right to determine a minimum and a maximum amount of any
EDI award per application or project and to modify requests accordingly. The applicant will be required to modify
its project plans and application to conform to the terms of HUD approval (final obligation) before execution of a
grant agreement. HUD reserves the right to reduce or de-obligate the EDI award if approvable Section 108 loan guarantee
applications are not submitted by the grantee in the required amounts on a timely basis. 



(F) Eligible Applicants for 

EDI Grant Assistance 



Generally, eligible applicants for 

EDI grants under section 108(q) of the Act are those public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance
pursuant to  570.702. However, this NOFA further limits eligible applicants to those communities that submitted
applications on behalf of areas that qualify for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone, and that have remaining
Section 108 loan guarantee authority of at least $40 million; or in the case of an urban Empowerment Zone application
from joint entities, an aggregate Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities that submitted the Empowerment
Zone application of at least $40 million. In the case of a joint Empowerment Zone application for two or more entities,
HUD will accept a joint EDI application from the same public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance
pursuant to  570.702. However, each of the joint applications will be expected to execute separate EDI grant
agreements and separate loan commitments and issuance documents for their related section 108 loan guarantees.




(G) Eligible Activities 



EDI grant funds may be used for: 

(1) Activities listed at  570.703, provided such activities are carried out in the qualifying Empowerment
Zone area. 

(2) Payment of costs of private financial guaranty insurance policies, letters of credit, or other credit enhancements
for the notes or other obligations guaranteed by HUD pursuant to Section 108, provided such notes or obligations are
used to finance an economic development project. Such enhancements shall be specified in the contract required by
 570.705(b)(1), and shall be satisfactory in form and substance to HUD for security purposes. 

(3) The payment of principal or interest due (including such servicing, underwriting, or other costs as may be authorized
by HUD) on the notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to the Section 108 loan guarantee program. 



II. The Application Process 



Public entities applying for EDI assistance under this NOFA must make a specific request for that assistance, in accordance
with this NOFA. The EDI application shall be accompanied by a request or requests for Section 108 loan guarantee commitment(s),
as further described in Section II.B. of this NOFA below. Application guidelines for the Section 108 program are found
at  570.704. 



(A) Timing of Submission 



Applications for EDI assistance shall be received at HUD Headquarters at the address listed above at 

Addresses 

by close of business on December 16, 1994. Applicants are encouraged to submit applications to Room 7180. However,
any application received by the Office of Community Planning and Development in Headquarters, Washington, DC, by
the deadline date will be accepted. HUD will not accept applications which are submitted to HUD via facsimile (FAX)
transmission. 



(B) Submission Requirements 



(1) The EDI application (an original and two copies) shall be accompanied by a request for loan guarantee assistance
under Section 108. The request for Section 108 loan guarantee can be either one or more of the following: 

(a) A formal application for Section 108 loan guarantee(s), including the documents listed at  570.704(b);


(b) A brief description of a Section 108 loan guarantee application(s) to be submitted within 60 days (with HUD reserving
the right to extend such period for good cause, generally, on a case-by-case basis) of a notice of EDI selection (EDI
awards will be conditioned on approval of actual Section 108 loan commitments). This description must be sufficient
to support the basic eligibility of the proposed project or activities for Section 108 assistance;

<TEXT>
 

(c) If applicable, a copy of a Section 108 loan guarantee approval document with grant number and date of approval (which
was approved 

after

 the date of this NOFA, except in conjunction with a previous EDI award); or 

(d) A request for a Section 108 loan guarantee amendment (analogous to subparagraph (a) or (b) above) that proposes
to increase the amount of a previously approved application. However, any amount of Section 108 loan guarantee authority
approved 

before

 the date of this NOFA is not eligible to be used in conjunction with an EDI grant under this NOFA. Further, a Section 108
loan guarantee application that is the subject of a prior EDI grant award, whether or not the Section 108 loan guarantee
has been approved as of the date of this NOFA, is not eligible for an EDI award under this NOFA. For example, if a community
has a previously approved Section 108 loan guarantee of $12 million, even if none of the funds have been utilized, or
if the community had previously been awarded an EDI grant of $1 million and had certified that it will submit a Section
108 loan application for $10 million in support of that EDI grant, the community's application under this NOFA must
propose to increase the amount of its total Section 108 loan guarantee commitments beyond those amounts (the $12 million
or $10 million in this example) it has previously committed. 

(2) In addition, for EDI grant assistance, the public entity/entities shall submit the following: 

(a) SF 424, Application for Federal Assistance. 

(b) The certification regarding lobbying required under 24 CFR part 87 (Appendix A). 

(c) A brief narrative statement describing the activities that will be carried out with the EDI grant funds and explaining
how the use of EDI grant funds meets the selection criteria in paragraph II.(C) below. 

(3) The application shall be deemed to include a copy of the strategic plan for co
