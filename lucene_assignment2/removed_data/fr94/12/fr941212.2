COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION



Chicago Board of Trade's Proposed New Rules 424.00 and 480.14, and New Regulation 424.01_Member Firm Managed Futures
Accounts, and Customer Agreements and Risk Disclosure Statement Relating Thereto



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed Chicago Board of Trade (``CBOT'') rules and regulation related to the offering and operation of
certain retail customer managed futures accounts carried by CBOT member firms.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The CBOT has submitted two proposed new rules and one proposed new regulation
 pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act''). The proposed new provisions would establish
requirements for certain retail customer managed futures accounts carried by CBOT member firms (``Member Firms'').





Acting pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, the Division of Trading and Markets
has determined to publish the CBOT's proposal for public comment. The Division believes that publication of the CBOT's
proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Description of Proposed Rules



By letter dated August 8, 1994 (together with submitted materials: the ``Submission'' or ``Proposal''), the CBOT
submitted proposed new Rules 424.00 and 480.14 and new Regulation 424.01 pursuant to Commission Regulation 1.41(c).
The Division advised the CBOT that it will consider the Submission under Regulation 1.41(b) and the CBOT did not object
thereto. The proposed new provisions were revised and resubmitted October 12, 1994. The CBOT represents that the
objective of the Proposal is ``to make possible a regulatory framework in which active solicitation of retail business
by Member Firms can be made practicable_thereby fostered_by ensuring adequate customer protection while also clarifying
Member Firms' compliance obligations.'' The CBOT represents that the proposed rules and regulation have been designed
specifically to permit Member Firms to offer certain managed accounts without securities registration under the
Securities Act of 1933.

Under the Proposal, Member Firms could solicit customers to open Member Firm Managed Futures Accounts (``MFMFAs'').
Each MFMFA would be a discretionary account owned by, and carried in the name of, an individual customer, managed by
either the Member Firm, an associated person (``AP'') thereof, or an unaffiliated trading manager such as a registered
commodity trading advisor (``CTA''). The CBOT contemplates that MFMFAs would trade contracts to which the average
pricing system (``APS'')
 and average quantity order system (``AQOS'')
 are applicable. The Proposal contemplates that, except as provided therein, each MFMFA would be subject to all applicable
requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission regulations and CBOT rules. Among other exceptions,
however, Member Firms would not be required to provide the Disclosure Document of a commodity trading advisor (``CTA'')
retained to direct a MFMFA, as otherwise required by Commission Regulation 4.31, nor would they be required to provide
daily purchase and sale confirmations to MFMFA customers, as required by Commission Regulation 1.33(b). CTA Disclosure
Documents would be available upon request, and daily confirmations would be available at the office of the Member
Firm.

5

 Each MFMFA customer would be provided with, and acknowledge receipt of, a MFMFA Risk Disclosure Statement disclosing,
among other things, the risks of investing in a MFMFA and the provisions regarding daily confirmations and delivery
of the Disclosure Document of a CTA managing a MFMFA.

6

 The Risk Disclosure Statement also would disclose that no individual customer could invest more than ten percent
of his or her liquid net worth, exclusive of home, furnishings and automobile, in a single MFMFA or more than twenty
percent of liquid worth in all his or her MFMFAs at all Member Firms combined. As submitted, the Proposal also includes
a provision for mandatory arbitration of disputes relating to MFMFAs.








Member Firms sponsoring a MFMFA would be required to submit, upon request, a separate ledger recording all day trades
to the CBOT's Office of Investigations and Audits and to adopt and enforce written procedures enabling them to supervise
the solicitation of investments in MFMFAs and the handling of complaints related to such accounts. No person participating
in MFMFA trading decisions could receive monthly commissions in an amount greater than 2.083 percent of net equity
in any particular MFMFA as of the beginning of the month.



II. Request for Comments



Comment is requested on any aspect of the Proposal that members of the public believe may raise issues under the Act
or Commission regulations. In this regard, the Commission notes that, naturally, Section 4

o

 of the Act would apply to the proposed provisions. The Commission further notes that the Proposal, as submitted, could
not be approved unless certain existing Commission regulations were amended. For example, as noted above, the Proposal
would: (1) Require account owners to consent to the submission of all disputes relating to MFMFAs to binding arbitration,
which appears to conflict with Commission Regulation 180.3(b) pursuant to which a customer's consent to arbitration
prior to the time a claim or grievance arises may not be a condition to the customer's ability to utilize the services
of the futures commission merchant; (2) permit Member Firms to not provide MFMFA customers with daily purchase and
sale confirmations as now is required by Commission Regulation 1.33(b); and (3) require delivery of the Disclosure
Document of a CTA retained to direct a MFMFA to the account owner solely where requested by the customer, whereas Commission
Regulation 4.31 requires delivery of the Disclosure Document to prospective CTA clients at or before the time of their
solicitation or opening a discretionary account with the CTA. Accordingly, commenters may wish to address the questions
of whether the proposed arbitration, disclosure and trade confirmation provisions provide adequate customer protection.
Further, commenters should discuss what are the compelling reasons, if any, from a fairness, business, increase
of access, flexibility, or other perspective, why the Commission should revise the above-cited rules to provide
for the exceptions necessary to implement the Proposal and what conditions, if any, should limit the use of such exceptions.
In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether Member Firms or their APs participating in the proposed program
may come within the Commission's regulatory framework for commodity trading advisors and should be required to register
as such, on whether the Proposal presents issues related to the oversight of such Member Firms and APs and on any other
aspect of the Proposal.

Copies of the Submission are available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies also may be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat
at the above address or by telephoning (202) 254-6314. Some materials may be subject to confidential treatment
pursuant to 17 CFR 145.5 or 145.9.

Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the Proposal should send such comments to
Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, by the specified
date.




Issued in Washington, DC, on December 6, 1994.

Railroad Commission of Texas; Tight Formation Area Determination; Notice of Preliminary Finding



December 5, 1994.


On December 23, 1991, the Railroad Commission of Texas (Texas) submitted its determination that the J through Y Sands
portion of the Vicksburg Formation (also known as the Lower Vicksburg), underlying parts of the McAllen Ranch Field
in Hidalgo County qualifies as a tight formation under Section 107(c)(5) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).





For the reasons discussed below, the Commission issues this Notice of Preliminary Finding that Texas' determination
for the J-Y Sands (Texas-15 Addition 3) is not supported by substantial evidence.



Background



After staff sent two tolling letters requesting Texas to provide a statement explaining its determination and requesting
additional data to support the determination, an informal conference was held at the request of Shell Western E &
P, Inc. (SWEPI), the applicant before Texas. Following that conference, Texas, at SWEPI's request, issued separate
tight formation area determinations for portions of the M, R, S, and T Lower Vicksburg Sands that are also included
in the Texas-15 Addition 3 determination, and deferred answering staff's tolling letter.
 By order issued September 30, 1994, the Commission affirmed Texas' separate determinations for the M, R, S, and T Sands.





On October 27, 1994, Texas responded to staff's second tolling letter in the Texas-15 Addition 3 proceeding by submitting
SWEPI's commentsand stating that those comments should satisfy the concerns raised in the tolling letter. The comments
provide additional explanations for why SWEPI believes that the recommended formation meets the guidelines but
contain no additional data on permeability or flow rate characteristics.



Discussion



Permeability Guideline



Section 271.703(c)(2)(i)(A) of the Commission's regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the


in situ 

permeability to gas, throughout the pay section in the formation, is expected to be 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less.






Each recommended sand (J, K, L, M, * * * etc.) is actually a sand package, consisting of multiple sands;
the recommended area for each Lower Vicksburg sand package is the same, whether the sand package is present throughout
all of the approximately 15,100-acre recommended area or not. The record contains permeability data for only 17 of
the 97 wells drilled within the recommended area. In addition, as shown below, permeability data was not provided
for each sand package.

Since Shell predicted permeability values for the sands with no data (i.e., untested sands), the tolling letter questioned
why Texas believed the determination was supported by substantial evidence and requested additional permeability
data.

In its comments responding to the second tolling letter, SWEPI argues that the subject sands are of the same age, the
same depositional environment, originated from the same source area, have very similar mineral composition, and
have undergone the same post-depositional structural and diagenetic processes. On this basis, SWEPI concludes
that the factors controlling porosity and permeability in the sands lacking pressure build-up (PBU) test data are
the same, or very similar, to the PBU tested sands.

SWEPI also argues that the untested sands are adjacent to sands with sufficient test data to afford sufficient control
to establish the basis for using the values that were calculated for untested sands. SWEPI further contends that the
empirical PBU data from the tested sands can be used to predict permeabilities in the untested sands. For this purpose,
SWEPI's Texas-15 Addition 3 application includes a graph which attempts to show that initial permeabilities may
be predicted based on a correlation between initial permeability, porosity, and gas saturation (i.e., that the points
on the graph demonstrate that there is a linear relationship between initial permeability and the other two factors).
SWEPI also argues that the few sands which lack PBU test data are either immediately above or below a PBU tested sand,
or (in most cases) between PBU tested sands.

We find, however, that the Texas-15 Addition 3 record does not contain substantial evidence showing that all of the
sands in the recommended interval (the J through Y Sands) meet the Commission's 0.1 md guideline for tight formation
designation over all of the 15,100-acre area being recommended. Our review of SWEPI's Engineering Exhibit 7 shows
that initial permeability varies widely from one sand package to the next,
 and even from one well to the next.
 Thus, the record shows that the permeability evidence from tested sand packages does not demonstrate that the untested
sands meet the 0.1 md guideline for tight formation designation. Moreover, the record does not show that initial permeability
for untested sands can be predicted using the linear relationship that SWEPI drew. An examination of SWEPI's graph
shows that the points on the graph are completely scattered; therefore, there is no linear relationship and no showing
that initial permeability is a function of porosity and gas saturation.






Natural Gas Flow Rate Guideline



Section 271.703(c)(2)(i)(B) of the Commission's regulations requires the jurisdictional agency to show that the
average pre-stimulation stabilized natural gas flow rate (against atmospheric pressure) of wells completed for
production in the formation does not exceed the applicable maximum allowable flow rate (based on the average depth
to the top of the formation and the table of maximum flow rates in the regulations).

Our review shows that the Texas-15 Addition 3 record does not contain individual pre-stimulation stabilized flow
rates from each completion for production in a recommended sand and no additional supporting documentation (i.e.,
completion reports and/or copies of driller's reports) verifying which sand intervals were completed for production
within each data well, and whether or not the PBU tested intervals correspond to those completion intervals. SWEPI's
pre-stimulation flow rate calculations for the J-Y interval rely on the predicted permeability values for
untested sands. In view of the fact that these predicted values are flawed, we find that the Texas-15 Addition 3 record
does not contain substantial evidence that the stabilized production rate, against atmospheric pressure, of wells
completed for production in the J-Y Sand interval, without stimulation, is not expected to exceed the applicable
allowable found in the Commission's regulations. Moreover, we find that the additional pre-stimulation stabilized
flow rate data developed for the separate M, R, S, and T Sand determinations does not provide evidence as to the flow
rate characteristics of completions for production in other sands, in other wells.



SWEPI's De Novo Review Argument



SWEPI argues that the Commission has exceeded its substantial evidence review authority under Section 503 of the
NGPA and conducted a de novo review of the Texas-15 Addition 3 application. SWEPI's argument is based in large part
on the detailed data requests in staff's tolling letters.

We find that SWEPI's argument is without merit. The Commission has consistently required that the 

in situ

 permeability and pre-stimulation natural gas and crude oil flow rate guidelines pertain to the initial permeability
and flow rate characteristics of the formation, not to conditions resulting from years of sustained production.
 Since the record in the Texas-15 Addition 3 determination clearly indicates that initial well completions in natural
gas pay sections within the J-Y Sand interval (within the recommended area) exceed the guidelines for tight
formation designation, and that it is only as a result of sustained production that the producing well completions
begin to exhibit permeability and flow rate values below the numerical limits in the regulations, the record does
not support a determination that the recommended formation meets the permeability and flow rate guidelines established
by the Commission. Therefore, staff's requests for data to provide additional evidence to support Texas' determination
was appropriate. As discussed above, our review shows that the record does not contain sufficient data to support
Texas' determination that the recommended area and the recommended interval meets each of the Commission's guidelines.





Under  275.202(a) of the regulations, the Commission may make a preliminary finding, before any determination
becomes final, that the determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Based on the above discussion,
the Commission hereby makes a preliminary finding that Texas' determination is not supported by substantial evidence
in the record upon which it was made.
 Texas or the applicant may, within 30 days from the date of this preliminary finding, submit written comments and request
an informal conference with the Commission, pursuant to  275.202(f) of the regulations. A final Commission
order will be issued within 120 days after the issuance of this preliminary finding.






By direction of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America; Notice of Amendment</DOCTITLE>



December 6, 1994.



Take notice that on November 30, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard,
Illinois, 60148, filed to amend its application in Docket No. CP93-672-000 for permission authorizing
the abandonment of facilities constructed in the 1930's and 1960's, and partial replacement of these facilities,
all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Natural requested authorization in Docket No. CP93-672-000 for the abandonment of approximately 490
miles of the original 24
'
' Amarillo No. 1 mainline and one 12,000 HP engine at intermediate Compressor Station 195 located in Washington
County, Kansas. Natural also requested the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing
it to construct and operate: (1) Approximately 9.41 miles of 30
'
' loop and three separate segments of 36
'
' loop totaling approximately 18.66 miles in Hutchinson County, Texas; Ford County, Kansas; Lincoln County,
Kansas; and Otoe County, Nebraska, respectively, at an aggregate estimated cost of $19,020,000; and, (2) one 14,500
HP compressor engine, by means of retrofitting one existing 12,000 HP engine to 14,500 HP, at Compressor Station 195
located in Washington County, Kansas, at an estimated cost of $5,925,000. Natural indicated that the abandonment
and construction project was proposed to increase the reliability of Natural's services and reduce operating costs
by eliminating or replacing parts of the system that are obsolete and require high operation and maintenance costs.

In Docket No. CP93-672-001 Natural proposes to amend its application in Docket No. CP93-672-000
to eliminate from that docket the proposed abandonment and construction activity south of its Hooker Lateral in Beaver
County, Oklahoma. Natural states that it is now requesting authorization to abandon approximately 308 miles of its
24-inch diameter Amarillo No. 1 line and one compressor engine at its Compressor Station 195 located in Washington
County, Kansas. According to Natural's application to amend, it is also requesting authorization to construct and
operate approximately 9.46 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline in Otoe County, Nebraska and one 14,500 horsepower
compressor engine, by means of retrofitting an existing engine, at its Compressor Station 195. Natural estimates
the total cost of the new construction to be approximately $12,828,000.


Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before December
27, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate and permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the
public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own
motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Natural to appear or
be represented at the hearing.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Standard for Determining Whether Certain Information Is ``Necessary,'' Within the Meaning of Section 7114(b)(4)(B)
of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Labor Relations Authority.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of the opportunity to file briefs as 

amici curiae

 in certain unfair labor practice proceedings in which agencies have refused to provide information requested by
labor organizations under section 7114(b)(4) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C.
7114(b)(4)).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Labor Relations Authority provides an opportunity for all interested persons to file briefs as 

amici curiae

 on a significant issue common to a number of cases pending before the Authority involving the refusals of agencies
to provide labor organizations with information requested under section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Labor Relations Authority has pending before it cases where agencies have refused to provide labor organizations
with information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute because the agencies allege, 

inter alia,

 that the requested information is not ``necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation
of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining[.]'' 5 U.S.C. 7114(b)(4)(B). In National Park Service, National
Capital Region, United States Park Police, 48 FLRA 1151 (1993) (National Park Service) (Member Talkin concurring
in part and dissenting in part), the Authority adopted the standard set forth in 

National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA,

 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (

NLRB v. FLRA

), for determining when requested information involving advice, guidance, counsel or training provided for management
officials is ``necessary,'' within the meaning of section 1714(b)(4)(B). The Authority is now considering application
of the National Park Service standard to pending cases, including whether a different standard should be applied
to requests for other types of information.


In this context, parties in the following pending cases have been directed to file statements with the Authority addressing
certain questions. The cases, and the types of information at issue therein, are:
Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Ventura District Office, Case No. 8-CA-20443;
where the union requested supervisors' ``memory joggers.''
United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, Case No. 6-CA-10866;
where the union requested memoranda written by employees requesting assignments to certain work units.
Social Security Administration, Dallas Region, Case No. 6-CA-10825; where the union requested ``memory
joggers'' pertaining to a certain bargaining unit employee who was challenging an appraisal rating.
United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Case No. 7-CA-0658; where the union
requested a performance appraisal of an employee who was appraised under a performance plan identical to that of a
unit employee who was dissatisfied with her appraisal rating.
Federal Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, Pennsylvania, 12-CA-20160;
where the union requested a crediting plan for a first-line supervisory position for which a bargaining unit employee
was not selected.
Parties in the aforementioned cases were directed to provide briefs addressing the following questions:
1. Do the requested documents constitute guidance, advice, counsel or training provided for management officials
or do they fall within some other category? Why do you so characterize them?
2. If the requested documents do not constitute guidance, advice, counsel or training provided for management officials,
should the standard set forth in National Park Service be applied to such documents, in light of 

NLRB v. FLRA; Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base v. FLRA,

 956 F.2d 1223 (D.C. Cir. 1992); 

U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery, Pennsylvania v. FLRA,

 988 F.2d 1267 (D.C. Cir. 1993); 

Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA,

 1 F.3d 19 (D.C. Cir. 1993); 

Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, El Paso,
TX v. FLRA,

 991 F.2d 285 (5th Cir. 1993); and 

United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Northern Region, Twin Cities, Minnesota;
Office of Inspector General, Washington, D.C.; and Office of Professional Responsibility, Washington, D.C. v.
FLRA,

 No. 93-1284 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 4, 1994), slip op. at 16-17? If not, why not, and what standard should be applied?
3. What showing of need for the requested information has the Union established?
4. What interest has the Agency established for not disclosing the requested information?
Although these questions were asked of the parties in the above-referenced cases, the matters addressed in the questions
posed are likely to be of concern to the Federal sector labor-management relations community in general. With respect
to questions 3 and 4, the matters of broader concern would be the showings of need (question 3) and interest (question
4) the union and respondent, respectively, would be required to establish under whatever standard is advanced as
appropriate for application. Therefore, the Authority finds it appropriate to provide for the filing of briefs as


amici curiae

 addressing any or all of these matters.



Dated: December 7, 1994.



For the Authority.

Travel Restriction Modifications for the Rabbit Valley Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Department of Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Order of Area, Road and Trail Travel Restriction.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This order, issued under the authority of 43 CFR 8342.1 and 43 CFR 8364.1 limits non-motorized mechanized and motorized
travel on identified public lands in the vicinity of Rabbit Valley. This order authorizes single-track travel routes
for mechanized vehicles (including motorcycles, snowmobiles and bicycles) less than 40 inches in width and authorizes
two-track travel routes for mechanized vehicles (including all-terrain vehicles and four-wheel drives) over 40
inches in width. Authorized routes will be identified on recreation area maps and designated by on-the-ground white
arrow signing. 


The identified public land is in Colorado, Mesa County, under the management jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management,
Grand Junction Resource Area, Grand Junction District. The area is bounded by the Colorado River on the south, the
Colorado-Utah stateline on the west, Interstate 70 on the north and Salt Creek on the east. The area is located in T.
10 S., R. 103 W. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 18, 19; T. 10 S., R. 104 W., Sections 1, 2, and 9 to 33; T. 11 S., R. 104 W., Sections 4, 5,
6, 7, 8; 6th P.M.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Rabbit Valley is experiencing heavy and generally undirected recreational use. Dominant recreational pursuits
include; horse riding, mountain biking, hiking, off-highway vehicle (OHV) riding, camping, dinosaur fossil viewing
and viewing rock art. Current travel designations for the area, established in the Grand Junction Resource Area,
Resource Management Plan, 1987, allowed ``motorized use is permitted only on existing roads and trails'' or ``closed''
areas to motorized use . These travel designations still facilitated the expansion of unauthorized routes. The unauthorized
routes resulted in multiple trailings, unaesthetic landscape conditions, and unacceptable impacts to cultural,
soil, vegetation and wildlife resources. 


The Grand Junction Resource Area, Resource Management Plan, 1987, identified the need for to prepare supplemental
recreation management plans for the Grand Valley which includes Rabbit Valley. The Rabbit Valley Recreation Area
Management Plan (RAMP) and Environmental Assessment (CO-076-1-16) was prepared, with public
participation and comment. This order implements the Decision Record signed on May 7, 1991 by the Grand Junction Resource
Area Manager. 
Travel routes that did not negatively affect resources were authorized as either single-track routes open to mechanized
travel under 40 inches in with or as two-track routes open to mechanized vehicles 40 inches and over in width. The area
affected by this order will be posted with appropriate regulatory signs. Travel maps of the area are available at the
Grand Junction Resource Area Office and Grand Junction District Office. 
All motorized vehicle use will be limited year round, including snowmobiles operating on snow. Persons who are exempt
from the restrictions include: (1) Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, emergency and law enforcement
activities; (2) BLM employees engaged in official duties; (3) Other persons authorized to operate motorized vehicles
within the restricted area.



PENALTIES:

 Violations of this restriction order are punishable by fines not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed
12 months.

<DOCTITLE>Louisiana Southern Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_ </DOCTITLE>
at Chalmette, LA 



Louisiana Southern Railway Company (LS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_

Exempt Abandonments 

to abandon a 1.4-mile line of railroad between milepost 1.7-LS and milepost 3.1-LS at Chalmette, in St.
Bernard Parish, LA. 

LS has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) there is no overhead traffic
on the line; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a state or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or

and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (service of verified notice on governmental agencies) have been met. 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under


Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 

360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial
revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 

Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on January 11, 1995, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve
environmental issues,

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Commonwealth Edison Company; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-19, DPR-25, DPR-29, and DPR-30,
issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd, the licensee) for the Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3,
located in Grundy County, Illinois, and the Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Rock Island
County, Illinois.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would grant an exemption from certain requirements of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 in response to
the licensee's request of October 4, 1994. More specifically, for each two-ply bellows that has been identified to
leak through both plies, the exemption being proposed will relax the requirement to perform a Type A test every refuel
outage as specified in an Exemption to the appendix J requirements dated February 6, 1992. The proposed revised exemption
will allow the option of: (1) Conducting a Type B test of the leaking bellows prior to the return to service during the
present outage, or (2) conducting a Type A test to be followed up, at the next subsequent outage, with replacement of
the bellows or conducting a Type B test of the leaking bellows to demonstrate license limits are met.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed to relax an unnecessary requirement to perform a Type A test each refuel outage in which
a two-ply bellows has been identified as leaking through both plies. The licensee has developed alternative Type
B testing methods to assure a valid Type B test could be performed on these non-Type B testable bellows. The requirement
to Type A test and to replace all bellows that leak through both plies could result in significant costs being incurred
unnecessarily with no safety benefit in return.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The proposed exemption revision substitutes an alternative testing and replacement program for the Type A testing
requirements of the original exemption. The alternative testing program would allow, upon completion of the two-ply
bellows special testing program, the following to be accomplished for those two-ply bellows that were found to leak
through both plies: (1) Performance of a Type B test to ensure license limits are met prior to return to service, or (2)
performance of a Type A test before the return to service followed by replacement of the bellows or performance of a
Type B test to ensure license limits are met before the return to service from a subsequent refuel outage. Thus, this
revised exemption will not change the types, or allow an increase in the amounts, of effluents that may be released
offsite and will not result in an increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. With regard
to potential non-radiological environmental impacts, the proposed revised exemption does not affect non-radiological
plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
(construction permit and operating license) for Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Units 2 and 3, dated November 1973,
and for Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, dated September 1972.



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the proposed
exemption, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
to the exemption would be to require rigid compliance with the requirements of the original Exemption requiring a
Type A test every refuel outage and in the subsequent refuel outage replace bellows that had a leak, however small,
on both plies. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result in unwarranted licensee
expenditures of engineering and construction resources, as well as associated capital costs.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The staff consulted with the Illinois State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the forgoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. 

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's letter of October 4, 1994. This document is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
D.C., and at the local public document room located at the Morris Public Library, 604 Liberty Street, Morris, Illinois
60450, and at the Dixon Public Library, 221 Hennepin Avenue, Dixon, Illinois 61021.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to the In Person Trading Volume Requirement for Registered Option Traders



December 5, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 18, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule change



The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 958 to (a) require that a Registered Option Trader (``Trader'') execute at least
25% of his/her options transactions and volume in person
 and (b) provide that if a Trader executes at least 80% of his options transactions and volume in person, the Trader can
receive favorable capital and margin treatment for certain opening off-floor activity. The text of the proposed
rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Exchange Rule 958 sets forth the obligations of Traders when they initiate options transactions on the floor of the
Exchange for accounts in which they have an interest. These obligations include, but are not limited to, contributing
to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, bidding and offering within prescribed parameters and, when establishing
or increasing an options position, initiating such transactions on the floor of the Exchange.
The Exchange now proposes to establish an additional requirement that at least 25% of a Trader's transactions and
contract volume during each calendar quarter be executed in person and not through the use of orders given to a floor
broker or left on a specialist's book. The Exchange believes that establishing such a requirement will result in better,
more liquid markets because Traders will be available in trading crowds to contribute to the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets, to make competitive bids and offers, and to trade for their own account when there exists a lack of
price continuity, a temporary disparity between the supply of and demand for options contracts or a temporary distortion
of the price relationships between options.
While the Exchange believes an in person requirement of 25% is appropriate at this time, it is further proposed that
the Exchange be given the authority to increase the in person requirement above 25% should such action be deemed necessary
by the Exchange.
The Exchange also proposes to extend favorable capital and margin treatment to certain opening orders entered by
Traders from off the Exchange floor provided at least 80% of their total transactions and contract volume is executed
in person during any calendar quarter. These off-floor orders shall also be subject to Rule 958 and may be effected
only for the purpose of hedging, reducing the risk of, or rebalancing a Trader's open positions.
Currently, pursuant to Exchange Rule 958, only transactions initiated on the floor of the Exchange can count as Registered
Trader transactions.
 Only on-floor transactions qualify for favorable capital and margin treatment, even if such orders are entered to
adjust or hedge the risk of a Trader's positions that are the result of on-floor market making activity. Because Traders
cannot, according to the Exchange, effectively adjust positions or engage in hedging or other risk-limiting opening
transactions from off the Exchange floor without incurring a significant economic penalty, they must be either physically
present on the floor at all times while the market is open, or face significant risk of adverse market movements during
those times when they must necessarily be absent from the trading floor. The Exchange believes that the imposition
of these costs on such risk-adjusting transactions prevents Traders from effectively discharging their market
making obligations and exposes them to unacceptable levels of risk. The Exchange believes that the proposal presents
a more appropriate and realistic treatment of Traders' transactions initiated from off-floor than is currently
provided by Exchange rules. Extending favorable capital and margin treatment to off-floor transactions to those
Traders who satisfy an 80% in person requirement will, in the Exchange's opinion, increase the extent to which Traders'
transactions contribute to liquidity and to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by providing for a greater
degree of in person trading and by enabling Traders to better manage the risk of their market making.




The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-51

<DOCTITLE>PaineWebber Incorporated, et al.; Notice of application</DOCTITLE>


December 6, 1994.


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

PaineWebber Incorporated (the ``Sponsor''); and Paine, Webber Municipal Bond Fund, The Municipal Bond Fund, The
Corporate Bond Trust, PaineWebber Pathfinders Trust, The PaineWebber Federal Government Trust, and The PaineWebber
Equity Trust (the ``Trusts'').



RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested pursuant to section 6(c) for exemptions from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), 22(d), and 26(a)(2)(C)
of the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder, and pursuant to section 11(a) to amend two prior orders (the ``Prior Orders'')
granting relief from section 11(c).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek to impose sales charges on a deferred basis and waive the deferred sales charge in certain cases, exchange
Trust units having deferred sales charges, and exchange units of a terminating series of a Trust for units of the next
available series of that Trust.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.


Applicants' Representations


1. Each of the Trusts is a unit investment trust sponsored by the Sponsor. The Trusts are made up of one or more separate
series (``Series''). Over five hundred Series have been created by the Trusts collectively.
2. Each Series is created by a trust indenture among the Sponsor, a banking institution or trust company as trustee,
and an evaluator. The Sponsor acquires a portfolio of securities and deposits them with a trustee in exchange for certificates
representing fractional undivided interests in the portfolio of securities (``Units''). Units currently are offered
to the public through the Sponsor and other underwriters and dealers at a price based upon the aggregate offering side
evaluation of the underlying securities plus an up-front sales charge. The sales charge currently ranges from 4.75%
to 2% of the public offering price, and is subject to reduction as permitted by rule 22d-1.
3. Applicants seek an order under section 6(c) exempting them from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), 22(d), and
26(a)(2)(C) and rule 22c-1 thereunder to let them impose sales charges on Units on a deferred basis and waive
the deferred sales charge in certain cases. Under applicants' proposal, the Sponsor will continue to determine the
amount of sales charge per Unit at the time portfolio securities are deposited in a Series. The Sponsor will have the
discretion to defer collection of all or part of this sales charge over a period following the purchase of Units. The
Sponsor will in no event add to the deferred amount initially determined any additional amount for interest or any
similar or related charge to reflect or adjust for such deferral.
4. The Sponsor anticipates collecting a portion of the total sales charge immediately upon purchase of Units. A portion
of the outstanding balance will be deducted periodically by the trustee from distributions on the Units and paid to
the Sponsor until the total amount of the sales charge is collected. If distribution income is insufficient to pay
a deferred sales charge installment, the trustee will have the ability under the trust indenture to sell portfolio
securities in an amount necessary to provide the requisite payments. If a unitholder redeems or sells to the Sponsor
his or her Units before the total sales charge has been collected from installment payments, the balance of the sales
charge may be collected at the time of such redemption or sale.
5. For purposes of calculating the amount of the deferred sales charge due upon redemption or sale of Units, it will
be assumed that Units on which the balance of the sales charge has been collected from installment payments are liquidated
first. Any Units disposed of over such amounts will be redeemed in the order of their purchase, so that Units held for
the longest time are redeemed first.
6. The Sponsor intends to waive collection of the unpaid balance of the deferred sales charge upon any sale or redemption
of Units. If applicants later decide to collect the unpaid balance of the deferred sales charge upon sale or redemption,
they may nonetheless waive payment of the balance of the deferred sales charge on redemptions or sales of Units in certain
specific cases. Any such waiver will be disclosed in the prospectus and will satisfy the other conditions of rule 22d-1.

7. The Sponsor believes that the operation and implementation of the deferred sales charge program will be disclosed
adequately to potential investors as well as unitholders. The prospectus for each Series will describe the operation
of the deferred sales charge, including the amount of and date of each installment payment. The prospectus also will
contain disclosure pertaining to the trustee's ability to sell portfolio securities if the income generated by a
Series' portfolio is insufficient to pay an installment. The securities confirmation statement sent by the Sponsor
to each purchaser will state the amount of the ``up-front'' sales charge, if any, and the amount of the deferred sales
charge to be deducted in regular installments. The annual report of each Series will state the amount of annual installment
payments deducted during the previous fiscal year on both a per Trust and per Unit basis. 

8. The maximum sales charge on Units acquired in the secondary market normally ranges from 5.75% to 3% of the public
offering price of the Units. The Prior Orders permit applicants to allow unitholders to exchange Units of one Series
for Units of another Series subject to an additional sales charge not to exceed 2% of the public offering price of the
acquired Units. The additional sales charge is calculated as the greater of (a) a flat fee, or (b) if Units of any Series
are exchanged within five months of their acquisition for Units of a Series with a higher sales charge, an amount which,
together with the sales charge already paid on the Units being exchanged, equals the normal sales charge on the acquired
Units. 

9. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Orders to permit offers of exchange of Units subject to a deferred sales charge.
If Units subject to a deferred sales charge are exchanged for Units of a Series not having a deferred sales charge, the
deferred sales charge will be collected at the time of the exchange. If Units subject to a deferred sales charge are
exchanged for Units of a Series having a deferred sales charge, installment payments will continue to be deducted
from the distributions on the acquired Units until the original balance of the sales charge owed on the initial investment
has been collected. In either case, the additional sales charge permitted under the Prior Orders will be imposed at
the time of the exchange. 

10. The Sponsor offers certain Series which have short-term stated maturities. Upon termination of such Series,
the Sponsor may create a new Series with the same investment objective and the same type of portfolio securities as
the terminating Series. Applicants wish to make Units of the new Series available to the unitholders of the terminating
Series at the net asset value of the new Units plus the reduced sales charge permitted under the Prior Orders (the ``Rollover
Option''). Although applicants believe that the Prior Orders already permit the Rollover Option, they request that
the Prior Orders be amended to cover the Rollover Option explicitly.

Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Under section 6(c), the SEC may exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Act or any rule thereunder
to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
2. Section 2(a)(32) defines a ``redeemable security'' as a security that, upon its presentation to the issuer, entitles
the holder to receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash
equivalent of those assets. Because the imposition of deferred sales charge may cause a redeeming unitholder to receive
an amount less than the net asset value of the redeemed Units, applicants seek an exemption from section 2(a)(32) so
that Units subject to a deferred sales charge are considered redeemable securities for purposes of the Act.





3. Section 2(a)(35) defines the term ``sales load'' to be the difference between the sales price and the proceeds to
the issuer, less any expenses not properly chargeable to sales or promotional expenses. Because a deferred sales
charge is not charged at the time of purchase, an exemption from section 2(a)(35) is necessary.
4. Section 22(c) and rule 22c-1 require that the price of a redeemable security issued by an investment company
for purposes of sale, redemption, and repurchase be based on the investment company's current net asset value. Because
the imposition of a deferred sales charge may cause a redeeming unitholder to receive an amount less than the net asset
value of the redeemed Units, applicants seek an exemption from this section and rule.
5. Section 22(d) requires an investment company and its principal underwriter and dealer to sell securities only
at a current public offering price described in the investment company's prospectus. Because sales charges traditionally
have been a component of the public offering price, section 22(d) historically required that all investors be charged
the same load. Rule 22d-1 was adopted to permit sale of redeemable securities ``at prices that reflect scheduled
variations in, or elimination of, the sales load.'' Because rule 22d-1 does not extend to scheduled variations
in deferred sales charges, applicants seek relief from section 22(d) to permit them to waive or reduce their deferred
sales charge in certain specified instances.
6. Section 26(a)(2) in relevant part prohibits a trustee or custodian of a unit investment trust from collecting from
the trust as an expense any payment to a depositor or principal underwriter thereof. Because of this prohibition,
applicants need an exemption to permit the trustee to collect the deferred sales charge installments from distribution
deductions or Trust assets.
7. Applicants believe that implementation of the deferred sales charge program in the manner described above would
be fair and in the interests of the unitholders of the Trusts. Thus, granting the requested order would be appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act.
8. Section 11(c) prohibits any offers of exchange of the securities of a registered unit investment trust for the securities
of any other investment company, unless the terms of the offer have been approved by the SEC. Applicants assert that
the reduced sales charge imposed at the time of exchange is a reasonable and justifiable expense to be allocated for
the professional assistance and operational expenses incurred in connection with the exchange.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Whenever the exchange option is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a security
subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at least 60 days
prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment, provided that: (a) No such notice need be given
if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge payable at the time of an exchange,
to add one or more new Series eligible for the exchange option, or to delete a Series which has terminated; and (b) no
notice need be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, either (i) there is a suspension of the redemption of
units of the Trust under section 22(e) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or (ii) a Trust temporarily
delays or ceases the sale of its Units because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in accordance with applicable
investment objectives, policies, and restrictions.
2. The sales charge collected at the time of any exchange or conversion shall not exceed 2% of the public offering price
of the Unit being acquired on each exchange.
3. The prospectus of each Trust offering exchanges and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence
of the exchange option will disclose that the exchange option is subject to modification, termination, or suspension,
without notice except in certain limited cases.
4. Each Series offering Units subject to a deferred sales charge will include in its prospectus the table required
by item 2 of Form N-1A (modified as appropriate to reflect the differences between unit investment trusts and
open-end management investment companies) and a schedule setting forth the number and date of each installment payment.

<DOCTITLE>Southwest Florida International Airport, Ft. Myers, Florida; Noise Exposure Map Notice</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.




Action: 

Notice.




</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by the Lee County Port
Authority for the Southwest Florida International Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety
and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the Southwest Florida International
Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective November 21, 1994.



Under Section 103 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible
land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in
which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested
and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.

The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the Lee County Port
Authority. The specific maps under consideration are ``CURRENT (1994) NOISE CONTOURS WITH RUNWAY EXTENSIONS, MAP
A'' and ``FUTURE (1999) NOISE CONTOURS WITH RUNWAY EXTENSIONS AND PARALLEL RUNWAY, MAP B'' in the submission. The
FAA has determined that these maps for the Southwest Florida International Airport are in compliance with applicable
requirements. This determination is effective on November 21, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's
noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained
in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information
or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under Section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of Section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under  150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

Copies of the noise exposure maps and of the FAA's evaluation of the maps are available for examination at the following
locations:

<DOCTITLE>Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement; Changes in Aircraft Flight Patterns Over the State of New Jersey;
Reopening of the Comment Period and Public Hearings</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Reopening of comment period and notice of public hearings.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On November 12, 1992, the FAA issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to assess the impact of changes
in aircraft flight patterns caused by implementation of the Expanded East Coast Plan over the State of New Jersey.
The comment period on the DEIS closed on November 23, 1993. On September 30, 1994, the FAA issued a Supplemental Draft
Environmental Impact Statement (SDEIS) to afford the public an opportunity to review and comment on (1) a proposed
mitigation measure, (2) analysis of the proposal by the New Jersey Coalition Against Aircraft Noise (NJCAAN) to route
aircraft departing Newark International Airport over the ocean twenty four hours a day, and (3) other new and updated
information developed in response to comments on the DEIS. The SDEIS was issued for public comment for 60 days, on September
30, 1994.



In response to requests from several members of the New Jersey congressional delegation, the FAA is reopening the
comment period on the SDEIS on December 12, for an additional 60 days. This will afford the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental
Research additional time to review data and documentation concerning the SDEIS provided between early September
and October 28 and provide comments on behalf of the NJCAAN.

Because the comment period is being extended, the FAA will now be able to conduct additional hearings in Morris and
Bergen Counties as requested by several members of Congress. Additional hearings will facilitate comments by citizens
potentially affected by the Solberg mitigation proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The most useful comments are those which are as specific as possible and provide facts and analysis to support the reviewer's

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS


Notice of a Meeting


The Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service, pursuant to its Bylaws (39 C.F.R. Section 7.5) and the Government
in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552b), hereby gives notice that it intends to hold a meeting at 8:00 a.m. on Monday,
December 12, 1994, in Washington, DC. The meeting is closed to the public (See 59 FR 61927, December 2, 1994).
At its meeting on December 5, 1994, the Board of Governors voted to add to its agenda consideration of the Postal Rate
Commission's Opinion and Recommended Decision on Remand in Docket No. 90-1.
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c) (3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3 (c)
and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, discussion of this matter is exempt from the open meeting requirement
of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information in connection
with proceedings under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with postal ratemaking, mail classification
and changes in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39,
United States Code.
The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10) of Title 5, United States Code, and section
7.3(j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion is exempt because it is likely to specifically concern
participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination on the record after
opportunity for a hearing.
The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be
open to the public and no earlier public announcement of the addition to the agenda was possible.
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation, pursuant to section 552b(c) (3) and (10) of Title 5, United States Code;
and section 7.3 (c) and (j) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
The meeting will be held at U.S. Postal Service Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, S.W. The Board expects to discuss
the matters stated in the agenda which is set forth below. Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed
to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202) 268-4800.

UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE BOARD OF GOVERNORS


Notice of Vote to Close Meeting


At its meeting on December 5, 1994, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted unanimously to
close to public observation its meeting scheduled for January 9, 1995, in Washington, D.C. The members will consider
research and development funding for electronic commerce.
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace, and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary to the Board
Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(i) of
Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the
Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information, the premature disclosure
of which would significantly frustrate proposed procurement actions.
The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be
open to the public.
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code; and
section 7.3(i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202)

Supplements to New Drug Applications, Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or Abbreviated Antibiotic Applications
for Nonsterile Drug Products; Draft Guideline


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a draft guideline entitled ``Draft Guideline on Supplements
to NDA's, ANDA's, or AADA's for Nonsterile Drug Products.'' This draft guideline is intended to help distinguish
between manufacturing changes that require prior approval through a supplement to an approved new drug application
(NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or abbreviated antibiotic application (AADA), manufacturing
changes that require a supplement but that may be made prior to approval of the supplement, and those manufacturing
changes that need only to be described in an annual report. The draft guideline covers certain changes in the method
of manufacture that involve equipment changes, reprocessing of drug products that fail to meet specifications,
and changes made to the physical facility. The draft guideline also advises manufacturers of their statutory obligation
to comply with the current good manufacturing practice regulations regardless of whether or not they submit a supplement
to an application. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA regulations, in  314.70 (21 CFR 314.70), require applicants to notify FDA about each change in condition
established in an approved NDA, ANDA, or AADA. Applicants notify FDA of such changes through a supplemental application
and, depending on the type of change, may or may not need FDA approval before the change may be implemented (see  314.70(b)
and (c)). Examples of changes to a drug product that require prior FDA approval include: (1) Adding or deleting an ingredient
or otherwise changing the composition of the drug product; (2) relaxing the limits for a specification; (3) establishing
a new regulatory analytical method or deleting a specification or regulatory analytical method; (4) changing the
method of manufacturing of the drug product, including changing or relaxing an in-process control; (5) using a different
facility or establishment; and (6) establishing a new procedure for reprocessing a batch of the drug product that
fails to meet specifications (see  314.70(b)(2)). Examples of changes to a drug product that may be made before
FDA approval of a supplemental application include adding a new specification or test method or changing the methods,
facilities, or controls to provide increased assurance that the drug will have the characteristics of identity,
strength, quality, and purity which it purports or is represented to possess (see  314.70(c)(1)). 


The regulations also permit applicants to make some changes, including, but not limited to, changes to comply with
an official compendium or an editorial or minor change in labeling, without submitting a supplemental application;
instead, these changes are described in an annual report (see  314.70(d)).
FDA has prepared the draft guideline to help distinguish between some manufacturing changes that require prior approval
through a supplement to an approved NDA, ANDA, or AADA, some changes that require a supplement but that may be made prior
to approval of the supplement, and some changes that ordinarily may be described only in an annual report. The guideline
covers changes in the method of manufacture that involve certain equipment changes, reprocessing of drug products,
and certain changes made to the physical facility. For example, the draft guideline explains that changing to equipment
of different design or operating principles from previously utilized equipment would require prior FDA approval,
but changing to equipment of the same design and operating principles from the same or a different manufacturer could
be described in the annual report.
FDA is making this draft guideline available for public comment before issuing a final guideline. If, following receipt
of comments, the agency concludes that a guideline will assist firms in complying with the supplement regulations
at  314.70, FDA will prepare a final guideline and will announce its availability in the 

Federal Register
