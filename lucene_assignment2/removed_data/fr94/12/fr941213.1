International Banking Operations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board or Federal Reserve) is seeking public comment on a proposal
to amend its regulations to include criteria to be used in evaluating the operations of any foreign bank in the United
States that the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated
basis. The Board is required to develop such criteria, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury (Treasury),
and to publish them for public comment pursuant to section 202(e)(7) of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement
Act (the FBSEA or Act).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



The Statute



Section 202(e)(7) of the FBSEA amended section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA) by adding a requirement
that the Board, in consultation with the Treasury, develop and publish criteria to be used in evaluating the operation
of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive supervision
or regulation on a consolidated basis. In developing such criteria, the Board is required to allow reasonable opportunity
for public review and comment. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7). In order to implement this statutory provision, the Board is
issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 12 CFR part 211 of its regulations governing international
banking operations.

The Congress in enacting the FBSEA recognized the importance of the comprehensive, consolidated supervision of
banks operating internationally. The FBSEA strengthened the role of U.S. banking supervisors as the 

host

 country supervisors of foreign banks operating in this country. The Act also recognized the importance of 

home

 country supervision in assuring the overall safety and soundness of foreign banks that conduct operations in the
United States by requiring the Board:

1. To determine that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by its home country
supervisor in order to establish a new banking presence in this country; and

2. To establish, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, these criteria in order to evaluate the operation
of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to such supervision.

As provided in sections 7(e) (1) and (5) of the IBA, as amended, a determination by the Board that a foreign bank is not
subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis is a sufficient ground, in and of itself,
for the Board to require or, in respect of federal branches or agencies, to recommend, termination of the foreign bank's
U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(1),(5). Termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations in these circumstances
is not mandatory, however. Instead, in enacting section 7(e)(7) of the IBA, Congress recognized that there may be
factors in particular cases that militate against termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7).

All determinations with regard to whether a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on
a consolidated basis will be made in the context of the supervision and regulation of the foreign bank's existing U.S.
operations. Just as is the case with other supervisory or regulatory determinations, a foreign bank generally will
have an opportunity to provide its views and any information it considers to be relevant in advance of any decision
being made with regard to question of comprehensive, consolidated supervision, unless expeditious action is necessary
to protect the public interest.

The proposed criteria set out below reflect the factors the Board considers will be relevant for purposes of evaluating
the operations of any foreign bank the Board determines is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation
on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisors in accordance with 12 CFR 211.24(c)(1).



Criteria



Following a determination by the Board that a foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive, consolidated supervision
by its home country supervisor in accordance with  211.24(c)(1) of Regulation K, the Board proposes to take
into account a number of criteria in reaching a view regarding whether the foreign bank's U.S. operations should be
terminated or permitted to continue, and, if the latter, whether any supervisory constraints should be placed upon
the bank in connection with those operations. These criteria are:

1. The proportion of the foreign bank's total assets and total liabilities that are located or booked in its home country,
as well as the distribution and location of its assets and liabilities that are located or booked elsewhere;

2. The extent to which the operations and assets of the foreign bank and any affiliates are subject to supervision by
its home country supervisor;

3. Whether the foreign bank has effective and reliable systems of internal controls and management information and
reporting, which enable management properly to oversee the bank's worldwide operations;

4. Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor has any objection to the bank continuing to operate in the United
States;

5. Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor and the home country supervisor of any parent of the foreign
bank share material information regarding the operations of the foreign bank with other supervisory authorities;

6. The relationship of the U.S. operations to the other operations of the foreign bank, including whether the foreign
bank maintains funds in its U.S. offices that are in excess of amounts due from the foreign bank's non-U.S. offices;

7. The soundness of the foreign bank's overall financial condition;


8. The managerial resources of the foreign bank, including the competence, experience, and integrity of the officers
and directors and the integrity of its principal shareholders;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941213-1-00004 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

9. The scope and frequency of external audits of the foreign bank; 

10. The operating record of the foreign bank generally and its role in the banking system in its home country; 

11. The foreign bank's record of compliance with relevant laws, as well as the adequacy of its money laundering controls
and procedures, in respect of its worldwide operations; 

12. The operating record of the U.S. offices of the foreign bank and any affiliates; 

13. The views and recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'') or the relevant state
banking regulator regarding the U.S. offices of the foreign bank; 

14. Whether the foreign bank, if requested, has provided the Board with adequate assurances that such information
will be made available on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any of its affiliates as the Board deems
necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA, the BHC Act, and other applicable federal banking statutes;
and 

15. Any other information relevant to the safety and soundness of the U.S. operations of the foreign bank. 

These criteria address factors relating both to the operations of the foreign bank as a whole and to its U.S. operations
in particular. Evaluations of both of these facets of a foreign bank's operations are necessary in order to determine
whether the bank's U.S. operations should be permitted to continue and, if so, whether these operations should be
subject to supervisory constraints. 

As subsection (c) of proposed  211.30 of Regulation K provides, any foreign bank that the Board determines is
not subject to comprehensive, consolidated supervision may be required to enter into an agreement to conduct its
U.S. operations subject to such restrictions as the Board, having taken into account the criteria, determines to
be appropriate in order to assure the safety and soundness of the bank's U.S. operations. Where appropriate, such
an agreement could require a suitable degree of insulation between the foreign bank's U.S. operations and its operations
(or those of its affiliates) in other countries. For example, one means of accomplishing this would be to require the
bank to conduct its U.S. banking operations in a ``net due to'' position vis-a-vis the rest of the organization. Other
restraints also could be imposed where appropriate (

e.g., 

restricting transactions with other parts of the organization or requiring that international transactions of
the U.S. offices be conducted through a correspondent acceptable to the Board). Prior to imposing such restrictions,
the Board will consult with the OCC or the appropriate state banking authority. 

If any requirements imposed in such an agreement were not adhered to, the U.S. banking operations of the foreign bank
would be subject to further enforcement action, including issuance of an order terminating the activities of the
U.S. offices or transmittal of a recommendation to the OCC for such termination, as appropriate in the circumstances.




Request for Comment 



The Board believes that the proposed criteria will be sufficient to evaluate the safety and soundness of the U.S. operations
of a foreign bank, to determine whether its U.S. operations should be permitted to continue in the absence of comprehensive,
consolidated supervision by the home country authority, and, if so, on what basis. At the same time, the Board does
not wish to impact unduly the existing operations of foreign banks, the vast majority of which are operated in a safe
and sound manner by banks that are subject to a significant degree of supervision by their home country authorities.
The Board, therefore, considers it to be appropriate, in developing the proposed criteria, to take into account the
panoply of tools available to the Board and other banking regulators to regulate the operations of foreign banks that
are not yet subject to full consolidated supervision, which fall short of the ultimate sanction of termination of
their U.S. operations. 

As required by the Act, the Board has consulted with the Treasury in the development of the proposed criteria and the
Treasury has agreed that the criteria may be published for comment. Further consultation will take place with the
Treasury following the analysis by both agencies of the comments received. The Board requests comment on all aspects
of the proposed criteria. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) are contained in the proposed rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Board certifies that the proposed criteria would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities that are subject to its regulation.

Personal Protective Equipment for Shipyard Employment

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Rule; Request for public participation 
in public meeting.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announces an informal public meeting to provide an opportunity
for oral and written presentations regarding specific issues raised through the reopening of the Shipyard Employment
Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) rulemaking record (59 FR 34586, July 6, 1994) and the incorporation of the general
industry PPE rulemaking docket (S-060).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard
employment standards (part 1915, subpart I)(53 FR 48150). This proposal updated references to national consensus
standards and added requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection and care of PPE, training, lifesaving
equipment and personal fall protection. The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency received
10 comments on the proposed rule, and one hearing request, which was withdrawn.

On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket
S-060) for eye and face ( 1910.133), head ( 1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic
requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training
in the proper use of PPE,   1910.132(d) through (f) (54 FR 33832).

On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment ( 1910.128, 1910.129
and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (  1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry PPE
standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S-057)(55 FR 13423).

The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive rulemaking records, including hundreds of comments and
several thousand pages of hearing testimony.

On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in the general industry PPE proceeding.
Based on the rulemaking record, (59 FR 16334, Docket S-050), OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting
the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirements to provide clear requirements for
what is adequate training and what circumstances trigger retraining. In addition, the final rule added requirements
for certification that the required hazard assessment ( 1910.132(d)(2)) and training (  1910.132(f)(4))
had been performed.

Also, based on the general industry rulemaking record (Docket S-057), the Agency is considering whether it
should revise the proposed rule for general industry fall protection PPE to further limit or to prohibit the use of
body belts and non-locking snap hooks in personal fall arrest systems. In a related rulemaking for fall protection
in the construction industry, OSHA recently issued a final rule (59 FR 40672, August 9, 1994) which prohibits the use
of body belts and nonlocking snap hooks in personal fall arrest systems after December 31, 1997.

The Agency believes that the substance of the OSHA standards for general industry (part 1910), shipyard (part 1915)
and construction employment (part 1926) should be consistent where possible. OSHA believes that PPE used in shipyard
employment does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry, and that the standards covering PPE use should
not differ markedly either.

While the Agency recognizes that work activities in shipyard employment often differ from those in other industries,
the Agency believes that much of the information generated in the general industry rulemakings will help the Agency
draft the final rule for shipyard PPE. To this end, OSHA formally incorporated the general industry PPE rulemaking
records (Dockets S-057 and S-060) into the record for the shipyard employment PPE rulemaking (59 FR 34586,
July 6, 1994).

In that same notice, OSHA reopened the written comment period for the shipyard employment PPE rulemaking to provide
the public with an opportunity to comment on the newly incorporated general industry materials and on five specific
issues (certification of hazard assessment; certification of training; training elements; body belts and body
harnesses; and locking and non-locking snaphooks). The comment period, which ended August 22, 1994, elicited 13
comments, including one hearing request. These comments generally opposed any revision to proposed 1915 subpart
I based on the 1910 subpart I records.

Based on these submissions, OSHA is convening a public meeting to seek additional input regarding all issues raised
therein with emphasis on the issues set out below. OSHA solicits further input regarding how the incorporation of
the provisions discussed in the July 6, 1994 notice of reopening would impact the shipyard industry. The Agency also
requests that interested parties provide input regarding any experience they have had with the implementation of
such provisions.



Issues



Issue 1_Certification of Hazard Assessment



Proposed part 1915 subpart I would require that employers select PPE for their employees based on an assessment of
the pertinent workplace hazards (proposed  1915.152(b)). For example, shipyard maintenance workers, in
general, are required to wear hard hats, safety glasses and safety shoes. Maintenance workers who are exposed to airborne
concentrations of asbestos that exceed the PELs, are also required to wear full-body clothing, gloves and foot coverings.

The proposed provision did not specifically address documentation of the hazard assessment. The revised PPE standard
for general industry requires that affected employers verify that they have assessed workplace hazards through
a written certification. As discussed in the July 6, 1994 notice, the Agency has been considering whether it would
be appropriate to require written certification of hazard assessments in shipyards, as well.

One commentor (Ex. 9-2) said that such a certification provision required the approval of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act and the implementing regulations. Other comments (Exs.
9-3, 9-7, 9-8 and 9-10) stated that OSHA should take a performance-oriented approach to documentation
of hazard assessments, instead of adopting the general industry written certification requirement. In particular,
a commentor (Ex. 9-7) stated ``certification of hazard assessment requirements should be based on employees'
duties that tend to be constant rather than on the shipyard work place that is neither fixed, nor constant, nor readily
quantifiable like work places in all other industries.''

<DOCNO> FR941213-1-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, one commentor (Ex. 9-11) stated that hazard certification is unnecessary, because that company
has ``a good hazard assessment program that addresses PPE. A properly trained Compliance Officer can make a fair determination
concerning PPE.'' 

Those commentors indicated that requiring hazard assessments for each job, if followed literally, would create
considerable costs for shipyard employers, without increasing employee safety. Those commentors also stated that
requiring employers to certify their hazard assessment activities would increase shipyard operational costs and
paperwork burdens, with no safety benefit. 

Based on those comments, OSHA requests input regarding the appropriateness of a documentation requirement; the
manner in which shipyards currently document their hazard assessments; and suggested language for a verification
requirement that would address concerns specific to shipyard employment. In particular, the Agency solicits information
regarding hazard assessment programs currently in use in shipyards and experience concerning the effectiveness
of such programs. 

In addition, the Agency is considering the extent to which current hazard assessments performed by trade or occupation
provide the necessary information for selection of appropriate PPE. The following are examples of typical trade-based
hazard assessment formats that OSHA may consider to be acceptable: 



Example 1: Welder 



Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which welders are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic
PPE required for this occupation. This does not take into account a job location in which additional PPE may be required
such as where the welder works from an elevated platform without guard rails. In this situation the welder must wear
the proper fall protection equipment, such as a body harness. 




_Hard hat 

_Welding Shield (Face) 

_Welding Gloves 

_Safety Glasses 

_Safety Shoes 

_Welding Sleeves (welding in the overhead position) 





(Signed and dated) 




Example 2: Yard Maintenance Worker 



Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard maintenance workers are exposed, the equipment
listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. Where maintenance workers are exposed to other hazards,
such as asbestos exposure where the insulation on a pipe is being repaired, the maintenance worker must be provided
with the appropriate supplemental PPE (requirements for asbestos PPE are set out in  1915.1001).

 


_Hard Hat 

_Safety Glasses 

_Work Gloves 

_Safety Shoes

 



(Signed and dated) 



Issue 2_Certification of Training and Training Elements 



Proposed  1915.152(d) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment.
The proposal did not address certification of training nor did it address specific training elements. The revised
PPE standard for general industry requires employees to be trained and retrained, as necessary, in at least the following:





When PPE is necessary; 

What PPE is necessary; 

How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 

The limitations of the PPE; and, 

Useful life and disposal of the PPE 




This training may be provided in a variety of ways, such as through tool box training or at safety meetings. Once this
training has been completed,  1910.132(f)(4) requires employers to verify through a written certification
that each affected employee has received and understood the required training. This certification requirement
may be satisfied through a training log or other document that the employer has already been using to keep track of its
training activities. For compliance purposes, a record which provides the names of the employees who have successfully
completed the training, the date of the training, the type of certification (that is, completion of PPE training),
and the signature of a supervisor or trainer would be sufficient. OSHA solicits additional information concerning
whether it is appropriate to clarify the requirements of proposed  1915.152(d) by incorporating the above-noted
training elements and whether the Agency should add a new requirement for written certification of training. 

In response to the notice of reopening, OSHA received comments (Exs. 9-6, 9-8 and 9-9) which stated
that training can be satisfied during new employee orientation. Another commentor (Ex. 9-7) supported OSHA's
intent for general requirements for training. The commentor also believed that ``documentation of all training
should be in the form of training logs, which would be the equivalent of ``written certification'' to avoid the non-value
added redundance of record keeping.'' In addition, a commentor (Ex. 9-9) stated that most shipyards are already
complying with the OSHA PPE training standard under consideration. Most of the shipyards that responded to the notice
of reopening stated that they already have a written certification program and a new hire training program in effect.
One commentor (Ex. 9-11) stated that requiring employers to certify their training activities would increase
shipyard operational costs and paperwork burdens, with no safety benefit.

Issue 3_Body Belts and Body Harnesses 


Proposed part 1915 subpart I would allow the use of personal fall arrest systems with either body belts or body harnesses,
but would limit the impact load allowed for body belts to one-half of that allowed for body harnesses (900 pounds as
opposed to 1800 pounds). The July 6, 1994 notice stated that OSHA was considering whether the part 1915 subpart I final
rule should bar the use of body belts for fall protection. Some commentors (Exs. 9-1, 9-3, 9-7 and
9-8) suggested that there is no basis for barring the use of body belts for fall arrest and that the load limits
set in the proposed rule were appropriate. In particular, the South Tidewater Association of Ship Repairers and Newport
News Shipbuilding (Exs. 9-3 and 9-11) stated that requiring employers to dispose of body belts and to purchase
body harnesses would impose unreasonable financial burdens. Those commentors also stated that a review of their
records showed no injuries that would have been prevented by having employees wear body harnesses instead of body
belts; that belts had greater ease of use; and that the cost of harnesses was approximately double that of body belts.
On the other hand, Tampa Shipyard (Ex. 9-8), Atlantic Marine (Ex. 9-9), and General Dynamics (Ex. 9-10)
stated that they already employ body harnesses in their personal fall arrest systems. Tampa Shipyards and Atlantic
Marine stated that the use of body harnesses was cost effective, even though harnesses could cost twice as much as body
belts, because the additional safety factor provided by harnesses was worth the investment. In addition, General
Dynamics (Ex. 9-10) stated that its systems already comply with the general industry criteria. 
Subsequently, OSHA promulgated a revised fall protection standard for construction, part 1926 subpart M (59 FR 40672,
August 9, 1994), which prohibits the use of body belts in personal fall arrest systems after December 31, 1997. After
that time, construction employees may use body belts only with positioning device systems. The Agency has found,
as follows:


 


The evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that employees who fall while wearing a body belt are not afforded
the level of protection they would be if the fall occurred while the employee was wearing a full body harness. In addition,
[a commentor] presented evidence of injuries resulting from the use of body belts. The best available evidence the
Agency has at this time indicates that the Agency should ban the use of body belts after a reasonable period. This will
allow employers to phase out their existing inventory.



 

OSHA seeks input regarding the extent to which a phased in ban on the use of body belts in personal fall arrest systems
would be appropriate for shipyard employment. Please provide information on the useful life of body belts currently
in use or on the market, the impact loads imposed on employees who fall while wearing such body belts, the cost of the
body belts and body harnesses that are currently available, along with other data which would help OSHA address this

Missouri Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing on proposed amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the receipt of a proposed amendment to the Missouri Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) State Reclamation
Plan (hereinafter, the ``Missouri Plan'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The proposed amendment consists of changes to Missouri statute, regulations, and reclamation plan provisions of
the AML program pertaining to powers of the commission, AML reclamation fund, AML reclamation general requirements,
identification and establishment of reclamation priority of sites, elimination of selected priority sites, project
evaluation and ranking, and purchasing and procurement. The amendment is intended to revise the State AML Plan to
be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards, clarify ambiguities, and improve operational efficiency.




This notice sets forth the times and locations that the Missouri AML Plan and proposed amendment to that Plan are available
for public inspection, the comment period during which interested persons may submit written comments on the proposed
amendment, and procedures that will be followed regarding the public hearing, if one is requested.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background



Title IV of SMCRA established an Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) program for the purposes of reclaiming and
restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee
imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that
were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977,
and for which there was no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508, Title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C.
1231 

et seq.

 to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. The Secretary adopted AML regulations
(59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994) at 30 CFR Subchapter R, Parts 795, 870, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, and 886 to implement this act.
Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977.
These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation
and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for
adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR
program has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program.

The Secretary of the Interior approved the Missouri AMLR Plan on January 29, 1982. Information pertinent to the general
background of the Missouri AMLR Plan submission, as well as the Secretary's findings and the disposition of comments
can be found in the January 29, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 4253). Subsequent actions concerning Missouri's AMLR Plan and Plan amendments can be found at 30 CFR 925.25.

The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14
in approving and disapproving an amendment or revision.



II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated November 29, 1994, (Administrative Record No. AML-MO-89) Missouri submitted a proposed
amendment to its AML Plan pursuant to SMCRA. Missouri submitted the proposed amendment in response to a letter from
OSM dated September 26, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AML-MO-88), in accordance with 30 CFR 884.15(b)
concerning revisions to the AML regulations at 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter R (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994).

Missouri proposes to amend its statutes at RSMo Section 444.810, Powers of Commission-abandoned mine reclamation
fund created, purpose as well as RSMo Section 444.915, Abandoned mine reclamation fund-deposits and expenditures.
Missouri proposes to amend its regulations at 10 CSR 40-9.020 (1) and (3), Reclamation-General Requirements.
Missouri proposes to amend its AML Plan at Section 884.13(c)(2), project ranking and selection procedures and Section
884.13(d)(3), purchasing and procurement.



(1) 10 CSR 40-9.020(1) (D) and (E) and (3) General Requirements



The addition of subsections (D) and (E) make additional lands eligible for reclamation activities where the coal
mining site was left: (1) either unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed between August 4, 1977, and November 21, 1980,
where funds or other financial guarantees are not sufficient to provide or adequate reclamation or abatement at the
site; (2) either unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, and the surety
of such mining operator became insolvent during such period, and as of November 5, 1990, remaining funds or other financial
guarantees are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; (3) the site meets priority
objectives stated in subsections (4) (A) and (B) of this rule. Priority will be given to those sites which are in the
immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a community; and (4) monies
available from sources outside the fund or which are ultimately recovered from responsible parties involving lands
eligible pursuant to (1)(D) of this rule, shall either be used to offset the cost of the reclamation or transferred
to the fund if not required for further reclamation activities at the permitted site. The definition of left and abandoned
in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition is revised to be consistent with these changes.



(2) Section 884.13(c)(2) Project Ranking and Selection Procedures



The AMLR Plan is revised to require the submittal of the Abandoned Mine Land Problem Area Description Form (OSM 76).
This form will be utilized in identifying problem area priorities and submitted to OSM upon project completion to
report actual reclamation accomplishments.

The AMLR Plan is revised to ensure that certain interim sites and insolvent surety sites mined after August 3, 1977,
may be eligible for AML funding. Additional ineligible sites would include sites and areas designated for remedial
action pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7901 

et seq.

) or that have been listed for remedial action pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 

et seq.

).



(3) Section 884.13(d)(3), Purchasing and Procurement



Missouri is adding provisions that restrict the eligibility of bidders and their subcontractors on AML contracts:
(1) to any bidder or equipment supplier whose firm or affiliate is not listed in the General Services Administration
publication entitled Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs; and (2) must
be eligible to receive a permit or conditional permit to conduct surface coal mining operations as confirmed by OSM's
Applicant/Violator System.

Missouri also adds a provision that AML State Share funds may be requested annually for the Future Reclamation Set-Aside
Program. The funds would only be utilized to accomplish the purposes of P.L. 95-87 and only withdrawn after September
30, 1995. A separate accounting system would be utilized for these funds.

<TEXT>
 

(4) RSMo 444.810.2-8. Joint Committee on Administrative Rules



Missouri requires that any rules promulgated under the authority of the Land Reclamation Commission shall not become
effective until it has been approved by the joint committee on administrative rules. Missouri adds these subsections
to provide the procedures necessary for this review and approval process.



(5) RSMo 444.915.2(4), AML Reclamation Fund Expenditures



Missouri eliminates as a priority, expenditures for research and demonstration projects relating to the development
of surface mining reclamation and water quality control program methods and techniques.



(6) RSMo 444.915.3, AML Reclamation Fund Eligibility



Missouri revises this subsection to require that AML fund monies may be used if there is no continuing reclamation
responsibility under State or Federal laws for lands or water. Eligibility is defined in one of three ways: (1) as lands
and water affected by coal mining, wastebanks, coal processing or other coal mining processes and abandoned or left
in an inadequate reclamation status prior to September 28, 1979; (2) A finding must be made that the mining operation
occurred between August 4, 1977, and November 21, 1980, and that available funds are insufficient for adequate reclamation
or abatement; or (3) A finding may also be made that the mining operation occurred between August 4, 1977, and October
1, 1991, and that the surety became insolvent during that period and that available funds are not sufficient for adequate
reclamation or abatement.



III. Public Comment Procedures 



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 884.14, OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 884.14 for the approval of reclamation plan amendments. If the
amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Missouri AMLR Plan.



Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issue proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``DATES'' or at
locations other than the Kansas City Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.



Public Hearing



Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

by 4:00 p.m., c.s.t. December 28, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Any disabled individual who has a need for a special accommodation to attend a public hearing should contact the individual
listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to comment have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

Public Meeting



If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
at the OSM office listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

. All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES

. A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record.



IV. Procedural Determinations



Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned
mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph
8.4B(29)).



Compliance With Executive Order No. 12291



On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSM an exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive
Order 12291 for actions related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatory programs, actions, and program
amendments. Therefore, preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not necessary and OMB regulatory review is
not required.



Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal, which is the subject of this rule, is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.



Compliance With Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730,
731, and 732 have been met.



Compliance With the Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

<USBUREAU>Coast Guard</USBUREAU>














Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Lafourche Bayou, LA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

At the request of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, the Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulation
governing the operation of the following two drawbridges across Lafourche Bayou, in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana:



The State Route 1 (Galliano-Tarpon) vertical lift span bridge, mile 30.6 at Cutoff, Louisiana; and

The State Route 1 (Cote Blanche) pontoon bridge, mile 33.9 at Cutoff, Louisiana.

The proposed regulation would require that the bridges open on signal; except that from 2 to 3 p.m. and from 4:30 to 5:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, other than Federal holidays, the bridges would be permitted to remain closed to navigation
for the uninterrupted crossing of peak vehicular and school bus traffic. 

Presently, the draws of the bridges are required to open on signal at all times.

This action would relieve traffic congestion on the bridges during these periods and permit the timely return of school
children to their homes while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Request for Comments



Interested parties are invited to participate in the proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge and give
reasons for concurrence with or any recommended change in this proposal. Persons desiring acknowledgment that their
comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Eighth Coast Guard District
at the address under ADDRESSES.

 The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



The Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of
final action on this proposal. The proposed regulation may be changed in the light of comments received.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are Mr. John Wachter, project officer, and LT Elisa Holland, project attorney.



Background and Purpose



The Greater Lafourche Port Commission has requested the regulation because vehicular traffic crossing the bridges
during the proposed closure periods has increased dramatically during recent years and school children are delayed
from returning home from their classes in a timely manner. The new proposed regulation would allow for the free flow
of vehicular traffic, while still serving the reasonable needs of navigational interest.



Discussion of Proposed Rules



The Galliano ``Tarpon'' bridge is a vertical lift span structure. Navigational clearances provided by the bridge
are 3.0 feet vertical above mean high water in the closed to navigation position and 73 feet above mean high water in
the open to navigation position. Horizontal clearance is 80.0 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of tugs with
tows, fishing vessels, occasional small oil field work boats and recreational craft. Data provided by the Greater
Lafourche Port Commission show that from August 1993 through August 1994, the number of vessels that passed the bridge
totaled 1141 for the year. This breaks down to about 95 vessels per month or 3.1 vessels per 24-hour period. Vehicular
traffic that passes over the bridge during the proposed closure period from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. averages about 750 vehicles
including 4 school busses. An additional 4 school busses cross the bridge between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. and these busses
will be able to adjust their schedule to arrange to cross the bridge during the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. closure. Vehicular traffic
that crosses the bridge during the proposed closure period of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. averages approximately 780.

The Cote Blanche bridge is a pontoon bridge. There is no vertical clearance in the closed to navigation position and
unlimited clearance in the open to navigation position. The same type of navigation that passes the Galliano ``Tarpon''
bridge, also passes the Cote Blanche bridge. The average vessel passage per 24 hour period is 3.1. Vehicular traffic
that passes over the Cote Blanche Bridge during the proposed closure period from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. average about 380,
including 3 school busses. An additional 10 school busses cross the bridge between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. and these busses
will be able to adjust their schedule to cross during the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. closure. Vehicular traffic that crosses the
bridge during the proposed closure period of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. averages approximately 485.

Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.

Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected
to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq

.).



Federalism Implications



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated
under 

ADDRESSES.



List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117

LaFourche Bayou.



(a) The draws of the SR1 bridge, mile 30.6 and the SR1 bridge, mile 33.9, both near Cutoff, shall open on signal; except
that, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday except Federal holidays, the draws need
not be opened for the passage of vessels.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plan for Montana; Missoula; PM

10 

and CO Contingency Measures and Local Regulations; Disapproval of Missoula Variance Provision 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Montana with a letter
dated March 2, 1994. This submittal addresses the Federal Clean Air Act requirement to submit contingency measures
for both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM

10

) and for carbon monoxide (CO) for the areas in Missoula designated as nonattainment for the PM

10 

and CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Further, this submittal satisfies several commitments made
by the State in a previous PM

10 

SIP submittal. Due to the completion of those commitments, EPA is proposing to approve the related rules of the Missoula
City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences
on June 28, 1991 and amended on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor in letters dated August
20, 1991, June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994. These rules include regulations regarding inspections, emergency procedures,
minor source construction permits, open burning, and wood waste burners. EPA also proposes to approve minor revisions
to previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program Chapters VII and VIII, as included in
the March 2, 1994 submittal. Further, EPA declines to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations.
Finally, EPA proposes to disapprove Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances.




In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, EPA is acting on the State's SIP revisions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for EPA's actions
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this document should do so at this time.

flood elevation modifications for the communities listed below. The base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis
for the floodplain management measures that the community is required either to adopt or to show evidence of being
already in effect in order to qualify or remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 


These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


This proposed rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration.
No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared. 


Regulatory Classification 


This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


This proposed rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987. 


Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform 


This proposed rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 


List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 67 


Administrative practice and procedure, Flood insurance, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

 

Accordingly, 44 CFR part 67 is proposed to be amended as follows:

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns




DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY





DLA Acquisition Regulation; Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Logistics Agency, Defense.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule and requests for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 48 CFR Parts 219 and 252 provide regulatory coverage
incorporating two standard clauses giving small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns a ten percent evaluation
preference in competitive acquisitions where award is based on price and price related factors. The Defense Logistics
Agency Regulation (DLAR) 48 CFR parts 5419 and 5452, as proposed in the 

Federal Register 

of April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21954) would provide regulatory coverage incorporating two nonstandard clauses in domestic
bulk petroleum solicitations and contracts concerning small business set-asides and evaluation preference for
SDB concerns into DLAR on a permanent basis. These two DFARS and two DLAR clauses concern preferential consideration
for SDBs under small business set-asides and the ten percent evaluation preference for SDB concerns on unrestricted
procurements. Comments are hereby requested on the proposed DFARS and DLAR coverage, which reduces the SDB preference
from ten to five percent. The proposed coverage is being published in the 

Federal Register

 because it is expected to have an effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DLA, and in some cases, may have
a modest impact on contractors.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


A. Background 



Section 1207 of Public Law 99-661, as amended, sets a goal for the Department of Defense to award five percent
of contract performance dollars to SDB concerns, historically black colleges, and universities, and minority institutions.
To achieve this goal, the law permits the payment of contract prices up to 10 percent above fair market price. The implementing
DFARS coverage includes an across-the-board evaluation factor of 10 percent. Offers from non-SDB concerns on unrestricted
procurements are increased by adding an evaluation factor of ten percent to their offers (evaluation preference).
On partial small business set-asides, the DFARS permits award to SDB concerns at prices up to ten percent above the
highest non-set-aside award price (preferential consideration). Decreasing the percentage from ten to five percent
will save taxpayers at least $3 million a year, while continuing to provide SDB firms an opportunity to participate
in fuel procurements and allowing DLA to continue meeting the 5 percent SDB award goal. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 




This deviation may have a modest impact on a few SDB fuel suppliers. However, the proposed rule is not expected to have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq. 

since the projected SDB award percentages in the two most affected fuels programs should only be decreased by one-tenth
of a percent or less. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are
invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite this case in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed rules do not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements that require the approval of OMB under
44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

. 



List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 219, 252, 5419, and 5452

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR chapter 2 and proposed chapter 54 (as proposed in the

 of April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21954)) be amended as follows:

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 to implement the requirements
for unallowable costs and adds to the list of costs to be clarified in the cost principles. This regulatory action was
not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A. Background



The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act), Pub. L. 103-355, provides the authority to streamline
the acquisition process and minimize burdensome requirements unique to the Federal Government. Major changes that
can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial
Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal
Acquisition Computer Network.

This notice announces FAR revisions developed under FAR case 94-754, based on Section 2101 of the Act that (1)
adds to the list of unallowable costs found at 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1), the costs of lobbying the legislative body of a
political subdivision of a state; (2) adds to the list found at 10 U.S.C. 2324(f)(1) of costs to be clarified in the cost
principles, the cost of ``conventions''; and (3) expands the coverage to the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Section 2151 amends 41 U.S.C. 256 to include all the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2324, as amended
by Section 2101. Therefore, the provisions are made generally applicable to all other executive agencies. The new
FAR language, with only minor variations, was transferred from the current coverage in the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulations (DFARS).

The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94-754) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES


caption, above) on or before January 12, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether
a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

, because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded through sealed bidding on a firm fixed price basis.
The cost principles apply only to contracts which are not firm fixed price. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,


et seq

. (FAR case 94-754), in correspondence.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq

.

[Amended]



2. Section 31.205-1(f)(3) is amended by adding ``conventions,'' after ``meetings,''.

3. Section 31.205-6 is amended in paragraph (g)(2) by adding a sentence at the end of the introductory text and
adding paragraph (g)(3) to read as follows:

(3) Notwithstanding the reference to geographical area in 31.205-6(b)(1), under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(M)
and 41 U.S.C. 256(e)(1)(M), the costs of severance payments to foreign nationals employed under a service contract
or subcontract performed outside the United States are unallowable to the extent that such payments exceed amounts
typically paid to employees providing similar services in the same industry in the United States. Further, under
10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(N) and 41 U.S.C. 256(e)(1)(N), all such costs of severance payments which are otherwise allowable
are unallowable if the termination of employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment
of activities at, a United States facility in that country at the request of the government of that country; this does
not apply if the closing of a facility or curtailment of activities is made pursuant to a status-of-forces or other
country-to-country agreement entered into with the government of that country before November 29, 1989. 10 U.S.C.
2324(e)(3) and 41 U.S.C. 256(e)(2) permit the head of the agency, or designee, to waive these cost allowability limitations
under certain circumstances (see 37.113 and the clause at 52.237-XXX).

to a charge of fraud or similar proceeding (including filing of a false certification).
(4) Payments of fines and penalties resulting from violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, state, local,
or foreign laws and regulations, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific terms and conditions

amount paid in the industry involved under the customary or prevailing practice for firms in that industry providing
similar services in the United States, as determined by regulations in the FAR or in an executive agency supplement
to the FAR.

(14) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to a foreign national employed by the contractor under a service

of that country.

(15) Costs incurred by a contractor in connection with any criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings commenced
by the United States or a State, to the extent provided in 10 U.S.C. 2324(k) or 41 U.S.C. 256(k).

ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA proposes to revise the training and qualification requirements for certain air carriers and commercial operators
by: (1) Requiring certain certificate holders operating under part 135, and permitting certain others, to comply
with part 121 training, checking, and qualification requirements, and (2) mandating Crew Resource Management (CRM)
training requirements for part 121 and certain part 135 operators. The FAA has proposed these rules in order to make
some part 135 training requirements as comprehensive as part 121 requirements and to incorporate recent knowledge
about human performance factors. The proposed rule would also allow certain part 135 certificate holders to take
advantage of sophisticated aircraft simulator training technologies presently available to part 121 certificate
holders. By increasing the training and qualification requirements for certain operators, the proposed rule is
expected to reduce the risk of accidents and incidents. By mandating CRM training for certificate holders required
to comply with part 121 training requirements, the proposed rule is expected to reduce the number of accidents and
incidents that could be attributed to a lack of crew communication and coordination.

Background


Federal Aviation Regulations in parts 121 and 135 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations contain rules which
specify training program requirements for air carriers and certain commercial operators. Those rules specify the
qualification requirements of crewmembers, flight and simulator instructors, check airmen, aircraft dispatchers,
and other operations personnel. The most detailed and rigorous training and qualification requirements are those
contained in subparts N and O of part 121. Although subparts N and O have been amended a number of times in recent years,
most of the amendments concern the use of simulators, training devices, or specific training requirements such as
security and the transportation of hazardous materials. No comprehensive changes have been made to these subparts
since December 1969.
The FAA's most immediate concerns regarding the training and qualification regulations in part 121 and part 135 are
twofold. First, compared to part 121 training regulations, part 135 training regulations do not provide a balanced
mix of training and checking. Second, current parts 121 and 135 training regulations do not incorporate recent knowledge
about the significance of human performance factors (e.g., communication, decision-making, leadership, management)
in safe flight operations.
In December, 1986, in response to a Safety Recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB),
the FAA specifically addressed the human factors training issue by initiating an aviation behavioral technology
program. This ongoing program consists of projects that, among other things, increase the use of line operational
simulations (LOS) to improve cockpit/cabin communication and coordination skills, and pilot decision-making
skills.
In June 1988, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-88-71 concerning CRM training. The NTSB issued
the recommendation as a result of a Northwest Airlines crash on August 16, 1987, in which 148 passengers, 6 crewmembers,
and 2 people on the ground were killed. The NTSB noted that both pilots had received single-crewmember training during
their last simulator training and proficiency checks and the last CRM training they had both received was 3.5 hours
of ground school (general) CRM training in 1983. The NTSB implied that the accident might have been prevented had the
flight crew received adequate CRM training.
After soliciting ideas from other government agencies and from the aviation community, the FAA published a proposed
Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) and accompanying draft advisory circular (AC) in the 

Federal Register 

(54 FR 7670, February 22, 1989). These documents proposed a voluntary, alternative method of complying with the training
requirements in current regulations. The voluntary alternative training is called an ``advanced qualification
program'' (AQP). After considering comments received, the FAA issued a final SFAR 58, Advanced Qualification Program,
and an accompanying advisory circular (55 FR 40262, October 2, 1990). This voluntary program applies to certificate
holders operating under part 121 or part 135 who elect the alternative requirements of AQP which includes CRM training
and evaluation, increased use of LOS, use of training centers, and the evaluation of flight training devices and flight
simulators.
To date, the larger and more sophisticated air carriers have taken advantage of the voluntary program. The FAA expects
this to be the case for the foreseeable future. The FAA recognizes that many operators, particularly smaller operators,
may be unable to take advantage of the voluntary program. Since these operators will elect not to participate in the
voluntary AQP program and will instead comply with current training requirements in parts 121 and 135, the FAA proposes
to amend the current training requirements of parts 121 and 135 to address the most immediate concerns regarding improved
aircrew training and qualification standards. In particular, all certificate holders operating under part 121,
and those certificate holders operating under part 135 who are authorized or required to follow part 121 training
and qualification requirements, would be required to include CRM in their training programs.
Another recommendation from other government agencies and the aviation community was that commuter air carriers
conducting operations under part 135 with airplanes that require two pilot crewmembers should also be required to
comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of part 121. Many regional air carriers operate
under both parts 121 and 135. The Regional Airline Association, on December 10, 1991, petitioned the FAA for an exemption
to allow its members to train, check, and qualify their pilots under part 121 rather than under part 135. The FAA granted
exemption No. 5450 on May 8, 1992, and now over 60% of those certificate holders that operate under both parts 121 and
135 have obtained approval to train, check, and qualify their pilots pursuant to part 121.
The FAA has issued two NPRM's that are relevant to this rulemaking. Notice No. 92-10 (57 FR 35888, August 11, 1992)
relates to the use of training centers by certificate holders who do not elect to come under an AQP. The second NPRM,
Notice No. 93-1 (58 FR 15730, March 23, 1993), is of particular importance to those certificate holders who operate
under part 135 that would be affected by the mandatory requirements of this proposal. If the pilot operating and experience
requirements proposed in Notice No. 93-1 are adopted, the new crew pairing and consolidation of knowledge and
skills requirements would apply to those part 135 operators who are required or who elect to comply with the requirements
of subparts N and O of part 121. Therefore, affected part 135 certificate holders are invited to consider the applicability
of Notice No. 92-10 and Notice No. 93-1 to their operations when commenting on this notice. By this notice,
the FAA is not reopening the comment period for those NPRM's. The FAA could adopt the proposals in those NPRM's and still
consider whether to apply those provisions to part 135 certificate holders in this proposed rulemaking.

The Proposed Rule


General Applicability


The proposed amendments to part 121 would apply to all certificate holders operating under part 121 and to certain
certificate holders operating under part 135 who would be required to comply with the part 121 training qualification
requirements. The proposed requirements would also apply to certain part 135 certificate holders if they apply for
and receive FAA authorization to comply with the part 121 training and qualification requirements.


Commuter Operations Conducted Under Part 135


Part 135 commuter operations serving small and medium sized communities carry millions of passengers every year.
The Regional Airline Association (RAA), whose membership consists primarily of commuter air carriers, estimates
that more than 61 million passengers will be carried by RAA member airlines in 1997. Comprehensive training requirements,
including CRM training, are important to the safety of these operations. Part 121 training would benefit these operations
because it provides more emphasis on training, whereas current part 135 rules rely more heavily on the testing and
checking requirements set forth in subparts G and H of part 135. Part 121 also allows greater use of simulators resulting
in two benefits:
(1) Under  121.407(c), simulator training can be substituted for repetitive proficiency checks ( 121.441)
and certain recency requirements ( 121.439). This allows for greater flexibility and a more effective mix
of training and checking activities.
(2) Simulator training may include hazardous scenarios that would be imprudent to be included in inflight training.
This also increases pilot proficiency.
The proposed amendments to   121.431, 135.3, 135.241, 135.291, and 135.321(a) require the following
certificate holders conducting commuter operations under part 135 to comply with the training, checking, and qualification
requirements of part 121, subparts N and O, in place of the requirements of subparts E, G, and H of part 135: (1) Those
that conduct commuter operations with airplanes for which two pilots are required by aircraft type certification
rules, and (2) those that conduct commuter operations with airplanes having a passenger seating configuration,
excluding any pilot seat, of 10 seats or more.
The term ``commuter operations'' will apply to both intrastate and interstate operations with the frequency of operations
set forth in the definition of ``Commuter Air Carrier'' in SFAR 38-2. Thus, intrastate operations as described
above with a frequency of operations described in SFAR 38-2's definition of ``commuter air carrier'' would
also be subject to the proposals in this NPRM.

<DOCNO> FR941213-1-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed rule also allows the Administrator to authorize any other certificate holders that conduct operations
under part 135 to comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of subparts N and O of part 121.
These operations would include commuter operations using aircraft that do not meet the criteria outlined above and
all unscheduled operations conducted under part 135. However, because of the size and scope of these operations,
the FAA proposes to permit these certificate holders to comply with the operating experience requirements in  135.244
instead of those in  121.434.
Each certificate holder operating under part 135 that would be required under proposed  135.321(b) to comply
with the training and qualification requirements of part 121, subparts N and O, would also be required to submit and
obtain FAA approval of a transition plan converting from part 135 to the part 121 training and checking requirements.
In the proposed plan the certificate holder should address issues such as: (1) whether currently employed crewmembers
need additional training to meet minimum part 121 training and qualification requirements; and (2) whether and how
the certificate holder's training curriculum will be modified to meet part 121 requirements.
Although not part of the transaction plan, the proposed change to  121.405 would also require certain part 135
certificate holders to modify their training program manual contents. Under proposed  121.405(g) a certificate
holder may request a reduction in the programmed hours of ground training from the minimum hours required under present
 121.419. A reduction may be warranted in cases where a certificate holder shows that the airplanes it operates
under part 135 are less complex than those generally operated under part 121.


Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training


A major objective of this proposed rule is to require all certificate holders operating under part 121 and certain
certificate holders operating certain airplanes under part 135 to provide CRM training. Over the last decade, a number
of air carrier incidents and accidents have been attributed, in part, to the lack of CRM skills (e.g., communication,
decision-making, leadership, management). Over the last decade 24 part 121 accidents were reported by the NTSB as
having resulted, in part, from CRM-related causes. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) studies
over the last ten years indicate more than 60% of fatal air carrier accidents were not directly linked to mechanical
failure or lack of pilot skills, but rather to human error. These NASA studies emphasize a training deficiency in areas
related to human performance factors, such as poor group decisionmaking, ineffective communication, inadequate
leadership, and poor task and resource management. The NTSB's study, ``A Review of Flightcrew-involved Major Accidents
of U.S. Air Carriers 1978 through 1990,'' states ``a comprehensive CRM program is one tool an air carrier can use to
improve both decisionmaking and monitoring/challenging by crewmembers.'' Since 1990 the NTSB has issued two safety
recommendations (A-89-124 and A-93-37) that recommend that CRM training be added to crewmember
training programs. For a list of FAA and NASA publications and reports and related research findings and publications,
see AC 120-51A, as amended, ``Crew Resource Management Training.''
In addition, certain events may occur during flight where the activities of flight crewmembers and flight attendants
must be coordinated. One of the prerequisites for crew coordination is effective communication between all crewmembers.
In a 1986 survey of safety representatives and flight attendants, only 37% of the flight attendants and 60% of the pilots
said that they thought communication between the flight crew and cabin crew was adequate.
Similarly, clear communication between aircraft dispatchers and flight crewmembers is essential to flight safety.
Poor communication between dispatchers and the flight crew may jeopardize flight safety.
CRM training teaches crewmembers and aircraft dispatchers to use effectively all resources available to the crew
(e.g. hardware, software, and all persons involved in aircraft operation) to achieve safe and efficient flight operations.
Proposed amendments to   121.404, 121.419(a)(1), 121.421(a)(1), 121.422(a)(1), and 121.427(b)(4)
require that each ground training portion of an approved training program provide approved CRM training to flight
crewmembers, flight attendants, and aircraft dispatchers. If this NPRM becomes a final rule, part 135 certificate
holders who would be required or who successfully obtain FAA authorization to conduct training under part 121 would
also be required to provide CRM training as part of their approved training programs.
The FAA anticipates that for a CRM training program to be approved it would include three distinct components: (1)
An indoctrination/awareness component during which CRM issues are defined and discussed; (2) a recurrent practice
and feedback component during which trainees gain experience with CRM techniques; and (3) a continuing reinforcement
component which ensures that CRM principles are addressed throughout the trainee's employment with the certificate
holder. Advisory Circular (AC) 120-51, as amended, ``Crew Resource Management Training,'' and AC 121-XX,
``Dispatcher Resource Management Training'' provide basic guidance in establishing approved CRM training. (In
this notice, the term ``CRM'' includes both crew resource management and dispatcher resource management.) DOT/FAA/RD-92-26,
``Crew Resource Management: An Introductory Handbook,'' goes into further detail.
Proposed  121.404 includes initial CRM training for persons already employed by the certificate holder, and
for new employees of the certificate holder, unless a new employee has completed the applicable initial CRM training
from another certificate holder. The FAA anticipates that this component will be very similar for all certificate
holders.
CRM initial indoctrination/awareness training is a curriculum segment with a variety of instructional methods,
which can include lectures, discussions, films, practice in an operational setting or a LOS session, and feedback
with a facilitator. CRM initial indoctrination/awareness training must be provided to all crewmembers, including
flight attendants, and to aircraft dispatchers; this training is in addition to existing training. Under proposed
 121.406, the FAA may credit some CRM/DRM training received before the compliance date in the proposed rule.
Some operators have been providing CRM/DRM training under AQP or under voluntary programs. In appropriate circumstances,
the FAA may credit part or all of such training toward the initial ground CRM/DRM training which would be required by
proposed sections 121.419, 121.421, and 121.422.
The recurrent practice and feedback component of CRM training is best accomplished through the use of simulators
and video equipment. However, if the use of simulators is not practical, CRM scenarios can be created without simulators
and practice can be tape recorded to provide feedback. Feedback should be directed by a facilitator who has had appropriate
CRM training. Practice and feedback provide participants with self and peer critiques to improve communication,
decision-making, and leadership skills.

The FAA would approve a recurrent training program under proposed  121.427 that included CRM recurrent practice
and feedback and continuing reinforcement training components, and a refresher curriculum segment in the principles
of CRM. Ideally, for flight crewmembers continuing reinforcement may be accomplished, as authorized in proposed
 121.427(b)(4), during an approved simulator line operational flight training (LOFT) session. This could
include use of special purpose operational training (SPOT) which is a type of line operational simulation (LOS) that
may be used to train coordinated crew performance in specific subjects such as windshear training, use of special
navigation equipment, etc. CRM reinforcement may be incorporated into existing SPOT scenarios. It may also be incorporated
into LOS-like scenarios that do not use simulators. Advisory Circular (AC) 120-35B, Line Operational Simulators:
Line Oriented Flight Training, Special Purpose Operational Training, Line Operational Evaluation, provides suggested
guidelines for the design and implementation of LOS. Recurrent CRM training will be provided to all crewmembers and
aircraft dispatchers. 

The FAA estimates that the proposed CRM training requirement will increase the present minimum programmed hours
of instruction for initial and recurrent training. For initial training for pilots and flight engineers, the FAA
estimates that CRM training will add 12 hours to present requirements. For initial training for flight attendants
and aircraft dispatchers, the increase is estimated to be 8 hours. For recurrent training, the estimated increase
is 4 hours for pilots and flight engineers and 2 hours for flight attendants and aircraft dispatchers. To reflect these
estimated increases in programmed hours of training, changes are proposed to   121.419(b) (1) and (2),
121.421(c) (1) and (2), 1212.422(c) (1) and (2) and 121.427(c). The FAA invites comments on these estimates and, if
adequate justification is received, will consider reducing the increases in minimum required hours in the final
rule. In this regard, the FAA points out that under existing regulations (i.e.,  121.405(d)) individual certificate
holders may be granted reductions in programmed hours when justified under that paragraph. When the Administrator
approves a request to reduce programmed hours of training, a copy of the Administrator's statement is included in
the training program curriculum pursuant to  121.403(b)(6). 



Editorial Change 



A proposed change to  121.135(b)(15) would make it clear that the certificate holder's manual must include
the entire training program curriculum required under  121.403, not just the program affecting airmen. 



Effective Date and Compliance Dates 



The FAA is proposing an effective date of 90 days after these proposals are published as a final rule. By that date certificate
holders operating under part 135 who are required to comply with applicable part 121 training and qualification requirements,
would have to submit the transition plan required under proposed  135.321(b). The proposed compliance date
in  135.10 for training and qualifying under part 121 rules is 1 year after the effective date of the final rule.



For initial CRM training, the FAA proposes a compliance date 2 years after the effective date of the final rule for flight
crewmembers, and 3 years after the effective date of the final rule for flight attendants and aircraft dispatchers.
After the applicable date, a certificate holder would be prohibited from using a crewmember or dispatcher unless
that person has completed approved crew or dispatcher resource management initial training. Since a large number
of certificate holder employees are required to have this training, the delayed compliance date will allow sufficient
time to train instructors conducting CRM training, and then, in turn, provide this training to all crewmembers and
dispatchers. 

The FAA requests comments on the appropriateness of the proposed effective and compliance dates. 



Regulatory Evaluation Summary 



Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this proposed rule would generate benefits that justify its costs and does not meet the criteria
of ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order but is significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures. The proposal would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. And, the proposal would not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses,
available in the docket, are summarized below. 



Costs 



This section discusses costs of the new requirements that this NPRM would impose on parts 121 and 135 operators. The
regulatory evaluation assumes a 7 percent discount rate as mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
The analysis also uses a 6 percent growth rate for commuters and a 4 percent growth rate for air carriers for the next
decade. 

The new hire rate affects the amount of initial training required. This rate varies widely within the industry depending
on economic cycles, birth and death of airline companies, and long-term industry growth. The FAA has developed two
cost estimates. The first uses a 10 percent and the second a 20 percent new hire rate. Costs for a single year refer to
those using a 20 percent new hire rate (the higher of the two costs), while for the total 10 year costs the analysis shows
a range representing the difference between the 10 percent and 20 percent new hire rates. 

Each operator will incur a small administrative effort related to establishing these new requirements within its
existing training program. The FAA estimates that operators on average will incur a one time burden of about 8 hours
of administrative time. This relatively small burden is subsumed in the non-wage training costs. 



Part 121 Training for Part 135 Crews 



The proposed rule would require part 121 training standards for part 135 crewmembers of airplanes either certificated
for two pilots or having 10 or more passenger seats. The amendment exempts currently employed part 135 pilots and flight
attendants from initial and transitional part 121 training. However, it imposes a recurrent training requirement
on currently employed crewmembers to meet part 121 qualifying standards during their first recurrent training.
New crewmembers under part 135 would receive initial part 121 training.

<TEXT>
 

Many commuter airlines already train their cockpit crew at a level comparable to part 121 operators. Primarily, this
group consists of those airlines where the carrier operates aircraft under both parts 121 and 135. The FAA estimates
that the proposed rule would affect 3,400 employees: 1,100 pilots-in-command (PICs), 1,400 second-in-command
officers (SICs), and 900 flight attendants who work for strictly part 135 operators. The hourly wage rate (including
benefits) equals $43 for PICs, $28 for SICs, and $23 for flight attendants who work for the regional airlines. Travel
and per diem expenses equal $250 per round trip and training expense totals $90 a day.

For 1995, initial and transitional training costs for part 135 crewmembers would increase by about $1.9 million;
first year recurrent cost of training (expected to be more extensive than later recurrent training) would increase
by $3.0 million. Recurrent training cost after the first year would increase by $2.1 million. For the period 1994 through
2003, the discounted incremental cost to part 135 operators ranges from $27.1 (10 percent new-hire rate) to $35.7
million (20 percent new-hire rate).



CRM Training



The NPRM would require parts 121 and 135 operators affected by the proposal to train all crewmembers in cockpit resource
management (CRM). Although the proposed rule would provide some flexibility in curricula design, an FAA-approved
CRM training program would include: (1) Awareness of CRM issues where aspects of the problem are discussed; (2) practice
and feedback where crewmembers learn CRM techniques; and (3) reinforcement where CRM principles are strengthened.



Part 121 CRM Training Costs



The FAA estimates that part 121 personnel requiring CRM equals about 32,600 pilots-in-command; 33,900 copilots,
10,000 flight engineers, 84,000 flight attendants; and 1,100 dispatchers. Under the proposed rule, the FAA projects
that PICs, SICs, and flight engineers would receive 12 hours of CRM awareness training and 4 hours annually of CRM refresher
training. Flight attendants and dispatchers would receive 8 hours initial and 2 hours of recurrent training.

For PICs, SICs, and flight engineers, the proposal would require CRM awareness training within two years of the effective
date of the proposed rule; for flight attendants and dispatchers, it would require completion within three years.
All crewmembers would receive recurrent CRM training annually.

The number of pilots undergoing initial training in the two-year phase-in equals the total number of pilots plus new
hires. The hourly wage rate (including benefits) used in this analysis equals $55 for PICs, $38 for SICs, $38 for flight
engineers, $27 for flight attendants, and $18 for dispatchers. The initial training during the first two years would
cost approximately $55 million each year. Initial training would amount to about $10 million annually after the two-year
phase-in period. Recurrent training would total about $32 million annually.

Initial training for flight attendants and dispatchers over the three-year phase-in period would total $17 million.
Initial and recurrent training for flight attendants and dispatchers after the third year would be $4 million and
$17 million, respectively

Over the period 1995 through 2004, the discounted cost for part 121 CRM training ranges from $473 (10 percent new hire
rate) to $569 million (20 percent new hire rate).



Part 135 CRM Training



The FAA estimates that the NPRM would require CRM for 3,360 commuter airline flight crewmembers. CRM awareness training
would cost $300 for 12 hours of PIC and SIC training and $200 for 8 hours of flight attendant training.

As in the case of the part 121 CRM training, the proposed rule would require CRM awareness flight crew training within
two years of the effective date of the rule; for flight attendants, the proposed rule would require completion within
three years. All crewmembers would receive annual recurrent CRM training. The hourly wage rate (including benefits)
used in this analysis equals $43 for PICs, $28 for SICs, and $14 for flight attendants.

Part 135 CRM awareness training for the two-year phase-in period under the NPRM would cost $1.6 million, and after
the second year the training would cost $0.5 million annually. Recurrent CRM commuter pilot instruction would cost
$0.7 million annually.

CRM awareness training for part 135 flight attendants would cost $0.4 million annually for the three-year phase-in
period. The cost would total $64,000 per year, thereafter. Recurrent training would cost approximately $137,000
annually. Over the decade, CRM training would the industry cost would range from $9.5 (10 percent new hire rate) to
$11.8 million (20 percent new hire rate).



Total Costs



The total discounted cost of the proposed rule would range from $510 to $616 million over the next 10 years. The cost
of CRM for part 121 personnel makes up the largest portion of the cost estimate ranges from $473 to $569 million. The
discounted 10-year cost for commuter personnel CRM would vary from $9 to $12 million. The training upgrade for large
commuter aircraft would range from $27 to $36 million.



Benefits



The proposed rule would improve aviation safety by upgrading training standards for pilots flying part 135 aircraft
either certified for two pilots or having 10 or more passenger seats. Also, the NPRM would instruct air carrier (part
121) and commuter (part 135) crews in CRM techniques. This summarizes the analysis of benefits from this training.



Part 135 Pilot Training Upgrade



During 1982 through 1992, pilot error was a probable cause in 39 accidents involving part 135 aircraft of the type affected
by this proposal. These accidents caused 93 fatalities and 55 serious injuries. During this same period, commuter
operators flew 41.15 million flights resulting in a commuter accident rate due to pilot error of .9478 accidents per
million commuter flights.

Projected benefits equal the product of the accident rate times projected flights times the average cost of pilot-error
accidents. For instance, in 1994 the estimated value of benefits equals:




[.9478 ACCIDENTS/MILLION FLIGHTS] x [5.0 MILLION FLIGHTS] x [$7.838 MILLION]=$37.144 MILLION




If the proposed rule could reduce the pilot-error accident rate to zero, the total value over the period 1995 through
2004 would total $418 million. The discounted value of these benefits equals $289 million. However, at most the rule
would reduce the part 135 pilot-error accident rate down to the rate sustained by part 121 operators.

The FAA estimates the pilot-error accident rate for part 121 pilots to equal 0.7 accidents per million flights. Since
the pilot-error accident rate for part 135 operators equals 0.9478 accidents per million, the proportion of available
benefits for part 135 flights equal just over one-fourth accident per million flights [((0.9478^0.7)/0.9478))=0.26].
Also reducing the available benefits, the commuter operators would not complete training for two years. Hence, the
estimated value of the benefits of this proposed rule totals $62 million.



Part 135 Crew Resource Management Training



During the period 1982 through 1992, 13 part 135 accidents resulted from crew coordination problems, resulting in
an accident rate of 0.158 per million flights. These accidents resulted in 85 fatalities, 35 serious injuries, and
43 minor injuries. The average benefit value of avoiding an accident including fatalities, injuries, value of aircraft,
and accident investigation costs equals $19.545 million.

The FAA estimated the value of potential benefits by multiplying the average value of a part 135 CRM-related accident
($19.545 million) by the number of potential accidents (accident rate times projected flights). For 1995, the estimate
equals:




[.158 ACCIDENTS/MILLION FLIGHTS]  x  [5.0 MILLION FLIGHTS]  x  [$19.545 MILLION] = $15.411 MILLION




The discounted benefits over the next decade equal $98 million.



Part 121 Crew Resource Management Training



Between 1982 and 1992, there were 23 part 121 air carrier accidents reported by NTSB that resulted, in part, from CRM-related
causes. These accidents caused 324 fatalities and 91 serious injuries. The part 121 CRM accident rate equals 0.3938
accidents per million flights.

The FAA estimated the value of potential benefits by multiplying the part 121 CRM accident rate by the number of flights
times the average value per accident. The CRM benefits for 1995, for instance, equal:




[.3938 ACCIDENTS/MILLION FLIGHTS]  x  [6.6 MILLION FLIGHTS]  x  [$35.527 MILLION] = $87.139 MILLION




Over the next 10 years, the FAA projects the discounted value of benefits is $619 million. However, about one-third
of part 121 pilots (those not in AQP) will begin training in 1995 and airlines would finish training in late 1996. The
estimated potential benefits for part 121 CRM training equals $581 million.



Benefit-Cost Comparison



Part 135 Training Upgrade



Benefits from upgrading part 135 flight crew training to the part 121 level would result in a reduction in pilot-error
commuter accidents. The FAA estimates that the expected benefits of this provision would total $62 million over the
next decade. This evaluation estimates that the discounted training costs for large part 135 operators would increase
anywhere from $27 to $36 million. Hence, the FAA concludes that the benefits of this provision exceed its costs.



CRM Training for Part 121 Operators



The FAA calculates the discounted benefits from requiring CRM training for part 121 personnel to equal $581 million.
The estimated additional cost to airlines would range from $473 to $569 million over the decade. Hence, the FAA determines
that this proposed provision is cost beneficial.



CRM Training for Part 135 Operators



The FAA estimates the benefits from requiring CRM training for part 135 personnel to equal $98 million over the next
decade. The cost of training would range from an additional $9 to $12 million for part 135 operators. Hence, the FAA
determines that this requirement is cost beneficial.

Each provision of this proposal has potential benefits in excess of expected costs. Hence, the FAA concludes that
the proposal is cost beneficial.

International Trade Impact



The NPRM would have small impact on U.S. air carriers that foreign air carriers would not have to bear. The FAA estimates
a total of 6.2 billion total enplanements with a total of CRM training over the next 10 years of about $581 million. Hence,
the per emplanement cost over the next 10 years for part 121 carriers increases by about $0.09 per enplanement.



Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have
``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''

The proposed rule would affect those small entities regulated by parts 121 and 135. The FAA's criteria for ``a substantial
number'' are a number that is not less than 11 and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the proposed
rule. For air carriers, a small entity has been defined as one who owns, but does not necessarily operate, 9 aircraft
or less. The relevant FAA criteria for ``a significant impact'' is an incremental cost of $61,000 per year for a scheduled
air carrier with a fleet size of 60 seats or fewer, and $110,100 for a scheduled air carrier with aircraft fleet size
of more than 60 seats.

The FAA has identified 35 part 121 operators who operate 9 or fewer aircraft. The FAA assumes that an average crew size
consists of one pilot-in-command, one second-in-command, and three flight attendants. The FAA also assumes that
operators employ two crews per plane.

The FAA estimates that annualized CRM training for each aircraft would amount to $6,120 annually. This estimate includes
initial training and recurrent training averaged over the decade for a crew of two pilots (PIC and SIC) and four flight
attendants. The analysis assumes three crews per aircraft and a 20 percent turnover. Hence, the expected CRM training
cost will not exceed $55,080 (9 times $6,120). This cost falls below the ``significant impact'' threshold cost of
$110,100. Hence, CRM training costs would not impose a significant burden on a substantial number of small part 121
operators.

Seventy-three part 135 scheduled operators affected operate 9 or fewer aircraft. The FAA estimates an annualized
cost of $13,180 for part 135 training upgrade for crewmembers for one aircraft; CRM would carry an annualized cost
of $4,000. The total training costs equal $17,180 ($13,180 + $4,000). This estimate assumes three crews per aircraft
with each crew consisting of a PIC, a SIC, and two flight attendants. This estimate includes initial training and recurrent
training averaged over the decade and a 20 percent markup for turnover. Training costs for small entities with 4 to
9 aircraft would exceed the threshold (4  x  $17,180 = 68,720). However, FAA data shows 16 scheduled part 135 operators
of the type affected by this NPRM that operate between 4 and 9 aircraft. Since the number of companies represents about
22 percent of the 73 operators affected by this proposed rule, the FAA concludes that the proposed rule would not have
a significant economic impact on a significant number of small part 135 scheduled operators.



Federalism Implications



The proposed regulations do not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.
Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have federalism implications
warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
