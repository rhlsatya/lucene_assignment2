ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that three environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance or renewal of permits to allow the field
testing of genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion
that the field testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating
a plant pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of
no significant impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact
statements need not be prepared.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 



In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assesses the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 

Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
or renewal of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms: 






The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public of our determination that a genetically engineered, virus resistant yellow crookneck
squash line designated ZW-20 squash is no longer considered a regulated article under our regulations governing
the introduction of certain genetically engineered organisms. Our determination is based on our evaluation of data
submitted by the Upjohn Company in its petition for a determination of the regulatory status of ZW-20 squash,
an analysis of other scientific data, and our review of comments received from the public regarding the Upjohn petition.
This notice also announces the availability of the written determination document and its associated environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On July 13, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) received a petition from the Upjohn Company
(Upjohn) and its subsidiary, Asgrow Seed Company, of Kalamazoo, MI, seeking a determination that the ZW-20
virus resistant squash line no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340.


On September 4, 1992, APHIS announced the receipt of the Upjohn petition in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 40632-40633, Docket No. 92-127-1) and announced its intent to issue an interpretive ruling
that the ZW-20 virus resistant squash does not present a plant pest risk and, therefore, would no longer be considered
a regulated article. That notice also requested comments on APHIS' proposed interpretive ruling. After considering
the 17 comments submitted during the 45-day comment period, of which 7 were in support of the petition and 10 in opposition,
APHIS determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period to seek additional comment on several
scientific and technical issues raised by the commenters. The commenters expressed concerns in three major areas:
(1) Will the introduction of the two viral coat protein genes increase the likelihood of the creation of new plant viruses;
(2) could the introduction of two virus resistance genes cause squash to become a weed; and (3) would the virus resistance
genes move to wild squash relatives and would this have a detrimental impact on these wild plants? A notice was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92-127-2), to reopen the comment period for an additional 60 days.
Twelve comments were received, of which 10 were in support and 2 were in opposition. The same major areas of concern
expressed during the first comment period were again reflected in the two comments in opposition to the petition,
with the addition of a statement that an environmental impact statement should be prepared in connection with commercial
scale growth of the ZW-20 squash. 

Since the date of the original submission of Upjohn's petition, APHIS has formalized, under a ``Petition for Determination
of Nonregulated Status'' (

See

 58 FR 17044-17059, Docket No. 92-156-2), the interpretive ruling procedure that was in place when
the original petition for the ZW-20 squash was submitted. 

On May 23, 1994, APHIS published a third notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 26619-26620, Docket No. 92-127-3) to announce the availability of an environmental assessment
(EA) and preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI) related to the proposed determination of nonregulated
status for the ZW-20 squash, a public meeting in Washington, DC, on July 21, 1994, and a 45-day comment period
ending July 7, 1994. The notice included the text of the preliminary FONSI that had been prepared by APHIS.

At the public meeting on June 21, 1994, two speakers presented comments. One commenter supported the EA and preliminary
FONSI; the other did not support the EA and preliminary FONSI. Both speakers also submitted written comments. During
the 45-day comment period, APHIS received an additional 52 written comments from private individuals, universities,
agricultural experiment stations, the cooperative extension service, public interest groups, industry, a trade
association, and a Federal research laboratory. Twenty-three comments supported APHIS' findings in the EA and preliminary
FONSI. Twenty-nine comments disagreed with APHIS' proposal to approve the Upjohn petition, while 23 were in favor
of approval. The commenters in opposition to the petition again stressed concerns about the ecological safety of
commercial scale growth of the ZW-20 squash, citing such risks as gene glow to wild squash, potential impacts
on squash centers of diversity, the potential for increased weediness in wild squash, and the risk of creating new
viruses. APHIS has prepared a detailed technical analysis of, and response to, those comments in the determination
document, which is available upon request from the individual listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 



Analysis 



The crookneck squash (

Cucurbita pepo

 L. cultivar YC77E ZW-20) (ZW-20) developed by Upjohn resists infection by two plant viruses, zucchini
yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) and watermelon mosaic virus, type II (WMV2). ZW-20 squash was developed by engineering
two plant virus genes, the coat protein (CP) genes of ZYMV and WMV2, into a line of yellow crookneck squash. In addition,
the vector system used to transfer the viral CP genes into the recipient squash was derived from the bacterial plant
pathogen 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens

. Certain noncoding regulatory sequences were derived from plant pathogens, i.e. from 

A. tumefaciens

 and from cauliflower mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus. 

The ZW-20 squash has been considered a regulated article under the APHIS regulations in 7 CFR part 340 in part
because of the use of CP genes, in part because of the derivation of the vector system, and in part because of use of noncoding
regulatory sequences from plant pathogens. Field testing of the ZW-20 squash has been conducted since 1990
at approximately 46 field sites in 10 States under 14 permits issued by APHIS. All field trials have been performed
under conditions of reproductive confinement. Field data reports indicate no deleterious effects on plants, nontarget
organisms, or the environment from these field tests. 



Determination 



Based on an analysis of the information and data submitted by Upjohn, a review of scientific literature, and comments
received from the public, APHIS has concluded that the ZW-20 squash is as safe to grow as traditionally bred virus
resistant squash. The available evidence indicates that ZW-20 squash: (1) Exhibits no plant pathogenic properties;
(2) is no more likely to become a weed than a virus resistant squash plant developed by traditional breeding techniques;
(3) is unlikely to increase the weediness potential for any other cultivated plant or native wild species with which
it can interbreed; (4) should not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; (5) should not increase the
likelihood of the emergence of new plant viruses; and (6) is unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees, which are
beneficial to agriculture. The basic findings of the preliminary FONSI are therefore adopted in support of the determination
that Upjohn's ZW-20 squash does not present a plant pest risk and therefore will no longer be considered a regulated
article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340. The effect of this determination is that the permit requirements
of 7 CFR part 340 will no longer apply to the field testing, importation, or interstate movement of ZW-20 squash
or its progeny. Importation of ZW-20 squash and nursery stock or seeds capable of propagation is still, however,
subject to any restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notice regulations at 7 CFR part 319. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The EA has been prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321


et seq.

); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). Based on that EA, APHIS
reached a FONSI with regard to its determination that the virus resistant squash line designated as ZW-20 and
its progeny are no longer regulated articles under its regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Copies of the EA and FONSI are available
upon request from the individual listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

<DOCTITLE>Thunderbolt Wildfire Recovery, Boise and Payette National Forests, Idaho</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Thunderbolt Wildfire burned a total of 27,000 acres of Boise and Payette National Forest system lands in the fall
of 1994. The Forests intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Thunderbolt wildfire area to assess
and disclose the environmental effects of opportunities designed to improve long-term fish habitat, rehabilitate
existing sediment sources, improve hydrologic conditions of affected watersheds, and protect long-term soil productivity.
These objectives would be accomplished through road surfacing, revegetation of road cut and fill slopes, and drainage
improvements on existing roads; planting of conifers and shrubs; and salvaging dead and dying trees as a means to finance
the preceding opportunities. Timber harvest would be done by helicopter, and designed to result in minimal ground
disturbance and risk of erosion and no sediment delivery to streams.



All proposals within the Thunderbolt Wildfire Recovery Area would protect visual resources on river segments eligible
for classification under the Wild and Scenic rivers Act, provide for wildlife habitat, and improve fisheries habitat.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the fall of 1994, the Chicken, Thunderbolt, and portions of the Corral and Blackwell wildfires burned in excess
of 150,000 acres in the South Fork Salmon River drainage of the Payette and Boise National Forests in central Idaho.
A broadscale analysis team and several landscape analysis teams are using an ecosystem based approach to assess the
fires' effects and identify management opportunities that could be implemented to move the postfire landscapes
toward a desired ecological condition. The Payette National Forest is currently assessing the impacts and potential
opportunities associated with the Corral, Blackwell and Chicken wildfires which may result in separate Notices
of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.



The primary management emphasis in the South Fork Salmon River drainage is restoration of harvestable, robust, self-sustaining
populations of naturally reproducing salmon and trout. The South Fork Salmon River was historically the single largest
producer of summer chinook salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Since the 1950's this run has declined significantly,
partially due to habitat degradation caused by management-induced sediment. The species is currently listed as
endangered. Prime spawning habitat occurs within and/or adjacent to the Thunderbolt wildfire landscape. Numerous
road-related sediment sources continue to deliver sediment to streams. Annual sediment delivery is expected to
increase as a result of the fires.

Burn intensities in the Thunderbolt wildfire area varied considerably. Within the fire perimeter, approximately
6,000 acres burned at high intensity, 9,000 acres at moderate intensity, and 4,000 acres at low intensity. Approximately
8,000 acres inside the fire perimeter did not burn.

There are an estimated 18,000 acres burned within Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs). The IRAs affected are Caton
Lake and Meadow Creek.

The fire burned adjacent to or within the river corridors of Johnson Creek (eligible for Recreation classification)
and South Fork Salmon River, which are both pending Wild and Scenic River study.



Proposed Action



The objective for the Proposed Action is to improve long-term fish habitat, rehabilitate existing sediment sources,
improve hydrologic conditions of affected watersheds, protect long-term soil productivity, promote regeneration
of trees on burned acres, and recover the economic value of fire-killed and imminently dead trees as a means of financing
activities related to the preceding objectives.

The Proposed Action includes the following components:

Activities designed to rehabilitate existing sediment sources.

Johnson Creek Road (

#

413)_Surface (gravel) 5 miles, surface (asphalt) at several stream crossings, armor ditchlines, install culverts,
revegetate cut and fill slopes, construct fill structures.

Cabin Creek Road (

#

467)_Install gates and restrict wet-season traffic, construct waterbars, install culverts.

Roaring Creek Road (

#

474E)_Surface (gravel) 1 mile, construct waterbars, revegetate cut and fill slopes.

Penny Springs Road (

#

401)_Install gate and restrict wet-season traffic, revegetate cut and fill slopes, improve drainage, surface (gravel)
at several stream crossings, and obliterate 0.6 miles.

Ditch Creek Road (

#

410)_Relocate gate and seasonally restrict traffic for wildlife purposes, improve drainage, and revegetate cut
and fill slopes.

Plant conifers and shrub species on about 4,000 acres of moderate and high intensity burn areas where natural regeneration
is not expected within the next five to ten years.

Harvest economically feasible fire-killed timber and imminently dead trees from areas outside of the Riparian Habitat
Conservation Areas (draft PACFISH criteria) and the Wild and Scenic eligible corridor of the South Fork Salmon River.
Large snags would be retained in varying amounts thoughout the harvest areas for dependent wildlife, long-term soil
productivity, large woody debris recruitment, shade to assist tree regeneration, and aesthetics. To protect watersheds
and fish habitat, helicopter yarding systems are proposed for use in the salvage effort of 3,500 acres. Four helicopter
landings would need to be constructed to supplement the existing roads and landings needed to facilitate harvest
activities. No new road construction is proposed. Additional road reconstruction may be identified during analysis
as necessary to improve watersheds or fish habitat.

Salvage harvest would occur in the Caton Lake and Meadow Creek IRAs.

Visual quality objectives would be met on trails, the South Fork Salmon River and Johnson Creek roads, and the Wild
and Scenic River eligible Johnson Creek and South Fork Salmon River corridors.

Cultural resource sites, riparian areas, and sensitive fish, plant, and animal habitats would be protected.

Protection measures for streams would be based on the science utilized to develop the interim direction contained
in the draft PACFISH EA. The direction issued with the final PACFISH EA and Decision Notice would be incorporated as
necessary.

Methodologies, rationale and findings associated with the landscape analysis and site specific environmental
analysis would be reviewed by a proposed panel of experts elected from Forest Service research and system branches,
and other federal agencies. Recommendations made by this panel could be used by line officers in directing the environmental
analysis, formulating alternatives, disclosing environmental consequences, developing a monitoring plan and
making the final decision. This may include the option of not moving ahead with any or part of the action alternatives
if conclusive information shows that the action would be damaging to anadromous fish.



Forest Plan Amendment



The Boise and Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plans have specific management direction for
the South Fork Salmon River Area. The overall goal is to restore harvestable, robust, self-sustaining populations
of naturally reproducing salmon and trout. The Thunderbolt Wildfire Recovery Proposed Action is designed to improve
fish habitat and is consistent with the objectives and goals of both Forest Plans. Prior to making a NEPA decision,
a thorough examination of all standards and guidelines of both Forest plans would be completed and if necessary, plan
amendments would be addressed in the EIS.



Preliminary Issues



Anticipated concerns with the Proposed Action are; (1) Ground disturbing activities may increase sediment delivery
to streams and degrade fish habitat, and (2) salvage harvesting in IRAs and the potential effect it may have on the wilderness
attributes of the area.



Possible Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Two alternatives to the Proposed Action have been identified. A No Action alternative, and an alternative that would
exclude salvage harvesting in the IRAs. Other alternatives may be developed as issues are raised and information
is received.



Decisions To Be Made



The Boise and Payette National Forest Supervisors will decide the following:

What amount, type, and distribution of sediment reduction projects and riparian habitat conservation measures
would be implemented,

If Forest Plan amendments are necessary to proceed with the proposed actions within the Thunderbolt Wildfire Recovery
project area,

Should dead and imminently dead trees within fire areas, not needed to maintain ecological functions, be harvested
and if so how, and 

What burned areas need to be planted.



Public Involvement Meetings



Scoping meetings will be held in McCall (Smokejumper Loft, Dec. 12, 1994, 7:00 PM), Boise (Red Lion Inn, Downtowner,
Dec. 13, 1994, 7:00 PM), and Cascade (Ranger District Office, Dec. 14, 1994, 7:00 PM). Additional presentations will
be made upon request.



Agency/Public Contacts



A summary of the Proposed Action and methodologies to be used in the analysis, will be mailed in early December to key
individuals, groups and agencies for comments and issue identification. This mailing list will include about 350
people who are generally interested in the Boise and Payette National Forests' NEPA projects, and people who were
interested in the Boise National Forest's Foothills Wildfire Timber Recovery Project in 1992.



Schedule



Draft Environmental Impact Statement, February, 1995. Final EIS, April, 1995. Implementation, July, 1995.

Past experience with wildfire timber recovery efforts on the Boise and Payette National Forests have proven that
prompt action is required to recover the economic value of fire-killed trees. The trees, mostly Douglas-fir, subalpine
fir, and lodgepole pine, are expected to lose more than half of their economic value by the fall of 1995. Recovered timber
values would be used to finance beneficial watershed improvement projects designed to improve fish habitat.



Comments



Comments concerning the proposed project and analysis should be received in writing on or before January 13, 1994.
Mail comments to Cindy Tencick, Cascade Ranger District, Boise National Forest, PO Box 696, Cascade, ID 83611; Telephone,
(208) 382-7400. Further information can be obtained at the same location.

The comment period on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency publishes the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register.

 

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of Draft Environmental Impact
Statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC. 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978), Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed
by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1002 (9th Cir,. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages. Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed Action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the Proposed Action, comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Separate Rates 


All five respondents have requested separate antidumping duty rates. In cases involving non-market economies,
the Department's policy is to assign a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both 

de jure

 and 

de facto

 governmental control over export activities. In determining whether companies should receive separate rates,
we focus our attention on the exporter rather than the manufacturer, as our concern is manipulation of export prices,
and we examine PRC government control of the exporter. In this case, two of the five respondents are Hong Kong exporters
that are involved in joint ventures in the PRC that manufacture lighters. Since PolyCity and Cli-Claque are located
outside the PRC, the PRC government does not have jurisdiction over them. Moreover, the PRC government does not have
any ownership interest in these exporters and, therefore, it cannot exercise control through ownership of these
companies. Further, we have no evidence on the record indicating that the PRC government exerts control over these
exporters. (See, business proprietary memorandum to the file dated December 5, 1994.) On this basis, we preliminarily
determine that there is no need to apply our separate rates analysis and that PolyCity and Cli-Claque are entitled
to individual rates. 
In contrast to PolyCity and Cli-Claque, Gao Yao is a 50/50 joint venture between a Chinese company and Hong Kong company.
The joint venture owns both the production and export facilities used to manufacture and export the lighters it sells
to the United States. Given the direct PRC ownership in Gao Yao's export facilities, we have preliminarily determined
that it is appropriate to apply our separate rates analysis to this company. 




COTCO's and GLIP's business licenses indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the PRC (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (``Silicon Carbide''), ``ownership
of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these companies are
eligible for consideration for a separate rate under our criteria. 
To establish whether a firm is entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each exporting entity under a test
arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the PRC (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991)
(``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate
rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence of both 

de jure

 and 

de facto

 governmental control over export activities. 


1. Absence of De Jure Control 


The respondents submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of 

de jure 

control, including two PRC laws indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises owned by ``all the people''
is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China
on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law''); and the ``Regulations
for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992
(``1992 Regulations''). Respondents' submission also included the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration
of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions''). 
The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law
provides that enterprises owned by ``all the people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible
for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988 Law
contains other provisions which indicate that enterprises have management independence from the government. The
1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their
own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits
(Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions
(Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire employees without government approval
(Article XVII). 
The Export Provisions indicate those products subject to direct government control. Lighters do not appear on the
Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to export constraints. 
Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determine that the existence of these laws demonstrates that COTCO, GLIP, and
Gao Yao are not subject to 

de jure

 central government control with respect to export sales and pricing decisions. However, there is some evidence that
the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors
and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information
Service-China-93-133 (July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that a 

de facto

 analysis is critical to determine whether COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP are subject to governmental control over export
sales and pricing decisions.

2. Absence of De Facto Control 



The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether a respondent is subject to 

de facto

 government control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by, or subject to the approval of,
a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements;
(3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management;
and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding
disposition of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide). 

In response to our questionnaire, COTCO, GLIP, and Gao Yao have each asserted that they: 

 Are able to borrow at market rates from commercial banks; 

 Maintain their own bank accounts, including foreign exchange earnings; 

 Are not restricted in their access to their bank accounts; 

 Operate at a profit; 

 Make independent business decisions, including what to export; 

 Set their own prices independently and that the prices are not subject to review by trading companies or government
authorities; 

 Base their relationships with suppliers and customers on arm's length negotiations without governmental
interference; 

 Are not subject to foreign exchange targets set by either the central or provincial governments; 

 Have the ability to sell, transfer, or acquire assets; Exporter-Specific Information: 

The following is a summary of additional information provided by the exporters: 

Gao Yao has stated that: 

 It is a Sino-Hong Kong 50-50 joint venture; 

 It has no legal relationship with either the local, regional and/or national government; 

 It maintains a bank account in Hong Kong where all monies received from Gao Yao's foreign sales are deposited
and that the allocation of foreign currency is not subject to governmental review or approval; 

 Chinese joint venture and other laws confirm Gao Yao's independence (Gao Yao submitted an exhibit consisting
of laws pertaining to Sino-Foreign joint ventures in its response); 

 Management is selected by the board of directors, without any governmental interference; 

 Profits are divided evenly between the joint venture partners according to the shares invested; 

 The managing director of Gao Yao is a Hong Kong resident; and 

 All contracts are negotiated and signed by the officials of Gao Yao's Hong Kong sales office. 

GLIP has stated that: 

 Management is selected by its board of directors; 

 Current ownership of the company is by ``all the people.'' The company received authorization to privatize
on March 5, 1993, and ``is in the process of totally privatizing;'' and 

 It is independently managed and operated (a statement to this effect from CCCME was included in the response
as an exhibit). 

COTCO has stated that: 

 It is a limited liability company, owned by COTCO Beijing, which, in turn, is an ``all the people'' company;


 It is independently managed and operated (a statement to this effect from CCCME was included in the response
as an exhibit); 

 Its manager is hired following a public notice of vacancy, screening, and hiring negotiations; the manager
then selects the company's management committee; the decisions regarding the selection and promotion of management
are not subject to any entity's review or approval. 

The information submitted on behalf of each of the three companies supports a preliminary finding that there is a 

de facto 

absence of governmental control of export functions of each of the three companies. 

Consequently, COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of separate rates.
We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses are supported
by verifiable documentation.

Surrogate Country 




Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent
possible, in one or more market economies that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME
country and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that Indonesia
is the most suitable surrogate for purposes of this investigation. Based on available statistical information,
Indonesia is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC, and Indonesian export statistics indicate
that the country is a significant producer of lighters. Based on available information, Indonesia is the only surrogate
country, of those identified by our Office of Policy, that meet both of these criteria. (See, memorandum to the file
from Todd Hansen to Carole Showers, dated December 5, 1994, Surrogate Country Selection and memorandum from David
Mueller, Director, Office of Policy to Susan Kuhbach, Director, Office of Countervailing Investigations, dated
September 8, 1994, Lighters from the People's Republic of China, Non-Market Economy Status and Surrogate Country
Selection.) 



Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether sales of lighters from the PRC by COTCO, Gao Yao, GLIP, PolyCity and Cli-Claque were made at less
than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of the notice. 



United States Price

<DOCNO> FR941213-2-00012 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

For all respondents, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because lighters
were sold directly to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States, and because
exporter's sales price (``ESP'') methodology was not indicated by other circumstances. 
We calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States,
and packed, CIF prices, where appropriate. We made deductions for foreign inland freight, containerization, loading,
port handling expenses, and marine insurance, as indicated. Generally, costs for these items were valued in the surrogate
country. However, where inland freight was purchased from market economy suppliers and paid for in a market economy
currency, we used the cost actually incurred by the exporter. 


Foreign Market Value 


In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories
in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the five responding exporters. The factors used to produce lighters
include materials, labor and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported factor quantities were multiplied by the appropriate
surrogate values from Indonesia for those inputs purchased domestically from PRC suppliers. Where inputs were imported
from market economy countries and paid for in a market economy currency, we used the actual costs incurred by the producers
to value those factors (see, 

e.g., 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China,
56 FR 55271, October 25, 1991). Where a respondent failed to provide certain factor information in a usable form, we
have used publicly available information from the petition and other respondents as best information available
in valuing these factors. 
Cli-Claque has argued that since it purchases certain input parts produced in the PRC from a Hong Kong reseller, the
Department should accept these prices as market-determined and use them when calculating FMV. We disagree with this
argument and have not used the prices for these inputs in calculating FMV. For purposes of valuing factors of production,
it is the Department's practice not to use prices from one PRC producer to an unrelated PRC producer because those prices
are distorted. In the present case, the two Hong Kong companies negotiated prices for inputs produced in the PRC on
behalf of their related production facilities located in the PRC. Therefore, we have determined that these input
prices should not be used to value the factors of production in this case. We have only used prices for imported inputs
which were produced in market-based economies to value those factors. 
In determining which surrogate value to use for each factor of production which was not sourced from a market-economy
country, we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information (``PAPI'') which was: (1)
an average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party,
or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive. 
With the exception of butane, we used the Indonesian import price taken from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical
Bulletin_Imports, November 1993. For butane, however, the amount imported into Indonesia was negligible compared
to the amount exported from that country. Therefore, for those PRC producers that did not import butane from market
economy sources, we relied on Indonesian export statistics, as reported in the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical
Bulletin_Exports, November 1993. 
We used Indonesian transportation rates taken from a September 18, 1991, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S.
Embassy in Indonesia to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the disposable lighter
factories. 
To value electricity, we used public information from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region
(January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. To value labor amounts, we used labor rates published by the
Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor, in Foreign Labor Trends-Indonesia. 
We adjusted the factor values, when necessary, to the POI using wholesale price indices (``WPIs'') published by the
International Monetary Fund (``IMF''). 
To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on a December 2, 1994 U.S. State Department cable from
the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta giving elements of industry group income statements. 
For general expense percentages, we used the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials, labor, and overhead costs
calculated for each factory. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory
overhead, and general expenses. We did not have Indonesian values for either general expenses or profit. 
We added packing based on Indonesian values obtained from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports,
November 1993. 
Cli-Claque argues that since it makes all of its sales/exports from Hong Kong, has all of its management, administrative
and selling operations in Hong Kong, and is wholly-owned and operated as a market-economy producer, we should treat
Cli-Claque as a market-economy producer and base FMV on Hong Kong home market prices. Failing this, Cli-Claque maintains
that since the PRC production facility does not know Cli-Claque's customers or the ultimate destination of the merchandise
and since the products enter the commerce of Hong Kong, we should, at a minimum, consider Cli-Claque as a third country
reseller and consider Hong Kong a viable home market on which to base FMV. 
We disagree with Cli-Claque on both accounts. First, its related production facility is located in a non-market economy
country and, therefore, the FMV of the subject merchandise must be determined using the factors of production methodology.
Second, given the relationship between Cli-Claque and the PRC production facility, we do not consider that there
is a ``purchase'' from the PRC production facility by Cli-Claque within the meaning of section 773(f) of the Act. Therefore,
Cli-Claque is not considered a ``reseller'' within the meaning of that provision.

Best Information Available 


Potential exporters identified by MOFTEC failed to respond to our questionnaire. In the absence of responses from
these and other PRC exporters during the POI, we are basing the PRC country-wide rate on best information available
(BIA). When a company refuses to provide information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly
impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to the company the higher
of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation
(see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain
Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Belgium, 58 FR 37083,
July 9, 1993) (``Belgium Steel''). Since some PRC exporters failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning
to all other PRC exporters the highest margin in the May 27, 1994, amendment to the petition. 


Critical Circumstances 


On November 23, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of disposable
pocket lighters from the PRC. We did not receive the allegation in time to make a critical circumstance determination
in this preliminary determination. However, we will make a preliminary determination with respect to critical circumstances
no later than December 23, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(b)(2)(ii). 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify information used in making our final determination. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


For Gao Yao, we calculated a zero margin. Consistent with Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:
Certain Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 55625, November 8, 1994), merchandise that is sold
by Gao Yao but manufactured by other producers will not receive the zero margin. Instead, such entries will be subject
to the ``All Others'' margin. 
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this
notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated dumping margins, as shown
below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping
margins are as follows: 







ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry within 75 days after our final determination. 


Public Comment 


Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice.
Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number; 
(2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed. 
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary no later than January 20, 1995, and rebuttal briefs no later than January 27, 1995. A hearing,
if requested, will be held on Friday, February 3, 1995, at 10:00 am at the U.S. Department of Commerce in Room 1412. Parties
should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours prior to the scheduled time. In accordance
with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs. 
We will make our final determination not later than 75 days after of this preliminary determination. 
This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) 
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

<DOCTITLE>Export Trade Certificate of Review</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration, Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of initiation of process of revoke export trade certificate of review No. 92-00008. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Commerce issued an export trade certificate of review to International EXIM Corporation. Because
this certificate holder has failed to file an annual report as required by law, the Department is initiating proceedings
to revoke the certificate. This notice summarizes the notification letter sent to International EXIM Corporation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (``the Act'') [15 U.S.C. 4011-21] authorized the Secretary
of Commerce to issue export trade certificates of review. The regulations implementing Title III [''the Regulations'']
are found at 15 CFR part 325. Pursuant to this authority, a certificate of review was issued on September 8, 1992 to International
EXIM Corporation. 


A certificate holder is required by law (Section 308 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 4018) to submit to the Department of Commerce
annual reports that update financial and other information relating to business activities covered by its certificate.
The annual report is due within 45 days after the anniversary date of the issuance of the certificate of review [Sections
325.14(a) and (b) of the Regulations]. Failure to submit a complete annual report may be the basis for revocation [Sections
325.10(a) and 325.14(c) of the Regulations]. 
The Department of Commerce sent to International EXIM Corporation on August 29, 1994, a letter containing annual
report questions with a reminder that its annual report was due on October 23, 1994. Additional reminders were sent
on October 24, 1994, and on November 16, 1994. The Department has received no written response to any of these letters.

On December 7, 1994, and in accordance with  325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations, a letter was sent by certified
mail to notify International EXIM Corporation that the Department was formally initiating the process to revoke
its certificate. The letter stated that this action is being taken for the certificate holder's failure to file an
annual report. 
In accordance with  325.10(c)(2) of the Regulations, each certificate holder has thirty days from the day after
its receipt of the notification letter in which to respond. The certificate holder is deemed to have received this
letter as of the date on which this notice is published in the 

Federal Register

. For good cause shown, the Department of Commerce can, at its discretion, grant a thirty-day extension for a response.

If the certificate holder decides to respond, it must specifically address the Department's statement in the notification
letter that it has failed to file an annual report. It should state in detail why the facts, conduct, or circumstances
described in the notification letter are not true, or if they are, why they do not warrant revoking the certificate.
If the certificate holder does not respond within the specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements
contained in the notification letter (Section 325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations). 
If the answer demonstrates that material facts are in dispute, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice
shall, upon request, meet informally with the certificate holder. Either Department may require the certificate
holder to provide the documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions (Section 325.10(c)[3]
of the Regulations). 
The Department shall publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of the revocation or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify (Section 325.10(c)[4] of the Regulations).
If there is a determination to revoke a certificate, any person aggrieved by such final decision may appeal to an appropriate
U.S. district court within 30 days from the date on which the Department's final determination is published in the


Federal Register

 (Sections 325.10(c)(4) and 325.11 of the Regulations).

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Certificate of Interim Extension of the Term of U.S. Patent No. 4,062,848; Remeron</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Interim Patent Term Extension.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office has issued a certificate under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) for a one-year interim extension
of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,062,848 that claims the human drug product known as Remeron.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 156 of Title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.



On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103-179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.

On November 25, 1994, the patent owner Akzona Incorporated filed an application under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) for interim
extension of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,062,848. The application states that the patent claims the active ingredient
mirtapazine in the human drug product Remeron. The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing
a regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market or use the product commercially.
The original term of the patent is set to expire on December 13, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the
term of the patent for a period of one year.

Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156. Since it is apparent that the regulatory
review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the patent term
under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) of the term
of U.S. Patent No. 4,062,848 has been granted for a period of one year from the original expiration date of the patent.

Privacy Act of 1974; Computer Matching Program Between the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Defense


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Manpower Data Center, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a new computer matching program between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Defense
(DoD) for public comment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act, is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects
of a computer matching program between OPM and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The objective
is to identify individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay and (1) credit for military service
in their civil service annuities, or (2) annuities based on the `guaranteed minimum' disability formula. This match
will identify and/or prevent erroneous payments under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA), the Federal Employees'
Retirement System Act (FERSA), and the Joint Uniform Military Retired Pay System. This agreement replaces all existing
data exchange agreements that pertain to the disclosure of beneficiary payment data between DMDC and OPM.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the OPM and DoD has concluded an agreement
to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal data
between the agencies for identification of individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay. The match
will yield the identity and location of those individuals within the Federal government so that OPM can make more timely
and accurate adjustments in benefits, and prevent or correct overpayments, fraud and abuse, thus assuring proper
benefit payments. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.


A copy of the computer matching agreement between OPM and DoD is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Quality Assurance Division, Retirement and Insurance Group, 1900
E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415.
Set forth below is the notice of the establishment of a computer matching program required by paragraph 6.c. of the
Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on computer matching published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 37906 on July 25, 1994.

Computer Matching Program Between the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Defense for Retired Military
Pay 





A.

Participating agencies: 

Participants in this computer matching program are the Quality Assurance Division, Retirement and Insurance Group,
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) of the Department of Defense (DoD).
The OPM is the source agency, i.e., the agency disclosing the records for the purpose of the match. The DMDC is the specific
recipient agency or matching agency, i.e., the agency that actually performs the computer matching.




B.

Purpose of the match: 

The purpose of the match is to identify and locate individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay and
(1) credit for military service in their civil service annuities, or (2) annuities based on the `guaranteed minimum'
disability formula. This match will identify and/or prevent erroneous payments under the Civil Service Retirement
Act (CSRA), the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (FERSA), and the Joint Uniform Military Retired Pay System.




C.

Authority for conducting the match: 

The legal authority for conducting the matching program is contained in Title 5 U.S.C. 8331 (CSRA) and Title 5 U.S.C.
8401 (FERSA), et. seq. Title 5 U.S.C. 8332 is the legal authority for CSRA and Title 5 U.S.C. 8411 is the legal authority
for FERSA for determining creditability of military service for civil service retirement purposes. DoD's legal
authority for monitoring retired pay is Title 10 U.S.C. 1401.




D.

Records to be matched: 

The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows:
1. OPM will use the record system identified as OPM/CENTRAL-1, Civil Service Retirement and Insurance Records,

last published at 58 FR 19170, April 12, 1993, and revised at 58 FR 41300, August 3, 1993.
2. DoD will use the record system identified as S322.10 DMDC, Defense Manpower Data Center Data Base, 59 FR 55462, November
7, 1994.
The categories of records in the OPM and DoD records are personnel employment records. The categories of individuals
in the OPM system consists of active, separated and retired civilian employees. The DMDC database, established under
an interagency agreement between DoD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records
of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Both record systems involved contain an appropriate
routine use disclosure provision required by the Privacy Act permitting the interchange of the affected personal
information between OPM and DoD. These routine uses are compatible with the purpose for collecting the information
and establishing and maintaining the record systems.




E.

Description of computer matching program: 

The tape extract provided by OPM, the source agency, will contain the names, addresses, social security numbers,
dates of birth, retirement claim numbers, provision retired codes and payment and service data of individuals currently
receiving benefits from OPM. DoD, the matching agency, data will contain names, social security numbers, branches
of service and dates of retirement.
The OPM file will contain the information for approximately 1.5 million CSRA and FERSA retirees. DoD retired files
contain approximately 1.6 million records.




F.

Inclusive dates of the matching program: 

This computer matching program is subject to a 40-day review period by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress.
If no objections are raised by either, and the mandatory 30 day public notice period for comment has expired for this


Federal Register

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated on an annual basis, unless OMB or the Treasury
Department request a match twice a year. Under no circumstances shall the matching program be implemented before
this 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period cannot be waived. By agreement between
OPM and DoD, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months with an option to extend for 12 additional
months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written request to terminate or modify the agreement.




G.

Address for receipt of public comments or inquiries: 

Director, Defense Privacy Office, Crystal Mall 4, Room 920, 1941 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202-4502.
Telephone (703) 607-2943.

 Notice of intent. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a financial assistance award
under grant Number DE-FG01-95EE15617 to Custom Electronics, Incorporated. The proposed grant will provide
funding in the amount of $99,945 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of
a gas broiler control to automatically limit gas flow to cooking equipment when it is not in use.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) that the unsolicited application
for financial assistance submitted by Custom Electronics, Incorporated is meritorious based on the general evaluation
required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial
assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The co-inventor, William Garceau, who will be assisted
by Thomas Speakman, has many years of experience performing advanced research work in the fields of electronics and
material sciences. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned
solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention program (ERIP), has been structured since
its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs
ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue
a competitive solicitation.

<DOCTITLE>State of Louisiana Office of Conservation_Geopressured Brine Gas Well Determinations (FERC Nos. JD94-04615,
et al.); Order Granting Withdrawal Request and Notice of Preliminary Finding</DOCTITLE>



Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, William L. Massey, and Donald
F. Santa, Jr.




Issued: December 6, 1994.



On August 2, 1994, in Docket No. GP94-16-000, the Commission preliminarily found that five well determinations
by the Office of Conservation for the State of Louisiana (Louisiana) are not supported by substantial evidence.
 Louisiana's determinations find that gas produced from the five wells qualifies as natural gas produced from geopressured
brine under section 107(c)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).







On September 6, 1994, WRT Energy Corporation (WRT), the applicant before Louisiana, filed a letter withdrawing its
applications for the five wells. By letter dated September 9, 1994, the Commission advised WRT that the withdrawal
nullified the applications and Louisiana's determinations and terminated the proceeding in Docket No. GP94-16-000.

On September 19, 1994, WRT asked the Commission to allow it to withdraw its letter filed on September 6, 1994, and, if
necessary, to reinstate the proceeding in Docket No. GP94-16-000. WRT states that it withdrew its applications
because it believed that it would not have sufficient time to effectively respond to the preliminary finding but that
after it withdrew its applications, it became aware that staff would allow WRT additional time to file comments.

Subsequently, WRT and Louisiana filed comments urging the Commission to reverse the preliminary finding on October
5, 1994. In addition, an informal conference was held on October 26, 1994, and WRT, Louisiana and the Interstate Oil
and Gas Compact Commission (IOCC) filed comments urging the Commission to find that gas from the five wells qualify
as geopressured brine gas on November 4, 1994, November 8, 1994, and November 4, 1994, respectively.

Pursuant to  275.202(d) of the regulations, the letter WRT filed on September 6, 1994 nullified both the determinations
and the underlying applications on that date.
 However, since WRT states that it withdrew the applications due to a misunderstanding and has filed additional comments
to support the applications, for good cause shown, we grant WRT's request to withdraw the letter filed on September
6, 1994, so as to reinstate its applications and Louisiana's determinations as of the date of this order. However,
inasmuch as the proceeding in Docket No. GP94-16-00 has been terminated, the Commission will process
the determinations, and underlying applications, in a new proceeding and hereby makes a preliminary finding in Docket
No. GP94-18-000, pursuant to the procedures previously set forth in section 275.202(a) of the regulations,
that Louisiana's determinations for the five wells are not supported by substantial evidence in the records upon
which they were made for the reasons stated in our August 2, 1994 Notice of Preliminary Finding. In addition, the record
in Docket No. GP94-16-000 is included in new Docket No. GP94-18-000.





The Commission will issue a final order in Docket No. GP94-18-000 no later than 120 days from the date hereof.
Since the final order will consider the comments filed on the August 2, 1994 preliminary finding and the comments filed
after the informal conference, WRT, Louisiana and the IOCC need not file additional comments.




By the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Energy Research Financial Assistance Program Notice 95-08: Electron Beam Irradiation of Medical Waste </DOCTITLE>


Agency:

 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).



Action:

 Notice inviting grant applications.




<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), announces its interest in receiving applications for support of the research and development of technology
for commercial exploitation of electron beam sterilization of infectious hospital waste in preparation for disposal.
It is essential that the research be conducted at a public, urban teaching hospital affiliated with a comprehensive
medical school and research center with an active electron beam program and documentable experience in operating
a functional machine. In recent years, the practice of handling medical infectious waste by incineration or autoclaving
has resulted in public controversies in terms of environmental and public health issues. Irradiation of medical
infectious waste by electrons might provide an environmentally safe and publically acceptable method for disposing
of this waste. Applications should also address: (a) Monitoring and validating the treatment efficacy; (b) pre-irradiation
processing of waste, and (c) economic feasibility of this approach. 


Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are encouraged to submit a brief preapplication, in
accordance with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2), which consists of two to three pages of narrative describing research objectives
and methods of accomplishment. The preapplications will be reviewed relative to the scope and research needs for
the commercial exploitation of electron irradiation technology for medical waste disposal. Preapplications referencing
program Notice 95-08 should be received by January 1, 1995, and sent to Dr. Matesh N. Varma, Office of Health and
Environmental Research, ER-73, U.S. Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585, telephone: (301)903-3209.
Telephone and telefax numbers are required to be a part of the preapplication. A response to the preapplications discussing
potential relevance of a formal application will be communicated by January 15, 1995. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 DOE is interested in receiving research applications focused on the study of electron irradiation for treatment
of medical waste. Additional information can be obtained by contacting Dr. Matesh N. Varma at (301)903-3209.



It is anticipated that approximately $1 million will be available for one award during Fiscal Year 1995, contingent
upon availability of funds. Information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations,
evaluation and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found in the Application Guide for the
Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR Part 605. The Application Guide is available from
the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Health and Environmental Research, ER-73, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585.
Telephone requests may be made by calling (301)903-5349.

 Department of Energy (DOE).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice inviting grant preapplications.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces
its interest in receiving preapplications from potential applicants for research funding in the Energy Biosciences
program area. The intent in asking for a preapplication is to save the time and effort of applicants in preparing and
submitting a formal project application that may be inappropriate for the program. The preliminary screening of
research ideas is aimed also at relieving some of the burden of the scientific community in peer reviewing an excessive
number of research applications. The preapplication should consist of a two to three page concept paper about the
research being contemplated as a potential, formal application to the Energy Biosciences program. The concept paper
should focus on the objectives of the planned research, its scientific goals and their significance, an outline of
the approaches planned, and any other information that relates to the planned research. No budget information or
biographical data need be included; nor is an institutional endorsement necessary. The preapplication gives DOE
the opportunity to evaluate the technical suitability of submitting a formal application for support of research
ideas. A response indicating the appropriateness of submitting a formal application will be sent from the Division
of Energy Biosciences office in time to allow for an adequate preparation period for a formal application.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants should submit a brief preapplication in accordance
with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2), which consists of two to three pages of narrative describing research objectives. These
will be reviewed relative to the scope and the research needs of the Energy Biosciences program. The Energy Biosciences
program has the mission of generating 

fundamental 

biological information about plants and non-medical related microorganisms that can provide support for future
energy related biotechnologies. The objective is to pursue 

basic 

biochemical, genetic and physiological investigations that may contribute towards providing alternate fuels,
petroleum replacement products, energy conservation measures as well as other technologies, such as phytoremediation,
related to DOE programs. Areas of interest include bioenergetic systems, including photosynthesis; control of
plant growth and development, including metabolic, genetic, and hormonal and ambient factor regulation, metabolic
diversity, ion uptake, transport and accumulation, stress physiology and adaptation; genetic transmission and
expression; plant-microbial interactions, plant cell wall structure and function; lignocellulose degradative
mechanisms; mechanisms of fermentations, genetics of neglected microorganisms, energetics and membrane phenomena;
thermophily (molecular basis of high temperature tolerance); microbial interactions; and one-carbon metabolism,
which is the basis of biotransformations such as methanogenesis. The objective is to discern and understand basic
mechanisms and principles. 


Funds are expected to be available for new grant awards in FY 1996. The magnitude of these funds available and the number
of awards which can be made will depend on the budget process. The new awards made during FY 1994 averaged about $87,000
per year. Most awards are funded for a three-year period. The principal purpose in using preapplications at this time
is to reduce the expenditure of time and effort of all parties. Information about development and submission of applications,
eligibility, limitations, evaluations and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found
in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR Part 605. The Application
Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program for formal submissions and copies of 10 CFR Part
605 are available from U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, ER-17, Division of Energy
Biosciences, 
Washington, D.C. 20585. Telephone requests may be made by calling 
(301) 903-2873. Instructions for preparation of a formal application are number for this program is 81.049.

Roquette America, Inc.; Filing of Food Additive Petition


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Roquette America, Inc., has filed a petition proposing
that the food additive regulations be amended to permit the manufacture of mannitol by fermentation of sugars or sugar
alcohols such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, or sorbitol by the action of the yeast 

Zygosaccharomyces rouxii

.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4A4412) has been filed by Roquette America, Inc., c/o Keller and Heckman, 1001 G St. NW., Washington,
DC 20001. The petition proposes that the food additive regulations in  180.25 

Mannitol

 (21 CFR 180.25) be amended to permit the manufacture of mannitol by fermentation of sugars or sugar alcohols such as
glucose, sucrose, fructose, or sorbitol by the action of the yeast 

Zygosaccharomyces rouxii

. 


As part of FDA's comprehensive safety review of substances on the list of substances generally recognized as safe
(GRAS), the safety of mannitol as a food ingredient was evaluated in 1972 by the Select Committee on GRAS Substances
(SCOGS) from the Life Sciences Research Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
(FASEB). SCOGS concluded that mannitol was safe when used in food at current or reasonably expected future levels.
In the 

Federal Register

 of July 26, 1973 (38 FR 20046), FDA proposed to affirm the GRAS status of mannitol that was manufactured by the process
then known to the agency. 
In response to the proposal, the agency received a comment stating that mannitol was also commonly manufactured by
a process different from that set out in the proposed GRAS affirmation. The agency also received information raising
questions about the safety of mannitol. Data from studies on mannitol demonstrated a significant (but not dose related)
incidence of benign thymomas, and an abnormal growth of thymus gland tissue, in female rats fed mannitol. 
As a result of these findings, the agency concluded that additional data were necessary to evaluate the safety of mannitol.
Thus, in the 

Federal Register

 of September 23, 1974 (39 FR 34178), the agency declined to affirm the use of mannitol as GRAS and, instead, established
an interim food additive regulation for use of mannitol at existing levels. The interim regulation,  121.4005
(21 CFR 121.4005) (redesignated as  180.25 (21 CFR 180.25)) required that mannitol be manufactured by either
the process FDA had proposed to affirm as GRAS or the process described in the comment.
Following the publication of the interim food additive regulation, the agency received data that showed an increased
combined incidence of medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma of the adrenal glands in Fischer rats fed a diet
of 10 percent mannitol. No such mannitol-treatment effect, however, was observed in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats.
In 1985, FASEB, under contract with FDA, established an ad hoc Expert Panel on Sugar Alcohols and Lactose to study certain
effects that had been observed in animal experiments in which the test animals were fed sugar alcohols and lactose.
In a report submitted to FDA in 1986, ``Health Aspects of Sugar Alcohols and Lactose,'' FASEB concluded that there
was a statistically significant increased incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma in
rats fed high levels of sugar alcohols, including mannitol. The report further concluded that the existing data provided
no satisfactory mechanistic explanations of these adrenal medullary lesions, which are commonly found in aged rats
maintained on standard laboratory diets. 
FDA is continuing to evaluate the FASEB report on sugar alcohols, including mannitol, as well as other data from animal
studies of these substances to determine whether any regulatory action is appropriate for any or all of the sugar alcohols.
During this period of continuing evaluation, mannitol continues to be listed, on an interim basis, for food use.
Roquette America's petition to amend the interim food additive regulation on mannitol, if granted, would not change
the allowed uses of mannitol; it would simply permit a new method of manufacture of the additive. The subject regulation
on mannitol specifies manufacturing procedures that do not include the fermentation process used in Roquette's
production of mannitol. To permit a new manufacturing method, Roquette's petition proposes to amend the interim
food additive regulation ( 180.25) to provide for the use of 

Zygosaccharomyces rouxii

 in the fermentation process of producing mannitol from sugars and sugar alcohols.
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before January
12, 1995, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement and Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''
for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency
Training Programs </DOCTITLE>


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal
year (FY) 1995 Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training Programs under the authority of section 751,
title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of
1992, Pub. L. 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentages for
``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for the implementation of the general statutory funding preference.

Approximately $600,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that the $600,000 will support
approximately 7 competing awards averaging $86,000. 


Purpose 


Section 751 authorizes the award of grants for the purpose of planning and implementing projects in primary care training
for podiatric physicians in approved or provisionally approved residency programs which shall provide financial
assistance in the form of traineeships to residents who participate in such projects and who plan to specialize in
primary care. 


Eligibility 


Eligible entities for this program are schools of podiatric medicine and public and nonprofit private hospitals.
As noted above, the authorizing legislation limits eligibility to residency programs that are approved or provisionally
approved. The Council on Podiatric Medical Education (CPME), the recognized accrediting body for podiatric medicine,
uses the term ``candidate status'' in lieu of ``provisional approval.'' For the purposes of this program ``candidate
status'' will be accepted as meeting the statutory requirement for ``provisional approval.'' 
Applicants to this program that are planning to initiate a new podiatric primary care residency program are expected
to apply to CPME for candidate status. Grants will only be awarded to applicants that can demonstrate the attainment
of candidate status by July 1, 1995. The application for Federal funding must demonstrate, through responses to the
program specifications, that an adequate emphasis will be placed on podiatric primary care. 
The period of Federal support should not exceed 3 years. 


National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 


The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. The Podiatric Primary Care Residency
Training Program is related to the priority area of Educational and Community-Based Programs. Potential applicants
may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People
2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402-9325 (Telephone 202-783-3238). 


Education and Service Linkage 


As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public
Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.



Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with 
the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. 
The following project requirements and review criteria were established in FY 1989, after public comment and are
being extended by the Administration in FY 1995. 


Project Requirements 


Each project must have: 
a. A project director who is employed by the grantee institution and has completed at least one year of podiatric residency
training and has at least one year of clinical teaching experience; or is board certified in a recognized specialty
area in podiatric medicine and has at least 5 years of clinical teaching experience; 
b. An appropriate administrative and organizational plan and appropriate faculty, staff and facility resources
for the achievement of stated objectives; 
c. A systematic evaluation of the educational program, including the performance and competence of trainees and
faculty, the administration of the program, and the degree to which program and educational objectives are met; 
d. Use of ambulatory care settings where podiatric primary care is practiced and where an adequate portion of the clinical
training is conducted; 
e. A curriculum which: 
1. Is appropriate for the academic level of the trainees and the specific length and nature of the educational program;

<TEXT>
 

2. Supplements any practical (including clinical) experiences with related educational activities; and 
3. Includes: A minimum of 20 percent of curriculum time devoted to supervised instruction in ambulatory clinical
settings; instruction in behavioral sciences and the development of psychosocial skills and topics; and a supervised
clinical experience in a family medicine or general internal medicine ambulatory care setting; 
f. A sufficient number of residents to assure an adequate collegial environment for the educational program and to
enhance cost-efficiency; 
g. An adequate number of qualified faculty with training and experience in podiatric medicine, and behavioral sciences
and liaison faculty in related program areas for the number of residents in the program. The faculty in the program
must be engaged in periodic faculty development activities to improve their teaching skills; 
h. Adequate facilities for the conduct of the educational activities and, in particular, have ambulatory care space
sufficient to provide an adequate clinical experience for the residents; and 
i. A sufficient number of patients with a variety of health care needs to provide the resident with a broad clinical
experience. 


Review Criteria 


The HRSA will review applications based on an analysis of the following factors: 
(1) The degree to which the proposed project provides for 
the project requirements; 
(2) The administrative and management capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost effective
manner; 
(3) The degree to which the proposed training program emphasizes training in podiatric primary care settings; and

(4) The potential of the project to continue on a self sustaining basis. 


Other Considerations 


In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 
A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications. 
It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 


General Statutory Funding Preference 


As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to qualified applicants that: 
(1) have a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of
medically underserved communities; or 
(2) have achieved, during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. 
This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended
for approval by the peer review group. 
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 25 percent of the combined Podiatric Primary Care Residency graduates in academic
years 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice
in medically underserved communities. 
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992-93 and 1993-94, the rate
of placing graduates in medically underserved communities has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in medically underserved communities. 
Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 15743, dated April 4, 1994. 


Program Specific Statutory Funding Preference 


Under section 751(b) of title VII, preference will be given to qualified applicants that ``provide clinical training
in podiatric medicine in a variety of medically underserved communities.'' 


Information Requirements Provision 


Under section 791(b) of the Act, the Secretary may make an award under the Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency
Training Programs only if the applicant for the award submits to the Secretary the following information: 
1. A description of rotations of preceptorships for students, or clinical training programs for residents, that
have the principal focus of providing health care to medically underserved communities. 
2. The number of faculty on admissions committees who have a clinical practice in community-based ambulatory settings
in medically underserved communities. 
3. With respect to individuals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds or from medically underserved communities,
the number of such individuals who are recruited for academic programs of the applicant, the number of such individuals
who are admitted to such programs, and the number of such individuals who graduate from such programs. 
4. If applicable, the number of recent graduates who have chosen careers in primary health care.

Proposed Reestablishment of the Little Rock Mine in Grant County, New Mexico


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) and notice of scoping meeting.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), Las Cruces District Office, will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third
party contractor. The EIS will describe the potential impacts of the proposed reestablishment of the Little Rock
open-pit copper mining project located approximately 10 miles southwest of Silver City in Grant County, New Mexico.
The proposed Little Rock Project would reestablish an open-pit copper mining operation at a site that was developed
and operated sporadically between the 1950
' and 1972. The proposed Little Rock Project would resume mining operations at the site and would have a projected
operating life of between 2 and 4 years. 


The public is invited to participate in the planning process. A public scoping meeting will be held at the following
time and location:

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In 1993, Phelps Dodge Mining Company submitted a Plan of Operations (POO) to reestablish mining activities at the
Little Rock mine. Since it was indicated by the BLM that the preparation of an EIS would likely be required, no Environmental
Assessment (EA) was done. Instead, Phelps Dodge agreed to proceed in preparing an EIS and completed a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) between themselves, the BLM, and the United States Forest Service (USFS) outlining the responsibilities
of each party to the agreement. 


Phelps Dodge and the current owner, MM Holdings of San Jose, California, have entered into a lease-purchase agreement
whereby Phelps Dodge has an option to purchase the Little Rock property pending a successful effort on its part to obtain
the necessary environmental and operating permits and approvals. 
The Little Rock mine is a small oxide copper deposit located approximately 1 mile west of the existing Phelps Dodge
mining operation at Tyrone, New Mexico. It has operated sporadically, most recently between 1970 and 1972, producing
copper via leaching and subsequent copper cementation. 
As proposed in the POO, the project would be a conventional open-pit mining operation with a daily production rate
of as high as 160,000 tons for a period of between 2 and 4 years. No processing or waste disposal facilities are planned
for the project area. All material mined will be transported to the existing Tyrone mine facilities via a haul road
to be constructed from the Tyrone mine to the project site. Overburden or other inert, non-mineralized materials
will be transported to the existing Tyrone tailing dams for use as cover material for tailing dam closure or stockpiled
for reclamation of the site. All leachable material will be processed at existing permitted processing sites at the
Tyrone mine. All solid wastes generated at the Little Rock mine will be transported to and disposed of at existing permitted
facilities at the Tyrone mine. 
No permanent facilities will be constructed for the operations proposed under this Plan, with the possible exception
of dewatering facilities if required by the New Mexico State Engineer or the New Mexico Environment Department. Minimal
associated facilities specific to future mining of this site will be required and will consist of a temporary office
trailer, a dewatering system, a water pipeline and fill station to provide water for dust suppression, a 46kV power
distribution system, and a fuel dock. All these facilities will be transported or aligned along the proposed haul
road or existing routes and will be removed upon completion of mining. 
All mine overburden (waste) will be hauled off-site to be stockpiled on private property on top of existing, permitted
Phelps Dodge tailing piles located northeast of the site. All suitable leach material mined from the site will be hauled
to existing, permitted leach facilities on Phelps Dodge property. Existing leach and waste stockpiles from prior
mining activities on the site would also be removed to these sites or remediated in-place, as required. 
Remaining waste products from the mining operations will be negligible since maintenance, office, and managerial
functions will be located at the Tyrone mine. The Little Rock mine and associated facilities will be provided with
trash dumpsters and will utilize the existing Tyrone solid waste landfill. 
Reclamation of some items (

e.g.,

 removal of existing foundations, stockpiles and trash) would be done prior to, or concurrent with, mining activities.
All existing debris would be transferred to the Tyrone mine for recycling or disposal. All non-recyclable materials
will be disposed of at Tyrone's existing solid waste landfill. Reclamation of the majority of the site will follow
mining to allow final limits of disturbance to be determined. 
The EIS will address issues of geology and minerals, soils, water resources, vegetation, wildlife, range management,
air quality, visual resources, reclamation, land use, access, recreation, wilderness, cultural resources, social
and economic values, transportation and noise. 
The BLM has identified the following potentially significant impacts as requiring additional analysis: The quality
and quantity of post-mining water generated by the open pit; the effect on surface water quality and riparian areas
of the proposed haul road to the Little Rock site; and the effect on surface water quality and riparian areas of the proposed
diversion of California Gulch around the Little Rock site. 
Because these issues were determined to require special investigation, it is anticipated that the majority of work
for other resources will be limited to summarizing and incorporating by reference data and analyses from existing
environmental studies as prescribed in 40 CFR 1500.4 and 1500.5. Additional investigation may be indicated for other
resources after review of existing data and comments received during the scoping process. 
BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) identification
of viable alternatives; and (3) notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that additional information
concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS
process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies

<DOCTITLE>Availability of a Final Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement on the Federal Aid in Sport Fish
Restoration (SFR) and Federal Aid In Wildlife Restoration (WR) Programs </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service has reviewed the operation of the SFR and WR Programs into the next century and has completed
a Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (SPEIS) to the Program Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) published in 1978. The data, analyses, and conclusions of the 1978 EIS, where still valid, are incorporated
by reference. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since the 1978 EIS, continued population growth has resulted in intensified resource use; values, interests, and
leisure-time activities have increased demand for non-consumptive uses; and natural resources management priorities,
Federal laws and funding patterns have altered the Program. 


No change to the existing Program direction has been selected as the SPEIS preferred alternative. Overwhelming support
of the existing program was indicated by respondents to the draft document issued in November 1993. The majority of
comments urged that the Program remain unchanged and cited examples of successful cooperative projects that have
been undertaken. Most comments expressed belief that States are the best qualified to assess the needs of their citizens
for the management of fish and wildlife resources. The view was also expressed that the Federal government should
not become more involved in establishing priorities for State projects. 
The WR Program will continue to provide positive benefits for game species, non-game wildlife species/biodiversity,
threatened endangered species, wetland/floodplain habitat, terrestrial habitat, recreation, local economies,
social values, and cultural resources. The SFR Program will continue to provide positive benefits for sport fish,
non-game fish species and diversity, threatened and endangered species, recreation, local economies, and social
values.

<DOCTITLE>National Digital Cartographic Data Base</DOCTITLE>


<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to obtain Digital Line Graphs (DLG), Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Digital
Raster Graphics (DRG), and Digital Orthophotoquads (DOQ) captured from or registered to USGS primary series topographic
maps for entry into the National Digital Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB) as part of the public domain. The USGS recognizes
the public benefit of obtaining DLG, DEM, DLG, and DOQ data prepared by State and local government agencies, public
utilities, and private firms. The USGS seeks to identify other sources of digital map data for areas now lacking DLG,
DEM, DRG, or DOQ coverage, and to obtain technically acceptable data through cooperative agreements. When it is in
the Government's interest, and subject to the availability of appropriated funds, the USGS will assist qualified
organizations in preparing digital map data to USGS standards for NDCDB archiving and public distribution in non-proprietary
formats.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice does not solicit contract support for specific USGS digital mapping requirements, nor does it encourage
speculative ventures by any potential cooperator. The intent is to identify accurate primary digital map data being
prepared by non-Federal organizations to support their own mapping needs, and to determine whether the data can be
obtained in DLG, DEM, DRG, and DOQ formats (or converted to these formats by USGS) through cooperative agreements.
All data obtained under this initiative will be archived by USGS as part of the public domain.


Acceptable data must meet general requirements for source, content, accuracy, and format as detailed in USGS National
Mapping Program Technical Instructions: 

Standards for Digital Line Graphs; Standards for Digital Elevation Models

; 

Standards for Digital Raster Graphics;

 and 

Standards for Digital Orthophotos

 (Internet FTP nmdpow9.er.usgs.gov/public). The USGS may support acceptable proposals by providing any of the following:
funds; source materials; public domain software; data validation; technical assistance; other materials and services.
Assistance will be offered to the applicant(s) offering the greatest technical benefits at a fair and reasonable
cost relative to the amount of USGS funds available. All proposed cooperative agreements must be determined by the
USGS to serve the public interest, and to comply with applicable public law. Authority for this Program is contained
in the Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey Fiscal Year 1994 appropriation bill.

OSHA Training Institute Education Centers


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for proposals.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducts short-term technical training in occupational
safety and health through the OSHA Training Institute in Des Plaines, Illinois. In recent years, the number of private
sector personnel and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA requesting training has increased beyond the
capacity of the OSHA Training Institute to meet the demand. In October 1992, OSHA began a project to test the feasibility
of using other training or educational institutions to conduct OSHA Training Institute courses for private sector
personnel and for Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA. Based on the success to date of this project, OSHA
is expanding the program.


This notice announces the opportunity for interested organizations to submit applications to become OSHA Training
Institute Education Centers. Applications will be rated on a competitive basis and two organizations will be selected
to participate in the project. Complete application instructions are contained in this notice. 
Authority for this program may be found in sections 21 (b) and (c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29
U.S.C. 670). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


The OSHA Training Institute conducts 82 short-term technical training courses in OSHA standards, policies and procedures
for persons responsible for enforcing or directly supporting the OSH Act, private sector employers and employees,
and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA. Its primary responsibility is to the first group: Federal and
State compliance officers and State consultation program staff. Private sector and Federal personnel from agencies
other than OSHA receive training on an ``as available'' basis. 
In recent years the demand for training has increased from all three groups. Resources of the OSHA Training Institute
have not increased at a rate that can keep up with the demand. As the number of Federal and State personnel engaged in
enforcement or consultation being trained has increased, opportunities for training for private sector personnel
and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA have remained static or decreased. 
In order to meet the increased demand for its courses, the OSHA Training Institute has selected eight educational
institutions to conduct OSHA Training Institute courses for private sector personnel and Federal personnel from
agencies other than OSHA. 
These OSHA Training Institute Education Centers, which were selected through nationwide competitive processes,
are: Keene State College, Manchester, New Hampshire; Niagara County Community College, Lockport, New York; West
Virginia University/National Resource Center for Construction Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia;
Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, Georgia; Texas Engineering Extension Service/Texas Safety Association,
Arlington, Texas; Maple Woods Community College, Kansas City, Missouri; Red Rocks Community College/Trinidad
State Junior College, Lakewood, Colorado; and the University of California, San Diego, California. 
The OSHA Training Institute now proposes to expand the number of OSHA Training Institute Education Centers from eight
to ten. 


Scope


OSHA will enter into nonfinancial agreements with two colleges, universities or other nonprofit training organizations
to conduct OSHA courses for private sector personnel and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA. The two
new OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be located in two OSHA Regions, one per region. The two OSHA Regions
contain the following states.

1. Region V: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
2. Region X: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
The new OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be selected through a competitive process. This notice solicits
applications from organizations interested in participating in the project.
Applicants selected to participate as OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be expected to present six
courses: four general industry OSHA courses: Course 204A, Machinery and Machine Guarding Standards; Course 501,
A Guide to Voluntary Compliance in Safety and Health; Course 521, OSHA Guide to Voluntary Compliance in the Industrial
Hygiene Area; and Course 600, Collateral Duty Course for Other Federal Agencies; and two constructions industry
course: Course 500, Instructor Course in Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry
and Course 510, Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry. Additional information
about each of these courses is in the appendix to this notice.
Applicants will be selected based upon their occupational safety and health experience, their nonacademic training
background, the availability of classroom and lodging facilities, and access to transportation. OSHA will support
the program by providing curriculum outlines, masters of student handouts, and orientation to OSHA course presentation.
OSHA also will provide assistance in presenting and/or answering questions on OSHA policy.
The project will be fifteen months in duration. OSHA will monitor each of the new OSHA Training Institute Education
Centers to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. If performance is satisfactory at the end of the fifteen-month
period, OSHA will enter into a new agreement for a two-year period. Continuation of this agreement will be dependent
on continued satisfactory performance and mutual interest of the parties in continuing the OSHA Training Institute
Education Center program. OSHA may initiate modifications to agreements to increase or decrease the number of different
OSHA courses offered by the OSHA Training Institute Education Centers.


Eligibility


Any nonprofit public or private college or university is eligible to apply. Any other nonprofit organization that
can demonstrate that training or education is part of its mission and that more than 50 percent of its staff and dollar
resources is devoted to training or education is also eligible to apply.
In addition to meeting the eligibility criteria, applicants must have a physical presence in the Region for which
they are applying. For example, an eligible national organization based in San Francisco that has a training facility
in Chicago would have a physical presence in Region V. On the other hand, a national organization based in New York City
that rents hotel space to provide training at multiple sites around the county would be considered to have a physical
presence only in New York and would not be qualified to apply.
A training or educational institution may elect to apply for this program in partnership with a safety and health organization
that is not primarily a training organization. For example, a university could enter into an agreement with a labor
union that provides for the use of university classrooms and faculty supplemented by union safety and health professionals.
If two or more organizations wish to apply as a consortium, a training or educational member of the consortium must
be designated as the lead organization. OSHA will only enter into a nonfinancial agreement with the lead organization.


Financial Considerations


Organizations selected as OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will not be provided funding by OSHA to support
this effort. The Centers will be expected to support their OSHA training through their normal tuition and fee structures.


Length of Project


The project will start July 1, 1995, and will run for fifteen months.


OSHA Training Institute Education Center Responsibilities


Each OSHA Training Institute Education Center will be responsible for the following.
1. Arranging to have instructors assigned to teach OSHA courses attend OSHA orientation.
2. Scheduling courses. Courses are to be scheduled on a year-round basis, with each course being offered more than
once a year.
3. Publicizing the availability of courses.
4. Registering students.
5. Purchasing, or otherwise obtaining, audiovisual materials for use in courses.
6. Reproducing handouts for students.
7. Conducting courses in accordance with materials and instruction provided by OSHA.
8. Monitoring courses to ensure that OSHA course outlines are being followed.
9. Collecting course evaluation data from students in accordance with OSHA procedures.

Review Criteria


A panel of OSHA staff will review the applications. It will consider each of the factors listed below.
1. 

Occupational Safety and Health Training Experience
a. Evidence that occupational safety and health training or education has been an ongoing program of the applicant
organization. Reviewers will examine the number of different occupational safety and health courses offered by
the applicant organization over the past two years, the length of the courses, the number of students completing each
course, and the number of times each course was offered. Successful applicants will also include samples of course
announcements.
b. Qualifications of personnel teaching occupational safety and health courses. These include academic training
in occupational safety and health subjects, experience with the application of Federal OSHA standards to hazards
and hazard abatement, professional certification, practical experience in the field of occupational safety and
health, and training experience. Training experience is defined as experience in training workers or managers in
nonacademic situations.
2. Adequacy of Training Facilities.

 Potential for accommodating classes of 25 to 40 students on a year-round basis in settings comparable to those of the
OSHA Training Institute. Items considered will include classroom layout, e.g., desks or tables for students, availability
of audiovisual equipment, reproduction facilities for handouts, and availability of appropriate laboratory and/or
hands-on facilities. Accessibility for persons with disabilities will also be considered.
3. 

Recruitment and Registration Procedures. 

Reasonableness of the applicant's procedures for recruiting and registering students. Methods of reaching potential
students, ease of registration, provisions for cancellations, and system for informing students of available accommodations
and materials necessary for the course, if any, are among the items that will be reviewed.

Area or Regional Office. Accommodations, preferably national hotel/motel chains, and restaurants should be reasonably
prices and should be within a few miles of the training facility. A major airport with regular service to all parts of
the Region should be within a reasonable driving time from the hotel and training locations. Interstate highways
should also be within reasonable distance. The nearest OSHA Office should be within one hour's travel time of the principal
training site to facilitate OSHA participation in training sessions.
5. 

Tuition.

 Conformance of proposed tuition and/or fees with the established policies of the applicant and reasonableness of
the charges.
6. 

Nondiscrimination.

 Adherence of the applicant's policies with Federal requirements.
7. 

Off-site Courses.

SUMMARY: 

NARA will hold a public meeting with vendors to discuss a proposal to change procedures for ordering reproductions
of archival still photographs, aerial film, maps, and drawings from the Still Picture Branch, Cartographic and Architectural
Branch, and other units of the National Archives. The proposal would privatize the reporudction of these archival
materials by allowing customers to place their order directly with vendors. In addition, NARA would assign work space
to the vendors in its new building in College Park, MD, in order that the materials can be copied on its premises. The
proposed procedures, which will be tested for a one-year trial period, are intended to expedite the reproduction
ordering process and to ascertain the extent to which digital scanning can satisfy customer requirements.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Company, et al.; Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 95 to Facility Operating License No.
NPF-62 issued to Illinois Power Company (the licensee), which revised the Technical Specifications for operation
of the Clinton Power Station, Unit 1, located in Dewitt County, Illinois. The amendment is effective as of the date
of issuance.
The amendment modified the Technical Specifications by replacing the existing Technical Specifications in their
entirety with a new set of Technical Specifications based on NUREG-1434, ``Improved BWR-6 Technical
Specifications,'' dated September 1992. This amendment was based on the licensee's submittal of October 26, 1993,
and supplemented by letters dated April 26, October 31, November 18, and November 28, 1994.
The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required
by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17800). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice.
The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an
environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the
issuance of the amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 55864, dated
November 9, 1994).
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment dated October 26, 1993, and supplemented
by letters dated April 26, October 31, November 18 and November 28, 1994, (2) Amendment No. 95 to License No. NPF-62,
(3) the Commission's related Safety Evaluation, and (4) the Commission's Environmental Assessment. All of these
items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street
NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room located at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West
Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of: Philadelphia Electric Company, et al. Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I.


Philadelphia Electric Company, et al. (PECo, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-44
and DPR-56, which authorize operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, (PBAPS) Units 2 and 3. The licenses
provide, among other things, that the license is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now
or hereinafter in effect.
The facility consists of two boiling water reactors located in York County, Pennsylvania.


II.


It is stated in 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors
against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical
protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities
involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable
risk to the public health and safety.''
It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), that ``The licensee shall control all
points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that ``A numbered
picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas
without escort * * *'' It also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors)
may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon
entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area * * *''
The licensee propose to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badge with them when departing the site.
An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges
offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated September 8, 1994, the licensee requested
an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose.


III.


Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide measures for protection against radiological sabotage provided
the licensee demonstrates that the measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological
sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.
At the PBAPS site, unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination
badge and keycard. (Hereafter, these are referred to as badge). The security officers at the entrance station use
the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees
and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at the entrance/exit location
and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at the entrance/exit location. In accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plant's
physical security plan, neither licensee employee nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite.
Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized for unescorted access into protected areas would have
the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control
system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system
would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared
with the previously stored template in the access control system to verify authorization for entry. Individuals,
including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badges with them when they depart the
site and thus eliminate the process to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges
do not carry any information other than a unique identification number.
All other access processes, including search function capability would remain the same. This system would not be
used for persons requiring escorted access, i.e., visitors.
Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91_0276
US-906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on the licensee's experience with the current photo-identification
system, the licensee stated that the false accept rate for the hand geometry system is comparable to that of the current
system. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department of Energy facilities.
The licensee will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance
equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plan for PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, will be revised
to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees
and contractors to take their badges offsite.
The licensee will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security personnel
through the use of a badge and verification of hand geometry. A numbered picture badge identification system will
continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges will continue
to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.

Since both the badges and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected areas, the proposed system
would provide for a positive verification process and the potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of
taking the badge offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas.
For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures
for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against
radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.


IV.


Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning
of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by the licensee, i.e., contractors,
who are authorized unescorted access into the protected area, may take their picture badges offsite.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 62753).
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DRP-64, issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee), for operation of Indian
Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (Indian Point 3) located in Westchester County, New York.


The proposed amendment would revise Section 4.4 of the Indian Point 3 Technical Specifications. Specifically, TS
4.4.E.1 would be revised to allow a one-time extension to the 30-month interval requirement for leak rate testing
of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation values AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870. This one-time extension for leak rate testing of the RHR valves
would be deferred until prior to return to power following the current outage, which defined as prior to T

avg 

exceeding 350 
 F.


Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.


The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilities in accordance with
the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a siginificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:


Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:


1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?




Response: 

The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change is limited to a one-time extension of the containment isolation valve
leak rate test for RHR valves, AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870.
Testing the RHR containment isolation valves while T

avg 

is above 200 
 F and below 350 
 F is considered to be a more practical time to test the valves because, in this configuration, the reactor coolant
pumps and steam generators can be used to remove decay heat. Additionally, the revised testing procedure required
to test the RHR containment isolation valves with T

avg

 above 200 
 F and below 350 
 F can be performed in accordance with the current Technical Specifications. Therefore, the probability of
a previously evaluated accident is not significantly increased. The consequences of a previously evaluated accident
would not be significantly increased because each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC-732, AC-741,
AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 has redundant isolation barriers and
is supplied by the IVSWS [isolation valve seal water system] which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers.
Further, due to the periodic surveillance that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment
does not exceed two gallons per hour, even if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred,
this would not significantly affect off-site exposures.

2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?



Response: 

The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since
the change does not alter the physical characteristics of any plant system or component. The change is limited to a
one-time extension to the leak rate test interval for RHR valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870.

3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?



Response: 

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Testing the RHR containment
isolation valves while T

avg

 is above 200 
 F and below 350 
 F is considered to be a more practical time to test the valves because, in this configuration, the reactor coolant
pumps and steam generators can be used to remove decay heat. Additionally, the revised testing procedure required
to test the RHR containment isolation valves with T

avg

 above 200 
 F and below 350 
 F can be performed in accordance with the current Technical Specifications. Therefore, there is not a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. With respect to containment integrity, there is not a significant reduction in a margin
of safety because each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743,
and AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 has redundant isolation barriers and is supplied by the IVSWS
which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers. The most recent test results associated with valves
AC-732, AC-741, AC-MOV-743, AC-MOV-744, and AC-MOV-1870 show that
the leak rates of the valves were well within the acceptance criteria of the tests. Further, due to the periodic surveillance
that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment does not exceed two gallons per hour, even
if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred, this would significantly affect off-site
exposures.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facilities, the Commission may issue the license amendments before the expiration
of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendments involve no significant
hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the
Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By January 12, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendments to the subject
facility operating licenses and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White
Plains, New York 10601. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
The petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
If the determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendments.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Michael J. Case: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Charles M. Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle, New York, New York 10019, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(l)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated December 8, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine
Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
 


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
 


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
 


The purpose of this rule change is to establish a single service offering comprised of the existing Nasdaq Level 1 (``Level
1'') quotation and Last Sale Information (``Last Sale'') services. The monthly charge to be levied for the consolidated
service will be $19/terminal, the sum of the monthly charges currently assessed for receipt of the Last Sale and Level
1 services on an authorized terminal device. Hence, this rule proposal does not entail an increase in the subscriber
charges for the individual constituent services; however, its implementation will result in higher fees for some
Level 1 subscribers who do not currently pay for receipt of last sale data.

The two services covered by this proposal are distributed by commercial vendors of market data pursuant to contracts
with The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``NSMI''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NASD.

1

 Vendors distribute the data via their respective networks to the end users who pay the established charge levied by
NSMI for receipt of the quotation and transaction information. The existence of separate service categories for
quotation and transaction data traces to the evolution of The Nasdaq Stock Market (``Nasdaq''). From its inception
in 1971, Nasdaq provided quotation information on a real-time basis for vendor distribution. In 1982, the NASD implemented
rules requiring member firms to report individual transactions in the top tier of Nasdaq listings within 90 seconds
of execution. Later, this reporting regime was extended to Nasdaq SmallCap issues, Nasdaq convertible debt issues,
and equity issues traded exclusively over-the-counter (``OTC''). In 1991, the universe of quotation data available
to Level 1 subscribers was expanded to include real-time quotations entered by OTC market makers utilizing the OTCBB
service. The instant proposal would combine the real-time quotation and transaction data for Nasdaq and OTC issues,
respectively, into a single service distributed by vendors for which their subscribers will pay a single monthly
charge of $19/terminal.

The NASD posits that this proposal will produce benefits to vendors as well as their customers. First, it will simplify
the billing process by eliminating the need to separately identify and track those terminals receiving one or the
other covered service. This should minimize the potential for billing disputes between vendors and their customers,
and simplify the process by which vendors authorize (or deauthorize) subscriber devices for receipt of real-time
quotation and transaction information on Nasdaq and OTC issues, Second, it will increase market transparency by
ensuring that all subscribers to NSMI's comprehensive quotation data (

i.e., 

the quotations on Nasdaq and OTCBB issues that Level 1 subscribers currently receive) will receive trade-by-trade
information for the same universe of quoted securities. Thus, the vendors' customers will automatically have access
to more expansive data that can be used to gauge market trends and facilitate investment decisions. And third, implementation
of this proposal will materially advance NSMI's efforts to simplify and update its fee structure, with a view toward
reducing the administrative burdens and costs incurred by vendors that distribute quotation and transaction data
from the Nasdaq and OTC markets, respectively.
 In this regard, the NASD notes that the SEC previously approved a similar initiative that linked the subscription
of quotation and transaction data services for New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') listed issues and established
unified subscriber fees. This was accomplished by certain amendments to the Consolidated Tape and Consolidated
Quotation Plans.







The NASD and NSMI believe that that proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 15A(b)(5)
of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) specifies that the rules of a national securities association shall provide for the
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members, issuers and other persons using any
facility or system that the association operates or controls. The proposed change in fee structure effects the consolidation
of two existing services into a single service, priced at the current levels of the constituent services. As such,
the proposal does not constitute a fee increase for those subscribers receiving the most comprehensive service.
However, its implementation will require that Level 1 subscribers who had not previously received last sale data
also pay for receipt of complete last sale data. In terms of the universe of Level 1 terminals currently supported,
this segment accounts for about 6.5% of the terminal population. It should be noted that this percentage has been declining
in recent years, apparently reflecting the enhanced value of last sale data that now includes all Nasdaq-listed securities
and thousands of OTC equity securities. The NASD believes that the additional cost of $9.75 that some subscribers
will incur will be partially offset by the administrative savings.
 In particular, large subscribers will no longer have to verify the accuracy of billings by tracking terminals that
receive only one of the covered services. Administrative savings should also accrue to vendors with large populations
of subscribers receiving Nasdaq market data. Moreover, the instant proposal will effect a simplification in the
fee structure applicable to receipt of two major data services supported by NSMI.






The NASD and NSMI also believe that this proposal is consistent with certain national market system objectives expressed
by Congress in adopting Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act in 1975. Specifically, the Congress found that the efficiency
of the nation's securities markets would be advanced by the broad dissemination of reliable quotation and transaction
information to brokers, dealers, and investors. In other words, the Congress sought to increase market transparency
by fostering opportunities for electronic delivery of current market data to the constituencies served by the various
securities markets. The NASD submits that its proposal is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1) because it will optimize
the distribution of real-time quotation and transaction data from the Nasdaq and OTC markets to market professionals
handling customer orders. As a result, registered representatives using desk-top terminals to supply current market
data on Nasdaq or OTC equities will automatically be able to furnish their customers with insider bids/offers as well
as last sale prices for these securities. Hence, consolidation of the Level 1 and Last Sale services translates to
expanded access to market data for retail investors who depend on their brokers for current market information  Finally,
the NASD notes that the Commission previously approved amendments to the Consolidated Tape and Consolidated Quotation
Plans that effected a bundling of quotation and last sale data services (and the establishment of unified subscriber
fees) respecting NYSE-listed securities covered by these national market system plans. Based on these factors,
the NASD reiterates its belief that the instant proposal is fully consistent with the data distribution objectives
contained in Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act.

in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Issuance of Record of Decision.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is provided in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and  5.4.9 of TVA's implementing
procedures, 48 FR 19264 (1983). TVA has decided to adopt the modified preferred alternative (Alternative E) identified
in its ``Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Natural Resources Management Plan (NRMP) at Land Between
The Lakes (LBL).'' The Final EIS was made available to the public on October 17, 1994. Under Alternative E (modified),
natural resource management will be used to enhance recreation and environmental education, with emphasis on scenic
beauty, sightseeing, wildlife viewing, and a more natural appearance of the forest. Multiple use of resources will
be allowed, including hunting, fishing and timber harvesting. The final NRMP also identifies measures to integrate
LBL's designation as a United Nations Man and the Biosphere Reserve into resource planning and management.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

LBL is a 170,000-acre tract of federal land in western Kentucky and Tennessee. It is located between Kentucky Reservoir
and Lake Barkley. The area was established in 1963. TVA manages LBL to promote recreation and environmental education.
Management of the area's natural resources is a very important element in the fulfillment of these goals. Natural
resources which are managed include forests, open lands (

e.g.,

 agricultural fields, wildlife openings), wildlife, and water.


TVA first developed an NRMP in 1964 and subsequently revised it several times. The NRMP was last revised in 1985. Since
then, a number of new resource management issues have arisen and there have been changes in public desires for resource
management. In addition, LBL was designated an international biosphere reserve by the United Nations in 1991. The
UN's biosphere reserve program identifies examples of the world's major managed and preserved ecosystems and emphasizes
resource conservation and research at those areas. LBL was designated a UN biosphere reserve ``to provide a research
demonstration of how preserved lands, managed lands, and man can coexist.''
To obtain the public's views on new resource issues and possible changes to the management plan, TVA decided to prepare
an EIS in concert with its consideration of possible revisions to the NRMP. Following scoping, TVA released a draft
EIS and NRMP on November 10, 1993. A public hearing was held on December 14, 1993, and a 60-day period was provided for
receipt of written comments. TVA received approximately 2,900 letters and 64 statements were made at the public hearing.
After considering all comments, TVA revised the EIS appropriately. The Final EIS was distributed to commenting agencies
and the public on October 17, 1994.


Alternatives Considered


In light of LBL's broad goals, a number of management philosophies and plans could be implemented. Consequently,
TVA purposefully formulated alternatives for the EIS that captured a reasonable range of appropriate management
approaches. Certain of the alternatives were then modified, first in response to comments received during the scoping
stage and then in response to comments received on the draft EIS. As presented in the Final EIS, the alternatives evaluated
and considered included:


Alternative A: No Action


Under Alternative A, there would be no change in the basic management guidance provided by the 1985 Natural Resources
Management Plan. Since 1985, there have been several modifications in management practices used at LBL as knowledge
has improved and new management techniques were developed. These modifications will be formally incorporated into
a revised NRMP. Aside from these modifications, choosing Alternative A would essentially mean taking no action because
it represents current management objectives and guidelines for LBL's natural resources. The basic management approach
for forest resources would continue commercial forest management (the removal and sale of merchantable timber)
by even-aged management, including shelterwood and clearcut harvests. However, harvest levels would be substantially
lower than annual growth, with a rotation age for hardwoods of 276 years. Approximately 13,150 acres would be designated
as biosphere reserve core area. TVA would protect water resources through use of silvicultural and agricultural
best management practices (BMPs), would manipulate water levels on selected interior ponds, and would construct
artificial wetlands to benefit shorebirds and waterfowl.


Alternative B: Emphasis on Wildlife Management for Game Species


Even-aged forest management practices would continue to be used, including shelterwood and clearcut harvests but
the volume of trees cut would be increased. Increasing even-aged practices would retard shade-tolerant hardwood
encroachment into LBL's forests and maintain a higher proportion of oak-hickory forest types. Oak-hickory forests
produce more mast (seeds and nuts such as acorns and hickory nuts) than other forest types. Increasing even-aged practices
also would increase the amount of young plant growth and edge communities. Both changes would benefit wildlife, especially
game species, and associated recreational activities such as hunting and wildlife viewing. Timber harvest levels
would still be less than annual growth (less wood volume would be removed than grows each year). However, the rotation
age for hardwoods would decrease to approximately 100 years. Biosphere reserve core areas would total 20,650 acres.
Water resource and wetland management would be the same as in Alternative A.

<TEXT>
 

Alternative C. No Active Natural Resource Management


Under Alternative C, commercial forest management would not be practiced, and natural succession would be allowed
to convert approximately 40 to 50 percent of the forest to shade-tolerant hardwoods such as maple and beech. In addition,
open land management for the purposes of creating wildlife habitat would cease, and hunting and other consumptive
recreation would not be allowed. The biosphere reserve core area would total 161,500 acres, essentially all of LBL
except those areas devoted to the interior highway system and facilities. Water level manipulation on interior ponds
would benefit waterfowl and shorebirds, but no artificial wetlands would be constructed.


Alternative D: No Active Forest Management, Hunting Allowed


Under Alternative D, commercial forest management would cease as in Alternative C. However, open land management
would continue as in the past, and hunting would be allowed. Biosphere reserve core area would total 151,050 acres.
Water and wetland management would be the same as under Alternative A.


Alternative E (modified): Combination of Even-Aged and Uneven-Aged Forest Management With Expansion of Biosphere
Reserve Core Area


Under Alternative E, even-aged forest management would be used on moist, lower slopes and bottomland habitats where
conversion to shade-tolerant species through natural succession is most likely. Uneven-aged forest management
practices would be used on upper slopes and ridges where conversion is less likely to occur. The goal of both management
systems would be to maintain a high proportion of healthy, vigorous oak-hickory forest stands. For aesthetic reasons,
clearcuts would not be used. To further reduce aesthetic impacts, final shelterwood harvests would be deferred for
20 to 40 years following the initial harvest. The rotation age for forests under even-aged management would be 150
years. Group selection harvests under the uneven-aged system would be limited to about one acre or less in size. Although
set rotations would not apply to uneven-aged management, hardwood trees would be allowed to reach an age of 150 to 200
years. Open land management would continue as in the past; however, any open lands within biosphere reserve core areas
would be allowed to revert to forest. Biosphere reserve core areas would be increased to a total of 42,500 acres. Water
level and wetland management would be the same as under Alternative A.


Preferred Alternative


The Final EIS identified Alternative E as TVA's preferred alternative. In TVA's opinion, Alternative E represents
an environmentally balanced approach which best provides for the recreational and educational goals of LBL. This
approach is largely consistent with and builds upon the management approach currently in use at LBL (Alternative
A). It provides for increased outdoor recreation and environmental education opportunities but does so in the context
of ecologically sound natural resource management.
Under Alternative E, active forest and wildlife management would occur at reduced level's compared to the no action
alternative (Alternative A). However, the forest should have a more natural appearance compared to alternatives
A and B_a difference which TVA's analyses indicate is preferred by the general public. A larger biosphere reserve
core area would enhance conditions for those species which benefit from unfragmented forest blocks and closed canopies.
This would include forest interior neotropical migratory birds which are of current concern. There are a number of
other attributes that make Alternative E preferable:


e

 Scenic beauty would be emphasized_timber harvesting methods would be employed that decrease the visual
impact of tree removal. Areas along roadways and adjacent to facilities would be planted to native prairie grasses,
native wildflowers and native flowering trees and shrubs;


e

 Timber harvesting would continue but at a level of 5.3 million board feet annually, a 20 percent decrease from
prior levels of 6.6 million board feet;


e

 Wildlife management activities would continue to support hunting and wildlife viewing activities;


e

 The combination of forest management activities used, in conjunction with a large biosphere reserve area,
would enhance site-level, landscape-level, and regional biological diversity; 


e

 Hiking, horseback riding, and bicycle riding experiences would be enhanced; and 


e

 A slight increase in tourism spending would be expected, while the loss of timber-related jobs would be minimized.
As finally formulated, Alternative E reflects modifications which were made to it in response to public comments
on the Draft EIS. Specific comments and responses were:


Comment: 

The biosphere reserve core acreage should be increased to address concerns about forest fragmentation, habitat
for forest interior neogropical migratory birds, and regional biological diversity.


Response: 

The biosphere reserve core acreage was increased from 20,650 acres to 42,500 acres (approximately 25 percent of LBL).


Comment: 

Silvicultural recommendations (

e.g., 

timber harvesting methods) should be based on specific site conditions; therefore, even-aged management should
not be eliminated as a management tool.


Response: 

Even-aged management was added to the alternative as an appropriate practice on moist and bottomland sites.


Comment: 

Management actions should provide for improved forest health and vigor (especially in light of anticipated future
gypsy moth infestations).


Response: 

Even-aged and uneven-aged management practices were included with a goal of maintaining a healthy and vigorous forest.


Comment: 

Aesthetic resources should continue to be protected and improved through resource management activities.


Response: 

Silvicultural practices such as shelterwood with a delay in the final shelterwood harvest were included as an alternative
to clearcutting.


Comment: 

The use of pesticides and other chemicals should be reduced.


Response: 

The alternative was modified to establish as a target a 25 percent reduction in the amount of pesticides used at LBL
by the year 2000.

TVA received a substantial number of comments that supported the more aggressive timber harvesting activities allowed
under Alternatives A and B. TVA agrees that Alternative A has been a successful management strategy in the past at LBL,
particularly in the area of enhancing wildlife habitat. As a result, even-aged forest management, a critical component
of Alternative A, has been included in Alternative E although at reduced levels. Even-aged forest management will
help to meet the long-term needs of early successional wildlife species by increasing the amount of young plant growth.
Even-aged management is more effective in maintaining the oak-hickory forest of the area. However, the public's
perception of even-aged management is generally negative and there is less acceptance of this than in the past, particularly
on public lands. The reduced use of even-aged management under Alternative E attempts to strike a balance between
the ecological benefits of even-aged management and the public's perceptions.
TVA also agrees with commenters that Alternative B would represent sound resource management from a biological standpoint.
However, increasing the level of even-aged timber management would have negative visual impacts and is not desirable
for that reason. In addition, as pointed out by a number of commenters, LBL offers the opportunity to maintain a large
block of mature forest in a region where most private forests are fragmented and other tracts of public land are small
in size.
A number of comments were received that supported an end to commercial forest management activities (the harvesting
of commercially-usable timber) on all of LBL. This would occur under Alternatives C and D. As stated in TVA's EIS, Alternative
C or D would be consistent with and help advance LBL's broad goals. However, over the long term, these alternatives
are expected to change 40 to 50 percent of the stands in LBL's forests from oak-hickory to beech-maple. Oak-hickory
species are better mast producers and many wildlife species rely on mast for food. In addition, wildlife species which
depend on early-successional vegetative habitats would be adversely impacted by the change to mature, old-growth
forest. There is also likely to be a decline in overall visitation under Alternatives C and D because of adverse effects
on hunting. Under Alternative C, hunting would be eliminated. Under Alternative D, the habitats preferred by certain
game species would be reduced and hunting opportunities would be adversely affected. The diversity of habitats and
associated recreational opportunities offered by Alternative E better support LBL's recreational and education
goals.


Environmentally Preferable Alternative


Because of LBL's goals of recreation and environmental education, none of the alternatives would be environmentally
destructive and none of the alternatives would likely result in significant environmental impacts.
There are environmental differences among alternatives. Depending on the alternative, there could be greater or
lesser impacts on certain resources and certain species. For example, Alternative C would eliminate future commercial
timber harvesting and likely eventually result in an old growth forest. This would benefit species which prefer such
habitat such as some neotropical birds. However, those neotropical birds which favor early successional vegetation
would be adversely impacted. In contrast, Alternative B, which would allow the most timber harvesting, would result
in more early successional habitat and benefit game species, such as deer, that prefer such habitats.
Consequently, depending on the habitat or species one wants to enhance or foster, any one of the alternatives evaluated
in TVA's EIS could be characterized as environmentally preferable.


Environmental Consequences and Commitments


In choosing Alternative E, all practical means to avoid or minimize environmental harm have been adopted. Site-specific
environmental reviews will be conducted prior to implementation of natural resource management actions that could
potentially impact the environment. Typically, mitigation will be accomplished by avoiding sensitive areas, changes
in intensity or method of management, or providing off-setting resource enhancement or replacement at other localities.
Common mitigation measures include silvicultural and agricultural BMPs to ensure that minimal amounts of soil and
nutrients enter any water course. Other mitigation measures include archaeological and historic surveys, use of
integrated pest management techniques, and implementation of visual quality zones. Wildlife management mitigation
includes bat management zones and eagle nest management zones. To address the issues of fragmentation and biological
diversity, large blocks of biosphere reserve core acreage are an integral part of Alternative E.
The results of implementing Alternative E will be continuously monitored to determine if management objectives
are being achieved. The results of forest and open land management activities will be monitored through the use of
forest inventories, logging inspections, annual mast surveys, and use of gypsy moth traps among other activities.
Management impacts on wildlife are monitored through periodic surveys of bats, breeding and wintering birds, eagles,
grouse, turkeys, and deer, as well as through hunter harvest data and wildlife disease surveillance activities.
Water and soil will also be monitored through testing and survey activities.
Innovative natural resource management is crucial to the fulfillment of LBL's mission and to TVA's role in environmental
leadership. TVA believes this plan will further the recreation and environmental education mission of LBL. At the
same time, this plan will maintain and enhance a nationally significant tract of public land in western Kentucky and
Tennessee.

Chrysler Corporation; Decision on 
Petition for Determination of Inconsequential 
Noncompliance 


Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler) of Auburn Hills, Michigan, determined that some of its vehicles failed to comply
with the outside mirror requirements of 49 CFR 571.111, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 111, ``Rearview
Mirrors,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Chrysler
also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. 

Notice of receipt of the petition was published on May 17, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 25699).
This notice grants Chrysler's petition with respect to some of the noncomplying motor vehicles and denies it with
respect to the remainder. 

Paragraph S7.1 of FMVSS No. 111 requires that trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds
have outside mirrors of unit magnification. 

During the 1989 through early-1994 model years, Chrysler manufactured an estimated total of 26,700 Dodge Ram 350
and 3500 pickup trucks and cab/chassis with convex, passenger-side, outside, rearview mirrors. 

Chrysler supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following (Chrysler also submitted
two figures which compared the fields of view of the noncompliant mirrors to two types of compliant mirrors. This material
is available in the NHTSA docket):


 


(1) The affected vehicles are also equipped with a driver side outside rear view mirror of unit magnification and,
except for the less than 100 cab/chassis models, an inside rear view mirror of unit magnification. 
(2) The installed 6
'
'  x  9
'
' convex passenger side mirror meets all requirements of S5 of FMVSS 111 [passenger car requirements], and
provides increased field of view capability when compared to the same size mirror of unit magnification or the optional
10
'
'  x  7
'
' unit magnification mirror. 

(3) Other than the passenger side mirror being convex rather than unit magnification, the rear view mirror system
on the affected vehicles meets or exceeds all performance and location requirements of FMVSS 111. The system capability
is adequate in all regards, specifically including provision for both overall system and passenger side field of
view. 
(4) Chrysler is not aware of any owner complaints, field reports or allegations of hazardous circumstances relating
to performance of the passenger side mirror on the affected vehicles. 
(5) The subject condition occurred as the result of the upgrading of a model for the 1989 model year to more than 10,000
pounds GVWR. That model for prior model years had been equipped with a convex passenger side mirror and unit magnification
driver side and inside rear view mirrors. The same mirror system was carried over on the vehicles for which the GVWR
was upgraded. Rear view adequacy of the convex mirror was not affected by the GVWR increase, and the need to instead
release a unit magnification mirror for compliance to the FMVSS 111 requirement at the upgraded GVWR was inadvertently
overlooked at the time and thereafter. 
(6) From a practical vehicle operation and motor vehicle safety standpoint, the mirror system which fully complied
to all FMVSS 111 requirements on earlier model year vehicles was equivalently effective and capable on the upgraded
GVWR vehicles. 
(7) Existence of the variance was detected during an engineering analysis resulting from a question of mirror size
adequacy on certain 1994 subject models. Size was determined to not be a concern, but the analysis uncovered the convex
mirror issue. Chrysler then took immediate, expedited action to correct the condition by specifying and installing
the optional 10
'
'  x  7
'
' unit magnification mirrors on affected vehicles.


 


Chrysler summarized its rationale for granting its petition with the following. 





Existence of the subject condition was totally inadvertent and not a deliberate attempt to evade Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard requirements. Therefore, in spite of good faith and due care efforts by Chrysler, some vehicles with
a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds were manufactured and shipped with a convex passenger side outside rear view mirror.
Upon discovery of the condition, Chrysler took immediate action to correct it in production and minimize the number
of vehicles produced with the convex mirror.


 


No comments were received on the petition. 
NHTSA has reviewed FMVSS No. 111 and Chrysler's arguments. The reason that convex magnification mirrors are permitted
for passenger side mirrors on vehicles whose GVWR is less than 10,000 pounds and not for heavier vehicles is that when
a vehicle is very large it is important for its operator to be able to look in the mirrors to see the vehicle and its immediate
surroundings when in motion. For example, if an operator is attempting to back a longer vehicle into a confined space,
a mirror of unit magnification will give a view which is undistorted, thus reducing the chances that the vehicle will
collide with anything in its path due to an error in perception by the operator. A convex mirror yields a slightly distorted
perspective of the surroundings in order to obtain a larger field of view. This distortion could produce adverse effects
if the vehicle is very long. 

Chrysler stated that the rearview adequacy of the convex mirrors was not affected by the upgrade in GVWR. This change
consisted of adding an extra wheel to the rear axle on each side of the vehicle in order to give it a greater load capacity.
While this does increase the width of the vehicle to 93 inches, the modification adds nothing to the length of the truck,
and should not affect the ability of the operator to judge the driving environment to the rear and side of the truck.
NHTSA has concluded, therefore, that safety does not require that the vehicles be refitted with a convex mirror on
the passenger side. However, this conclusion applies to the completed vehicles only. With respect to the 90 cab/chassis
that have been produced with the noncompliant mirror, NHTSA notes that these incomplete vehicles could have a number
of types of bodies added by a final stage manufacturer, such as ambulance, cargo compartment, and cherry picker. Because
of the variance in possible equipment which could be added to the chassis, there is no way to assess the effect on safety
of the noncompliance on the completed vehicle. Because these vehicles could be completed in a way which could significantly
obstruct a vehicle operator's view, it is impossible to decide that the noncompliance is inconsequential with respect
to them, and NHTSA believes that they should be equipped with a unit magnification mirror as the standard requires.

In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Chrysler has met its burden of persuasion with
respect to the 26,610 completed pickup trucks described in its petition, and that the noncompliance of these vehicles
with FMVSS No. 111 is inconsequential as it relates to safety. Accordingly, with respect to the completed pickup trucks,
the Administrator exempts Chrysler from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements
of 49 U.S.C. 30120. The Administrator has further decided that Chrysler has not met its burden of persuasion with respect
to the 90 cab/chassis incomplete vehicles described in the petition, and denies Chrysler's petition with respect
to these motor vehicles.

<DOCTITLE>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance </DOCTITLE>


The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company (Uniroyal) of Greenville, South Carolina, determined that some of its tires failed
to comply with 49 CFR 571.109, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 109, ``New Pneumatic Tires,'' and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Uniroyal also petitioned
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_Motor Vehicle Safety on the
basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 19, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 36832).
This notice grants Uniroyal's petition. 
Paragraph S4.3.3(b) of FMVSS No. 109 specifies that each tire be labeled with an identification number, the last three
digits of which represent the week and year of manufacture. 
During the period of the 17th through the 20th week of 1994, Uniroyal manufactured approximately 2,800 P175/70R13
MOTOMASTER LE tires with an incorrect week and year of manufacture contained in the tire identification number. The
last three digits in the identification numbers on the subject tires are incorrectly marked ``167,'' ``168,'' ``169,''
and ``120.'' The last three digits in the identification numbers for these tires should be ``174,'' ``184,'' ``194,''
and ``204'' signifying the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th weeks of 1994. All tires are sold only in the replacement market.

Uniroyal supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:




[Uniroyal does] not believe that this error will impact motor vehicle safety since only the week and year of manufacture
is incorrect. 
Uniroyal offered further rationale in its Part 573 Report. 
The dates marked on these tires could be interpreted as the year 1987 through 1990 or 1997 through 2000. This tire line
was introduced during the fourth quarter of 1992; therefore, there would not be pre-existent tires with these numbers.
In the event a recall is necessary prior to the week and year (years 1997 through 2000) marked on these tires, there will
be no tires that were actually manufactured during these weeks. If it is necessary to recall these tires during or after
the weeks marked, the recall population would comprise both the mismarked and properly marked tires.




No comments were received on the petition. 


NHTSA has reviewed FMVSS No. 109 and the petitioner's arguments. The primary purpose that the identification number
serves is to facilitate identification of tires that are the subject of notification and remedy campaigns. The erroneous
date code marking does not affect the ability to identify the tires in the event a campaign is conducted either before
or after the erroneously indicated manufacture date. If a recall campaign is required on the tires before the 16th
week of 1997, their date code, like any tire's conforming date code, permits instant identification of a tire in the
recall population. Should a campaign be required on tires of this tire line manufactured during the 16th weeks of 1997,
1998, and 1999, and the 12th week of 2000, or on the tires in question, the petitioner will have to campaign both sets
of tires, compliant tires as well as noncompliant ones, but this is a burden to be borne by the petitioner and does not
affect safety in a negative way. 
In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Uniroyal has met its burden of persuasion and
that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, the Administrator
exempts Uniroyal from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118, and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C.
30120.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_request for proposals. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Executive Office of the United States Information Service (USIS) at the American Embassy in Brasilia announces
an open competition for an assistance award. Public or private non-profit organizations meeting the provisions
described in IRS regulation 501(c)(3) may apply to plan and conduct a three-week seminar in English-language teaching
and American culture for approximately 30 Brazilian Binational Center teachers selected by USIS.




Overall grant making authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act
of 1961, Public Law 87-256, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act. The purpose of the Act is ``to enable
the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the
people of other countries * * *; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating
the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other
nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic and peaceful relations
between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' The funding authority for the program cited above
is provided through Reorganization Plan No. 2 of March 1978, E.O. 12048 dated March 27, 1978 and the Federal Grants
and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-224). 

Programs and projects must conform with Agency requirements and guidelines outlined herein. USIS projects and programs
are subject to the availability of funds.




ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIS concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number USIS/BSB-94-001.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced
and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted
in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion, geographic
location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the
advancement of this principle. 




Overview



Participants should receive advanced training in EFL: course and curriculum design, teacher training and management
skills, evalution and testing, with an intensive American Studies component. Special emphasis should be placed
on incorporating American Studies materials into an intercultural curriculum. Since this will be the first U.S.
experience for many of the participants, the program should introduce the participants to U.S. life, institutions,
values, and culture through classes, field trips, contacts with Americans, and community activities. The program
should maintain a relative balance among discussion sessions, workshops, and practical experience and promote
interaction among the participants. The project should also include an individual research project for each participant.


Approximately 30 Brazilian nationals who are full time employees at a Binational Center in Brazil will participate
in this program. Each participant is nominated by his/her institution for final selection by United States Information
Service (USIS). Participants either teach English as a Foreign Language, administer English or American Studies
programs, or provide teacher training in either English or American Studies. Participants will come on ``B1-B2''
visas issued by U.S. Consular Officers at American Embassy or Consulates in Brazil. USIS Brasilia will provide the
university with biographical and professional data on each candidate. 

The proposal should specifically address the following technical requirements:



U.S. Pre-Program Activities 



After receiving the final participant list, the university is expected to do the following: send USIS a pre-departure
information packet containing welcome and general information with practical suggestions for preparing the participants
for their stay at the university. The participants will arrive directly at the program site from their home cities.
The university program staff will be expected to make arrangements to have participants met upon arrival at the airport
nearest the university campus. A substantive orientation should be provided shortly after all the participants'
arrival at the university. The purpose of the orientation is to provide detailed information concerning the program,
university, community, etc. It should also acquaint participants with one another, the university program, and
the administrative staff. During this orientation a brief needs assessment is to be conducted to determine individual
learning needs and to identify the topic of the individual research project. The Institute Director should be prepared
to adjust program content, emphasis, and schedule as necessary to respond to participants' concerns.

The Educational Development


The educational development program should be a non-credit, intensive program of approximately 40 hours a week designed
to meet the stated program objectives through interactive lectures and discussions, workshops, and hands-on learning
experiences using university and community resources and opportunities. This course should not only emphasize
EFL teaching skills, teacher training and management skills, but also American culture and most importantly, how
to integrate the teaching of American culture in EFL classrooms. The curriculum should be designed to challenge the
participants to grow professionally. In addition, it should provide them with practical, hands-on learn-by-doing
experiences. The students should receive materials that they can immediately adapt to their BNC classes in Brazil.
Time should be allowed for students informally to pursue topics of personal interest. 
The Brazilian teaches participating in this program are among the best English teachers in Brazil. Most already have
a highly developed background in EFL based on years of teaching experience and exposure to materials and specialists
from the U.S. Thus, the entire program should reflect the high academic level, sophistication and professional development
of the participants.
Proposal should contain evidence of on-going evaluation and ability to make program adjustments, as well as evaluation
of the entire program.


The Cultural Enrichment Program


The two goals of the Cultural Enrichment Program are to: 1) strengthen the participants' knowledge of U.S. life and
culture through carefully designed interactive classes and community cultural activities and 2) provide an insight
into the use of ``cultural material'' in the classroom. The relationship between language and culture should be explored.
The cultural component of the program should allow students to explore the variety of American culture in both small
towns and larger cities, experience the richness of the visual and performing arts in the U.S., and interact with local
citizens.


Program Administration


All Institute programming and administrative logistics, the management of the Educational Development Program
and the Cultural Enrichment Program, local transportation, on-site university arrangements (including housing,
host-families, ordering and shipping of educational materials, general program support, etc.) and maintaining
current information regarding Internal Revenue Service regulations will be the responsibility of the Institute
grantee.
Participants should be housed in the same facility, preferably a modern dormitory with no more than two persons to
a room, adequately climate-controlled for the area and sufficient bathroom facilities. Three hot meals a day must
be provided. Extra-curricular activities such as field trips, Fourth of July celebrations, brief homestays and
other social and recreational activities should be provided. Each participant will arrive with valid U.S. health
insurance. Describe the available health and/or local health care system and plan to provide health care access.
Transportation to and from the airport and local transportation between the cultural activities must be provided.


Timing


Grant will begin May 15, 1995. Note: the participants will arrive in July, 1995. The grant start date allows for time
to prepare for the students' arrival. No funds may be expended until the grant agreement is signed.


Goals


The goals of the program include providing an overview of the state of the art of American EFL, identifying sources
of information for materials and curriculum development, and designing a challenging individualized academic
program for each participant which will promote an increased understanding of U.S. culture and society.


Funding


This project is a cost-share program with USIS paying for the course curriculum, tuition, faculty costs and course
materials. Participants pay their international travel and Binational Centers cover their meals and lodging.


Proposed Budget


A comprehensive line-item budget to include academic program and administrative fees, transportation, course
fees, materials, fees for meals and lodging and cultural activities must be submitted with the proposal by the application
deadline.

Applicants must submit a comprehensive budget for the entire program. There must be a summary budget as well as a break-down
reflecting both the administrative budget and the program budget. For better understanding or further clarification,
applicants may provide separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location, or activity in order to
facilitate USIS decisions on funding. Allowable costs for the program include the following:



(1) Academic Fees
(2) Administrative Costs
(3) Materials
(4) Course Fees
(5) Transportation
(6) Meals for Participants

Notice of Funding Availability for FY 1994; Invitation for Applications: Designated Housing for Disabled Families




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 for public housing development and major reconstruction
of obsolete public housing (MROP) activities designated for disabled families; invitation for applications. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCD Act of 1992) requires the Department to set aside
not less than 5 percent of amounts approved for public housing development and MROP activities in the FY 1993 and 1994
appropriations acts for designated housing for disabled families. Section 622 of the 1992 Act amends section 7 of
the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (USHA), and sets forth the requirements for designating housing for elderly families,
disabled families, and elderly 

and 

disabled families. (The final rule to implement the provisions of section 7 of the USHA was published on April 13, 1994.)
These set-asides are to be used only for the costs of development of, or MROP activities in connection with, housing
designated for occupancy under section 7. The competition for these set-aside funds will be based upon (1) the need
of the PHA for assistance (taking into consideration the allocation plan submitted), and (2) the extent to which the
projects/buildings meet the requirements of section 7(e) (i.e., the allocation and supportive service plans).
Note: Pursuant to section 624(B) of the HCD Act of 1992, no building selected by the PHA for designated housing for disabled
families under this NOFA may contain more than 25 units unless the applicant demonstrates a need for a building with
more than 25 units that cannot otherwise be met by a building with 25 units or less. Designation of a portion of a project
does not require that the buildings, floors or units be contiguous; PHAs are encouraged to place units in the most integrated
setting possible. In general, HUD will approve designated projects for disabled families only if there is a clear
demonstration that there is both a need and a demand by disabled families for such designation. 


Attached as Appendices A and B to this NOFA are the 1994 NOFA for Public Housing Development (published on May 24, 1994)
and the NOFA for 1993 and 1994 MROP activities (published on May 20, 1994). The requirements set forth in these NOFAs
that are applicable to public housing development and MROP activities apply to designated housing for disabled families
unless otherwise indicated in this NOFA. 
This NOFA announces the availability of the set-asides for public housing development and/or MROP activities applications
for designated housing for disabled families pursuant to section 7 of the USHA. The objective of development/MROP
activities funding for designated housing for disabled families is to assist PHAs to meet the goals set forth in their
allocation plans. 
A PHA's project(s) for disabled families must be designated before the development/MROP applications can be selected
for funding under this NOFA. Thus, the PHA must have an approved allocation plan that includes the designated project
as a housing resource. The PHA also must have an approved supportive service plan for the project(s) that has been designated
for disabled families. 
Allocation plans (including those with supportive service plans) may be submitted at any time. However, if a PHA anticipates
responding to this NOFA, it should submit its allocation plan and supportive service plan in sufficient time for them
to be approved before the PHA files its development/MROP application. 
This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction 


A. Authority 


Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); sec. 7(d) of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)); and sections 622 and 624 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992). 
Public housing development regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 941, and the designated housing final rule was
published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17652). The rule will be codified at 24 CFR part 945 (``Designated Housing'' regulations).



B. Fund Availability 


The HCD Act of 1992 required the Department to set aside not less than 5 percent of public housing development and MROP
activities amounts approved in the FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations acts for designated housing for disabled families.
Accordingly, $20 million was set aside in FY 1993 and a maximum of $21.78 million was set aside in FY 1994 for public housing
development; a maximum of $8.96 million was set aside from the FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations for MROP activities.
Thus, a maximum of $50.74 million may be made available under this NOFA. 


C. Fund Assignments 


Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated
on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts retained in a Headquarters Reserve and (b) appropriations determined
incapable of geographic allocation. Since the purpose of the allocation is to encourage PHAs to designate units for
occupancy by disabled families and the extent of interest is not predicable by formula, the Department does not intend
to fair share these funds. This determination was made on the basis of statutory set-aside, pursuant to 24 CFR 791.403(b)(1)(ii)(C).



II. Regulations and NOFA Requirements 


A. Conformity 


While conformity with 24 CFR part 941 is required, this funding effort is also subject to the additional specific requirements,
consistent with the part 941 regulations, that are set forth in this NOFA, the Designated Housing final rule (59 FR
17652), and the FSS interim and final regulations published on May 27, 1993 at 58 FR 30858 and 58 FR 30906, respectively,
codified at 24 CFR part 962. Applicants also should consult Handbook 7417.1 REV-1. 
A PHA preparing an application for public housing development or MROP activities for designated housing for disabled
families must (1) review Appendices A and B to this NOFA for requirements pertaining to the application process, threshold
approvability, Field Office processing, rating panel and criteria, checklist, and (2) follow the applicable instructions.

In addition to the requirements set forth in Appendices A and B, the following provisions are applicable to applicants:

1. Applications may be submitted to the HUD Field Office anytime after publication of this NOFA, as provided in the
``Application Submission'' section of this NOFA.

<DOCNO> FR941213-2-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. The PHA application cover letter must indicate the date the PHA's allocation and supportive services plans for
housing for disabled families have been or will be submitted to the Field Office for approval. If the allocation and
supportive service plans have not been filed, the Field Office shall advise the PHA that the development/MROP activities
application cannot be approved unless the plans are approved. 
3. Applications will be determined approvable if they successfully pass the minimum approvable score of 182 points
for development applications and 140 points for MROP applications. Section 624 requires that applications be selected
competitively based on (1) the PHA's need for funds to meet the goals expressed in its allocation plan; and (2) the extent
to which applications meet the requirements of 24 CFR part 945 (which contains the Designated Housing regulations).

Field Offices will prepare analyses of allocation and supportive service plans and of applications by furnishing
narrative responses to the following items: 
a. Need of the PHA for assistance, taking into account the number of disabled families who are potential residents
of the project based on waiting lists, local surveys of accessible housing needs, the needs assessment (see 24 CFR
8.25), a housing survey, a survey of agencies providing services to persons with disabilities, the average length
of vacancy for accessible units and the length of time a disabled family has to wait for a dwelling unit. 
b. Extent that appropriate supportive services will be provided, indicating that prospective residents want the
supportive services, that the services are adequately designed to meet the needs of disabled residents, and the experience
of the service provider(s) in administering an effective service delivery program for disabled families. If residential
supervision is required, the Field Office shall indicate that a written commitment has been obtained for such service.

c. Field Office Reports. The Field Office Public Housing Division shall forward each approvable application to the
Headquarters Panel within two weeks of the end of the deficiency ``cure'' period. The Field Office report will include
the project number, total number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s), cost areas, funding required,
the metropolitan/ non-metropolitan designations for each application, and the rating score sheets; in addition,
the report is to describe how the application supports the PHA allocation and supportive service plans, and whether
the PHA intends to develop the housing for disabled families on scattered sites or in a manner designed to obtain the
most integrated setting possible. 
4. Approvable applications will be referred to the Headquarters Review Panel, which will be convened on an ad hoc basis.
This Panel will be comprised of Headquarters staff and will retain the same individuals, to the extent possible, each
time the Panel convenes to ensure continuity. The Headquarters Review Panel will review and rank applications based
on Field Office rating score sheets, analyses, comments and recommendations. The Assistant Secretary will select
applications based on the Headquarters Review Panel's rankings and recommendations, up to the amounts available
under the two set asides. 


B. Rating Criteria 


1. 

General. 

All threshold-approvable applications shall be rated by the Field Offices on the established rating criteria listed
in Appendices A and B, which still apply to corresponding designated public housing development and MROP activities
plus the additional rating criteria point factors listed as follows: 






The selection criteria specified in the attached appendices and this NOFA may not be added to or modified. 
2. 

Total Possible Points. 

The total possible points for designated public housing applications is 260; the total for designated MROP activities
is 200. 
3. 

Reservation of Funds and Partial Funding. 

See Appendices A and B to this NOFA for applicable provisions. 



III. Other Matters 


See Appendices A and B to this NOFA with regard to other matters; all provisions as stated in the ``Other Matters'' sections
of Appendices A and B apply to this NOFA, including the Finding of No Significant Impact.

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT 


Office of Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing 





Notice of Funding Availability for FY 1994; Invitation for Applications: Public Housing Development 




AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 

 



ACTION:

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 for public housing development; invitation for applications.



 




SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) to submit
applications for public housing development. Applications are limited to: 


(1) Replacements for demolition/disposition subject to section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA);

(2) Replacements for homeownership transfers under the HOPE I Program, and homeownership sales under section 5(h)
of the USHA; 
(3) Unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies,
as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation;
and housing in support of desegregation efforts; and 
(4) ``Other'' applications. 
All successful applicants will be required to participate in the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, unless
granted an exception. This NOFA also provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications.
The Department is also encouraging applicants to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative arrangements
with community-based entities to provide housing, and is encouraging PHAs to engage in ``mixed income'' development
(wherein public housing units are integrated within market-rate developments). This is being done by providing
additional points for such efforts (see sections III.E.5 and IV.E. of this NOFA). 
This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program.

I. Introduction 


A. Authority 


Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); and sec. 7(d) of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). 
Public housing development regulations are published at 24 CFR part 941; demolition/disposition regulations are
published at 24 CFR part 970; section 5(h) regulations are published at 24 CFR part 906. 
The interim and final regulations for the public housing FSS program were published on May 27, 1993, at 58 FR 30858,
and 58 FR 30906, respectively, and will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. (The FSS final rule simply adopts the FSS interim
rule as the FSS final regulations.) 
The Notice of Program Guidelines for the HOPE-1 program was published on January 14, 1992 at 57 FR 1522. The Catalog
of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.850. 


B. Fund Availability 


The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1994 (Pub.L. 103-124, approved October 28, 1993) (1994 Appropriations Act) makes available up to $598 million
of budget authority (grants) for public housing development/Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP)
under section 5(a)(2) of the USHA. Since some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from the recapture of prior
year obligations, the actual amount available may be less. At the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, the available
amount was $542,796,616, which included $149,534 in available carryover funds. As recaptures of funds within the
Annual Contributions account occur during the fiscal year, these amounts will be made available for allocation to
public housing development up to the fully appropriated amount, plus carryover. 
In accordance with section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102-550, approved
October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of appropriated funds (up to $29,900,000
depending on recaptures) for the development of housing designated for disabled families, and up to $119,200,000
(depending on recaptures) for activities involving MROP activities. Applications for designated housing for disabled
families and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs to be published by the Department. 
The use of funds for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the
amount appropriated for development or $150 million. One half of one percent of the appropriated amount (up to $2,990,000)
has been set aside for technical assistance and inspections. Units transferred or sold to residents under HOPE I or
section 5(h) are subject to replacement in accordance with section 304(g) of the USHA. Based on experience, the Department
will provide up to $76,059,534 for such replacements. The balance of funds will be fair shared. 
The following table illustrates the distribution of grant authority. 


 

C. Fund Assignments 


Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated
on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts identified as Headquarters Reserve and (b) amounts determined incapable
of geographic allocation. The amounts identified by category below are maximums. 


1. Headquarters Reserve 


Threshold-approvable applications for housing resulting from unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural
and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters;
housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts shall
be assigned Headquarters Reserve funding. (Headquarters Reserve amounts are limited in accordance with section
104 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub.L. 101-235, approved December
15, 1989), to five percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under the USHA and section 101 of the
HUD Act of 1965. Thus, Headquarters Reserve funding decisions will be made by Headquarters and may affect the distribution
of grant authority shown above.) 


2. Fair Share 


Depending on recaptures, up to $220 million will be fair shared to approve category 4 (``other'') applications. These
fair share funds will be distributed to Areas (formerly Regions) on the basis of the following fair share factors,
which reflect the most recent decennial census data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies,
amount of substandard housing, and other measurable conditions. 
Because of errors in FY 1993 in calculating category 4 scores under the June 28, 1993, NOFA (58 FR 34670) for the Laconia
Housing and Redevelopment Authority (LHRA) in New Hampshire and the Nahunta Housing Authority (NHA) in Georgia,
fair share funds in the amounts of $753,400 and $759,400, respectively, will be awarded from the fair share amounts
provided to the New England and Southeast Area before making FY 1994 selections, and assigned to the LHRA and NHA applications.
The correction of these errors shall not adversely affect their participation in the FY 1994 rating and ranking process.
If a new application is filed by the LHRA or NHA under this NOFA, they will be rated and ranked on the same basis as other
applications, as if no error had been made. Any unused assignments will be redistributed, proportional to need, among
remaining Areas with approvable unfunded ``other'' applications. 
Fair share and Headquarters Reserve funds are also subject to the requirement of section 213 of the HCD Act of 1974 that
not less than 20 percent nor more than 25 percent of the HUD aggregate program funds covered by the statute be allocated
for use in nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, public housing development fund allocations to select ``other'' applications
may be modified before assignment in order to ensure Departmental compliance with this statutory and regulatory
requirement (see 24 CFR 791.403(a)). 


 

3. Non-Fair Share 


Thirty percent of the appropriated amount, up to $150 million, will be made available for applications for replacement
housing subject to section 18 of the USHA. Up to $76,059,534 will be made available for approvable applications for
replacement units for HOPE 1 or section 5(h) homeownership transfers or sales. 


4. Remaining Balances 


Any residual funds not reserved under categories 1, 2, and 3 will be added to the funds to be fair shared for ``other''
approvable applications. 


D. Conformity to Regulations and NOFA Requirements 


While conformity with 24 CFR part 941 is required, this funding effort is also subject to the additional specific requirements,
consistent with the regulations, that are set forth in this NOFA. Applicants also should consult Handbook 7417.1
REV-1, the FY 1994 detailed Processing Notice, and the FSS interim and final regulations published on May 27,
1993 at 58 FR 30858 and 58 FR 30906, respectively, which will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. The selection criteria specified
in this NOFA may not be added to or modified. 


II. Application Process Overview 


A. General 


All applications shall be submitted to the appropriate Field Office by the application deadline date. The Field Office
shall screen each application for completeness and will provide the PHA a 14-day opportunity to furnish missing technical
information or exhibits, or to correct technical mistakes. Each application will then be subjected to a ``pass/fail''
threshold examination. Approvable category 1, 2, and 3 applications will be reported to Headquarters for further
action. 
Category 4 passing applications will be forwarded for rating to Rating Panel(s). One or more Rating Panels, comprised
of HUD Field representatives appointed by Headquarters, shall be convened for the purpose. Category 4 applications
will be rated by the Rating Panel(s) based on Field Office analyses. Headquarters will determine the funds required
to approve category 1, 2, and 3 applications and select category 4 applications based on Rating Panel ratings and recommendations.



B. Categories of Applications 


Each application must be for one of the following categories: 
1. Replacement units for demolition/disposition approvals, subject to section 18 of the USHA (Category 1) 
2. Replacement units for HOPE I or section 5(h) home-ownership transfers or sales (Category 2); 
3. Public housing to be funded from Headquarters Reserve (Category 3); or 
4. ``Other'' development applications intended to increase the public housing stock (Category 4). Category 4 applicants
are limited to no more than one application per locality. 


C. Application Approval 


1. Up to the available amount for category 1 applications (see Section I.B. of this NOFA) and all category 3 approvable
applications will be funded. 
2. Up to $76,059,534 will be made available for approvable category 2 applications. 
3. Category 4 (other) applications will be funded up to the fair share amounts for each Area. 
4. Funds not required for categories 1, 2, or 3 will be added to the funds to be fair shared for ``other'' approvable applications.



D. Disclosure of Information 


The Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) prohibits advance disclosure
of funding decisions (see 24 CFR part 4); civil penalties related to advance disclosure are set out in 24 CFR part 30.
Application approval/non-approval notifications shall not occur until the Congressional notification process
is completed. 


E. Records Retention 


Applications and materials related to applications (e.g., Field Office analyses, application scoring sheets,
and notifications of selection/non-selection) will be retained in the appropriate Field Office for five years,
and be available for public inspection in accordance with 24 CFR part 12. 


III. Application Requirements 


A. All Applicants 


Each application must specify the housing type (new construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition), development
method (conventional, turnkey, or acquisition), and community for which the project is proposed. No more than one
housing type, development method, and locality may be proposed for an application. Each application shall consist
of an original and two copies, and must include the following: 


1. Cover Letter 


The cover letter must identify the category of application (see Section II.B. of this NOFA for a description of the
categories; see also subparagraph 6 of Section III.A of this NOFA).

If it has not previously done so, the PHA must document that it is legally organized. A current General Certificate
(Form HUD 9009) must be submitted. 



4. Cooperation Agreement (Form HUD 52481) 



The PHA must document that the number of units requested, along with units in management and other units in development,
are covered by Cooperation Agreements. 



5. PHA Resolution In Support of the Application (Form HUD-52471) 



Under this resolution, the PHA agrees to comply with all requirements of 24 CFR part 941 (see also paragraph 6 of this
Section III.A). By executing the PHA Resolution, the PHA also certifies that it will comply with Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131) and the implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35. 



6. Front-end Funds 



If front-end funds are being requested, the PHA must so state in its cover letter; should the PHA desire the project
only if front-end funds can be approved, the PHA must so state. The Form HUD-52471 (PHA Resolution) must refer
to the request, and include Form HUD-52472 (Local Governing Body Resolution/Transcript of Proceedings) approving
the request. 



7. Drug-Free Workplace 



The PHA must submit the Certification for a Drug-Free Workplace (Form HUD-50070) in accordance with 24 CFR 24.630.




8. Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative Agreement (Form HUD-50071) 



In accordance with section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year
1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87, the PHA must certify
that no federally appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of the PHA for influencing or attempting
to influence an officer or employee of any agency, or a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal
contract, the making of any Federal grant or loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension,
continuation, renewal, amendment, or modifications of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.




9. Form SF-LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities 



Also in accordance with the Byrd Amendment and the regulations at 24 CFR part 87, the PHA must complete and submit Form
SF-LLL if funds other than federally appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid by or on behalf of the PHA
for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, or a member of Congress in connection
with the awarding of any Federal contract, the making of any Federal grant or loan, the entering into of any cooperative
agreement, and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modifications of any Federal contract, grant,
loan, or cooperative agreement. 



10. Disclosure of Government Assistance and Identity of Interested Parties (Form HUD 2880) 



The PHA must submit the Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report (Form HUD-2880) in accordance with
the requirements of 24 CFR part 12, subpart C. 



11. Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) 



Section 23 of the USHA requires PHAs that are awarded new public housing units to implement an FSS program. Applicants
must certify that they will comply with 24 CFR part 962, which requires successful applicants to initiate or expand
an FSS program for the number of families that equals the total number of units they have been awarded (unless otherwise
excepted). 



B. Applications for New Construction 



In accordance with section 6(h) of the USHA, new construction may be engaged in only if the PHA demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Secretary that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA determines the housing is needed
is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation in such neighborhood. Therefore, every application
for a new construction project (conventional or turnkey) must be accompanied by either the information described
in paragraphs B.1 and B.3 of this section, or, at the applicant's option, the information described in paragraphs
B.2 and B.3 of this section: 

1. A PHA comparison of the costs of new construction (in the neighborhood where the PHA proposes to construct the housing)
and the costs of acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation in the same neighborhood (including estimated
costs of lead-based paint testing and abatement); or 

2. A PHA certification, accompanied by supporting documentation, that there is insufficient existing housing in
the neighborhood to develop housing through acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation; 

and 

3. A statement that: 

(a) Although the application is for new construction, the PHA will accept acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation,
if HUD determines the PHA cost comparison or certification of insufficient housing does not support approval of new
construction; or 

(b) The application is for new construction only. (In any such case, if HUD cannot approve new construction under section
6(h) of the USHA, the application will be rejected.) 



C. Replacement Housing Applications 



1. Cover Letter 



For both category 1 and category 2 applications, the cover letter must state whether the demo/dispo or transfer/sale
application (to demolish/dispose of units, or to transfer/sell units) (hereinafter referred to as the ``underlying
application'') has been approved; the date of approval; the project number and the name of the project being replaced;
and whether it is being replaced in whole or in part. If the underlying application was not approved at the time the replacement
housing application is filed, the cover letter must state the date the underlying application was submitted for consideration.
Category 1 or 2 applications will not be funded unless the underlying application is approved by the time funding selections
are made. 



2. Section 5(j) Certification 



The PHA must certify that the units requested are specifically required in FY 1994 either to meet the one-for-one replacement
requirement of section 18 of the USHA to replace public housing demolition/disposition; or to meet the requirements
of section 304(g) of the USHA to replace existing public housing approved in FY 1994 or earlier for homeownership transfer
under HOPE 1, or for sale under section 5(h) of the USHA. 



3. Replacement Application Under Section 18 



A PHA submitting a replacement housing application under section 18 (category 1) must demonstrate that the replacement
units, alone or together with other identified replacement units: 

a. Will implement the PHA's Replacement Housing Plan submitted and approved under 24 CFR 970.11; 

b. Are for no fewer units (or portion thereof approved by HUD) than the number of units to be demolished or disposed of;
and 

c. Will house at least the same number of individuals and families that could be served by the housing to be demolished
or disposed. 



D. Applications for Units to be Funded From Headquarters Reserve 



1. Cover Letter



A PHA submitting a category 3 application shall identify the purpose of the application (see Section I.C.1 of this
NOFA). 



2. Section 5(j) Certification 



The PHA must certify that the units requested are required to comply with court orders or directions of the Secretary.
Court orders must be identified. 



E. ``Other'' Applications 



Applicants are encouraged to review the rating criteria (IV.E.) to ensure rating factors have been addressed in the
application. ``Curable technical deficiencies'' (Section IV.B. of this NOFA) relate only to items that would not
improve the substantive quality of applications relative to rating factors. A PHA may file only one application per
locality under this category. 



1. Cover Letter 



Applicants for ``other'' public housing development units (category 4), must state whether they will accept fewer
units than applied for. Refusal to accept fewer units may result in an application not being selected if funds are not
sufficient for the full number of units. 



2. Section 5(j) Certification 



The PHA must certify to one of the following, pursuant to section 5(j) of the USHA (select E.2.a or E.2.b.): 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941213-2-00098 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


a. The units requested (limited to 100 or fewer) are needed for family housing to satisfy demands not being met by the
section 8 existing or voucher rental assistance programs; or 



b. 85 percent of the PHA's dwelling units (select (1), (2), or (3)): 



(1) Are maintained in substantial compliance with the section 8 housing quality standards (24 CFR 882.109); or 



(2) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which funding has been awarded; or 



(3) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted
in good faith under section 14 of the USHA (or a comparable State or local government program), and that there is a reasonable
expectation, as determined in writing by HUD, that such application would be approvable; or will be so maintained
upon completion of modernization under the Comprehensive Grant program. 




3. Funding Preference in Accordance With Section 6(p) 





Section 6(p) of the USHA requires HUD to provide a funding preference for applications in areas with an inadequate
supply of housing for use by low-income families (i.e., a ``tight'' housing rental market). The implementation of
this preference shall be in accordance with the process described in Section V.A.2 of this NOFA. 



a. The PHA must furnish data relative to rental vacancy rates in the market area where the project is proposed. This
data should include a description of the data sources and methods used to obtain survey information. (It is recommended
that PHAs consult with local community development agencies relative to their housing needs before submitting applications
under this NOFA, since most of these agencies will have participated in the development of a Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (CHAS).) 



b. Factors such as the following will provide evidence of conditions which, when taken together, will demonstrate
a pattern of inadequate supply (generally, no one factor, taken alone, is conclusive); 



(1) The current rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level (typically six percent or lower) which results in housing
not being available for families seeking rental units (unless the housing market area is not growing and, as a result,
is experiencing low levels of demand); 



(2) The annual production of rental housing units is insufficient to meet the demand arising from the increase in households,
or, where there is little or no growth, is insufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory;




(3) The shortage of housing is resulting in rent increases exceeding those increases commensurate with rental housing
operating costs; and 



(4) A significant number or proportion of section 8 certificate/voucher holders are unable to find adequate housing
because of the shortage of rental housing, as evidenced by PHA data showing a lower-than-average percentage of units
under lease and a longer-than-average time required to find units (typically, less than 85 percent lease up within
60 days). 




4. Documentation To Demonstrate Need 





The PHA must submit documentation, such as waiting list description or PHA vacancy rate data, to demonstrate need
for the proposed public housing, to assist the HUD Field Office in its determination of need and market in accordance
with Section IV.C.8.b of this NOFA. 




5. Additional Rating Points





Category 4 (other) applications may obtain additional rating points (see Section IV.E.8 of this NOFA) if the PHA furnishes
additional data regarding any of the following: 



a. ``Partnerships.'' PHAs are encouraged to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative or contractual arrangements
with community-based entities for the purpose of developing housing so that the housing fits into the community and
is seen as an integral part of it. ``Community-based entities'' include private non-profit or for-profit entities
with experience in the development of low and moderate income housing, or that are skilled in the delivery of services
to families who are residents of public housing. ``Cooperative or contractual arrangements'' include those that
will facilitate development (including management of the units) that will enhance the long-term viability of the
development; and those arrangements that the PHA has for the delivery of services (such as child care, education,
and economic opportunities) made available to residents of public housing. The PHA should indicate who the entity
(or entities) are, the qualifications of the entity and its principals, and the role they play or will play in the development,
management, or service delivery process which will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community.
Such cooperative arrangements require substantive involvement by the non-PHA partner in at least one of the following
areas: design, management, site selection, representation to the community, or service delivery. If the PHA proposes
to use public housing development funds to pay an entity for its role in the arrangement, a justification for sole-source
contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) must be provided for consideration by HUD. With respect to the delivery
of services, costs for such services are not eligible to be paid from public housing development funds. The PHA must
also certify that its selection of the cooperative entity (or entities) was in compliance with State and local law.
[Note: If State/local procurement requirements cannot be complied with before the application deadline date, the
PHA may submit a statement with its application indicating that it is in the processing of arranging such a cooperative
relationship and certifying that such a relationship will comply with State and local law. In such case, within 60
days of the date of publication of this NOFA,

 the PHA must: (1) identify the entity(ies) proposed to be part of the cooperative relationship; (2) describe the qualifications
of the entity(ies) and of its principals, and the role they will play in the development, management, or service delivery
process that will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community; (3) submit a justification for sole
source contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) (if the PHA proposes to use public housing development funds
to pay the entity for its role in the cooperative arrangement), and a certification that the selection of the entity(ies)
was in compliance with State and local law.] 



b. Mixed Income Development. In order to encourage the development of public housing in metropolitan areas that will
be less identifiable as public housing, PHAs are encouraged to develop units whereby public housing would be mixed
with market-rate dwellings so that they are indistinguishable. Specifically, in order to receive points for this
factor, a PHA must propose to acquire units in developments where the units require incomes that, on average, are at
or above 80 percent of median, or to acquire sites in developments where the units require incomes that, on average,
are at or above 80 percent of median. 



c. Past compliance with section 3. The PHA may submit evidence that over the past five years it has met any commitments
made under the provisions of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C., 1701u), as amended
from time to time, and the implementing regulations for section 3 at 24 CFR part 135. If the PHA does not have development
experience, it may instead submit evidence related to such experience with the modernization program. 



d. Proposed compliance with section 3. The PHA may submit its goals for complying with Section 3 employment and training
with regards to the public housing development application. 



e. Support for local initiatives. If the application proposes a project which, as evidenced by a letter from local
officials, actively supports an area of local initiative such as a Community Development Block Grant, urban revitalization,
Enterprise Zone, or other similar local activity, or includes a commitment for a donation to the project in the event
it is selected for funding, the PHA should describe the activity. 



f. Resident Initiatives. If the PHA is working with residents to establish and/or foster resident empowerment activities
(such as establishing Resident Corporations or Resident Management Corporations), the activities should be described.

F. Ineligible Applications 





Applications for intermediate care facilities and nursing homes may not be approved under this NOFA. Applications
for housing designated for the disabled and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs and may not be
applied for under this NOFA. 




IV. Field Office Processing of Applications 




A. Submission of Applications 





The cover letter of all applications must be marked with the date and time of receipt, along with the initials of the
Field Office employee accepting the application. Applications received after the date and time specified at the
beginning of this NOFA will be returned to the applicant. The PHA should obtain a ``Return receipt'' or similar evidence
of delivery when applications are delivered via other means (U.S. Mail, private mailing firms, etc.). 



B. Initial Screening





1. Immediately after the deadline for receipt of applications, the Field Office will screen each application to determine
whether all information and exhibits have been submitted. 



a. If any application lacks any technical information or exhibit, or contains a technical mistake, the PHA will be
advised in writing and will have 14 calendar days from the date of the issuance of HUD's notification to deliver the
missing or corrected information or documentation to the Field Office. 



b. Curable technical deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of a category
4 application, relative to the ranking factors. 



c. If Form HUD 52470 (Application) is missing, the PHA's application will be considered substantively incomplete,
and therefore ineligible for further processing. If other forms are missing, such as Form HUD 50070 (Drug Free Workplace
Certification) or if there is a technical mistake, such as no signature, or an unauthorized signatory on a submitted
form, the PHA will be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency. 



2. An application that does not meet the applicable threshold and NOFA requirements after the 14-day technical deficiency
period will be rejected from processing and determined to be unapprovable. 



3. Applications proposing housing in areas also served by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) are subject to coordination
with FmHA to assure that assisted housing resources to be provided are not duplicative. The State FmHA office shall
be advised that an application for public housing has been received and is being considered for funding, and be provided
an opportunity to comment on the application. 



4. The responsibility for submitting a complete application rests with the PHA. The failure of the Field Office to
identify and provide a notice of deficiency to the PHA shall not relieve the PHA of the consequences of failure to submit
a complete application. 




C. Application Threshold Approvability 





After initial screening and upon expiration of the deficiency ``cure'' period, complete applications will be examined
for threshold approvability. Applications that fail one or more of the threshold criteria will be rejected from processing
and determined to be unapprovable. All applications for public housing development funds must meet the following
thresholds to be determined approvable: 



1. The PHA may not have any litigation pending which would preclude approval of the application. The PHA must be legally
eligible to develop, own, and operate public housing under the USHA and have: 



a. Approved and current PHA organization documents; 



b. Local cooperation agreements to cover units under management, in development, and the units requested (Form HUD
52481), and any other required local authority; 



c. A properly executed and complete PHA Resolution (Form HUD 52471), referring to the need for front-end funding,
if requested, and a Local Governing Body Resolution (HUD 52472) which approves the request for front-end funds, if
front-end funds are requested. (Note: By executing the PHA Resolution, the PHA certifies that it will comply with
Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131) and the implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 35.
The PHA Resolution also certifies to the PHA's intent to comply with all requirements of 24 CFR part 941. These requirements
include: Nondiscrimination under the applicable civil rights laws; the requirements imposed by the Uniform Relocation
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655); the accessibility
requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 8; and section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701u), and HUD's
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 135.) 



2. The category of application is eligible under this NOFA (see Section II.B of this NOFA). 



3. If new construction (conventional or turnkey) has been applied for, the PHA has provided a cost comparison or a certification
with documentation (see Section III.B. of this NOFA), and has stated what is to be done with the application if new construction
is not approvable. 



4. No application shall be determined to be approvable if the PHA has failed to return excess advances received during
development or modernization, or amounts determined by HUD to constitute excess financing based on a HUD-approved
Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) or Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC), unless HUD has approved
a pay-back plan. 



5. There are no environmental factors, such as sewer moratoriums, precluding development in the requested locality.




6. The following certifications are included in the application and have been executed by the appropriate person(s):




a. Form HUD-50070, Drug-Free Workplace; 



b. Form HUD-50071, Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative Agreements; 



c. Form SF-LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, if applicable; 



d. Form HUD-2880, Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report; 



e. FSS certification; 



f. Section 5(j) certification appropriate to the category of application. 



7. The PHA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A PHA will be considered
to be in compliance if: 



a. As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil
rights laws unless the PHA is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct
the areas(s) of noncompliance; 



b. There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual,
unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s)
of noncompliance; 



c. There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations; 



d. There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the PHA by the Department of Justice; or 




e. There is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the PHA issued by the Secretary under section 810(g) of
the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400. 



8. For ``other'' applications only: 



a. The Field Office must determine that the PHA has or will have the capability to develop and manage the proposed housing.
The Field Office shall determine capability based upon the PHA's overall score under the Public Housing Management
Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901), the PHA's most recent fiscal audit, and outstanding HUD monitoring
findings. A PHA shall not be determined to lack administrative or development capability simply because it has no
recent experience in developing or managing public/assisted housing.

<DOCNO> FR941213-2-00100 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. The Field Office must determine that there is a need and a market for the proposed household type and bedroom sizes,
taking into consideration the documentation submitted by the PHA on housing supply and demonstration of need, any
local plans, and other assisted housing (e.g., HUD or FmHA) existing and proposed (including housing funded but not
completed). 



D. Threshold Approvable Applications



Applications in categories 1, 2, and 3 will be determined approvable if they successfully pass the threshold review.
Threshold-approvable applications in category 4 (``other'') will be reviewed and analyzed by the Field Office.




E. ``Other'' Development Applications



Threshold approvable ``Other'' applications will have points assigned by a Rating Panel(s) on the basis of Field
Office analysis and PHA documentation relating to the following criteria.



 



F. Field Office Reports



1. Category 1, 2, and 3 Applications



Each Field Office shall forward its lists (by category) of fair-share exempt threshold-approvable applications
to Headquarters within two weeks of the deficiency ``cure'' period. The lists shall include the project number, total
number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s), cost areas, funding required and the metropolitan/non-metropolitan
designations for each application. Category 1 and 2 applications shall also identify the underlying project and
its current status (e.g., approved (date), under review in Field Office, etc.). 



2. Category 4



All Field Office reports to Rating Panels on threshold-approvable ``other'' applications shall be submitted within
four weeks of the deficiency ``cure'' period and include the information described in F.1., above, the analysis of
each application, and Field Office recommendations for funding. 



V. Rating Panels 



A. Rating Panels 



1. General



The Rating Panel(s) shall ensure that all category 4 applications have been properly determined to be threshold-approvable.
The Rating Panel(s) shall compile data furnished by Field Offices for category 4 (other) applications, and rate each
application based on Field Office analyses, comments, and recommendations. 

A list of rated applications shall be forwarded to Headquarters, with copies of Field Office reviews and recommendations,
and justifications for Rating Panel rankings. Headquarters shall not modify ratings of category 4 (``other'') applications
unless a gross error has occurred. 

Examples of ``gross errors'' include, but are not limited to, errors in calculating the vacancy rate in the proposed
community, or assigning points for development/management experience based on a PHMAP score that was successfully
appealed, or simple errors of arithmetic.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941213-2-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941213-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Changes in ratings shall be fully documented, and a copy of the memorandum authorizing the change (and the basis thereof)
shall be sent to the Rating Panel and to the Field Office for inclusion in the file and be made available for public inspection.
Category 4 applications shall be approved within Areas, to the extent fair share funds are assigned, as follows: 



2. ``Tight Market'' Determination



Headquarters will separate ``other'' applications (category 4) on the basis of ``tight rental housing market''
and Rating Panel ratings and Headquarters rankings, and approve them (in the following order) to the extent fair share
funds are assigned to their respective Area: 

a. Applications within the same Area in tight rental housing markets which receive 80 or more rating points; 

b. All other applications in the same Area, in rank order, depending on ``metropolitan'' or ``non-metropolitan''
funding available. 



B. Reservation of Funds



Funds will be reserved in an amount equal to the total development cost limit for the number, structure type, and size
of units being approved, ``trended'' to take into consideration the anticipated cost of construction at the time
the construction/rehabilitation contract is expected to be executed; acquisition reservations will be trended
to take into account anticipated cost variations between fund reservation and Date of Full Availability (DOFA).
The trend shall be calculated by multiplying the project total development cost limit by 6 percent (1.06), rounded
to the nearest $50. No amendment funds will be available for these projects in the future. 



C. Partial Funding



Partial funding of highly ranked ``other'' applications within an Area may occur (so long as such projects are determined
viable and the PHA has indicated willingness to accept fewer units) to facilitate the funding in rank order of additional
applications for highly ranked projects. 



VI. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements_All Programs 



A. Submission Requirements



PHAs may use the following application checklist, which enumerates the submission requirements of Section III of
this NOFA.

B. Application Packets



Forms comprising the application package may be obtained from the HUD Field Office. 



VII. Other Matters 



A. Environmental Impact



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410. 



B. Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship
with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of
government. The NOFA will provide PHAs with funding for public housing development. 



C. Family Impact



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions
of this NOFA do not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being
within the meaning of the Order. To the extent that the funding provided through this NOFA results in additional or
improved housing, the effects on the family will be beneficial. 



D. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities: The Byrd Amendment



The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. (See Section II of this NOFA.) These authorities prohibit recipients
of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches
of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the
awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.




E. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 

HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in appendix
A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule.

F. Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act of 1989 



A final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 7, 1993, amended the definition of ``person'' to exclude from coverage a State or local government, or
the officer or employee of a State or local government or housing finance agency thereof who is engaged in the official
business of the State or local government. 

Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD).
This is not a toll-free number. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.




G. Prohibition Against Advance Disclosure of Funding Decisions 



Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons
not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation
implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the
making of funding decisions are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other
than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair
competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the
subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202)
708-3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) 



H. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 



HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 12 implement section 102 of the HUD Reform Act. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered
by HUD. The following requirements concerning documentation and public access disclosures are applicable to assistance
awarded under this NOFA. 



1. Documentation and Public Access 



HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 



2. Disclosures



HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT 



Office of Assistant Secretary for 
Public and Indian Housing 







Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for FY 1993 and 1994; 
Invitation for Applications: Public Housing Development_MROP Activities 





AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 






ACTION:

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 and FY 1994 for Public Housing Development_MROP Activities;
Invitation for Applications. 







SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1993 and 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs)
to submit development applications for MROP activities. Because the number of applications for FY 1993 funding which
received perfect scores was in excess of available funding (funding of all applications receiving a perfect score
of 90 would only have permitted funding at 40 percent of the amount requested), this NOFA withdraws the FY 1993 NOFA
published on September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47940). 



The FY 1993 funding is being combined and re-announced with the FY 1994 funding under this Public Housing Development_MROP
Activities NOFA (MROP Activities NOFA). 

All unfunded MROP activities applications submitted in response to the FY 1993 NOFA will be returned to the PHAs for
resubmission in response to this combined FY 1993 and FY 1994 NOFA. At the option of the PHA, an application may be amended
and resubmitted, or a new MROP activities application may be submitted. No other types of applications will be accepted
under this NOFA. 

A separate NOFA applicable to the public housing development program will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 

This MROP Activities NOFA provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications. 

This NOFA is NOT applicable to the Indian housing program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement: The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved
by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2577-0033, 2577-0036,
and 2577-0044. 



I. Introduction



A. Authority



Section 5 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437c); and sec. 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). Public housing development regulations are published at 24 CFR part 941. The
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.850.

B. Fund Availability



In accordance with the FY 1994 HUD Appropriations Act (Pub.L. 103-124, approved October 28, 1993), the Department
is making available, through this NOFA, up to $119.2 million of the FY 1994 public housing development funds for MROP
activities consistent with section 111 of the Housing and Community Development (HCD) Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102-550,
approved October 28, 1992). Because some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from recapture of prior year obligations,
a lesser amount may be available under this NOFA, unless actual recaptures during the current Fiscal Year return the
amount to the appropriated level. 

In addition, the $60 million of FY 1993 public housing development funds provided in the FY 1993 HUD Appropriations
Act (Pub.L. 102-389, approved October 6, 1992) for MROP activities consistent with section 111 of the HCD Act
of 1992, is also being made available.

3

 





Consistent with section 624 of the HCD Act of 1992, HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of the total of up
to $179.2 million (which provides up to $8,950,000 depending on recaptures) for MROP Activities for housing designated
for disabled families, which will be the subject of a separate NOFA to be published by the Department. 



C. Fund Assignments



Funding for MROP activities is provided for the reconstruction of existing public housing, the extent of which is
not predictable by formula. Therefore, the funds provided under this NOFA will not be fair-shared. This determination
was made on the basis of the exclusion of funds as incapable of geographic allocation pursuant to 24 CFR 791.403(b)
published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41426). 

Field Offices will ascertain threshold-approvability and, after Joint Review, send the threshold-approvable
applications to a review selection panel(s) comprised of representatives from various Field Offices (hereafter
referred to as ``panel(s)''). 

The panel(s) shall rate and rank the threshold-approvable applications based on the criteria in Section IV.E. of
this NOFA, and provide Headquarters with a list, in rank order, reflecting the ratings. The Department, in its discretion,
may choose to select or partially fund a lower-rated application in order to increase national geographic diversity,
and/or to increase the diversity of development types (high-rise buildings of five or more stories and those which
include only low-rise buildings). 



D. Eligibility



Applications for public housing development_MROP activities must be submitted by PHAs eligible for development
funding which have the required local cooperation and legal authority to develop, own and operate public housing
projects. 

PHAs eligible under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) (CIAP-eligible PHAs) and under the
Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) (CGP-eligible PHAs) may apply for these funds. CIAP and CGP are hereinafter referred
to as ``modernization.'' Applications will be determined eligible using the modernization procedures outlined
in Public Housing Modernization rule 24 CFR part 968, as amended by the interim rule for Public and Indian Housing,
Revised Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program, published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13916), (as modified by
this NOFA). 

Applications must meet the threshold approvability requirements in Section IV.B of this NOFA, including the following
requirements which must be addressed in the PHA's Narrative Statement accompanying its application, and will be
rated by a panel(s) on the Technical Review Factors listed in Section IV.E. of this NOFA. 

1. A project proposed for MROP activities must have long-term viability after reconstruction and the annual contributions
contract (ACC) for the project must remain in effect for 40 years. In determining viability, the PHA must have a comprehensive
plan (funded from other sources such as CIAP, CGP, donations, etc.) for the project for which the funds for MROP activities
are being requested. The comprehensive plan for the project may be part of the PHA's comprehensive plan for modernization.
The comprehensive plan must demonstrate a strategy which will assure that the entire development will be viable for
a minimum period of 20 years. This strategy may include, but not be limited to, an estimate of the required amount needed
for rehabilitation of the remaining portion of the development to the extent any additional rehabilitation is required;
sources of funding for the additional work; any proposed demolition/disposition that may be planned; and written
evidence of local government and resident support for the strategy. 

2. A proposed MROP activities project must be a rental (not homeownership) project. 


3. An ``obsolete project or building'' is one that has design or marketability problems that have resulted in: 
a. Current vacancies of more than 25 percent of the units available for occupancy; or 
b. (1) Estimated costs of the project (including any costs for lead-based paint abatement activities) that exceed
70 percent of the total current development cost limits for new construction of similar units in the area; and 
(2) The project or building has: 
(a) An occupancy density or a building height that is significantly in excess of that which prevails in the neighborhood;
or 
(b) A bedroom configuration that could be altered to better serve the needs of families seeking occupancy to public
housing; or 
(c) Significant security problems in and around the project; or 
(d) Significant physical deterioration or inefficient energy and utility systems. 
4. The deficiencies must be determined correctable under the CGP or the CIAP procedures (see 24 CFR part 968 and related
issuances), to ensure long-term viability (a useful life with full occupancy) of more than 20 years after completion
of reconstruction; the ACC for the project must remain in effect for 40 years. 
5. Existing projects which consist of more than one building may have MROP activities funding in any single year limited
to one or more (less than all) of a project's buildings. Where separate portions of an existing project receive MROP
funding in different fiscal years, each portion must be given a separate MROP project number and the funds reserved
must be sufficient to complete all of the reconstruction needed to make the portion viable; in such cases, the funds
for each MROP project must be kept separate and may not be commingled. 
6. A combination of MROP activities and modernization funds may be used within a project, but may not be used within
the same units (or buildings, as applicable). For example, if an existing project consists of low-rise, row, and elevator
buildings, an MROP activities project could be approved to include all or some of the row units, with the balance of
units included in a modernization project. MROP funds may, however, be used in conjunction with Urban Revitalization
Demonstration funds (HOPE VI) without limitation.

7. Management improvements are an eligible cost under MROP activities to the extent that such improvements are necessary
for the viability of the project (i.e., to maintain the physical improvements resulting from the proposed redesign,
reconstruction, or redevelopment MROP activities). 



E. Restrictions 



1. If partial demolition/disposition is required: 

a. A demolition/disposition application must have been approved before the MROP activities application may be approved;
or 

b. The application must have been submitted along with evidence of approval by the unit of general local government
in which the project is located. This approval may be obtained from the Chief Executive Officer. 

2. Conversion of units (by combining small units to make larger units or vice versa) must either be approved before
an MROP activities application involving conversion may be approved, or an application for said conversion must
have been submitted, and the cost of any conversion must be considered in the MROP activities application. 

3. Funding provided for MROP activities at a project may not be used for total demolition/disposition of that project,
but may be used for partial demolition/disposition if required to meet long-term viability; however, 75 percent
of the units in the project or portion of the project which comprises the MROP application must be reconstructed.2




II. Application Process Overview 



A. PHA Application



A PHA applying for development funds for MROP activities shall prepare a CIAP application, as modified by this NOFA.
The initial review process shall follow the CIAP procedures; however, once selected, the application shall be processed
under public housing development procedures. 



B. Application Processing



The Field Office will screen each application for completeness and will provide the PHA with a 14 calendar-day opportunity
to furnish any missing technical information or exhibits, or to correct technical mistakes. Each application will
then be subjected to a ``pass/fail'' threshold examination by the Field Office. Each passing application will be
rated as to the Technical Review Factors listed in Section IV.E. of this NOFA by a panel(s). 



C. Application Approval



Panels comprised of representatives from various Field Offices will prepare rankings based on the panels' ratings
and Headquarters will select applications for approval to the extent funds are available. 



D. Disclosure of Information



The Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) prohibits advance disclosure
of funding decisions. (See 24 CFR part 4.) Civil penalties related to advance disclosure are set out in 24 CFR part 30.
Application approval/non-approval notifications shall not occur until the Congressional notification process
is completed. (See Section VIII.F of this NOFA for more detailed information.) 



E. Records Retention



Applications and materials related to applications (e.g., application scoring sheets, and notifications of selection/non-selection)
will be retained in the appropriate Field Office for five years, and be available for public inspection in accordance
with 24 CFR part 12. (See Section VIII.G of this NOFA for more detailed information.) 



III. Application Requirements 



A. All Applicants



No more than one project (or portion of a project) may be proposed for MROP activities per application, although more
than one application may be submitted by a PHA. Each application shall consist of an original and two copies, and must
include the following: 

1. 

Cover letter.

 The cover letter must identify the project proposed for MROP activities by its original project number (e.g., WY 22-2),
and its total number of units (and buildings, if applicable). If fewer than the total number of units are being proposed,
the cover letter shall summarize the PHA's plans for the remaining units. If more than one application is submitted,
the cover letter must state the PHA's priorities for funding. The PHA must include a statement of whether the PHA will
accept funding for the reconstruction of fewer units. 

2. 

CIAP Application and Budget_Forms HUD 52822 and 52825.

 The application and budget forms must each be signed and dated and include the information as specified in the forms.
No more than one original project number shall be included in each application submission. 

3. 

Narrative Statement.

 The narrative statement must address each of the technical review factors under Section IV.E. of this NOFA, each of
the eligibility criteria under Section I.D. of this NOFA and each of the restriction criteria under Section I.E. of
this NOFA. 

4. 

Demolition/Disposition or Conversion of Units.

 If, as part of the MROP activities, the PHA intends to demolish/dispose (demo/dispo) of some of the units or to convert
units (combine small units to make larger ones, or vice versa), the PHA shall provide the date the demo/dispo or conversion
was approved by HUD or the date the demo/dispo or conversion application was submitted. If the demo/dispo application
has not yet been approved, the application for MROP activities that involves the demo/dispo of units must be accompanied
by evidence of approval by the unit of general local government in which the project is located (it can be provided by
the Chief Executive Officer). Development funds for MROP activities may not be used for total demo/dispo (see Section
I.E.3. of this NOFA). 

5. 

PHA Resolution In Support of the Application (Form HUD-52471).

 Under this resolution, the PHA agrees to comply with all requirements of 24 CFR part 941. These requirements include,

 The PHA must submit the Certification for a Drug-Free Workplace (Form HUD-50070) in accordance with 24 CFR 24.630.


8. 

Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative Agreements (Form HUD-50071).

 In accordance with section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year
1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the regulations at 24 CFR part 87, the PHA must certify that no federally
appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid, by or on behalf of the PHA for influencing or attempting to influence
an officer or employee of any agency, or a member of Congress in connection with the awarding of any Federal contract,
the making of any Federal grant or loan, the entering into of any cooperative agreement, and the extension, continuation,

10. 

Disclosure of Government Assistance and Identity of Interested Parties (Form HUD 2880).

 The PHA must submit the Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report (Form HUD-2880) in accordance with
the requirements of 24 CFR part 12, subpart C. 



IV. Field Office Processing of Applications 



A. Initial Screening 



1. Immediately after the deadline for receipt of applications, the Field Office will screen each application to determine
whether all information and exhibits have been submitted; no qualitative evaluation will be made at this time. 

a. If an application lacks any technical information or exhibit, or contains a technical mistake, the PHA will be advised
in writing and will have 14 calendar days from the date of the issuance of HUD's notification to deliver the missing
or corrected information or documentation to the Field Office. For example, the PHA Narrative Statement must address
each of the technical review factors under Section IV.E., the eligibility criteria under Section I.D. and the restriction
criteria under Section I.E. of this NOFA. 

b. Curable technical deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of the application,
relative to the ranking factors. 

c. If Forms HUD 52822 (Application) or HUD 52825 (Budget) are missing, the PHA's application will be considered substantively
incomplete, and therefore ineligible for further processing. However, if other forms [for example, Form HUD 50070
(Drug Free Workplace Certification), Form HUD 50071 (Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative
Agreements), Form SF LLL (Disclosure of Lobbying Activities), if applicable, or Form HUD 2880 (Application/ Recipient
Disclosure/Update Report)] are missing, or if there is a technical mistake, such as no signature or the wrong signature
on a submitted form, the PHA will be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency. 

2. The responsibility for submitting a complete application rests with the PHA. Failure of the Field Office to identify
and provide a notice of deficiency to the PHA shall not relieve the PHA of the consequences of submitting an incomplete
application. 

3. An application that does not meet all of the NOFA requirements after the 14-day technical deficiency period will
be removed from processing and determined to be unapprovable. If the PHA fails to correct deficiencies or fails to
submit missing forms or certifications, or any certification is incomplete or not executed by the appropriate person(s),
or the PHA Narrative Statement fails to address each of the Section IV.E. technical review factors, and each of the
Section I.D. eligibility criteria and the Section I.E. restriction criteria, the application will not be examined
for threshold approvability. 



B. Application Threshold Approvability



After initial screening and upon expiration of the deficiency ``cure'' period, applications for which all the information,
certifications, and documentation required by the NOFA have been received by HUD will be examined for threshold approvability.
Applications that fail one or more of the threshold criteria will be removed from processing and determined to be unapprovable.
Applications which successfully pass the threshold review (threshold-approvable applications) will, following
Joint Review, be submitted by the Field Office to a panel(s) which will rate applications, using the criteria set out
in Section IV.E. of this NOFA. All applications must meet the following thresholds to be determined threshold-approvable:


1. The MROP activities application must meet the eligibility criteria of Section I.D. and the restriction criteria
of Section I.E. 

2. The PHA may not have any litigation pending which would preclude approval of the application. The PHA must have the
required local cooperation and be legally eligible to develop, own, and operate public housing under the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937 and the application must have a properly executed and complete PHA Resolution (Form HUD 52471) referring
to the need for front-end funding, if requested, and a Local Governing Body Resolution (HUD 52472) which approves
the request for front-end funds, if front-end funds are requested. (NOTE: The PHA Resolution certifies to the PHA's
intent to comply with all requirements imposed by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655); the accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 135. By executing the
PHA resolution, the PHA also certifies that it will comply with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131), and its implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 35.) 

3. The Field Office must determine that the PHA has or will have the capability (as defined by Section IV.E.(1)(c))
to complete the MROP reconstruction activities and manage the resulting housing. The Field Office shall determine
capability based upon the PHA's overall performance, which includes the PHA's total score under the Public Housing
Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901), and the PHA's most recent fiscal audit. 

a. A PHA shall not be determined to lack administrative or development capability simply because it has no recent experience
in developing or ma
