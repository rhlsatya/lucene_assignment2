<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes special conditions for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 airplane. This new airplane
will have an unusual design feature associated with an Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS), for which
the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain appropriate safety standards for approach climb performance
using an ATTCS. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator
considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness
standards.

Background 



On September 13, 1989, Dassault Aviation, B.P. 24, 33701 Me



rignac, Ce



dex, France, applied for a new type certificate in the transport airplane category for the Model Falcon 2000 airplane.
The Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 is a medium-sized transcontinental business jet powered by two General Electric/Garrett
CFE 738 turbofan engines mounted on pylons extending from the aft fuselage. Each engine will be capable of delivering
5,600 lbs. thrust. The airplane will be capable of operation with two flight crewmembers and eight passengers.

The Model Falcon 2000 will incorporate an unusual design feature, the Automatic Takeoff Thrust Control System (ATTCS),
referred to by Dassault as Automatic Power Reserve or APR, to show compliance with the approach climb requirements
of  25.121(d). Appendix I to part 25 limits the application of performance credit for ATTCS to takeoff only.
Since the airworthiness regulations do not contain appropriate safety standards for approach climb performance
using ATTCS, special conditions are required to ensure a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.



Type Certification Basis



Under the provisions of  21.17 of the FAR, Dassault Aviation must show that the Falcon 2000 meets the applicable
provisions of part 25, effective February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through 25-69. The certification
basis may also include later amendments to part 25 that are not relevant to these special conditions. In addition,
the certification basis for the Falcon 2000 includes part 34, effective September 10, 1990, plus any amendments in
effect at the time of certification; and part 36, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by Amendments 36-1 through
the amendment in effect at the time of certification. These special conditions form an additional part of the type
certification basis. In addition, the certification basis may include other special conditions that are not relevant
to these special conditions.

If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 because of a novel or unusual
design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety
equivalent to that established in the regulations.

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.17(a)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for
that model be amended later to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature,
or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or
unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).



Novel or Unusual Design Features



The Model Falcon 2000 will incorporate an unusual design feature, the ATTCS (referred to by Dassault as the Automatic
Power Reserve or APR), to show compliance with the approach climb requirements of  25.121(d). The FALCON 2000
is a twin-turbofan-powered airplane equipped with Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADECs) that, in part,
protect against exceeding engine limits. Further, the FALCON 2000 incorporates a non-moving throttle system that
functions by placing the throttle levers in detents for the takeoff and climb phases of flight, allowing the FADEC
to schedule power setting based on flight phase. With the throttle levers placed in either of the two forward detents
(takeoff/go-around and climb), if an engine failure (RPM (N1)) difference of greater than 10 percent between engines
is sensed, power is automatically advanced on the remaining engine to the APR power level associated with the detent.
The system is permanently armed and will function any time the throttle levers are in either of the two forward detents
and an engine failure is sensed. Additionally, as in the case of an APR failure, or in an all-engines mode, the crew can
select APR by placing the throttle levers in either of the two forward detents and manually activating the system using
an instrument panel-mounted override switch.

APR power levels manifest themselves as an increase in the engine flat-rating temperature for the operating altitude,
and, in general, result in higher thrust levels than those associated with the throttle detents alone. Dassault also
makes reference in the APR logic description to thrust increase being armed for a throttle lever angle above 27 degrees
(max cruise position), but does not make it clear in the system description if the APR system functions when the throttle
is not in a detent. Further discussions with Dassault make it clear that when the throttle is between two detents, the
FADEC makes a linear intepolation between the related tables of corrected N

1

; i.e., an almost linear thrust change. As function outside of a detent is possible, then a throttle angle of 28 degrees
(arming angle + 1 degree) would produce almost no additional thrust when APR is activated, while 1 degree before the
next detent (max cruise/max continuous) would produce almost the same thrust increase as when the throttle is in that
detent. Logic for the max climb/max continuous detents is the same. From a practical point of view, throttle positions
between the detents are not used.

The part 25 standards for ATTCS, contained in  25.904 and Appendix I, specifically restrict performance credit
for ATTCS to takeoff. Expanding the scope of the standards to include other phases of flight, including go-around,
was considered at the time the standards were issued, but flightcrew workload issues precluded further consideration.
As stated in the preamble to Amendment 25-62:




In regard to ATTCS credit for approach climb and go-around maneuvers, current regulations preclude a higher thrust
for the approach climb ( 25.121(d)) than for the landing climb ( 25.119). The workload required for the
flightcrew to monitor and select from multiple in-flight thrust settings in the event of an engine failure during
a critical point in the approach, landing, or go-around operations is excessive. Therefore, the FAA does not agree
that the scope of the amendment should be changed to include the use of ATTCS for anything except the takeoff phase.
(52 FR 43153, November 9, 1987)




The ATTCS incorporated on the FALCON 2000 allows the pilot to use the same power setting procedure during a go-around,
regardless of whether or not an engine fails. In either case, the pilot obtains go-around power by moving the throttles
into the forward (takeoff/go-around) throttle detent. Since the ATTCS is permanently armed, it will function automatically
following an engine failure, and advance the remaining engine to the ATTCS thrust level. Therefore, this design adequately
addresses the pilot workload concerns identified in the preamble to Amendment 25-62. Accordingly, these proposed
special conditions would require a showing of compliance with those provisions of  25.904 and Appendix I that
are applicable to the approach climb and go-around maneuvers.

The definition of a critical time interval for the approach climb case, during which time it must be extremely improbable
to violate a flight path based on the  25.121(d) gradient requirement, is of primary importance. The  25.121(d)
gradient requirement implies a minimum one-engine-inoperative flight path capability with the airplane in the
approach configuration. The engine may have been inoperative before initiating the go-around, or it may become inoperative
during the go-around. The definition of the critical time interval must consider both possibilities.

As discussed above, these proposed special conditions would be applicable to the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon
2000. Should Dassault Aviation apply at a later date for a change to the type certificate to include another model incorporating
the same novel or unusual design feature, these special conditions would apply to that model as well under the provisions
of  21.101(a)(1).



Conclusion



This action affects only certain design features on the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 airplane. It is not a rule
of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on
the airplane.

4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g).



The Proposed Special Conditions



Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the Dassault Aviation Model Falcon 2000 airplane.

(a) 

General:

 An ATTCS is defined as the entire automatic system, including all devices, both mechanical and electrical, that sense
engine failure, transmit signals, actuate fuel controls or power levers, or increase engine power by other means
on operating engines to achieve scheduled thrust or power increases and furnish cockpit information on system operation.

(b) 

Automatic takeoff thrust control system (ATTCS).

 The engine power control system that automatically resets the power or thrust on the operating engine (following
engine failure during the approach for landing) must comply with the following requirements:

(1) 

Performance and System Reliability Requirements.

 The probability analysis must include consideration of ATTCS failure occurring after the time at which the fightcrew
last verifies that the ATTCS is in a condition to operate until the beginning of the critical time interval.

(2) 

Thrust Setting.

 The initial takeoff thrust set on each engine at the beginning of the takeoff roll or go-around may not be less than:

(i) Ninety (90) percent of the thrust level set by the ATTCS (the maximum takeoff thrust or power approved for the airplane
under existing ambient conditions);

(ii) That required to permit normal operating of all safety-related systems and equipment dependent upon engine
thrust or power lever position; or

(iii) That shown to be free of hazardous engine response characteristics when thrust is advanced from the initial
takeoff thrust or power to the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power.

(3) 

Powerplant Controls.

 In addition to the requirements of  25.1141, no single failure or malfunction, or probable combination thereof,
of the ATTCS, including associated systems, may cause the failure of any powerplant function necessary for safety.
The ATTCS must be designed to:

(i) Apply thrust or power on the operating engine(s), following any one engine failure during takeoff or go-around,
to achieve the maximum approved takeoff thrust or power without exceeding engine operating limits; and

(ii) Provide a means to verify to the flightcrew before takeoff and before beginning an approach for landing that the
ATTCS is in a condition to operate.

(c) 

Critical Time Interval.

 The definition of the Critical Time Interval in Appendix I, Section 125.2(b) shall be expanded to include the following:

(1) When conducting an approach for landing using ATTCS, the critical time interval is defined as follows:

(i) The critical time interval 

begins

 at a point on a 2.5 degree approach glide path from which, assuming a simultaneous engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting
approach climb flight path intersects a flight path originating at a later point on the same approach path corresponding
to the Part 25 one-engine-inoperative approach climb gradient. The period of time from the point of simultaneous
engine and ATTCS failure to the intersection of these flight paths must be no shorter than the time interval used in
evaluating the critical time interval for takeoff beginning from the point of simultaneous engine and ATTCS failure
and ending upon reaching a height of 400 feet.

(ii) The critical time interval 

ends

 at the point on a minimum performance, all-engines-operating go-around flight path from which, assuming a simultaneous
engine and ATTCS failure, the resulting minimum approach climb flight path intersects a flight path corresponding
to the Part 25 minimum one-engine-inoperative approach climb gradient. The all-engines-operating go-around flight
path and the Part 25 one-engine-inoperative approach climb gradient flight path originate from a common point on
a 2.5 degree approach path. The period of time from the point of simultaneous engine and ATTCS failure to the intersection
of these flight paths must be no shorter than the time interval used in evaluating the critical time interval for the
takeoff beginning from the point of simultaneous engine and ATTCS failure and ending upon reaching a height of 400
feet.

(2) The critical time interval must be determined at the altitude resulting in the longest critical time interval
for which one-engine-inoperative approach climb performance data are presented in the Airplane Flight Manual.

(3) The critical time interval is illustrated in the following figure:

















*The engine and ATTCS failed time interval must be no shorter than the time interval from the point of simultaneous
engine and ATTCS failure to a height of 400 feet used to comply with I25.2(b) for ATTCS use during takeoff.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
(AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A310 and A300-600 series airplanes. 
This proposal would require repetitive inspections to detect distortion and/or cracks on 
the attachment brackets of the backrest recline control locks of certain seats. This 
proposal would also require replacement of cracked or distorted brackets and their 
associated attachment fittings with new parts, which would terminate the repetitive 
inspection requirements. This proposal is prompted by a report of failure of the bracket 
of the backrest recline control lock on a seat due to fatigue-related cracking. The actions 
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such fatigue-related cracking and/or 
distortion, which could result in failure of the seat backrest attach fittings, which may 
lead to the uncommanded 50
  angle recline of the pilot or co-pilot seat, and, 
subsequently, the temporary inability of the pilots to control the airplane.

Discussion 



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness 
authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on 
certain Airbus Model A310 and A300-600 series airplanes equipped with certain 
SOGERMA-SOCEA pilot, co-pilot, and third occupant seats. The DGAC advises that a 
report has been received of failure of the bracket of the backrest recline control lock on a 
seat after the airplane accumulated 21,762 total flight hours. Investigation has revealed 
that the cause of this failure has been attributed to fatigue-related cracking. Fatigue 
cracks and/or distortion of the bracket of the backrest recline control lock, if not detected 
and corrected in a timely manner, could result in failure of the seat backrest attach 
fittings, and the subsequent uncommanded 50 angle recline of the pilot or co-pilot seat; 
this situation could lead to the temporary inability of the pilots to control the airplane. 

SOGERMA-SOCEA has issued Service Bulletin 25-229, dated November 26, 
1993, which describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect 
distortion and/or cracks on the attachment brackets of the backrest recline control locks. 
This service bulletin also describes procedures for replacement of both of the brackets 
and their associated attachment fittings with new parts, which would eliminate the need 
for the repetitive inspections. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory 
and issued French airworthiness directive 94-188-162(B), dated August 17, 1994, in order 
to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the 
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is 
necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United 
States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would require repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect distortion and/or cracks on 
the attachment brackets of the seat backrest recline control locks. This proposed AD 
would also require replacement of both of the brackets and their associated attachment 
fittings with new parts; this replacement would constitute terminating action for repetitive 
inspection requirements. The actions would be required to be accomplished in 
accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 49 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts 
would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$11,760, or $240 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules 
Docket at the location provided under the caption

 39.13


[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 






Airbus Industrie: 

Docket 94-NM-191-AD. 






Applicability: 

Model A310 and A300-600 series airplanes equipped with SOGERMA-SOCEA pilot, co-pilot, and third occupant
seats; as listed in SOGERMA-SOCEA Service Bulletin 25-229, dated November 26, 1993; certificated in
any category. 


Note 1: 

This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (b) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD. 







Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent fatigue cracks and/or distortion in the seat bracket of the backrest recline control lock, which could
result in failure of the seat backrest attach fittings, the uncommanded 50
  angle recline of the pilot or co-pilot seat, and, subsequently, lead to the temporary inability of the pilots
to control the airplane, accomplish the following: 
(a) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total flight hours or within 500 flight hours after the effective date of this
AD, whichever occurs later, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect distortion and/or cracks on the attachment
brackets of the backrest recline control locks of certain seats, in accordance with SOGERMA-SOCEA Service
Bulletin 25-229, dated November 26, 1993. 

(1) If no bracket is distorted or cracked, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight
hours. 

(2) If any bracket is distorted or cracked, prior to further flight, replace both of the brackets and their associated
attachment fittings with new parts, in accordance with the service bulletin. Accomplishment of this replacement
constitutes terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirements of this AD. 

(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113. 







Note 2: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113. 

(c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes series airplanes. The CAA advises
that operators have reported failures of the tee fittings of the spoiler bleed nipples. Investigation revealed that
these failures were due to fatigue induced by pressure pulses resulting from air in the spoiler system. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the failure of the tee fitting and subsequent loss of the main system hydraulics.


Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin J41-29-001, dated August 12, 1994, and Jetstream Service Bulletin
J41-29-001, Revision 1, dated August 30, 1994, which describe procedures for modification of the spoiler
system. This modification involves the installation of new bleed point fittings, hydraulic pipes, bleed nipple
fittings, and hose assemblies. This modification also involves flushing, filling, bleeding, and functionally
testing the left and right spoiler systems. This modification will make it easier to bleed (purge air from) the spoiler
system. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the spoiler system. The actions
would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 14 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
7 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required
parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,880, or $420 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Discussion 



The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received
reports of fatigue failure of the case drain line in the hydraulics system due to a lack of support against vibration.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in the loss of the main system hydraulics. 

Jetstream has issued Service Bulletins J41-29-005, Revision 1, dated August 12, 1994, and Revision 2,
dated August 30, 1994, which describe procedures for installation of new case drain pipes and an additional fairlead
support for the hydraulics case drain line in the rear spar area of the engine/nacelle. Accomplishment of this installation
will provide support against vibration and reduce the possibility of fatigue failure of the case drain line in the
hydraulics system. The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of new case drain pipes and an additional
fairlead support for the hydraulics case drain line in the rear spar area of the engine/nacelle. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 

As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 

The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,400, or $600 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

The Proposal



The FAA is considered an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to provide additional
controlled airspace for IFR operations at the NAS Memphis, TN, Airport by revising the radius of the 700 foot Class
E airspace from 6 to 7 nautical miles. Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above
the surface are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994
which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be
published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A that describes the application procedure. 



The Proposal 



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 72 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace, extending upward from the surface as an extension to the Class D airspace at Drake Field, Fayetteville,
AR. Additionally, the FAA is considering an amendment to the Class E airspace, controlled airspace extending upward
from 700 feet AGL, which currently overlies Drake Field, Fayetteville, AR. The development of a new MLS SIAP to RWY
34 has made this proposal to establish Class E airspace and to amend existing Class E Airspace necessary. The intended
effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the MLS SIAP to RWY 34 at Drake
Field, Fayetteville, AR. 

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace area designated as
an extension to a Class D surface area are published in Paragraph 6004 and designated Class E airspace area extending
upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994,
and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designations
listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal 



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise the Class
E airspace, controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL, at Laredo International Airport. An instrument
procedural amendment to the VOR/DME, TACAN or GPS SIAP to RWY 14 has made necessary this proposal to amend the controlled
airspace. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the
amended SIAP. 

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending
upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated July 18,
1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations

the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Consular Affairs plans to amend its notarial regulations to authorize certain U.S. citizen employees
of the Department of State who are not diplomatic or consular officers, but who have been designated by the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Overseas Citizen Services, to perform notarial services overseas. All consular officers, other foreign
service officers and designated U.S. citizen employees authorized to perform such notarials shall be identified,
for notarial purposes, as ``notarizing officers.'' The extension of this authority to designated U.S. citizen State
Department employees will enable foreign service posts to provide enhanced notarial service to the public. Consular
officers assisted by designated U.S. citizen employees will be able to concentrate on managing consular resources,
although they will still be available, as needed, to provide notarial services to U.S. citizens. Notarization by
a designated U.S. citizens State Department employee will generally have the same effect as notarization by a consular
officer. This proposed rule does not, however, permit designated U.S. citizen State Department employees to perform
authentications, perform a notarial service for a patent application or take a deposition pursuant to a commission,
as prescribed under 18 U.S.C. 3492, nor does it in itself ensure that notarials performed by the designated employees
will be acceptable to every state. With these qualifications, the State Department believes that notarials performed
by designated U.S. citizen employees will be acceptable for all purposes (particularly for federal law purposes).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule implements section 127(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994-1995, P.
Law 103-236, April 30, 1994. Section 127(b) authorizes the Secretary of State to designate State Department
employees who are U.S. citizens to perform in foreign countries notarial services authorized to be performed by consular
officers. Under section 24 of the Act of August 18, 1856, 11 Stat. 61, now generally cited as 22 U.S.C. 4221, consular
officers are authorized to administer to or take from any person an oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition,
and to perform any other notarial act which any notary public is required or authorized by law to do within the United
States. Section 7 of the Act of April 5, 1906, 34 Stat. 101, now generally referred to as 22 U.S.C. 4215, made the performance
of notarial services by consular officers mandatory, and mandated that a fee be charged for notarial services. The
Department's new authority under Section 127(b) will allow it to supplement the staff available to perform notarial
services at posts abroad with designated U.S. citizen State Department employees who are not consular officers,
thereby providing prompt, efficient service to the public and freeing consular officers to also focus more of their
efforts on other demands on our overseas posts. Consular and other diplomatic officers will still perform notarial
functions as needed.




Section 127(b) authorizes the Secretary of State to promulgate regulations providing for the designation of U.S.
citizen employees of the Department of State to perform notarial functions as provided therein. The Secretary's
authority was delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs on September 20, 1994. These proposed regulations
will further delegate to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Overseas Citizens Services the authority to designate
the United States citizen State Department employees who may perform these notarial functions.

The regulations implementing Section 127(b) will define the term ``notarizing officer.'' This term will include
consular officers, diplomatic officers encompassed by the term ``secretary of embassy or ligation'' in 22 U.S.C.
4221, and U.S. citizen employees of the Department of State designated by the Deputy Assistant Secretary. The Bureau
of Consular Affairs expects that the bulk of the U.S. citizen designees will be comprised of civil service visa examiners,
part-time intermittent, temporary foreign service (PIT) employees, when actually employed individuals (WAE's,
generally retired Foreign Service Officers temporarily serving), consular associates (all the above being assigned
overseas) and civil service employees ordinarily assigned to the Department of State but temporarily serving overseas.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary will insure that all designees are qualified to perform notarials, mormally by satisfactory
completion of the Basic Consular Course offered by the Foreign Service Institute at the National Foreign Affairs
Training Center.

This proposed regulation will not provide for designated U.S. citizen State Department employees to perform authentications,
but the Department hopes to be able to extend the rule to encompass authentications in the future. The authentication
of documents for use in civil proceedings in the federal courts is currently governed by Rule 44(e)(2) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. It is unclear whether that rule can be read to include authentications performed by non-consular
officer U.S. citizens designated by the Department to perform notarial services. The Bureau for Consular Affairs
plans to initiate consultations with the appropriate judicial officials to clarify the interpretation of Rule 44
and, if necessary, to ask that Rule 44 be amended to encompass all notarial officials under this proposal rule, thereby
permitting further amendments to the Department's notarial regulations to include authentications.
Similarly, the regulation will not allow the designated employees to perform notarial services in connection with
patents and patent applications. The taking to oaths regarding patent applications is governed by 35 U.S.C. 115,
which provides for patent application oaths to be administered by ``diplomatic and consular officers.'' The Bureau
of Consular Affairs plans to initiate consolations with the appropriate officials to clarify the scope of 35 U.S.C.
115 and, if necessary, to seek amendments to permit notarial officers to accept patent applications, thereby permitting
further amendments to these regulations to include patent applications.

Another service which designated employees will be unable to perform is the taking of testimony in any criminal action
or proceeding pursuant to a commission issued by a court in the United States. Such testimony is governed by 18 U.S.C.
3492, which authorizes consular officers to receive commissions to take testimony. Again, the Bureau of Consular
Affairs plans to initiate consultations with the appropriate officials to clarify the scope of 18 U.S.C. 3492 and,
if necessary, to seek amendments to permit notarial officers to receive commissions to authenticate documents and
take testimony.

The acceptability of notarials performed by designated U.S. citizen State Department employees for State law purposes
is of course governed by the laws of the various states. The Department hopes that any State laws that do not allow acceptance
of such notarials will be amended as necessary to achieve this result, and will be inviting consultations to this end.
The Department also invites comments from state and local governments as well as members of the public bar on the proposed
rule and its relationship to state notarial laws.
The Department believes that, with these qualifications, notarials performed by designated U.S. citizen State
Department employees will be acceptable for all purposes, and particularly for all Federal law purposes. The Bureau
of Consular Affairs will be consulting with other interested federal agencies to ensure this result to the extent
possible consistent with current statutory authorities.

The Bureau of Consular Affairs is also proposing herein to make Sections 92.5 and 92.31 more concise by eliminating
superfluous material from both sections.

This regulation is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under
the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It will not impose information collection requirements under the
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been reviewed as required under E.O. 12778 and certified
to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under E.O. 12866 but is consistent therewith and is being
shared with potentially interested federal agencies to ensure that they are aware of the changes it will entail in
consular operations.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, 22 CFR Part 92 is proposed to be amended as follows:


PART 92_NOTARIAL AND RELATED SERVICES


1. The authority citation for Part 92 is revised to read as follows:





Authority: 

22 U.S.C. 2658.



2. Section 92.1(d) is added to read as follows:


 92.1

Definitions.


* * * * *


(d) For purposes of this part, except   92.36 through 92.42 relating to the authentication of documents,
the term ``notarizing officer'' includes consular officers, officers of the Foreign Service who are secretaries
of embassy or legation under section 24 of the Act of August 18, 1856, 11 Stat. 61, as amended (22 U.S.C. 4221), and such
U.S. citizen Department of State employees as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Overseas Citizens Services
may designate for the purpose of performing notarial acts overseas pursuant to Section 127(b) of the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994-1995, Pub. L. 103-236, April 30, 1994 (``designated employees'').
The authority of designated employees to perform notarial services shall not include the authority to perform authentications,
to notarize patent applications, or take testimony in a criminal action or proceeding pursuant to a commission issued
by a court in the United States, but shall otherwise encompass all notarial acts, including but not limited to administering
or taking oaths, affirmations, affidavits or depositions. The notarial authority of a designated employee shall
expire upon termination of the employee's assignment to such duty and may also be terminated at any time by the Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Overseas Citizen Services.
3. Section 92.2 is revised to read as follows:


 92.2

Description of overseas notarial functions of the Department of State, record of acts. 


The overseas notarial function of notarizing officers of the Department of State is similar to the function of a notary
public in the United States. See section 22.5(b) of this chapter concerning the giving of receipts for fees collected
and the maintenance of a register serving the same purposes as the record which notaries are usually expected or required
to keep of their official acts.
4. In  92.4 the title and paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are revised to read as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 92.4 

Authority of notarizing officers of the Department of State under Federal law.



(a) All notarizing officers are required, when application is made to them within the geographic limits of their consular
district, to administer to and take from any person any oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition, and to perform
any notarial act which any notary public is required or authorized by law to perform within the United States. With
respect to notarial acts performed by notarizing officers away from their office, see 92.7. Notarial acts shall be
performed only if their performance is authorized by treaty provisions or is permitted by the laws or authorities
of the country wherein the notarizing officer is stationed.

(b) These acts may be performed for any person regardless of nationality so long as the document in connection with
which the notarial service is required is for use within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government of the United States
or within the jurisdiction of one of the States or Territories of the United States. (However, see also 92.6.). Within
the Federal jurisdiction of the United States, these acts, when certified under the hand and seal of office of the notarizing
officer are valid and of like force and effect as if performed by any duly authorized and competent person within the
United States. Documents bearing the seal and signature of a secretary of embassy or legation, consular officer (including
consul general, vice consul or consular agent) are admissible in evidence within the Federal jurisdiction without
proof of any such seal or signature being genuine or of the official character of the notarizing officer.

(c) Every notarizing officer may perform notarial acts for use in countries occupied by the United States or under
its administrative jurisdiction, provided the officer has reason to believe that the notarial act will be recognized
in the country where it is intended to be used. These acts may be performed for United States citizens and for nationals
of the occupied or administered countries, who reside outside such countries, except in areas where another government
is protecting the interests of the occupied or administered country.



* * * * *



5. Section 92.5 is revised to read as follows:



 92.5 

Acceptability of notarial acts under State or territorial law.



The acceptability within the jurisdiction of a State or Territory of the United States of a certificate of a notarial
act performed by a notarizing officer depends upon the laws of the State or Territory.

6. Section 92.6 introductory paragraph and paragraph (b) are revised to read as follows:



 92.6 

Authority of notarizing officers under international practice.



Although such services are not mandatory, notarizing officers may, as a courtesy, perform notarial acts for use in
countries with which the United States has formal diplomatic and consular relations. Generally the applicant for
such service will be a United States citizen or a national of the country in which the notarized document will be used.
The notarizing officer's compliance with a request for a notarial service of this type should be based on the reasonableness
of the request and the absence of any apparent irregularity. When a notarizing officer finds it advisable to do so,
the officer may question the applicant to such extent as may be necessary to be assured of the the reasonableness of
the request and the absence of irregularity.

(b) That the notarial service is legally necessary and cannot be obtained otherwise than through a United States notarizing
officer without loss or serious inconvenience to the applicant; and



* * * * *



7. In  92.7, the title and paragraph (b) are revised to read as follows:



 92.7



Responsibility of notarizing officers of the Department of State.



* * * * *



(b) As indicated in sections 92.4, 92.5, and 92.6, the authority of secretaries of embassy or legation as well as consular
officers to perform notarial acts is generally recognized. However, the function is essentially consular, and notarial
powers are in practice exercised by diplomatic officers only in the absence of a consular officer or U.S. citizen State
Department employee designated to perform notarial functions as provided in Section 92.1(d). Performance of notarial
acts by an officer assigned in dual diplomatic and consular capacity shall be performed in his/her consular capacity,
except in special circumstances.

8. In  92.31, paragraph (a), the third sentence is revised to read as follows:



 92.31



Taking an acknowledgement.



(a) * * * Therefore, notarizing officers and consular agents who are called upon to perform this notarial
act should consult the applicable State or territorial law to ascertain whether certificates of acknowledgement
will be acceptable.



* * * * *



9. Section 92.51 is revised to read as follows:



 92.51



Methods of taking depositions in foreign countries.



Rule 28(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States provides that depositions may
be taken in foreign countries by any of the following four methods:

(a) Pursuant to any applicable treaty or convention, or

(b) Pursuant to a letter of request (whether or not captioned a letter rogatory), or 

(c) On notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which the examination is held, either by
the law thereof or by the law of the United States. Notarizing officials as defined by 22 CFR 92.1 are so authorized by
the law of the United States, or 

(d) Before a person commissioned
 by the court, and a person so commis
sioned shall have the power by virtue of the commission to administer any necessary oath and take testimony.

10. Section 92.52 is revised to read as follows:



 92.52



``Deposition on notice'' defined.



A ``deposition on notice'' is a deposition taken before a competent official after reasonable notice has been given
in writing by the party or attorney proposing to take such deposition to the opposing party or attorney of record. Notarizing
officers, who are authorized to administer oaths pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4221, are competent officials for taking depositions
on notice in foreign countries (see  92.51). This method of taking a deposition does not necessarily involve
the issuance of a commission or other court order.

11. Section 92.55 is revised to read as follows:



 92.55



Consular authority and responsibility for taking depositions.



(a) Requests to take depositions or designations to execute commissions to take depositions. Any United States notarizing
officer may be requested to take a deposition on notice, or designated to execute a commission to take depositions.
A commission or notice should, if possible, identify the officer who is to take the depositions by his official title
only in the following manner: ``Any notarizing officer of the United States of America at (name of locality)''. The
notarizing officer responsible for the performance of notarial acts at a post should act on a request to take a deposition
on notice, or should execute the commission, when the documents are drawn in this manner, provided local law does not
preclude such action. However, when the officer (or officers) is designated by name as well as by title, only the officer
(or officers) so designated may take the depositions. In either instance, the officer must be a disinterested party.
Rule 28(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for the district courts of the United States prohibits the taking of a deposition
before a person who is a relative, employee, attorney or counsel of any of the parties, or who is a relative or employee
of such attorney or counsel, or who is financially interested in the action.

(b) Authority in Federal law. The authority for the taking of depositions, charging the appropriate fees, and imposing
the penalty for giving false evidence is generally set forth in 22 U.S.C. 4215 and 4221. The taking of depositions for
federal courts of the United States is further governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the provisions
of law which govern particularly the taking of depositions to prove the genuineness of foreign documents which it
is desired to introduce in evidence in any criminal action or proceeding in a United States federal court, see 18 U.S.C.
3491 through 3496.

(c) Procedure where laws of the foreign country do not permit the taking of depositions. In countries where the right
to take depositions is not secured by treaty, notarizing officers may take depositions only if the laws or authorities
of the national government will permit them to do so. Notarizing officers in countries where the taking of depositions
is not permitted who receive notices or commissions for taking depositions should return the documents to the parties
from whom they are received explaining why they are returning them, and indicating what other method or methods may
be available for obtaining the depositions, whether by letters rogatory or otherwise.

12. In  92.66, paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised to read as follows:



 92.66



Depositions taken before foreign officials or other persons in a foreign country.



(a) 

Customary practice. 

Under Federal law (Rule 28 (b), Rules of Civil Procedure for the District Courts of the United States) and under the
laws of some of the States, a commission to take depositions can be issued to a foreign official or to a private person
in a foreign country.

However, this method is rarely used; commissions are generally issued to U.S. notarizing officers. In those countries
where U.S. notarizing officers are not permitted to take testimony (see  92.55(c)) and where depositions must
be taken before a foreign authority, letters rogatory are usually issued to a foreign court.


* * * * *


(d) 

Transmission of commissions to foreign officials or other persons. 

A commission to take depositions which is addressed to an official or person in a foreign country other than a United
States notarizing officer may be sent directly to the person designated. However, if such a Commission is sent to the
United States diplomatic mission in the country where the depositions are intended to be taken, it should be forwarded
to the Foreign Office for transmission to the person appointed in the commission. If sent to a United States consular
office, the commission may be forwarded by that office direct to the person designated, or, if the notarial officer
deems it more advisable to do so, he may send the commission to the United States diplomatic mission for transmission
through the medium of the foreign office.

Background 



Section 1275(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) 
grants the Secretary the authority to prescribe regulations under 
the original issue discount (OID) provisions of the Code, 
including regulations relating to debt instruments that provide 
for contingent payments. On April 8, 1986, the IRS published in 
the 

Federal Register

 a notice of proposed rulemaking (51 FR 
12022) relating to debt instruments with OID. Section 1.1275-4 
of the 1986 proposed regulations provided rules for contingent 
payment debt instruments. On February 28, 1991, the IRS 
published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed amendment to 
 1.1275-4 (56 FR 8308), which would have bifurcated certain 
contingent payment debt instruments into their component parts 
( 1.1275-4(g)). 

On December 22, 1992, the IRS published in the 

Federal 
Register 

a notice of proposed rulemaking that substantially 
revised the 1986 proposed regulations (57 FR 60750), and on 
February 4, 1994, the IRS published in the 

Federal Register

 final 
OID regulations (59 FR 4799). However, neither the 1992 proposed 
regulations nor the final OID regulations contained rules for 
contingent payment debt instruments under  1.1275-4. 

The IRS received numerous written comments on  1.1275-4, as 
originally proposed in 1986 and as amended in 1991. In addition, 
on November 17, 1986, the IRS held a public hearing to discuss 
the 1986 proposed regulations, including  1.1275-4. 

Commentators criticized  1.1275-4 of the 1986 proposed 
regulations because the regulations ignored the economics of many 
contingent payment debt instruments. In particular, commentators 
believed that the 1986 proposed regulations did not reflect the 
reasonable expectations of the parties because the regulations 
used a ``wait and see'' approach to the accrual of interest 
determined by reference to contingencies. The commentators noted 
that, with respect to certain contingent payment debt 
instruments, the 1986 proposed regulations resulted in a 
significant backloading of interest. 

Commentators also criticized the 1991 proposed amendment to 
 1.1275-4. Commentators argued that there is rarely a unique set 
of components into which a contingent payment debt instrument can 
be bifurcated. In addition, commentators questioned whether it 
is appropriate to bifurcate a contingent payment debt instrument 
because it is often unclear how the contingent components should 
be taxed. 

Some commentators suggested that it is preferable to 
determine interest accruals on a contingent payment debt 
instrument by assuming that the issue price of the debt 
instrument will bear a return at the applicable Federal rate 
(AFR) or some other specified rate. Other commentators suggested 
that it is preferable to determine interest accruals by 
constructing a projected payment schedule and accruing on the 
basis of the projections.

Explanation of Provisions 



In general



The proposed regulations in this document contain new rules 
for the treatment of contingent payment debt instruments 
( 1.1275-4). The proposed regulations provide separate rules for 
debt instruments that are issued for cash or publicly traded 
property and for debt instruments that are issued for nonpublicly 
traded property. The proposed regulations also provide special 
rules for tax-exempt obligations. Section 1.1275-4, as proposed 
on April 8, 1986, and amended on February 28, 1991, is superseded 
as of December 16, 1994.

The proposed regulations provide a rule to determine the 
imputed principal amount of a contingent payment debt instrument 
issued for nonpublicly traded property. The proposed regulations 
also provide rules for the integration of certain debt 
instruments with related hedges ( 1.1275-6). In addition, the 
proposed regulations amend the rules for variable rate debt 
instruments in  1.1275-5 of the final OID regulations. Finally, 
the proposed regulations make conforming changes to certain 
provisions of the final OID regulations, such as the regulations 
under section 483. 



Section 1.1275-4 Contingent payment debt instruments. 



A. Applicability



Section 1.1275-4 of the proposed regulations generally 
applies to any debt instrument that provides for one or more 
contingent payments. The proposed regulations, however, do not 
apply to a debt instrument that has an issue price determined 
under section 1273(b)(4), a variable rate debt instrument, a debt 
instrument subject to  1.1272-1(c) (certain debt instruments that 
provide for alternative payment schedules), a debt instrument 
subject to section 1272(a)(6) (REMIC interests and certain other 
debt instruments that are subject to prepayment), or, except as 
provided in section 988, a debt instrument subject to section 988 
(a debt instrument that provides for payments denominated in, or 
determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency). The IRS 
and Treasury request comments on whether other types of debt 
instruments should be excluded from the rules of  1.1275-4, such 
as certain prepayable obligations included in a pool. 

Section 1.1275-4 of the proposed regulations applies only to 
a contingent payment debt instrument that constitutes a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is 
intended under the proposed regulations as to whether a 
particular instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal 
income tax purposes. 

Although the proposed regulations do not define the term 
contingent payment, the proposed regulations treat certain 
payments as not being contingent. For example, if a payment is 
subject to either a remote or incidental contingency, the payment 
is not a contingent payment. A contingency is remote if there is 
either a remote likelihood that the contingency will occur or a 
remote likelihood that the contingency will not occur. A 
contingency is incidental if the potential amount of the payment 
under any reasonably expected market conditions is insignificant 
relative to the total expected payments on the debt instrument. 
Under the proposed regulations, a debt instrument does not 
provide for contingent payments merely because it is convertible 
into stock of the issuer or a related party. However, if a debt 
instrument is convertible into stock of an unrelated party, the 
debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument. 



B. The Noncontingent Bond Method



The noncontingent bond method applies to a contingent 
payment debt instrument that has an issue price determined under 
 1.1273-2 or  1.1274-2(b)(3). For example, the noncontingent 
bond method generally applies to a contingent payment debt 
instrument issued for money or publicly traded property.

Under the noncontingent bond method, a projected payment 
schedule is determined for a debt instrument, and interest 
accrues on the debt instrument based on this schedule. The 
projected payment schedule for a debt instrument consists of all 
noncontingent payments and a projected amount for each contingent 
payment. If the actual amount of a contingent payment differs 
from the projected amount of the payment, appropriate adjustments 
are taken into account to reflect this difference. 

Although the actual amount of a contingent payment is not 
fixed or determinable when a contingent payment debt instrument 
is issued, the noncontingent bond method, in effect, treats the 
projected amounts of contingent payments like fixed payments and 
requires interest accruals based on the projected amounts. The 
IRS and Treasury believe that this method is consistent with 
Congress' intent under the OID provisions to require a current 
accrual of interest on a debt instrument.

<TEXT>
 

While other methods suggested by commentators also require a current accrual of interest, the noncontingent bond
method requires interest accruals based on a rate that is implicit in the debt instrument and provides a means of determining
whether payments are appropriately treated as interest or principal. The IRS and Treasury believe that the noncontingent
bond method is the most appropriate method for achieving this purpose. For example, methods that require accrual
at a fixed rate for all debt instruments often will over-accrue or under-accrue interest on a particular debt instrument.
In addition, the methods may not always provide an appropriate measure of the interest and principal components of
a payment. Because of the inaccuracies under these methods, the IRS and Treasury rejected these methods. 
1. 

Projected payment schedule. 
The projected payment schedule for a contingent payment debt instrument is determined as of the debt instrument's
issue date. Except in the case of a contingent payment that is fixed more than 6 months before it is due, the projected
payment schedule remains fixed throughout the term of the debt instrument and any income, deductions, gain, or loss
attributable to the debt instrument are based on the schedule. 
The projected payment schedule for a debt instrument consists of all noncontingent payments and a projected amount
for each contingent payment. The proposed regulations provide rules for determining the projected amount of each
contingent payment included in a projected payment schedule. Under the proposed regulations, contingent payments
are either quotable contingent payments or nonquotable contingent payments. 
A quotable contingent payment is a contingent payment that is substantially similar to a property right for which
forward price quotes are readily available. In general, the projected amount of a quotable contingent payment is
the forward price of the property right. If a contingent payment is substantially similar to an option and forward
price quotes are not readily available for the option, the projected amount of the payment is the spot price of the option
on the issue date, if readily available, compounded at the AFR from the issue date to the date the payment is due. 
Under the proposed regulations, a property right includes a right, an obligation, or a combination of rights or obligations.
For example, options and forward contracts are property rights. More complicated contingent payments are constructed
from combinations of rights and obligations. 
A contingent payment is substantially similar to a property right if, under reasonably expected market conditions,
the value and timing of the amount to be paid or received pursuant to the property right are expected to be substantially
the same as the value and timing of the contingent payment. It is irrelevant for purposes of testing substantial similarity
whether the property right must be settled in cash or in property or whether the credit rating of the issuer is different
from the party giving the price quote. It is also irrelevant whether a property right is available in the same denomination
as the measure of the contingent payments.

<TEXT>
 

Quotes for the substantially similar property right are readily available if they are readily available from brokers,
traders, or dealers during specified time periods. Although price quotes for over-the-counter property rights
often are not widely disseminated because the rights may be privately tailored for a particular transaction, quotes
for over-the-counter property rights generally will be treated as readily available if customers could obtain quotes
from brokers, traders, or dealers. 
Commentators have stated that any method requiring taxpayers to create payment schedules using expected values
would be difficult to apply. They have said that there is too much variation in the expected values of the property rights
embedded in contingent payment debt instruments to allow for the creation of payment schedules that are not susceptible
to abuse or to challenge upon examination on the basis of hindsight. 
The noncontingent bond method, however, generally sets the projected amounts of market-based contingent payments
by using forward prices for the embedded property rights rather than expected values. It is the understanding of the
IRS and Treasury that forward prices are available for almost all of the market-based property rights embedded in
contingent payment debt instruments. For example, these property rights generally may be obtained on a separate
basis for hedging purposes. Moreover, the IRS and Treasury understand that dealers and certain information services
provide daily quotations of the prices of contingent payment debt instruments held by regulated investment companies
to allow the companies to determine their net asset values. To do this, the price of the separate elements of the contingent
payment debt instruments, including the embedded property rights, must be determined. Thus, the IRS and Treasury
believe that, in general, it will not be difficult for issuers of contingent payment debt instruments to obtain forward
price quotes for the property rights embedded in the debt instruments. 
The proposed regulations include a number of provisions designed to address other concerns with the pricing requirement.
First, the pricing requirement only applies if quotes are readily available. Therefore, when it is not feasible to
obtain a quote, pricing is not required. 
Second, the IRS and Treasury understand that the price a broker or dealer develops for any property right embedded
in a contingent payment debt instrument when pricing the debt instrument as a whole will not necessarily translate
into a forward price for the property right determined on a separate basis. For example, the price of the property right
embedded in a contingent payment debt instrument may include charges for financial intermediation that would not
be imposed if the property right were purchased separately. Thus, the rules that apply to an issuer who must set a projected
payment schedule allow substantial flexibility. 
Further, the IRS and Treasury recognize that quotes for thinly traded property rights may vary and that the bid-ask
spread may be substantial. The proposed regulations, therefore, provide that a taxpayer may use any reasonable quote
to determine the projected amount of a payment. The proposed regulations also provide that the taxpayer may use bid
price, ask price, or midpoint price quotes to determine the projected amounts of quotable contingent payments. However,
the taxpayer must make this determination on a consistent basis. For example, a taxpayer cannot use ask prices to determine
the projected amounts for some contingent payments on a debt instrument and bid prices to determine the projected
amounts for other contingent payments on the instrument. Finally, if a contingent payment is equivalent to more than
one combination of property rights, taxpayers may use any reasonable combination. However, it is not reasonable
to construct a combination of property rights that contains property rights for which forward price quotes are unavailable
if there are other possible combinations that consist only of property rights for which forward price quotes are readily
available. 
A nonquotable contingent payment is any contingent payment that is not a quotable contingent payment. For example,
contingent payments based on oil production or the issuer's gross receipts are generally nonquotable contingent
payments. 
The projected amount of a nonquotable contingent payment is generally based on the projected yield of the contingent
payment debt instrument. The projected yield is a reasonable rate for the debt instrument that, as of the issue date,
reflects general market conditions, the credit quality of the issuer, and the terms and conditions of the debt instrument.
For this purpose, the proposed regulations provide that a reasonable rate is not less than the AFR or the yield on the
debt instrument determined without regard to the nonquotable contingent payments. In many cases, a reasonable rate
will substantially exceed the AFR. Once the projected yield is determined, the projected amount of each nonquotable
contingent payment is determined so that the projected payment schedule reflects the projected yield. The projected
amount of each payment, however, must reasonably reflect the relative expected values of the nonquotable contingent
payments. 
The proposed regulations provide simplifying rules to determine the projected payment schedule of a contingent
payment debt instrument that would be a variable rate debt instrument except that it provides for a single quotable
contingent payment at maturity or does not guarantee a sufficient return of stated principal. Under the proposed
regulations, the projected amounts of the variable interest payments are determined using the rules of  1.1275-5(e),
rather than the general rules for quotable contingent payments. For example, if the contingent payment debt instrument
provides for stated interest at a single qualified floating rate and a quotable contingent payment at maturity, the
projected amounts of the interest payments are based on the value of the rate as of the instrument's issue date and the
projected amount of the contingent payment is determined under the rules for quotable contingent payments. 
The proposed regulations require the issuer to construct the projected payment schedule. If an issuer fails to produce
a projected payment schedule as required, the issuer will be treated as failing to meet the recordkeeping requirements
under section 6001 necessary to support the deduction of interest. To avoid potential audit disputes about the projected
amount of a contingent payment, the proposed regulations provide that the issuer's projected payment schedule will
be respected unless the schedule is unreasonable. A projected payment schedule generally will be considered unreasonable
if it is set with a purpose to accelerate or defer interest accruals. In determining whether a projected payment schedule
is unreasonable, consideration will be given to whether the interest on a contingent payment debt instrument determined
under the schedule has a significant effect on the issuer's or the holder's U.S. tax liability. For example, a projected
payment schedule prepared by an issuer that is a non-U.S. taxpayer will be given special scrutiny because no schedule
would have an effect on the issuer's U.S. tax liability.

The proposed regulations provide that all holders of a 
contingent payment debt instrument are bound by the issuer's 
projected payment schedule and that an issuer must provide the 
schedule to the holders. A holder may vary from the projected 
payment schedule provided by the issuer only if the projected 
payment schedule is unreasonable. If an issuer does not create a 
projected payment schedule as required or the issuer's schedule 
is unreasonable, a holder must apply the projected payment 
schedule rules to determine a reasonable projected payment 
schedule. If a holder is not using the issuer's projected 
payment schedule, the holder must explicitly disclose this fact 
on its timely filed federal income tax return and must explain 
why it is not using the issuer's schedule. 

Because the proposed regulations allow considerable 
flexibility, taxpayers may attempt to create uneconomic accruals 
by intentionally overstating or understating the projected 
amounts of the contingent payments. Taxpayers must use actual 
prices in setting the payment schedule and are given flexibility 
only within the range of reasonable prices. For example, the 
prices of an issuer's or a holder's hedges may be used to 
determine reasonableness. Under the rules of section 6001, 
taxpayers must maintain adequate contemporaneous records to 
support the projected payment schedule. In addition, the rules 
of  1.1275-2T(g) (the OID anti-abuse rule) apply to transactions 
subject to the proposed regulations, including transactions in 
which the taxpayer attempts to create payment schedules that 
cause uneconomic accruals. Attempts to overstate or understate 
the amounts of the projected payments will give rise to 
adjustments of tax liability, and, if appropriate, penalties. 

2. Adjustments. 

Under the noncontingent bond method, if the actual amount of 
a contingent payment differs from the projected amount of the 
payment, the difference results in either a positive or negative 
adjustment that must be taken into account by the taxpayer. The 
purpose of the adjustments is to correct the interest accruals 
that have occurred to date on the debt instrument. Therefore, 
the adjustments generally increase or decrease the amount of 
interest on a contingent payment debt instrument. 

If the actual amount of a contingent payment is greater than 
the projected amount of the payment, the difference is a positive 
adjustment. If the projected amount of a contingent payment is 
greater than the actual amount of the payment, the difference is 
a negative adjustment. Positive and negative adjustments for a 
taxable year are netted for each taxable year. 

A net positive adjustment for a taxable year is treated by 
the taxpayer as additional interest for the year. A net negative 
adjustment for a taxable year is taken into account as follows. 

First, a net negative adjustment for a taxable year offsets 
the interest that accrued on the debt instrument for the year 
based on the projected payment schedule. 

Second, if the net negative adjustment exceeds the amount of 
interest that accrued on the debt instrument for the taxable 
year, the excess is treated as an ordinary loss by the holder or 
as ordinary income by the issuer. However, the amount treated as 
ordinary loss by the holder is limited to the amount by which the 
holder's total prior interest inclusions on the debt instrument 
(including all net positive adjustments) exceed the total net 
negative adjustments on the debt instrument previously treated as 
ordinary loss by the holder. Similarly, the amount treated as 
ordinary income by the issuer is limited to the amount by which 
the issuer's total prior interest deductions on the debt 
instrument (including all net positive adjustments) exceed the 
total net negative adjustments on the debt instrument previously 
treated as ordinary income by the issuer. 

Third, because a negative adjustment adjusts interest 
accruals, if the net negative adjustment exceeds the sum of the 
amount of interest that accrued on the debt instrument for the 
taxable year and the amount treated as ordinary loss (or income) 
for the taxable year, the excess is treated as a negative 
adjustment that occurs on the first day of the succeeding taxable 
year. As a result, the excess offsets interest accruals on the 
debt instrument in future taxable years. 

Fourth, any unused net negative adjustment reduces the 
amount realized by the holder on the sale, exchange, or 
retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument. Similarly, 
any unused net negative adjustment is taken into account by the 
issuer on retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument as 
income from the discharge of indebtedness. The IRS and Treasury 
request comments on whether the regulations should provide 
specific rules governing the treatment of net negative 
adjustments determined on the occurrence of other events. 

The IRS and Treasury chose this method for taking 
adjustments into account because it provided a relatively simple 
method for adjusting the yield. However, the method may produce 
inappropriate results, for example, if there are large 
adjustments in the early years of a debt instrument. Other 
methods, such as a method that spreads adjustments over the term 
of the debt instrument, would produce more accurate results but 
would be more complex. The IRS and Treasury request comments on 
whether another method should be used for taking adjustments into 
account. 

3. Adjusted issue price, basis, and retirement. 

Under the noncontingent bond method, the adjusted issue 
price of a contingent payment debt instrument, adjustments to the 
holder's basis in the debt instrument, and the amount of any 
contingent payment treated as made on the scheduled retirement of 
the debt instrument are determined using the projected payment 
schedule rather than actual contingent payments. This rule is 
appropriate because positive or negative adjustments are used to 
take into account the difference between actual amounts and 
projected amounts of contingent payments. This difference would 
be counted twice if adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and the 
amount deemed paid on retirement were based on the actual amounts 
of contingent payments rather than the projected amounts. 

4. Character on sale, exchange, or retirement. 

Under the noncontingent bond method, any gain recognized by 
a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a contingent 
payment debt instrument is treated as interest income. 
Similarly, any loss recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, 
or retirement of a contingent payment debt instrument is treated 
as ordinary loss to the extent of the holder's prior interest 
inclusions (reduced by prior ordinary losses attributable to net 
negative adjustments) on the instrument. Although this rule is 
inconsistent with the treatment of noncontingent debt 
instruments, the rule is necessary because of the treatment of 
net positive and net negative adjustments. The rule prevents a 
taxpayer who sells a contingent payment debt instrument 
immediately before a positive adjustment occurs from converting 
the interest income from the adjustment into capital gain or from 
converting the amount by which a negative adjustment would reduce 
interest income into capital loss. Consistent with the rule's 
purpose, the rule does not apply to a sale, exchange, or 
retirement that occurs when there are no outstanding contingent 
payments due on a debt instrument.

5. Other special rules. 

Although most contingent payment debt instruments can be 
dealt with under the above provisions, the proposed regulations 
provide additional rules for certain other circumstances. For 
example, the proposed regulations provide rules for a holder 
whose basis in a contingent payment debt instrument is different 
from the debt instrument's adjusted issue price (e.g., a 
secondary market purchaser of the debt instrument). Under the 
proposed regulations, the holder continues to accrue interest and 
determine adjustments based on the original projected payment 
schedule. The holder, however, must allocate the difference 
between basis and adjusted issue price to the accruals or 
projected payments on the debt instrument over the remaining term 
of the debt instrument. Amounts allocated to a taxable year are 
recovered as if they were positive or negative adjustments, as 
appropriate. 

The proposed regulations require only a reasonable, rather 
than an exact, allocation of the difference between basis and 
adjusted issue price. For example, if almost all of the 
difference is attributable to changes in the expected value of a 
contingent payment, the holder may allocate the difference to the 
contingent payment. Similarly, a taxpayer may allocate a portion 
of the difference to accruals if the taxpayer determines that the 
portion is attributable to changes in interest rates. A taxpayer 
may make this determination by comparing rates on similar debt 
instruments, by looking to changes in standard interest rate 
indices that have occurred since the date the contingent payment 
debt instrument was issued, or by other appropriate means. The 
proposed regulations require the holder's allocation to be 
reasonable based on all the facts and circumstances. 

In the case of a contingent payment debt instrument that is 
exchange listed property (within the meaning of  1.1273-2(f)(2)), 
the proposed regulations provide a safe harbor that allows 
holders to account for the difference between the debt 
instrument's adjusted issue price and the holder's basis under 
the same rules that apply to acquisition premium on a 
noncontingent debt instrument under section 1272(a)(7) and 
 1.1272-2. 

The IRS and Treasury recognize that the method provided in 
the proposed regulations for allocating the difference between 
basis and adjusted issue price may be difficult to apply because 
the difference may be attributable to both changes in interest 
rates and in the expected values of the contingent payments. 
Other methods for making the allocation were considered in 
drafting the proposed regulations, but were not adopted because 
they were not believed to be sufficiently accurate. The IRS and 
Treasury believe that contingent payment debt instruments (other 
than exchange listed debt instruments) rarely trade in the 
secondary market and, therefore, the need to make the allocation 
will occur only infrequently. The IRS and Treasury request 
comments on this issue. 

The proposed regulations also provide rules for a debt 
instrument that has a contingent payment that is fixed more than 
6 months before the payment is due. Under the proposed 
regulations, an adjustment is made on the date the payment is 
fixed, and the amount of the adjustment is equal to the 
difference between the present value of the fixed amount and the 
present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment. 
The adjusted issue price is modified to reflect the adjustment 
and the projected payment schedule is changed to reflect the 
fixed payment. The IRS and Treasury are concerned about whether 
this method may produce inappropriate accelerations of income or 
deductions and request comments on whether other methods, such as 
a method that spreads the income or deductions, are more 
appropriate. 

In addition, the proposed regulations provide rules for debt 
instruments that have both payments that are contingent as to 
time and payments that are contingent as to amount. If a 
taxpayer has an option to put or call the debt instrument, to 
exchange the debt instrument for other property, or to extend the 
maturity date of the debt instrument, the projected payment 
schedule is determined by using the principles of 
 1.1272-1(c)(5). Under the proposed regulations, if an option to 
put, call, or exchange the debt instrument is assumed to be 
exercised under the principles of  1.1272-1(c)(5), it is 
generally reasonable to assume that the option is exercised 
immediately before it expires. If the option is exercised at an 
earlier time, the exercise is treated as a sale or exchange of 
the debt instrument. 

The proposed regulations reserve on other types of timing 
contingencies. The IRS and Treasury request comments on the 
appropriate treatment of other types of timing contingencies. 



C. Method for Debt Instruments Not Subject to the 
Noncontingent Bond Method 



The proposed regulations provide a method for contingent 
payment debt instruments not subject to the noncontingent bond 
method. In general, the method applies to a debt instrument that 
has an issue price determined under  1.1274-2 (e.g., a 
nonpublicly traded debt instrument issued in a sale or exchange 
of nonpublicly traded property). The method in the proposed 
regulations is generally similar to the rules prescribed in 
 1.1275-4(c) of the 1986 proposed regulations. 

Under the proposed regulations, the payments on a contingent 
payment debt instrument (the overall debt instrument) are divided 
into two components: (1) a noncontingent component consisting of 
all noncontingent payments and the projected amounts of any 
quotable contingent payments, and (2) a contingent component 
consisting of all nonquotable contingent payments. 

The noncontingent component is treated as a separate debt 
instrument and is taxed under the general OID rules (including 
the noncontingent bond method if the separate debt instrument 
provides for quotable contingent payments). However, no interest 
payments on the separate debt instrument are qualified stated 
interest payments and the de minimis rules do not apply to the 
separate debt instrument. The issue price of the separate debt 
instrument is the issue price of the overall debt instrument. 
See the discussion below for the determination of the stated 
principal amount and the imputed principal amount of the overall 
debt instrument for purposes of section 1274. 

In general, a nonquotable contingent payment is not taken 
into account until the payment is made. When a nonquotable 
contingent payment (other than a contingent payment accompanied 
by a payment of adequate stated interest) is made, a portion of 
the payment is treated as principal, based on the amount 
determined by discounting the payment at the AFR from the payment 
date to the issue date, and the remainder is treated as interest. 
Special rules are provided if a nonquotable contingent payment 
becomes fixed more than 6 months before it is due.

D. Tax-Exempt Obligations 



The proposed regulations provide special rules for tax-
exempt obligations. The IRS and Treasury believe that, given the 
limited exclusion provided in section 103, it is generally 
inappropriate to treat payments on a property right embedded in a 
tax-exempt obligation as interest on an obligation of a State or 
political subdivision (i.e., as tax-exempt interest). Therefore, 
while the noncontingent bond method generally applies to tax-
exempt contingent payment obligations, all positive adjustments 
are treated as taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the 
obligation rather than as interest. Negative adjustments are 
treated as reducing tax-exempt interest, and, therefore, are 
generally not taken into account as deductible losses. If 
negative adjustments on a tax-exempt obligation exceed the total 
tax-exempt interest a holder receives or accrues on a tax-exempt 
obligation, the excess is treated as loss from the sale or 
exchange of the obligation. This rule is similar to the rule 
that applies to exchange gains and losses on tax-exempt 
obligations under  1.988-3(c)(2). In addition, the proposed 
regulations provide that the projected yield determined for a 
tax-exempt obligation may not exceed the greater of the yield on 
the obligation determined without regard to contingent payments 
and the tax-exempt AFR that applies to the obligation. If the 
projected payment schedule results in a higher yield, projected 
payments must be reduced appropriately. 




E. Cross Border Transactions



The IRS and Treasury are concerned about various issues 
relating to the treatment of foreign holders of contingent 
payment debt instruments. For example, the IRS and Treasury are 
concerned about the possibility for tax avoidance that may arise 
when a contingent payment debt instrument is structured with 
payments that approximate the yield on an equity security. The 
IRS and Treasury invite comments on this issue and other issues 
concerning the proper taxation of foreign holders of contingent 
payment debt instruments issued by U.S. persons or U.S. holders 
of contingent payment debt instruments issued by foreign persons. 



Section 1.1274-2 Imputed Principal Amount 



In general, the issue price of a debt instrument subject to 
section 1274 is determined by reference to the instrument's 
imputed principal amount. The 1992 proposed regulations under 
section 1274 provided that, in the case of a contingent payment 
debt instrument, the imputed principal amount of the debt 
instrument was the present value of the fixed payments plus the 
fair market value of the contingent payments. A number of 
commentators objected to the rule, especially because of the 
difficulty in valuing the contingent payments typically provided 
for in debt instruments subject to section 1274. Other 
commentators objected to the rule's effect on the buyer's basis 
in the property acquired and the seller's amount realized on the 
sale or exchange. In response to these comments, the final OID 
regulations reserved on the issue to allow further study and to 
coordinate the issue with the regulations relating to contingent 
payment debt instruments. 

Under the proposed regulations, the imputed principal amount 
of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to section 1274 
is the sum of the present values of the fixed payments and the 
present values of the projected amounts of any quotable 
contingent payments. Consistent with the treatment of the fixed 
payments and any quotable contingent payments as a separate debt 
instrument under  1.1275-4 of the proposed regulations, 
nonquotable contingent payments are not taken into account to 
determine the stated principal amount or the imputed principal 
amount of a contingent payment debt instrument. This rule is 
generally consistent with the 1986 proposed regulations under 
section 1274. 

The proposed regulations also provide that the imputed 
principal amount of a variable rate debt instrument that provides 
for payments at a single objective rate is determined by assuming 
that the payments on the debt instrument are the same as the 
payments on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument determined 
under  1.1275-5(e). 

The IRS and Treasury request comments on the effect of the 
proposed regulations on other provisions of the Code, including 
section 108(e)(11), which measures the amount of discharge of 
indebtedness income in a debt-for-debt exchange by the issue 
price of the newly issued debt instrument. 



Conforming Amendments to Section 483. 



The proposed regulations provide rules under section 483 for 
the treatment of contingent payments under a contract for the 
sale or exchange of property ( 1.483-4). In general, the rules 
are the same as the rules for a debt instrument subject to 
section 1274, except that a taxpayer takes interest into account 
under its own method of accounting. 



Section 1.1275-5 Variable Rate Debt Instruments. 



In response to comments, the proposed regulations include 
changes to the final regulations under  1.1275-5 regarding the 
treatment of variable rate debt instruments. The proposed 
regulations redefine an objective rate as a rate (other than a 
qualified floating rate) that is determined using a single fixed 
formula and that is based on objective financial or economic 
information. The rate, however, must not be based on information 
that is within the control of the issuer (or a related party) or 
that is, in general, unique to the circumstances of the issuer 
(or a related party), such as dividends, profits, or the value of 
the issuer's stock. The new definition of objective rate is 
broader than the definition in the final regulations and 
includes, for example, a rate based on changes in a general 
inflation index. 

The proposed regulations also make it clear that a variable 
rate debt instrument may not provide for any contingent payments 
other than certain variable rates of interest. Finally, the 
proposed regulations clarify the treatment of a variable rate 
debt instrument under  1.1275-5(e)(2). In general, a variable 
rate debt instrument described in  1.1275-5(e)(2) is treated like 
a fixed payment debt instrument for purposes of OID and qualified 
stated interest accruals. The changes to  1.1275-5(e)(2) clarify 
the final OID regulations and, therefore, are proposed to be 
effective for debt instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994. 

Because of the special rules for tax-exempt contingent 
payment obligations in the proposed regulations, the IRS and 
Treasury request comments on the definition of an objective rate 
for tax-exempt obligations under  1.1275-5(c)(5).

Section 1.1275-6 Integration 



Many commentators suggested that the integration of 
contingent payment debt instruments with associated hedges 
provides the best method of taxing contingent payment debt 
instruments that are hedged. The proposed regulations respond to 
this suggestion by providing for the integration of contingent or 
variable rate debt instruments with certain financial instruments 
( 1.1275-6). The integration rules are issued under the 
authority of section 1275(d), and until the proposed regulations 
under  1.1275-6 are finalized, the integration rules are not a 
permissible means of determining the character and timing of 
income, deductions, gains, and losses. 

The rules in the proposed regulations are modeled after the 
integration rules of section 988(d) and  1.988-5(a). The rules 
in the proposed regulations, however, have been modified to 
reflect the different policy concerns underlying the rules for 
taking currency gain or loss into account and for taking interest 
income or deductions into account. The IRS and Treasury intend 
to make conforming changes to  1.988-5(a) and request comments on 
the extent to which  1.988-5(a) should be modified to conform to 
the proposed regulations. 

The integration rules apply to qualifying debt instruments, 
which are defined as contingent payment debt instruments, 
variable rate debt instruments, and the synthetic debt 
instruments that are the result of integration under the proposed 
regulations. Thus, the integration rules do not apply to fixed 
rate debt instruments. 

For a financial instrument to qualify as a hedge under the 
proposed regulations (a  1.1275-6 hedge), the combined cash flows 
of the qualifying debt instrument and the financial instrument 
must permit the calculation of a yield to maturity or must be the 
same as the cash flows on a variable rate debt instrument that 
pays interest at a qualified floating rate or rates. Thus, the 
proposed regulations generally require a perfect hedge. Section 
1.1275-6 hedges, however, are not limited to hedging transactions 
as defined in  1.1221-2(b). For example, a  1.1275-6 hedge need 
not reduce risk from all of the operations of a business. A debt 
instrument held by a taxpayer cannot be a  1.1275-6 hedge of a 
debt instrument issued by the taxpayer and a debt instrument 
issued by a taxpayer cannot be a  1.1275-6 hedge of a debt 
instrument held by the taxpayer. Physical assets, such as 
inventory, generally will not be treated as  1.1275-6 hedges 
because they do not provide the predictable cash flows necessary 
to create a perfect hedge. A supply or sales contract, however, 
may qualify as a  1.1275-6 hedge. Stock does not qualify as a 
 1.1275-6 hedge. 

To qualify as an integrated transaction, the taxpayer must 
issue or acquire a qualifying debt instrument, enter into a 
 1.1275-6 hedge, and meet six requirements. First, the taxpayer 
must satisfy the identification requirements of the proposed 
regulations, such as by entering a description of the qualifying 
debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge in its books and records. 
Second, the  1.1275-6 hedge must not be with a related party 
(other than a member of the same consolidated group making the 
separate-entity election under  1.1221-2(d)). Third, the same 
taxpayer must enter into the qualifying debt instrument and the 
 1.1275-6 hedge. Fourth, if the taxpayer is a foreign person 
engaged in a U.S. trade or business who issues or acquires the 
qualifying debt instrument or enters into the  1.1275-6 hedge 
through the trade or business, all items of income and expense 
associated with the debt instrument or hedge (other than interest 
expense that is subject to  1.882-5) must be effectively 
connected with the U.S. trade or business. Fifth, the qualifying 
debt instrument, any other debt instrument that is part of the 
same issue as the qualifying debt instrument, or the  1.1275-6 
hedge cannot have been part of an integrated transaction that was 
previously legged out of by the taxpayer. Finally, the  1.1275-6 
hedge must be entered into by the taxpayer on or after the date 
the taxpayer issues or acquires the qualifying debt instrument. 
If the taxpayer meets these requirements, the qualifying debt 
instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge are integrated and the 
resulting synthetic debt instrument is taxed accordingly. 

The Commissioner may require integration if a qualifying 
debt instrument and a financial instrument have, in substance, 
the same combined cash flows as a fixed or variable rate debt 
instrument. Therefore, even if the taxpayer fails one or more of 
the requirements for integration, the Commissioner may integrate 
a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument. For 
example, if the taxpayer fails to meet the identification 
requirements, or enters into a hedge with a related party, the 
Commissioner may integrate the transaction. The Commissioner 
also may integrate a transaction even if the hedge is not 
perfect. Thus, taxpayers may not avoid integration by altering 
the hedge so that there is a small amount of basis risk or the 
payments under the hedge do not fully match the payments on the 
qualifying debt instrument. The Commissioner will not integrate 
a debt instrument with an imperfect hedge, however, if the 
taxpayer retains substantial risk. 

The proposed regulations provide rules for legging into and 
legging out of an integrated transaction. Legging into an 
integrated transaction generally means entering into the hedge 
after the qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired by the 
taxpayer. If a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction, the 
qualifying debt instrument is subject to the separate transaction 
rules up to the leg-in date, except that the day before the leg-
in date is treated as the end of an accrual period for purposes 
of computing OID and interest accruals on the qualifying debt 
instrument. 

After the taxpayer legs in, the qualifying debt instrument 
and the  1.1275-6 hedge are integrated. Built-in gain or loss on 
the qualifying debt instrument is not treated as realized on the 
leg-in date (contrary to the rule for currency gain or loss in 
 1.988-5(a)(6)(i)). Because the built-in gain or loss will be 
reflected in the accruals on the synthetic debt instrument, the 
built-in gain or loss on the leg-in date will be recognized over 
the term of the synthetic debt instrument.

This approach allows taxpayers to alter the timing of income or deductions on a qualifying debt instrument. For example,
a taxpayer expecting a large positive adjustment on a contingent payment debt instrument before the maturity date
can spread the adjustment over the remaining term of the debt instrument by legging into an integrated transaction.
Other approaches to legging in, however, create similar opportunities. For example, an approach that would mark
a qualifying debt instrument to market and defer any built-in gain or loss would present even greater opportunities
for deferral. Requiring mark-to-market gain or loss to be taken into account immediately would provide opportunities
for acceleration. The IRS and Treasury believe that taking the built-in gain or loss into account over the term of the
qualifying debt instrument produces the most reasonable result. To prevent abuse, however, the proposed regulations
include a special rule providing that if a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction with a principal purpose of
deferring or accelerating income, the Commissioner may treat the qualifying debt instrument as sold or otherwise
terminated and reacquired or reissued on the leg-in date or may refuse to allow integration. 

Legging out of an integrated transaction generally means disposing of or otherwise terminating the  1.1275-6
hedge or the qualifying debt instrument. If the Commissioner has integrated a qualifying debt instrument and a financial
instrument, the taxpayer is treated as legging out only if the taxpayer ceases to meet the requirements for Commissioner
integration. If a taxpayer legs out, the synthetic debt instrument is treated as sold or otherwise disposed of for
its fair market value and any income, deduction, gain, or loss is taken into account immediately. The component the
taxpayer retains (either the  1.1275-6 hedge or the qualifying debt instrument) is treated as immediately
reacquired for, or entered into at, its fair market value on the leg-out date. In order to prevent taxpayers from inappropriately
generating tax losses by legging into and immediately legging out of an integrated transaction, the proposed regulations
contain a wash sale rule that disallows losses if the taxpayer legs out within 30 days of legging into an integrated
transaction. 

If a qualifying debt instrument and a  1.1275-6 hedge are integrated, the instruments are no longer subject
to the rules that govern each instrument separately, except as specifically provided in the regulations or by publication
in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Instead, the instruments are subject to the rules that would govern the synthetic
debt instrument. For example, the qualifying debt instrument and  1.1275-6 hedge are not treated as part
of a straddle under section 1092, but the interest on the synthetic debt instrument may be subject to the interest capitalization
rules of section 263(g). 

The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument. The
issue date of the synthetic debt instrument is the date the  1.1275-6 hedge is acquired. The term of the
synthetic debt instrument is the period from the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument to the maturity date of
the qualifying debt instrument. If the synthetic debt instrument is a borrowing, its stated redemption price at maturity
is the sum of all amounts paid or to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and on the  1.1275-6 hedge,
reduced by all amounts received or to be received on the hedge and any amounts that would be qualified stated interest
on the synthetic debt instrument. If the synthetic debt instrument is a loan, its stated redemption price at maturity
is the sum of all amounts received or to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6
hedge, reduced by all amounts paid or to be paid on the hedge and any amounts that would be qualified stated interest
on the synthetic debt instrument. 

The rules for determining the stated redemption price at maturity are designed to cover situations where payments
on the hedge move inversely to the payments on the qualifying debt instrument. For example, if a holder of a qualifying
debt instrument purchases an option to hedge the debt instrument, the amount paid by the holder must be taken into account
as an adjustment to the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity. 

Separate transaction treatment is required for certain limited purposes. For example, the rules of sections 871(a),
881, 1441, and 1442 must be applied on a separate transaction basis. Similarly, any information reporting rules for
the qualifying debt instrument continue to apply as if the qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6
hedge were not part of an integrated transaction. The IRS and Treasury request comments on whether the regulations
should specifically provide separate transaction treatment for other purposes. The IRS and Treasury also request
comments on whether rules similar to  1.6045-1(d)(6)(iii) of the proposed regulations (regarding broker
reporting of an integrated transaction under  1.988-5) should be adopted for an integrated transaction
under  1.1275-6. 

The IRS and Treasury intend to propose rules coordinating  1.1275-6 with section 475. Comments are requested
on this issue. 



Proposed Effective Date 



In general, the proposed regulations in this document are proposed to be effective for debt instruments issued on
or after the date that is 60 days after the date final regulations are published in the 

Federal Register

. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 



Comments and Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public
inspection and copying.

Par. 2. 

Section 1.483-4 is added to read as follows: 



 1.483-4 



Contingent payments. 



(a) 

In general. 

If a contract for the sale or exchange of property subject to section 483 (the overall contract) provides for one or
more contingent payments, interest under the contract is generally computed and accounted for under rules similar
to those that would be applicable if the contract were a debt instrument subject to  1.1275-4(c). Consequently,
all noncontingent payments and quotable contingent payments (within the meaning of  1.1275-4(b)(4)(i))
under the overall contract are treated as if made under a separate contract, and interest accruals on this separate
contract are computed under rules similar to those contained in  1.1275-4(c)(3). Each nonquotable contingent
payment (within the meaning of  1.1275-4(b)(4)(ii)), if any, under the overall contract is characterized
as principal and interest under rules similar to those contained in  1.1275-4(c)(4). However, any interest,
or amount treated as interest, on a contract subject to this section is taken into account by a taxpayer under the taxpayer's
regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). 

(b) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

Example 1. Deferred payment sale with contingent interest_(i) Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, A sells depreciable personal property to B. As consideration for the sale, B issues to A a debt instrument
with a maturity date of December 31, 2000. The debt instrument provides for a principal payment of $200,000 on the maturity
date, and a payment of interest on December 31 of each year equal to a percentage of the total gross income derived from
the property in that year. However, the total interest payable on the debt instrument over its entire term is limited
to a maximum of $50,000. Assume that the short-term applicable Federal rate on January 1, 1996, is 4 percent, compounded
annually, and the mid-term applicable Federal rate on January 1, 1996, is 5 percent, compounded annually. 

(ii) 

Treatment of noncontingent payment as separate contract. 

Each contingent payment of interest is a nonquotable contingent payment (within the meaning of  1.1275-4(b)(4)(ii)).
Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, for purposes of applying section 483 to the debt instrument, the
right to the noncontingent payment of $200,000 at maturity is treated as a separate contract. The amount of unstated
interest on this separate contract is equal to $43,295, which is the amount by which the amount of this deferred payment
under the contract ($200,000) exceeds the present value of the deferred payment ($156,705), calculated using the
test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually (the mid-term applicable Federal rate on the date of the sale). The $200,000
payment at maturity is thus treated as consisting of a payment of interest of $43,295 and a payment of principal of $156,705.
The interest is includible in A's gross income, and deductible by B, under their respective methods of accounting.


(iii) 

Treatment of contingent payments. 

Assume that the amount of the contingent payment that is paid on December 31, 1996, is $20,000. Under paragraph (a)
of this section, the $20,000 payment is treated as a payment of principal of $19,231 (the present value, as of the date
of sale, of the $20,000 payment, calculated using a test rate equal to 4 percent, compounded annually) and a payment
of interest of $769. The $769 interest payment is includible in A's gross income, and deductible by B, in their respective
taxable years in which December 31, 1996 occurs. The amount treated as principal gives B additional basis in the property
on December 31, 1996. The remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument are accounted for similarly, using
a test rate of 4 percent, compounded annually, for the payments made on December 31, 1997, and December 31, 1998, and
a test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually, for the payments made on December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000. 



Example 2. Contingent stock payout_

(i) 

Facts. 

M Corporation and N Corporation each owns one-half of the stock of O Corporation. On January 1, 1996, pursuant to a reorganization
qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(B), M contracts to acquire the one-half interest of O held by N for an initial distribution
on that date of 30,000 shares of M voting stock, and a non- assignable right to receive up to 10,000 additional shares
of M's voting stock during the next 3 years, provided the net profits of O exceed certain amounts specified in the contract.
No interest is provided for in the contract. No additional shares are received in 1996 or in 1997. In 1998, the annual
earnings of O exceed the specified amount and on December 31, 1998, an additional 3,000 M voting shares are transferred
to N. Assume that the fair market value of the 3,000 shares on December 31, 1998, is $300,000 and that the short-term
applicable Federal rate on January 1, 1996, is 4 percent, compounded annually. Assume also that M and N are calendar
year taxpayers. 

(ii) 

Allocation of interest. 

Assume that the right to receive the additional shares is a nonquotable contingent payment (within the meaning of
 1.1275-4(b)(4)(ii)). Section 1274 does not apply to the right to receive the additional shares because
the right is not a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. As a result, the transfer of the 3,000 M voting shares
to N is a deferred payment subject to section 483 and a portion of the shares is treated as unstated interest under that
section. The amount of interest allocable to the shares is an amount equal to the excess of $300,000 (the fair market
value of the shares on December 31, 1998) over $266,699 (the present value of $300,000, determined by discounting
the payment at the test rate of 4 percent, compounded annually, from December 31, 1998, to January 1, 1996). As a result,
the amount of interest allocable to the payment of the shares is $33,301 ($300,000 - $266,699). Both M and N take the
interest into account in 1998. 




(c)

Stated interest at an objective rate. 

For purposes of 
paragraph (c) of this section, the imputed principal amount of a 
variable rate debt instrument (within the meaning of 
 1.1275-5(a)) that provides for stated interest at a single 
objective rate is determined by assuming that the debt instrument 
provides for a fixed rate that reflects the yield that is 
reasonably expected for the instrument. This paragraph (f)(2) is 
effective for debt instruments issued on or after the date that 
is 60 days after final regulations are published in the 

Federal 
Register

. 



(g) 

Treatment of contingent payment debt instruments. 

For 
purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the stated principal 
amount of a debt instrument that provides for one or more 
contingent payments is the sum of the noncontingent principal 
payments and the projected amounts of any quotable contingent 
principal payments (as determined under  1.1275-4(b)(4)(i)). The 
imputed principal amount of the debt instrument is the sum of the 
present value of each noncontingent payment and the present value 
of the projected amount of each quotable contingent payment. For 
additional rules relating to a debt instrument that provides for 
one or more contingent payments, see  1.1275-4. This paragraph 
(g) is effective for debt instruments issued on or after the date 
that is 60 days after final regulations are published in the 


Federal Register

Par. 7. 

Section 1.1275-4 is added to read as follows: 




 1.1275-4

Contingent payment debt instruments. 





(a) 

Applicability_

(1) 

In general. 

Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this section applies to any 
debt instrument that provides for one or more contingent 
payments. In general, paragraph (b) of this section applies to a 
contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for money or 
publicly traded property and paragraph (c) of this section 
applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that is issued 
for nonpublicly traded property. Paragraph (d) of this section 
provides special rules for tax-exempt obligations. If a taxpayer 
holds (or issues) a contingent payment debt instrument that the 
taxpayer hedges, see  1.1275-6 for the treatment of the debt 
instrument and the hedge by the taxpayer. 



(2) 

Exceptions. 

This section does not apply to_(i) A debt instrument that has an issue price determined 
under section 1273(b)(4);

<TEXT>
 


(ii) A variable rate debt instrument (as defined in 
 1.1275-5); 



(iii) A debt instrument subject to  1.1272-1(c) (a debt 
instrument that provides for an alternative payment schedule (or 
schedules) applicable upon the occurrence of a contingency (or 
contingencies)); 



(iv) A debt instrument subject to section 988 (except as 
provided in section 988 and the regulations thereunder); or 



(v) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies 
(certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain 
other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration). 



(3) 

Insolvency and default. 

A payment is not contingent 
merely because of the possibility of impairment by insolvency, 
default, or similar circumstances. 



(4) 

Convertible debt instruments. 

A debt instrument does 
not provide for contingent payments merely because it provides 
for a right to convert the debt instrument into the stock of the 
issuer, into the stock or debt of a related party (within the 
meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), or into cash or other 
property in an amount equal to the approximate value of such 
stock or debt. 



(5) 

Remote and incidental contingencies. 

A payment on a 
debt instrument is not a contingent payment if, as of the issue 
date, the contingency is either remote or incidental. A 
contingency is remote if there is either a remote likelihood that 
the contingency will occur or a remote likelihood that the 
contingency will not occur. A contingency is incidental if the 
potential amount of the payment under any reasonably expected 
market conditions is insignificant relative to the total expected 
payments on the debt instrument. 



(b) 

Noncontingent bond method_

(1) 

Applicability. 

The 
noncontingent bond method described in paragraph (b) of this 
section applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that has 
an issue price determined under  1.1273-2 (e.g., a contingent 
payment debt instrument that is issued for money or publicly 
traded property). The noncontingent bond method also applies to 
a contingent payment debt instrument that has an issue price 
determined under  1.1274-2(b)(3) (a contingent payment debt 
instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation). 



(2) 

In general. 

Under the noncontingent bond method, 
interest on a debt instrument must be taken into account whether 
or not the amount of any payment is fixed or determinable in the 
taxable year. The amount of interest that is taken into account 
for each accrual period is determined by constructing a projected 
payment schedule for the debt instrument and applying rules 
similar to those for accruing OID on a noncontingent debt 
instrument. The projected payment schedule is determined as of 
the issue date and is based on forward prices, if readily 
available, or on the projected pattern of expected payments and a 
projected yield. If the actual amount of a contingent payment is 
not equal to the projected amount, appropriate adjustments are 
made to reflect the difference. 



(3) 

Description of method. 

The following steps describe how 
to compute the amount of income, deductions, gain, and loss under 
the noncontingent bond method. 



(i) 

Step one: Determine a projected payment schedule. 

Determine the projected payment schedule for the debt instrument 
as of the debt instrument's issue date under the rules of 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 



(ii) 

Step two: Determine the projected yield. 

Based on the 
issue price of the debt instrument and the projected payment 
schedule, determine the projected yield of the debt instrument in 
the manner described in  1.1272-1(b)(1)(i). 



(iii) 

Step three: Determine the daily portions of interest. 

Determine the daily portions of interest on the debt instrument 
for a taxable year as follows. The amount of interest that 
accrues in each accrual period is the product of the projected 
yield of the debt instrument (properly adjusted for the length of 
the accrual period) and the debt instrument's adjusted issue 
price at the beginning of the accrual period. See paragraph 
(b)(7)(ii) of this section for rules for determining the adjusted 
issue price of the debt instrument. The daily portions of 
interest are determined by allocating to each day in the accrual 
period the ratable portion of the interest that accrues in the 
accrual period. Except as modified by paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of 
this section, the daily portions of interest are includible in 
income by a holder for each day in the holder's taxable year on 
which the holder held the debt instrument, and are deductible by 
the issuer for each day during the issuer's taxable year on which 
the issuer was primarily liable on the debt instrument. 



(iv) 

Step four: Adjust the amount of income or deductions 
for differences between projected and actual contingent payments. 


Make appropriate adjustments to the amount of income or 
deductions attributable to the debt instrument in a taxable year 
for any differences between projected and actual contingent 
payments. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section to determine the 
amount of an adjustment and the treatment of the adjustment. 



(4) 

Method of determining projected payment schedule. 

This 
paragraph (b)(4) provides rules for determining the projected 
payment schedule for a debt instrument. The projected payment 
schedule includes each noncontingent payment and the projected 
amount of each contingent payment. The schedule is determined as 
of the issue date and remains fixed throughout the term of the 
debt instrument (except under special rules that apply to a 
payment that is fixed more than 6 months before it is due under 
paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section). Under the rules of 
section 6001, taxpayers must maintain adequate contemporaneous 
records to support the projected payment schedule. 



(i) 

Quotable contingent payments_

(A) 

In general. 

If a 
right to a contingent payment is substantially similar to a 
property right for which forward price quotes are readily 
available (a quotable contingent payment), the projected amount 
of the contingent payment is equal to the forward price of the 
property right. The forward price of a property right is an 
amount one party would agree, as of the issue date, to pay an 
unrelated party for the property right on the settlement date 
(e.g., the date payments under the property right are to be 
made). For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a 
property right includes a right, an obligation, or a combination 
of rights or obligations. 



(B) 

Quotes readily available. 

For purposes of paragraph 
(b)(4)(i) of this section, quotes are readily available for a 
property right if, at any time during the 60-day period ending 30 
days after the issue date, one or more quotations for a price on 
the property right are readily available from brokers, traders, 
or dealers. 



(C) 

Substantially similar. 

A right to a contingent payment 
is substantially similar to a property right if, under reasonably 
expected market conditions, the value and timing of the amount to 
be paid or received pursuant to the property right (whether in 
the form of a cash payment or the delivery of property) are 
expected to be substantially the same as the value and timing of 
the contingent payment.

(D) 

Special rule for contingent payments substantially 
similar to options. 

A right to a contingent payment that is 
substantially similar to an option or combination of options, and 
that is not otherwise a quotable contingent payment, is treated 
as a quotable contingent payment if spot price quotations for the 
option or options are readily available. The projected amount of 
the contingent payment is the spot price of the option or options 
on the issue date compounded at the applicable Federal rate for 
the debt instrument (within the meaning of  1.1274-4(b)) from the 
issue date to the date the payment is due. 

(E) 

Reasonable determination of projected amounts. 

The 
projected amounts of quotable contingent payments may be 
determined based on either the bid, ask, or midpoint price quotes 
of the substantially similar property rights, provided the 
determination is reasonable and is made on a consistent basis. 
If price quotations vary among different quotation sources, any 
reasonable quotation may be used. If a right to a contingent 
payment is substantially similar to more than one combination of 
property rights for which forward price quotes are readily 
available (or options for which spot prices are readily 
available), any reasonable combination may be used. 

(ii) 

Quotes not readily available. 

If a debt instrument 
provides for one or more contingent payments that are not 
described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section (nonquotable 
contingent payments), the projected amount of each contingent 
payment on the debt instrument is determined as follows. First, 
determine the projected amount of each quotable contingent 
payment under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. Second, 
determine the projected yield of the debt instrument. The 
projected yield is a reasonable rate for the debt instrument. A 
reasonable rate is a rate that, as of the issue date, reflects 
general market conditions, the credit quality of the issuer, and 
the terms and conditions of the debt instrument (e.g., the 
existence of collateral securing the debt instrument or the 
uncertainty inherent in the contingent payments). A reasonable 
rate is never less than, and may substantially exceed, the 
applicable Federal rate for the debt instrument (within the 
meaning of  1.1274-4(b)), and may not be less than the yield on 
the debt instrument based on the projected payment schedule set 
without regard to the nonquotable contingent payments. Third, 
select a projected amount for each nonquotable contingent payment 
so that the projected payment schedule results in the projected 
yield and reasonably reflects the relative expected values of the 
nonquotable contingent payments.

(iii) 

Debt instruments similar to variable rate debt 
instruments. 

Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of 
this section, the projected payment schedules for certain debt 
instruments similar to variable rate debt instruments are 
determined as follows: 

(A) 

Single quotable contingent payment at maturity. 

If a 
debt instrument would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument 
under  1.1275-5 except that it provides for a single quotable 
contingent payment at maturity, the projected payment schedule is 
determined as follows. First, construct the equivalent fixed 
rate debt instrument for the debt instrument under the principles 
of  1.1275-5(e), disregarding the contingent payment at maturity. 
Second, determine the projected amount of the contingent payment 
at maturity in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section. Third, set the projected payment schedule by combining 
the payment schedule for the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument with the projected amount of the contingent payment. 

(B) 

Principal not fully guaranteed. 

If a debt instrument 
would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under  1.1275-5 
except that it does not meet the principal payment requirement of 
 1.1275-5(a)(2), the projected payment schedule is determined by 
constructing the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the 
debt instrument under the principles of  1.1275-5(e). 

(iv) 

Issuer/holder consistency. 

The projected payment 
schedule used by the issuer to compute interest accruals and 
adjustments determines the interest accruals and adjustments of 
the holder. The issuer must provide the projected payment 
schedule to the holder in a manner consistent with the issuer 
disclosure rules of  1.1275-2(e). If the issuer does not create 
a projected payment schedule for a debt instrument or the payment 
schedule set by the issuer is unreasonable, the holder of the 
debt instrument must set the projected payment schedule under the 
rules of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A holder that sets 
its own projected payment schedule must explicitly disclose this 
fact and the reason why the holder set its own schedule (e.g., 
why the projected payment schedule prepared by the issuer is 
unreasonable). Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, 
the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the 
holder's timely filed federal income tax return for the taxable 
year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument. 

(v) 

Issuer's determination respected. 

The issuer's 
determination of the projected payment schedule will be respected 
unless the schedule is unreasonable. A projected payment 
schedule will generally be considered unreasonable if the 
schedule is set with a purpose to accelerate or defer interest 
accruals on the debt instrument. In determining whether a 
projected payment schedule is unreasonable, consideration will be 
given to whether the interest on the debt instrument determined 
under the projected payment schedule has a significant effect on 
the issuer's or holder's U.S. tax liability. 

(vi) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section. In each example, 
assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument 
for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, 
however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. 






Example 1. Contingent payment substantially similar to an 
option

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, W corporation issues for 
$1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. 
The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000,000, 
payable at maturity. The debt instrument also provides for a 
payment at maturity equal to $10,000 times the increase, if any, 
in the value of a nationally known composite index of stocks from 
January 1, 1996, to the maturity date. 

(ii) 

Projected payment schedule. 

Under paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt 
instrument consists of the $1,000,000 payment at maturity plus 
the projected amount of the contingent payment at maturity. The 
right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a 
long call option on the index that is exercisable only on 
December 31, 2000. Thus, if quotes for the forward price of the 
option are readily available, the projected amount of the 
contingent payment is the forward price of the option. If quotes 
for the forward price are not readily available and quotes for 
the spot price of the option are readily available, the projected 
amount of the contingent payment is the option's spot price on 
the issue date compounded at the applicable Federal rate for the 
debt instrument from the issue date to the maturity date. 



Example 2. Contingent payment substantially similar to a 
forward contract

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, X corporation 
issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 
31, 2005. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of 
interest at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity 
equal to $1,000,000, plus the excess, if any, of the price of 
1,000 units of a commodity on the maturity date over $350,000, or 
less the excess, if any, of $350,000 over the price of 1,000 
units of the commodity on the maturity date. 

(ii) 

Projected payment schedule. 

Under paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt 
instrument consists of ten annual payments of $60,000 and a 
projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. The 
right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a 
right to a payment of $1,000,000 combined with a forward contract 
for the purchase of 1,000 units of the commodity for $350,000 on 
December 31, 2005. Assume forward price quotes to purchase the 
commodity on December 31, 2005, are readily available on the 
issue date. 

(A) Assume that on the issue date the forward price to 
purchase 1,000 units of the commodity on December 31, 2005, is 
$350,000. The projected amount of the contingent payment is 
$1,000,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base amount and no 
additional amount to be received or paid under the forward 
contract. Although the amount to be received or paid under the 
forward contract is projected to be zero, the contingency is not 
incidental (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section) because the potential amount to be received or paid 
based on the forward contract is not insignificant relative to 
the total expected payments on the debt instrument under any 
reasonably expected market conditions. 

(B) Assume, alternatively, that on the issue date the 
forward price to purchase 1,000 units of the commodity on 
December 31, 2005, is $370,000. The projected amount of the 
contingent payment is $1,020,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 
base amount plus the excess $20,000 of the forward price of the 
commodity over the purchase price of the commodity under the 
forward contract. 

(C) Assume, alternatively, that on the issue date the 
forward price to purchase 1,000 units of the commodity on 
December 31, 2005, is $330,000. The projected amount of the 
contingent payment is $980,000, consisting of the $1,000,000 base 
amount minus the excess $20,000 of the purchase price of the 
commodity under the forward contract over the forward price of 
the commodity.

Example 3. Contingent payment substantially similar to a 
combination of rights_

(i) 

Facts. 

Assume the same facts as in 


Example 2 

of this paragraph (b)(4)(vi), except that the debt 
instrument also provides for a cap and a floor on the contingent 
payment at maturity, so that the payment may not exceed 
$1,300,000 and may not be less than $700,000. 
(ii) 

Projected payment schedule. 

Under paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, the projected payment schedule for the debt 
instrument consists of ten annual payments of $60,000 and a 
projected amount for the contingent payment at maturity. The 
right to the contingent payment is substantially similar to a 
right to a payment of $1,000,000 combined with a forward contract 
for the purchase of 1,000 units of the commodity for $350,000 on 
December 31, 2005, and two options on 1,000 units of the 
commodity that are exercisable only on December 31, 2005: one a 
long put option with an exercise price of $50,000, and the other 
a short call option with an exercise price of $650,000. The 
projected amount of the contingent payment is determined by 
combining the forward prices of these property rights. 


Example 4. Nonquotable contingent payments

_(i) 

Facts. 

On 
January 1, 1996, Y issues for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that 
matures on December 31, 1999. The debt instrument has a stated 
principal amount of $1,000,000, payable at maturity, and provides 
for payments on December 31 of each year of $20,000 plus 5 
percent of Y's gross receipts, if any, for the year. Assume that 
a reasonable rate for the debt instrument (within the meaning of 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) is 7.5 percent, compounded 
annually. 
(ii) 

Projected yield. 


The debt instrument provides for 
nonquotable contingent payments. Under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of 
this section, the projected yield is 7.5 percent, compounded 
annually. 
(iii) 

Projected payment schedule. 

Assume that Y anticipates 
that it will have no gross receipts in 1996, but that it will 
have gross receipts in later years, and those gross receipts will 
grow each year for the next three years. Based on its business 
projections, Y believes that it is not unreasonable to expect 
that its gross receipts in 1998 and each year thereafter will 
grow by between 6 percent and 13 percent over the prior year. 
Thus, Y must take these expectations into account in establishing 
a projected payment schedule for the debt instrument that results 
in a yield of 7.5 percent, compounded annually. Accordingly, Y 
could reasonably set the following projected payment schedule for 
the debt instrument: 






 



Example 5. Debt instrument that provides for a variable 
rate of interest and a single quotable contingent payment at 
maturity_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, W corporation issues 
for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 
2000. The debt instrument has a stated principal amount of 
$1,000,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument also 
provides for semiannual payments of interest and a payment at 
maturity equal to $5,000 times the increase, if any, in the value 
of a nationally known composite index of stocks from January 1, 
1996, to the maturity date. The rate of interest on the debt 
instrument is the value of 6-month LIBOR on the payment date. On 
the issue date, the value of 6-month LIBOR is 4 percent, 
compounded semiannually. Assume that the payment at maturity 
based on the index is a quotable contingent payment. 
(ii) 

Projected payment schedule. 

Because the debt 
instrument would qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under 
 1.1275-5 except that it provides for a single quotable 
contingent payment at maturity, paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this 
section applies to the debt instrument. Under paragraph 
(b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the projected payment schedule is 
determined by first constructing the equivalent fixed rate debt 
instrument for the debt instrument. Under  1.1275-5(e), the 
equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument 
that provides for semiannual payments of interest at 4 percent, 
compounded semiannually. Next, the projected amount of the 
contingent payment is determined in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(4)(i) of this section. The right to the contingent payment 
based on the stock index is substantially similar to a long call 
option on the index that is exercisable only on December 31, 
2000. Thus, the projected amount of the contingent payment is 
the forward price of the option, assuming quotes for the forward 
price of the option are readily available. Finally, the 
projected payment schedule is determined, consisting of 10 
semiannual payments of interest at 4 percent and a payment at 
maturity equal to $1,000,000 plus the forward price of the option 
on the index.

(5) 

Qualified stated interest. 

No amounts payable on a debt 
instrument to which paragraph (b) of this section applies 
constitute qualified stated interest within the meaning of 
 1.1273-1(c). 
(6) 

Adjustments under the noncontingent bond method. 

This 
paragraph (b)(6) provides rules for the treatment of positive and 
negative adjustments under the noncontingent bond method. 
(i) 

Determination of positive and negative adjustments. 

If 
the amount of a contingent payment is more than the projected 
amount of the contingent payment, the difference is a positive 
adjustment on the date of the payment. If the amount of a 
contingent payment is less than the projected amount of the 
contingent payment, the difference is a negative adjustment on 
the date of the projected payment. 
(ii) 

Treatment of net positive adjustment. 

The amount, if 
any, by which total positive adjustments on a debt instrument in 
a taxable year exceed the total negative adjustments on the debt 
instrument in the taxable year is a net positive adjustment. A 
net positive adjustment is treated as additional interest for the 
taxable year. 
(iii) 

Treatment of net negative adjustment. 

The amount, if 
any, by which total negative adjustments on a debt instrument in 
a taxable year exceed the total positive adjustments on the debt 
instrument in the taxable year is a net negative adjustment. A 
taxpayer's net negative adjustment on a debt instrument for a 
taxable year is treated as follows: 
(A) 

Reduction of interest accruals. 

A net negative 
adjustment first reduces interest for the taxable year that the 
taxpayer would otherwise account for on the debt instrument under 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. 
(B) 

Ordinary income or loss. 

If the net negative adjustment 
exceeds the interest for the taxable year that the taxpayer would 
otherwise account for on the debt instrument under paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section, the excess is treated as ordinary 
loss by a holder and ordinary income by an issuer. However, the 
amount treated as ordinary loss by a holder is limited to the 
amount by which the holder's total interest inclusions on the 
debt instrument exceed the total amount of the holder's net 
negative adjustments treated as ordinary loss on the debt 
instrument in prior taxable years. The amount treated as 
ordinary income by an issuer is limited to the amount by which 
the issuer's total interest deductions on the debt instrument 
exceed the total amount of the issuer's net negative adjustments 
treated as ordinary income on the debt instrument in prior 
taxable years. 
(C) 

Carryforward. 

If the net negative adjustment exceeds 
the sum of the amounts treated by the taxpayer as a reduction of 
interest and as ordinary income or loss (as the case may be) on 
the debt instrument for the taxable year, the excess is a 
negative adjustment carryforward for the taxable year. 
(

1

) 

In general. 

Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(C)(

2

) of this section, a negative adjustment 
carryforward on a debt instrument for a taxable year is treated 
as a negative adjustment on the debt instrument on the first day 
of the succeeding taxable year.

) 

In year of sale, exchange, or retirement. 

Any negative 
adjustment carryforward on a debt instrument for a taxable year 
in which the debt instrument is sold, exchanged, or retired 
reduces the amount realized by the holder on the sale, exchange, 
or retirement. Any negative adjustment carryforward for a 
taxable year in which the debt instrument is retired is taken 
into account by the issuer as income from the discharge of 
indebtedness under section 61(a)(12). 
(iv) 

Cross references. 

If a holder has a basis in a debt 
instrument that is different than the debt instrument's adjusted 
issue price, the holder may have additional positive or negative 
adjustments under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. If the 
amount of a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months before 
the date it is due, the amount and timing of the adjustment are 
determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section. If all 
the remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument become 
fixed substantially contemporaneously, the timing of the 
adjustment is determined under paragraph (b)(9)(v) of this 
section. 
(v) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(6) of this section. In each example, 
assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument 
for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, 
however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. 





Example 1. Net negative adjustment_

(i) 

Facts. 

On June 13, 
1996, Z, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at 
original issue for $1,044. Assume that the debt instrument is 
subject to paragraph (b) of this section. The projected payment 
schedule provides for projected payments of $100 on December 31, 
1996, and $1,100 on December 31, 1997. Based on the projected 
payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest would be 
$56 for 1996 and $100 for 1997. 
(ii) 

Adjustment in 1996. 

Assume that the payment actually 
made on December 31, 1996, is $25, rather than the projected 
$100. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a 
negative adjustment of $75 on December 31, 1996, attributable to 
the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the 
amount of the projected payment. Because Z has no positive 
adjustments for 1996, Z has a net negative adjustment of $75 on 
the debt instrument for 1996. This net negative adjustment 
reduces to zero the $56 total daily portions of interest Z would 
otherwise include in income in 1996. Accordingly, Z has no 
interest income on the debt instrument for 1996. Because Z has 
no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable 
years, the remaining $19 of the net negative adjustment is a 
negative adjustment carryforward for 1996 that results in a 
negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997. 
(iii) 

Adjustments in 1997. 

Assume that the payment actually 
made on December 31, 1997, is $1,150, rather than the projected 
$1,100. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a 
positive adjustment of $50 on December 31, 1997, attributable to 
the difference between the amount of the actual payment and the 
amount of the projected payment. Because Z also has a negative 
adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997, Z has a net positive 
adjustment of $31 on the debt instrument for 1997 (the excess of 
the $50 positive adjustment over the $19 negative adjustment). 
Therefore, Z has $131 of interest income on the debt instrument 
for 1997 (the net positive adjustment plus the $100 total daily 
portions of interest that are taken into account by Z in that 
year). 


Example 2. Net negative adjustment at maturity_

(i) 

Facts. 


Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1 

of this paragraph 
(b)(6)(v), except that the payment actually made on December 31, 
1997, is $1,010, rather than the projected $1,100. 
(ii) 

Adjustments in 1997. 

Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, Z has a negative adjustment of $90 on December 31, 1997, 
attributable to the difference between the amount of the actual 
payment and the amount of the projected payment. In addition, Z 
has a negative adjustment of $19 on January 1, 1997. Because Z 
has no positive adjustments in 1997, Z has a net negative 
adjustment of $109 for 1997. This net negative adjustment 
reduces to zero the $100 total daily portions of interest Z would 
otherwise include in income for 1997. Therefore, Z has no 
interest income on the debt instrument for 1997. Because Z has 
no interest inclusions on the debt instrument for prior taxable 
years, the remaining $9 of the net negative adjustment 
constitutes a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997 that 
reduces the amount realized by Z on retirement of the debt 
instrument. 



(7) 

Adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and retirement_

(i) 

In general. 

Paragraph (b)(7) of this section provides rules 
under the noncontingent bond method to determine the adjusted 
issue price of a debt instrument, the holder's basis in a debt 
instrument, and the amount of any contingent payment made on a 
scheduled retirement. Paragraph (b)(7) of this section also 
provides rules for an unscheduled retirement. In general, 
because any difference between the actual amount of a contingent 
payment and the projected amount of the payment is taken into 
account as an adjustment to income or deduction, the projected 
payments are treated as the actual payments for purposes of 
making adjustments to issue price and basis and determining the 
amount of any contingent payment made on a scheduled retirement. 
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, 
positive and negative adjustments are not taken into account for 
purposes of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. 
(ii) 

Definition of adjusted issue price. 

The adjusted issue 
price of a debt instrument is equal to the debt instrument's 
issue price, increased by the interest previously accrued on the 
debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section 
(determined without regard to any adjustments taken into account 
under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and decreased by the 
amount of any noncontingent payment and the projected amount of 
any contingent payment previously made on the debt instrument. 
See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section for special rules that 
apply when a contingent payment is fixed more than 6 months 
before it is due.

 
(iii) 

Adjustments to basis. 

A holder's basis in a debt 
instrument is increased by the interest previously accrued by the 
holder on the debt instrument under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this 
section (determined without regard to any adjustments taken into 
account under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section), and 
decreased by the amount of any noncontingent payment and the 
projected amount of any contingent payment previously made on the 
debt instrument to the holder. See paragraphs (b)(9)(i) and (ii) 
of this section for special rules that apply when basis is 
different than adjusted issue price or a contingent payment is 
fixed more than 6 months before it is due.

(iv) 

Amount realized on a scheduled retirement. 

For 
purposes of determining the amount realized by a holder and the 
repurchase price paid by the issuer on the scheduled retirement 
of a debt instrument, a holder is treated as receiving, and the 
issuer is treated as paying, the projected amount of any 
contingent payment due at maturity. The amount realized on a 
scheduled retirement of a debt instrument and the issuer's 
repurchase price on the retirement, however, may be reduced under 
paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section (regarding the 
treatment of negative adjustment carryforwards determined in the 
taxable year of the retirement). 
(v) 

Unscheduled retirements. 

An unscheduled retirement of a 
debt instrument (or the receipt of a pro-rata prepayment that is 
treated as a retirement of a portion of a debt instrument under 
 1.1275-2(f)) is treated as a sale or exchange of the debt 
instrument (or a pro rata portion of the debt instrument) by the 
holder to the issuer for the amount paid by the issuer to the 
holder. 
(vi) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(7) of this section. In each example, 
assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument 
for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, 
however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. 





Example 1. Adjusted issue price, adjusted basis, and 
retirement

_(i) 

Facts. 

Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1 

of 
paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section. 
(ii) 

Adjustment to issue price and basis. 

Based on the 
projected payment schedule, Z's total daily portions of interest 
on the debt instrument would be $56 for 1996. Therefore, the 
adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and Z's adjusted 
basis in the debt instrument are increased by this amount ($56), 
despite the fact that, under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this 
section, Z has a net negative adjustment for 1996 of $75 that 
reduces to zero the $56 total daily portions of interest 
otherwise accounted for by Z in that year. In addition, the 
adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and Z's adjusted 
basis in the debt instrument are decreased on December 31, 1996, 
by the projected amount of the payment on that date ($100). 
Thus, on January 1, 1997, Z's adjusted basis in the debt 
instrument and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument 
are $1,000. 
(iii) 

Retirement. 

Based on the projected payment schedule, 
Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument immediately before the 
payment at maturity is $1,100. Even though Z receives $1,150 at 
maturity, for purposes of determining the amount realized by Z on 
retirement of the debt instrument, Z is treated as receiving the 
projected amount of the contingent payment on December 31, 1997. 
Therefore, Z is treated as receiving $1,100 on December 31, 1997. 
Because Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument immediately 
before its retirement is $1,100, Z recognizes no gain or loss on 
the retirement. Z, however, does include $131 as interest income 
on the debt instrument in 1997. See 

Example 1

 of paragraph 
(b)(6)(v) of this section. 


Example 2. Negative adjustment carryforward for year of 
sale_

(i) 

Facts.

 Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1

 of 
paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that Z sells the debt 
instrument on January 1, 1997, for $1,075. 
(ii) 

Gain on sale. 

On the date the debt instrument is sold, 
Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,000. Because Z 
has a negative adjustment on the debt instrument on January 1, 
1997, of $19 under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(

1

) of this section, 
and has no positive adjustments on the debt instrument in 1997, Z 
has a net negative adjustment for 1997 of $19. Because Z has 
included no interest on the debt instrument in income in 1997 or 
previous years, the entire $19 net negative adjustment 
constitutes a negative adjustment carryforward for the taxable 
year of the sale. Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(

2

) of this 
section, the $19 negative adjustment carryforward reduces the 
amount realized by Z on the sale of the debt instrument from 
$1,075 to $1,056. Thus, Z has a gain on the sale of $56.

Example 3. Negative adjustment carryforward for year of 
retirement_

(i) 

Facts. 

Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1 

of 
paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section, except that the payment 
actually made on December 31, 1997, is $1,010, rather than the 
projected $1,100. Thus, Z will have a $9 negative adjustment 
carryforward for 1997, the year of retirement. See 

Example 2 

of 
paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this section. 
(ii) 

Loss on retirement. 

Immediately before the payment at 
maturity, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,100. 
Under paragraph (b)(7)(iv) of this section, Z is treated as 
receiving the projected amount of the contingent payment, or 
$1,100, as the payment at maturity. Under paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, however, this amount is 
reduced by any negative adjustment carryforward determined for 
the taxable year of retirement to calculate the amount Z realizes 
on retirement of the debt instrument. Thus, Z has a loss of $9 
on the retirement of the debt instrument, equal to the amount by 
which Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument ($1,100) exceeds 
the amount Z realizes on the retirement of the debt instrument 
($1,100 minus the $9 negative adjustment carryforward). 



(8) 

Character on sale, exchange, or retirement

_(i) 

Gain. 


Any gain recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or 
retirement of a debt instrument is interest income. 
(ii) 

Loss. 

Any loss recognized by a holder on the sale, 
exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument is ordinary loss 
to the extent that the holder's total interest inclusions on the 
debt instrument exceed the total net negative adjustments on the 
debt instrument the holder took into account as ordinary loss. 
Any additional loss is treated as loss from the sale, exchange, 
or retirement of the debt instrument. 
(iii) 

Special rule if there are no remaining contingent 
payments on the debt instrument. 

Notwithstanding paragraphs 
(b)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section, if, at the time of the sale, 
exchange, or retirement of the debt instrument, there are no 
remaining contingent payments due on the debt instrument, any 
gain or loss recognized by the holder on the debt instrument is 
gain or loss from the sale, exchange, or retirement of the debt 
instrument. 

(iv) 

Fixed but deferred payments. 

For purposes of paragraph 
(b)(8) of this section, a contingent payment that is fixed within 
the 6-month period ending on the due date of the payment is 
treated as a contingent payment even after the payment is fixed. 
See paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, under which a 
contingent payment that is fixed more than 6 months before it is 
due is not treated as a contingent payment after it is fixed. 
(v) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(8) of this section. In each example, 
assume that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument 
for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, 
however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. 





Example 1. Gain on sale

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1997, D, 
a calendar year taxpayer, sells a debt instrument that is subject 
to paragraph (b) of this section for $1,350. On that date, D has 
an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $1,200. In addition, 
D has a negative adjustment carryforward of $50 for 1996 that 
results in a negative adjustment of $50 on January 1, 1997, under 
paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(1) of this section. D has no positive 
adjustments on the debt instrument on January 1, 1997. 
(ii) 

Character of gain. 

Under paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, the $50 negative adjustment on January 1, 1997, results 
in a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997, the taxable year 
of the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, the negative adjustment 
carryforward reduces the amount realized by D on the sale of the 
debt instrument from $1,350 to $1,300. As a result, D realizes a 
$100 gain on the sale of the debt instrument, equal to the $1,300 
amount realized minus D's $1,200 adjusted basis in the debt 
instrument. Under paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the gain 
is interest income to D. 


Example 2. Ordinary loss on sale

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 
1996, E, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at 
original issue for $1,000. The debt instrument is a capital 
asset in the hands of E. The debt instrument provides for a 
payment of $1,000 at maturity on December 31, 2001, and for 
quotable contingent payments on December 31, 1997, 1999, and 
2001. The projected payment schedule provides for projected 
payments of $275 on December 31, 1997, $200 on December 31, 1999, 
and $1,127 on December 31, 2001. Thus, the projected yield on 
the debt instrument is 10 percent, compounded annually. Based on 
the projected payment schedule, the total daily portions of 
interest would be $100 for 1996, $110 for 1997, and $93.50 for 
1998. 
(ii) 

Adjustment for 1997. 

Assume that the payment actually 
made on December 31, 1997, is $150, rather than the projected 
$275. Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, E has a 
negative adjustment of $125 on December 31, 1997. Because E has 
no positive adjustments for 1997, E has a net negative adjustment 
of $125 on the debt instrument for 1997. This net negative 
adjustment reduces to zero the $110 total daily portions of 
interest E would otherwise include in income in 1997. 
Accordingly, E has no interest income on the debt instrument for 
1997. Because E had $100 of interest inclusions for 1996, the 
remaining $15 of the net negative adjustment is an ordinary loss 
to E for 1997. 



(iii) 

Determination of amount and character of loss on sale. 


Assume that E sells the debt instrument for $950 on December 31, 
1998. On that date, E has an adjusted basis in the debt 
instrument of $1,028.50 ($1,000 original basis, plus total daily 
portions of $100 for 1996, $110 for 1997, and $93.50 for 1998, 
minus the $275 projected amount of the December 31, 1997 
payment). As a result, E realizes a $78.50 loss on the sale of 
the debt instrument (the difference between the sales price and 
E's adjusted basis in the debt instrument). The total amount of 
E's interest inclusions on the debt instrument as of December 31, 
1998 ($100 in 1996 and $93.50 in 1998) exceeds the total amount 
of net negative adjustments on the debt instrument E treated as 
ordinary loss as of that date ($15 in 1997) by more than $78.50. 
Therefore, under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the $78.50 
loss on the debt instrument is treated as an ordinary loss by E. 


Example 3. Loss on sale of a debt instrument

_(i) 

Facts. 


Assume the same facts as in 

Example 2 

of this paragraph 
(b)(8)(v), except that the payment actually made on December 31, 
1997, is $0, rather than the projected $275. 
(ii) 

Adjustment for 1997. 

Under paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this 
section, E has a negative adjustment of $275 on December 31, 
1997. Because E has no positive adjustments for 1997, E has a 
net negative adjustment of $275 on the debt instrument for 1997. 
This net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $110 total daily 
portions of interest E would otherwise include in income in 1997. 
Accordingly, E has no interest income on the debt instrument for 
1997. Because E had $100 of interest inclusions for 1996, $100 
of the remaining $165 net negative adjustment is treated by E as 
an ordinary loss for 1997. The remaining $65 of the net negative 
adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1997 that 
results in a negative adjustment of $65 on January 1, 1998.

(iii) 

Determination of amount and character of loss on sale. 


Assume that E sells the debt instrument for $900 on January 1, 
1998. On that date, E has an adjusted basis in the debt 
instrument of $935 ($1,000 original basis, plus total daily 
portions of $100 for 1996 and $110 for 1997, minus the $275 
projected amount of the December 31, 1997 payment). Because E 
has no other adjustments for 1998, and E's interest inclusions on 
the debt instrument in prior taxable years do not exceed the 
total net negative adjustments E treated as ordinary loss in 
those years, the $65 negative adjustment on January 1, 1998, 
results in a negative adjustment carryforward of $65 for 1998. 
Under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C)(2) of this section, the $65 
negative adjustment carryforward reduces the amount E realizes on 
the sale of the debt instrument from $900 to $835. As a result, 
E realizes a $100 loss on the sale of the debt instrument (the 
difference between the amount realized and E's adjusted basis in 
the debt instrument). Because E's total interest inclusions on 
the debt instrument do not exceed the total net negative 
adjustments E treated as ordinary loss on the debt instrument, 
E's loss on the sale of the debt instrument is treated as a 
capital loss. 



(9) 

Operating rules. 

The rules of this paragraph (b)(9) notwithstanding any other rule of this paragraph (b). 
(i) 

Basis different than adjusted issue price. 

This 
paragraph (b)(9)(i) provides rules for a holder whose basis in a 
debt instrument is different than the adjusted issue price of the 
debt instrument (e.g., a subsequent holder that purchases the 
debt instrument for more or less than the instrument's adjusted 
issue price). 
(A) 

General rule. 

A holder whose basis in a debt instrument 
is different than the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument 
accrues interest under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and 
makes adjustments under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section 
based on the projected payment schedule determined as of the 
issue date of the debt instrument. However, upon acquiring the 
debt instrument, the holder must reasonably allocate any 
difference between the adjusted issue price and the basis to 
daily portions of interest or projected payments over the 
remaining term of the debt instrument. Allocations are taken 
into account under paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(B) and (C) of this 
section. 
(B) 

Basis greater than adjusted issue price. 

If a holder's 
basis in a debt instrument exceeds the debt instrument's adjusted 
issue price, the amount allocated to a daily portion of interest 
or to a projected payment is treated as a negative adjustment on 
the date the daily portion accrues or the payment is made. The 
holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is reduced by the 
amount the holder treats as a negative adjustment under this 
paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B). 
(C) 

Basis less than adjusted issue price. 

If a holder's 
basis in a debt instrument is less than the debt instrument's 
adjusted issue price, the amount allocated to a daily portion of 
interest or to a projected payment is treated as a positive 
adjustment on the date the daily portion accrues or the payment 
is made. The holder's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is 
increased by the amount the holder treats as a positive 
adjustment under this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(C). 
(D) 

Premium and discount rules do not apply. 

The rules for 
accruing premium and discount in sections 171, 1272(a)(7), 1276, 
and 1281 do not apply. Other rules of those sections continue to 
apply to the extent relevant. 
(E) 

Safe harbor for exchange listed debt instruments. 

If a 
contingent payment debt instrument is exchange listed property 
(within the meaning of  1.1273-2(f)(2)), it is reasonable for a 
holder of the debt instrument to allocate any difference between 
the holder's basis and the adjusted issue price of the debt 
instrument pro-rata to daily portions of interest (as determined 
under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) over the remaining 
term of the debt instrument. 
(F) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section. In each 
example, assume that the debt instrument described is a debt 
instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is 
intended, however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes 
a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. In addition, 
assume that each debt instrument is not exchange listed property. 





Example 1. Basis greater than adjusted issue price

_(i) 
Facts. On July 1, 1997, Z purchases for $1,405 a debt instrument 
that matures on December 31, 1998, and promises to pay on the 
maturity date $1,000 plus the increase, if any, in the price of a 
specified amount of a commodity from the issue date to the 
maturity date. The debt instrument was originally issued on 
January 1, 1996, for an issue price of $1,000. Z is a calendar 
year taxpayer. The projected payment schedule for the debt 
instrument (determined as of the issue date) provides for a 
single payment at maturity of $1,350. Thus, the debt instrument 
has a projected yield of 10.25 percent, compounded semiannually. 
At the time of the purchase, the debt instrument has an adjusted 
issue price of $1,162, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending 
on December 31 and June 30 of each year. The increase in the 
value of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price is due 
to an increase in the expected amount of the contingent payment 
and not to a decrease in market interest rates. 
(ii) 

Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted 
issue price. 

Z's basis in the debt instrument on July 1, 1997, 
is $1,405. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, Z 
allocates the $243 difference between basis ($1,405) and adjusted 
issue price ($1,162) to the contingent payment at maturity. Z's 
allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue 
price is reasonable because the increase in the value of the debt 
instrument over its adjusted issue price is due to an increase in 
the expected amount of the contingent payment. 
(iii) 

Treatment of debt instrument for 1997. 

Based on the 
projected payment schedule, $60 of interest accrues on the debt 
instrument from July 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997 (the product of 
the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on July 1, 1997 
($1,162) and the projected yield properly adjusted for the length 
of the accrual period (10.25 percent/2)). Z has no net negative 
or positive adjustments for 1997. Thus, Z includes in income $60 
of total daily portions of interest for 1997. On December 31, 
1997, Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,465 ($1,405 
original basis, plus total daily portions of $60 for 1997). 
(iv) 

Effect of allocation to contingent payment at maturity. 


Assume that the payment actually made on December 31, 1998, is 
$1,400, rather than the projected $1,350. Under paragraph 
(b)(6)(i) of this section, Z has a positive adjustment of $50 on 
December 31, 1998. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, 
Z has a negative adjustment of $243 on December 31, 1998. As a 
result, Z has a net negative adjustment of $193 for 1998. This 
net negative adjustment reduces to zero the $128 total daily 
portions of interest Z would otherwise include in income in 1998. 
Accordingly, Z has no interest income on the debt instrument for 
1998. Because Z had $60 of interest inclusions for 1997, $60 of 
the remaining $65 net negative adjustment is treated by Z as an 
ordinary loss for 1998. The remaining $5 of the net negative 
adjustment is a negative adjustment carryforward for 1998 that 
reduces the amount realized by Z on the retirement of the debt 
instrument from $1,350 to $1,345.

(v) 

Loss at maturity. 

On December 31, 1998, Z's basis in the debt instrument is $1,350 ($1,405 original basis, plus total daily portions
of $60 for 1997 and $128 for 1998, minus the negative adjustment of $243). As a result, Z realizes a loss of $5 on the retirement
of the debt instrument (the difference between the amount realized ($1,345) and Z's adjusted basis in the debt instrument
($1,350)). Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the $5 loss is treated as loss from the retirement of the debt
instrument. Consequently, Z realizes a total loss of $65 on the debt instrument for 1998 (a $60 ordinary loss and a $5
loss on the retirement of the debt instrument). 



Example 2. Basis less than adjusted issue price_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1998, Y purchases for $910 a debt instrument that pays 7 percent interest semiannually on June 30 and December
31 of each year, and that promises to pay on December 31, 2000, $1,000 plus or minus $10 times the positive or negative
difference, if any, between a specified amount and the value of an index on December 31, 2000. However, the payment
on December 31, 2000, may not be less than $650. The debt instrument was originally issued on January 1, 1996, for an
issue price of $1,000. Y is a calendar year taxpayer. The projected payment schedule for the debt instrument provides
for semiannual payments of $35 and a contingent payment at maturity of $1,175. On January 1, 1998, the debt instrument
has an adjusted issue price of $1,060, assuming semiannual accrual periods ending on December 31 and June 30 of each
year. Since the time the debt instrument was issued, market rates of interest on similar debt instruments have increased
from approximately 10 percent to approximately 13 percent. In addition, because of a decrease in the relevant index,
the expected value of the contingent payment has declined by about 9 percent. 

(ii) 

Allocation of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price. 

Y's basis in the debt instrument on January 1, 1998, is $910. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, Y must allocate
the $150 difference between basis ($910) and adjusted issue price ($1,060) to daily portions of interest or to projected
payments. These amounts will be positive adjustments taken into account at the time the daily portions accrue or the
payments are made. 

(A) Based on forward prices on January 1, 1998, Y determines that approximately $105 of the difference between basis
and adjusted issue price is allocable to the contingent payment. Y allocates the remaining $45 to daily portions of
interest on a pro-rata basis. This allocation is reasonable. 

(B) Assume alternatively that, based on yields of comparable debt instruments and its purchase price for the debt
instrument, Y determines that approximately $49 of the difference between basis and adjusted issue price is allocable
to daily portions of interest as follows: $13.32 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December
31, 1998; $16.15 to the daily portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 1999; and $19.53 to the daily
portions of interest for the taxable year ending December 31, 2000. Y allocates the remaining $101 to the contingent
payment at maturity. This allocation is reasonable. 



Example 3. Secondary holder sells debt instrument_

(i) 

Facts. 

Assume the same facts as in Example 2 of this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F) and that Y allocates $49 to daily portions of interest
and $101 to the contingent payment at maturity, on the same basis as in paragraph (ii)(B) of 

Example 2 

of this paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F). In 1998, Y has a total of $104.68 of daily portions of interest, receives two semiannual
payments of $35, and has a positive adjustment of $13.32 from the allocation. Thus, Y has $118 of interest income on
the debt instrument for 1998 ($104.68 of interest and a $13.32 net positive adjustment). On December 31, 1998, Y has
an adjusted basis of $958 in the debt instrument ($910 original basis, plus $104.68 total daily portions for 1998 and
the $13.32 positive adjustment, minus $70 interest payments for 1998), and the debt instrument has an adjusted issue
price of $1,094.68 ($1,060 adjusted issue price on January 1, 1998, plus $104.68 total daily portions for 1998, minus
$70 interest payments for 1998). 

(ii) 

Sale of debt instrument. 

Assume that Y sells the debt instrument for $950 on January 15, 1999. In 1999, Y has total daily portions of interest
on the debt instrument (using a semiannual accrual period ending June 30) of $4.47 and positive adjustments allocable
to the total daily portions of interest in 1999 of $0.64. Therefore, Y has $5.11 of interest income on the debt instrument
for 1999. On January 15, 1999, Y has an adjusted basis in the debt instrument of $963.11. As a result, Y realizes a $13.11
loss on the sale of the debt instrument. Under paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section, the loss is an ordinary loss.

(ii) 

Fixed but deferred contingent payments. 

This paragraph (b)(9)(ii) provides rules for computing interest accruals and adjustments under paragraph (b)(3)
of this section when the amount of a contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before the payment is due. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, a payment is treated as a fixed payment if all remaining contingencies with respect
to the payment are remote or incidental. 

(A) 

Determining adjustments. 

The amount of the adjustment attributable to the payment is equal to the difference between the present value of the
amount that is fixed and the present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment. The present value of each
amount is determined by discounting the amount from the date the payment is due to the date the payment becomes fixed,
using a discount rate equal to the projected yield on the debt instrument. The adjustment is treated as a positive or
negative adjustment, as appropriate, on the date the contingent payment becomes fixed. See paragraph (b)(9)(v)
of this section to determine the timing of the adjustment if all remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument
become fixed substantially contemporaneously. 

(B) 

Payment schedule. 

For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the contingent payment is no longer treated as a contingent payment
after the date the amount of the payment becomes fixed. On the date the contingent payment becomes fixed, the projected
payment schedule for the debt instrument is modified prospectively to reflect the fixed amount of the payment. Therefore,
no adjustment is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section when the contingent payment is actually made. 

(C) 

Accrual period. 

Notwithstanding the determination under  1.1272-1(b)(1)(ii) of accrual periods for the debt instrument,
an accrual period ends on the day the contingent payment becomes fixed, and a new accrual period begins on the day after
the day the contingent payment becomes fixed. 

(D) 

Basis and adjusted issue price. 

The amount of any positive adjustment on a debt instrument determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section
increases the adjusted issue price of the instrument and the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument. The amount
of any negative adjustment on a debt instrument determined under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(A) of this section decreases
the adjusted issue price of the instrument and the holder's adjusted basis in the instrument. 

(E) 

Special rule for certain contingent interest payments. 

Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(9)(ii) (A), (B), (C), and (D) of this section, this paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(E) applies
to contingent stated interest payments that are adjusted to compensate for contingencies regarding the reasonableness
of the debt instrument's stated rate of interest. For example, this paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(E) applies to a debt instrument
that provides for an increase in the stated rate of interest if the credit quality of the issuer or liquidity of the debt
instrument deteriorates. Contingent stated interest payments of this type are recognized over the period to which
they relate in a reasonable manner. 

(F) 

Example. 

The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section. In this example, assume
that the debt instrument described is a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended,
however, as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes.

 




Example. Fixed but deferred payments_

(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, B, a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a debt instrument at original issue for $1,000. The debt
instrument matures on December 31, 2001, and provides for a payment of $1,000 at maturity. In addition, on December
31, 1998, and December 31, 2001, the debt instrument provides for payments equal to the excess of the average daily
value of an index for the 6-month period ending on September 30 of the preceding year over a specified amount. The two
contingent payments are substantially similar to options on the index. Assume that the two contingent payments are
quotable contingent payments, and that, on the issue date, the forward price of the option that is exercisable on December
31, 1998, is $250 and the forward price of the option that is exercisable on December 31, 2001, is $440. Assume that B
uses annual accrual periods. 

(ii) 

Interest accrual for 1996. 

Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the debt instrument's projected payment schedule consists of a payment of
$250 on December 31, 1998, and a payment of $1,440 on December 31, 2001. Thus, the debt instrument's projected yield
is 10 percent, compounded annually. B includes a total of $100 of daily portions of interest in income in 1996. B's adjusted
basis in the debt instrument and the debt instrument's adjusted issue price on December 31, 1996, is $1,100. 

(iii) 

Interest accrual for 1997_

(A) 

Adjustment. 

Based on the projected payment schedule, B would include $110 of total daily portions of interest in income in 1997.
However, assume that on September 30, 1997, the payment due on December 31, 1998, fixes at $300, rather than the projected
$250. Thus, on September 30, 1997, B has an adjustment equal to the difference between the present value of the $300
fixed amount and the present value of the $250 projected amount of the contingent payment. The present values of the
two payments are determined by discounting each payment from the date the payment is due (December 31, 1998) to the
date the payment becomes fixed (September 30, 1997), using a discount rate equal to 10 percent, compounded annually.
The present value of the fixed payment is $266.30 and the present value of the projected amount of the contingent payment
is $221.91. Thus, on September 30, 1997, B has a positive adjustment of $44.39 ($266.30-$221.91). 

(B) 

Effect of adjustment. 

Under paragraph (b)(9)(ii)(C) of this section, B's accrual period ends on September 30, 1997. The daily portions
of interest on the debt instrument for the period from January 1, 1997 to September 30, 1997 total $81.49. The adjusted
issue price of the debt instrument and B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument are thus increased over this period
by $125.88 (the sum of the daily portions of interest of $81.49 and the positive adjustment of $44.39 made at the end
of the period) to $1,225.88. For purposes of all future accrual periods, including the new accrual period from October
1, 1997, to December 31, 1997, the debt instrument's projected payment schedule is modified to reflect a fixed payment
of $300 on December 31, 1998. Based on the new adjusted issue price of the debt instrument and the new projected payment
schedule, the projected yield on the debt instrument does not change. 

(C) 

Interest accrual for 1997. 

Based on the modified projected payment schedule, $29.55 of interest accrues during the accrual period that ends
on December 31, 1997. Because B has no other adjustments during 1997, the $44.39 positive adjustment on September
30, 1997, results in a net positive adjustment for 1997, which is additional interest for that year. Thus, B includes
$155.43 ($81.49 + $29.55 + $44.39) of interest in income in 1997. B's adjusted basis in the debt instrument and the debt
instrument's adjusted issue price on December 31, 1997, is $1,255.43 ($1,225.88 from the end of the prior accrual
period plus $29.55 total daily portions for the current accrual period).

<TEXT>
 

(iv) 

Interest accrual for 1998. 

In 1998, B has no 
adjustments and, based on the modified projected payment 
schedule, includes $125.54 total daily portions of interest in 
income (rather than $121 as under the original projected payment 
schedule). On December 31, 1998, B's adjusted basis in the debt 
instrument and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument 
are increased by the $125.54 total daily portions of interest 
included in income under the modified projected payment schedule, 
and reduced by $300, the amount of the fixed payment on December 
31, 1998, that is reflected on the modified projected payment 
schedule. 

 


(iii) 

Timing contingencies. 

This paragraph (b)(9)(iii) 
provides rules for debt instruments that have both payments that 
are contingent as to time and payments that are contingent as to 
amount. 

(A) 

Treatment of certain options. 

If a taxpayer has an 
option to put or call the debt instrument, to exchange the debt 
instrument for other property, or to extend the maturity date of 
the debt instrument, the projected payment schedule is determined 
by using the principles of  1.1272-1(c)(5). If an option to put, 
call, or exchange the debt instrument is assumed to be exercised 
under the principles of  1.1272-1(c)(5), it is generally 
reasonable to assume that the option is exercised immediately 
before it expires. If the option is exercised at an earlier 
time, the exercise is treated as a sale or exchange of the debt 
instrument. 

(B) 

Other timing contingencies. 

[Reserved] 

(iv) 

Allocation of deductions. 

For purposes of  1.861-8, 
any amount treated as an ordinary loss under paragraph 
(b)(6)(iii)(B) or (b)(8)(ii) of this section is considered a 
deduction that is definitely related to the class of gross income 
to which interest on the relevant debt instrument belongs. Any 
other deduction or loss relating to the debt instrument will be 
subject to the general rules of  1.861-8. 

(v) 

Special rule when all contingent payments become fixed. 


Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if all the 
remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument become fixed 
substantially contemporaneously, any positive or negative 
adjustment on the instrument is spread over the remaining term of 
the instrument in a reasonable manner. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, a payment is treated as a fixed payment if 
all remaining contingencies with respect to the payment are 
remote or incidental. 

(c) 

Method for debt instruments not subject to the 
noncontingent bond method

_(1) 

Applicability. 

Paragraph (c) of 
this section applies to a contingent payment debt instrument that 
has an issue price determined under  1.1274-2 (other than a debt 
instrument issued in a potentially abusive situation). For 
example, paragraph (c) of this section generally applies to a 
contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for nonpublicly 
traded property. 

(2) 

Separation into components.

 In the case of a debt 
instrument subject to paragraph (c) of this section (the overall 
debt instrument), the noncontingent payments and any quotable 
contingent payments (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section) are subject to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, and the nonquotable contingent payments (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) are accounted for 
separately under the rules in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. 

(3) 

Treatment of noncontingent and quotable contingent 
payments. 

The noncontingent payments and any quotable contingent 
payments are treated as a separate debt instrument. The issue 
price of the separate debt instrument is the issue price of the 
overall debt instrument, determined under  1.1274-2. No interest 
payments on the separate debt instrument are qualified stated 
interest payments (within the meaning of  1.1273-1(c)) and the de 
minimis rules of section 1273(a)(3) and  1.1273-1(d) do not apply 
to the separate debt instrument. If the separate debt instrument 
provides for a quotable contingent payment, the rules of 
paragraph (b) of this section apply to the instrument, 
notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 

(4) 

Treatment of nonquotable contingent payments

_(i) 

In 
general. 

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section, the portion of a nonquotable contingent payment treated 
as interest under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is 
includible in gross income by the holder and deductible from 
gross income by the issuer in their respective taxable years in 
which the amount of the payment becomes fixed. 

(ii) 

Recharacterization of certain nonquotable contingent 
payments

_(A) 

Amount treated as principal. 

In general, a 
nonquotable contingent payment is treated as a payment of 
principal in an amount equal to the present value of the payment, 
determined by discounting the payment at the test rate from the 
date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed to the issue 
date. However, a nonquotable contingent payment accompanied by a 
payment of adequate stated interest is treated entirely as a 
payment of principal. 

(B) 

Amount treated as interest. 

If the total amount of a 
nonquotable contingent payment exceeds the amount of the payment 
treated as principal under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this 
section, the excess is treated as a payment of interest. 

(C) 

Test rate. 

The test rate used for purposes of paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section is the rate that would be the test 
rate for the overall debt instrument under  1.1274-4 if the term 
of the overall debt instrument began on the issue date of the 
overall debt instrument and ended on the date the contingent 
payment is fixed. 

(iii) 

Certain delayed contingent payments

_(A) 

Deemed 
issuance of separate debt instrument. 

If a nonquotable 
contingent payment becomes fixed more than 6 months before the 
payment is due, the issuer and holder are treated as if the 
issuer had issued a separate debt instrument on the date the 
amount of the payment becomes fixed, maturing on the date that 
the payment is due. This separate debt instrument is treated as 
a debt instrument to which section 1274 applies. The stated 
principal amount of this separate debt instrument is the amount 
of the payment that becomes fixed. An amount equal to the issue 
price of this debt instrument is characterized as interest or 
principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section 
and accounted for under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, as 
if this amount had been paid by the issuer to the holder on the 
date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed. To determine 
the issue price of the separate debt instrument, all payments 
under the separate debt instrument are discounted at the test 
rate from the maturity date of the separate debt instrument to 
the date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed. The 
amount of a contingent payment is treated as fixed even if, once 
fixed, the payment is payable in the future together with 
interest that is subject to further contingencies.

(B) 

Test rate. 

In applying section 1274 to a separate debt 
instrument described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, 
the test rate for the separate debt instrument is the rate that 
would be the test rate for the overall debt instrument under 
 1.1274-4 if the term of the overall debt instrument began on the 
issue date of the overall debt instrument and ended on the date 
the contingent payment is due. 

(5) 

Gain on sale, exchange, or retirement. 

Any gain 
recognized by a holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a 
debt instrument subject to paragraph (c) of this section is 
interest income. The preceding sentence does not apply, however, 
if, at the time of the sale, exchange, or retirement, there are 
no remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument. For 
purposes of the preceding sentence, if a contingent payment 
becomes fixed more than 6 months before it is due, it is no 
longer treated as a contingent payment after the date it is 
fixed. 

(6) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. In each example, 
assume that the instrument described is a debt instrument for 
federal income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, 
as to whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument 
for federal income tax purposes. 

 




Example 1. Nonquotable contingent interest payments

_(i) 


Facts. 

A owns Blackacre, unencumbered depreciable real estate. 
On January 1, 1996, A sells Blackacre to B. As consideration for 
the sale, B makes a downpayment of $1,000,000 and issues to A a 
debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. The debt 
instrument provides for a payment of principal at maturity of 
$5,000,000 and a contingent payment of interest on December 31 of 
each year equal to a fixed percentage of the gross rents B 
receives from Blackacre in that year. Assume that the contingent 
interest payments are nonquotable contingent payments and that 
the debt instrument is not issued in a potentially abusive 
situation. Assume also that on January 1, 1996, the short-term 
applicable Federal rate is 5 percent, compounded annually, and 
the mid-term applicable Federal rate is 6 percent, compounded 
annually. 



(ii) Determination of issue price. 

Under  1.1274-2(g), the 
stated principal amount of the debt instrument is $5,000,000. 
The imputed principal amount of the debt instrument is 
$3,736,291, which is the present value, as of the issue date, of 
the $5,000,000 noncontingent payment due at maturity, calculated 
using a discount rate equal to the mid-term applicable Federal 
rate. Therefore, under  1.1274-2(c), the issue price of the debt 
instrument is $3,736,291. Under  1.1012-1(g), B's basis in 
Blackacre on January 1, 1996, is $4,736,291 ($1,000,000 down 
payment plus the $3,736,291 issue price of the debt instrument). 



(iii) Noncontingent payment treated as separate debt 
instrument. 

Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the right to 
the noncontingent payment of principal at maturity is treated as 
a separate debt instrument. The issue price of this separate 
debt instrument is $3,736,291 (the issue price of the overall 
debt instrument). The separate debt instrument has a stated 
redemption price at maturity of $5,000,000 and, therefore, OID of 
$1,263,709. 



(iv) Treatment of contingent payments. 

Assume that the 
amount of contingent interest that is fixed and payable on 
December 31, 1996, is $200,000. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of 
this section, this payment is treated as consisting of a payment 
of principal of $190,476, which is the present value of the 
payment, determined by discounting the payment at the test rate 
of 5 percent, compounded annually, from the date the payment 
becomes fixed to the issue date. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) 
of this section, the remainder of the $200,000 payment, $9,524, 
is treated as interest. The additional amount treated as 
principal gives B additional basis in Blackacre on December 31, 
1996. The portion of the payment treated as interest is 
includible in gross income by A and deductible by B in their 
respective taxable years in which December 31, 1996 occurs. The 
remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument are 
accounted for similarly, using a test rate of 5 percent, 
compounded annually, for the contingent payments due on December 
31, 1997, and December 31, 1998, and a test rate of 6 percent, 
compounded annually, for the contingent payments due on December 
31, 1999, and December 31, 2000. 



Example 2. Fixed but deferred payment

_(i) 

Facts. 

The 
facts are the same as in 

Example 1 

of this paragraph (c)(6), 
except that the contingent payment of interest that is fixed on 
December 31, 1996, is not payable until December 31, 2000, the 
maturity date. 



(ii) Determination of issue price. 

The determination of the 
issue price of the debt instrument, and B's initial basis in 
Blackacre, is made in a manner the same as that described in 
paragraph (ii) of 

Example 1 

of this paragraph (c)(6). 
Accordingly, the issue price of the debt instrument is 
$3,736,291. 



(iii) Treatment of noncontingent payment. 

The right to the 
noncontingent payment of principal is treated as a separate debt 
instrument in a manner the same as that described in paragraph 
(iii) of 

Example 1 

of this paragraph (c)(6). 



(iv) Treatment of contingent payments. 

Assume that the 
amount of the payment that becomes fixed on December 31, 1996, is 
$200,000. Because this amount is not payable until December 31, 
2000 (the maturity date), under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this 
section, a separate debt instrument to which section 1274 applies 
is treated as issued by B on December 31, 1996 (the date the 
payment is fixed). The maturity date of this separate debt 
instrument is December 31, 2000 (the date on which the payment is 
due). The stated principal amount of this separate debt 
instrument is $200,000, the amount of the payment that becomes 
fixed. The imputed principal amount of the separate debt 
instrument is $158,419, which is the present value, as of 
December 31, 1996, of the $200,000 payment, computed using a 
discount rate equal to the test rate of the overall debt 
instrument (6 percent, compounded annually). An amount equal to 
the issue price of the separate debt instrument is treated as an 
amount paid on December 31, 1996, and characterized as interest 
and principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section. The amount of the deemed payment characterized as 
principal is equal to $150,875, which is the present value, as of 
January 1, 1996 (the issue date of the overall debt instrument) 
of the deemed payment, computed using a discount rate of 5 
percent, compounded annually. The amount of the deemed payment 
characterized as interest is $7,544 ($158,419^$150,875) which 
is includible in gross income by A and deductible by B in their 
respective taxable years in which December 31, 1996 occurs. The 
contingent payments made on December 31, 1997, December 31, 1998, 
December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000, are treated in a manner 
the same as that described in paragraph (iv) of 

Example 1

 of this 
paragraph (c)(6). 

 


(d) 

Rules for tax-exempt obligations

_(1) 

Applicability. 


This paragraph (d) provides rules for tax-exempt obligations (as 
defined in section 1275(a)(3)) subject to this section. 

(2) 

Noncontingent bond method generally applicable

_(i) 

In 
general. 

Except as modified by this paragraph (d), the rules of 
paragraph (b) of this section apply to tax-exempt obligations.

(ii) 

Daily portions. 

The daily portions of interest 
determined under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section are not 
included in gross income by the holder. 
(iii) 

Modification to projected payment schedule. 

The yield 
on a tax-exempt obligation may not exceed the greater of the 
yield on the obligation determined without regard to the 
contingent payments, and the tax-exempt applicable Federal rate, 
as determined for purposes of section 1288(b)(1), that applies to 
the obligation. If the projected yield determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section exceeds the yield determined 
under the preceding sentence, appropriate adjustments must be 
made to the projected payment schedule to create a projected 
yield that meets this requirement. 
(iv) 

Positive adjustments. 

Positive adjustments on a tax-exempt obligation are taken into account under this paragraph 
(d)(2)(iv) rather than under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. A 
positive adjustment on a tax-exempt obligation is treated as 
taxable gain to the holder from the sale or exchange of the 
obligation in the taxable year of the adjustment. 
(v) 

Negative adjustments. 

Negative adjustments on a tax-exempt obligation are taken into account under this paragraph 
(d)(2)(v) rather than under paragraph (b)(6) of this section. 
(A) 

Reduction of interest accruals. 

Total negative 
adjustments for a taxable year first reduce the tax-exempt 
interest the holder would otherwise account for on the tax-exempt 
obligation for the taxable year under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of 
this section. 
(B) 

Reduction of other tax-exempt interest for taxable year. 


If the total negative adjustments on the tax-exempt obligation 
for a taxable year exceed the tax-exempt interest for the taxable 
year that the holder would otherwise account for on the tax-exempt obligation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this
section, 
the excess is treated as a reduction of the holder's other tax-exempt interest income for the taxable year. However,
the amount 
treated as a reduction is limited to the amount by which the 
total tax-exempt interest the holder accounted for on the tax-exempt obligation in prior taxable years exceeds the
amount of 
the holder's total negative adjustments on the tax-exempt 
obligation that reduced other tax-exempt interest under this 
paragraph (d)(2)(v)(B) in prior taxable years. 
(C) 

Carryforward of negative adjustment. 

If the total 
negative adjustments on the tax-exempt obligation for a taxable 
year exceed the sum of the amounts treated as a reduction of tax-exempt interest under paragraphs (d)(2)(v)(A) and
(B) of this 
section, the excess is a negative adjustment carryforward for the 
taxable year. 
(1) 

In general. 

Except as provided in paragraph 
(d)(2)(v)(C)(

2

) of this section, a negative adjustment 
carryforward on a tax-exempt obligation for a taxable year is 
treated as a negative adjustment on the tax-exempt obligation on 
the first day of the succeeding taxable year. 
(

2

) 

In year of sale, exchange, or retirement. 

Any negative 
adjustment carryforward on a tax-exempt obligation for a taxable 
year in which the debt instrument is sold, exchanged, or retired 
reduces the amount realized by the holder on the sale, exchange, 
or retirement. 
(vi) 

Gains. 

Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(8) of this 
section, any gain recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement 
of a tax-exempt obligation is gain from the sale or exchange of 
the obligation. 
(vii) 

Losses_

(A) 

Reduction of tax-exempt interest income. 


Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(8) of this section, any loss 
recognized on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a tax-exempt 
obligation is treated as a reduction of the holder's tax-exempt 
interest income for the taxable year of the sale, exchange, or 
retirement. However, the amount treated as a reduction of tax- 
exempt interest income by the holder is limited to the amount by 
which the holder's total tax-exempt interest on the obligation 
exceeds the holder's total negative adjustments on the obligation 
that were treated as reductions of tax-exempt interest income 
under paragraph (d)(2)(v)(B) of this section. If the amount that 
would reduce tax-exempt interest income measured under the 
preceding sentence exceeds the holder's total tax-exempt interest 
income for the taxable year, the excess is carried forward to 
reduce the holder's tax-exempt interest income in subsequent 
taxable years.

(B) 

Treatment of excess losses. 

If the loss recognized by a 
holder on the sale, exchange, or retirement of a tax-exempt 
obligation exceeds the amount measured under paragraph 
(d)(2)(vii)(A) of this section, the excess is treated as loss 
from the sale or exchange of the tax-exempt obligation. 
(e) 

Timing of income and deductions from notional principal 
contracts. 

For the rules governing the timing of income and 
deductions with respect to notional principal contracts 
characterized as including a loan, see  1.446-3. 
(f) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective for debt 
instruments issued on or after the date that is 60 days after 
final regulations are published in the 

Federal Register

. 


Par. 8. 

Section 1.1275-5 is amended by: 
1. Revising paragraph (a)(1). 
2. Adding the word ``only'' immediately following the 
parenthetical in the introductory language of paragraph 
(a)(3)(i). 
3. Removing the language ``less than 1 year'' in the first 
sentence of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) and adding the language ``1 year 
or less'' in its place. 
4. Adding paragraph (a)(5). 
5. Revising paragraph (c)(1). 
6. Revising the text of paragraph (d) preceding the examples, revising 

Examples 4 

through

, and adding 

Example 10. 
7. Revising paragraph (e)(2). 
8. Revising the text of paragraph (e)(3)(v) preceding the examples and revising Example 3. 
The revisions and additions read as follows: 


 1.1275-5

Variable rate debt instruments. 


(a) Applicability_

(1) 

In general. 

This section provides 
rules for variable rate debt instruments. A variable rate debt 
instrument is a debt instrument that meets the conditions 
described in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this 
section. If a debt instrument that provides for a variable rate 
of interest does not qualify as a variable rate debt instrument, 
the debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument. See 
 1.1275-4 for the treatment of a contingent payment debt 
instrument. If a taxpayer holds (or issues) a variable rate debt 
instrument that the taxpayer hedges, see  1.1275-6 for the 
treatment of the debt instrument and the hedge by the taxpayer. 


* * * * * 


(5) 

No contingent principal payments. 

The debt instrument 
must not provide for any principal payments that are contingent 
(within the meaning of  1.1275-4(a)). 


* * * * * 


(c) 

Objective rate_

(1) 

In general_

(i) 

Debt instruments 
issued on or after the date that is 60 days after final 
regulations are published in the 

Federal Register

_(A) 

In 
general. 

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this 
section, for debt instruments issued on or after the date that is 
60 days after final regulations are published in the 

Federal 
Register, 

an objective rate is a rate (other than a qualified 
floating rate) that is determined using a single fixed formula 
and that is based on objective financial or economic information. 
For example, an objective rate generally includes a rate that is 
based on one or more qualified floating rates or on the yield of 
actively traded personal property (within the meaning of section 
1092(d)(1)). 
(B) 

Exception. 

For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of 
this section, an objective rate does not include a rate based on 
information that is within the control of the issuer (or a 
related party within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) 
or that is unique to the circumstances of the issuer (or a 
related party within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), 
such as dividends, profits, or the value of the issuer's stock. 
However, a rate does not fail to be an objective rate merely 
because it is based on the credit quality of the issuer. 
(ii) 

Debt instruments issued after April 3, 1994, and before 
the date that is 60 days after final regulations are published in 
the 

Federal Register

. For debt instruments issued after April 3, 
1994, and before the date that is 60 days after final regulations 
are published in the 

Federal Register

, an objective rate is a 
rate (other than a qualified floating rate) that is determined 
using a single fixed formula and that is based on_
(A) One or more qualified floating rates; 
(B) One or more rates where each rate would be a qualified 
floating rate for a debt instrument denominated in a currency 
other than the currency in which the debt instrument is 
denominated; 
(C) The yield or changes in the price of one or more items 
of personal property (other than stock or debt of the issuer or a 
related party within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)), 
provided each item of property is actively traded within the 
meaning of section 1092(d)(1) (determined without regard to 
section 1092(d)(3)); or 
(D) A combination of rates described in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.

(d) 

Examples.

 The following examples illustrate the rules 
of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For purposes of these 
examples, assume that the debt instrument is not a tax-exempt 
obligation. In addition, unless otherwise provided, assume that 
the rate is not reasonably expected to result in a significant 
front-loading or back-loading of interest and that the rate is 
not based on objective financial or economic information that is 
within the control of the issuer (or a related party) or that is 
unique to the circumstances of the issuer (or a related party). 



* * * * * 


 



Example 4. Rate based on changes in the value of a 
commodity index.

 X issues a debt instrument that provides for 
annual interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal 
to the percentage increase, if any, in the value of an index for 
the year immediately preceding the payment. The index is based 
on the prices of several actively traded commodities. Variations 
in the value of this interest rate cannot reasonably be expected 
to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly 
borrowed funds. Accordingly, the rate is not a qualified 
floating rate. However, because the rate is based on objective 
financial information, the rate is an objective rate. 


 

Example 5. Rate based on a percentage of S&P 500 Index.

 X 
issues a debt instrument that provides for annual interest 
payments at the end of each year based on a fixed percentage of 
the value of the S&P 500 Index. Variations in the value of this 
interest rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure 
contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds 
and, therefore, the rate is not a qualified floating rate. 
Although the rate would be an objective rate under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, the rate is not an objective rate 
because it is reasonably expected that the average value of the 
rate during the first half of the instrument's term will be 
significantly less than the average value of the rate during the 
final half of the instrument's term. 


 

Example 6. Rate based on issuer's profits.

 Z issues a debt 
instrument that provides for annual interest payments equal to 20 
percent of Z's net profits earned during the year immediately 
preceding the payment. Variations in the value of this interest 
rate cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous 
variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the 
rate is not a qualified floating rate. In addition, because the 
stated rate is based on objective financial information that is 
unique to the issuer's circumstances, the rate is not an 
objective rate. 



* * * * * 


 



Example 10. Rate based on an inflation index.

 On January 
1, 1996, X issues a debt instrument that provides for annual 
interest payments at the end of each year at a rate equal to 400 
basis points (4 percent) plus the annual percentage change in a 
general inflation index (e.g., the Consumer Price Index, U.S. 
City Average, All Items, for all Urban Consumers, seasonally 
unadjusted). Variations in the value of this interest rate 
cannot reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous 
variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds. Accordingly, the 
rate is not a qualified floating rate. However, because the rate 
is based on objective economic information, the rate is an 
objective rate.

Variable rate debt instrument that provides for annual 
payments of interest at a single variable rate. 

If a variable 
rate debt instrument provides for stated interest at a single 
qualified floating rate or objective rate that is unconditionally 
payable in cash or in property (other than debt instruments of 
the issuer), or that will be constructively received under 
section 451, at least annually_ 


 (i) All stated interest with respect to the debt instrument 
is qualified stated interest; 


 (ii) The amount of qualified stated interest and the amount

instruments by assuming that the variable rate is a fixed rate

Example 3. Adjustment to qualified stated interest for 
actual payment of interest

_(i) 

Facts.

 On January 1, 1995, Z 
purchases at original issue, for $90,000, a variable rate debt 
instrument that matures on January 1, 1997, and has a stated 
principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt 
instrument provides for annual payments of interest on January 1 
of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996. The amount of 
interest payable is the value of annual LIBOR on the payment 
date. The value of annual LIBOR on January 1, 1995, and January 
1, 1996, is 5 percent, compounded annually. The value of annual 
LIBOR on January 1, 1997, is 7 percent, compounded annually. 


 (ii) 

Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest. 

Under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the variable rate debt 
instrument is treated as a 2-year debt instrument that has an 
issue price of $90,000, a stated principal amount of $100,000, 
and interest payments of $5,000 at the end of each year. The 
debt instrument has $10,000 of OID and the annual interest 
payments of $5,000 are qualified stated interest payments. Under 
 1.1272-1, the debt instrument has a yield of 10.82 percent, 
compounded annually. The amount of OID allocable to the first 
annual accrual period (assuming Z uses annual accrual periods) is 
$4,743.25 (($90,000 x .1082)^$5,000), and the amount of OID 
allocable to the second annual accrual period is $5,256.75 
($100,000-$94,743.25). Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this 
section, the $2,000 difference between the $7,000 interest 
payment actually made at maturity and the $5,000 interest payment 
assumed to be made at maturity under the equivalent fixed rate 
debt instrument is treated as additional qualified stated 
interest for the period. 



* * * * * 


 



Par. 9. 

Section 1.1275-6 is added to read as follows: 


 

 1.1275-6 
 

Integration of qualifying debt instruments. 


 

(a) 

In general. 

This section generally provides for the 
integration of a qualifying debt instrument with a hedge or 
combination of hedges if the combined cash flows of the 
components are substantially equivalent to the cash flows on a 
fixed or variable rate debt instrument. The integrated 
transaction is generally subject to the rules of this section 
rather than the rules each component of the transaction would be 
subject to on a separate basis. The purpose of this section is 
to permit a more appropriate determination of the character and 
timing of income, deductions, gains, or losses than would be 
permitted by a separate accounting for the components. The rules 
of this section must be interpreted consistently with this 
purpose. The rules of this section affect only the taxpayer who 
holds (or issues) the qualifying debt instrument and enters into 
the hedge.

Definitions

_(1) 

Qualifying debt instrument

_(i) 

In 
general.

 A qualifying debt instrument is a debt instrument 
subject to either  1.1275-4 (relating to contingent payment debt 
instruments) or  1.1275-5 (relating to variable rate debt 
instruments), or is an integrated transaction as defined in 
paragraph (c) of this section. However, a tax-exempt obligation, 
as defined in section 1275(a)(3), is not a qualifying debt 
instrument. 


 (ii) 

Special rule if all payments on a debt instrument are 
proportionally hedged.

 If a debt instrument is a qualifying debt 
instrument and all principal and interest payments under the 
instrument are hedged in the same proportion, then, for purposes 
of this section, the portion of the instrument that is hedged is 
treated as a qualifying debt instrument. 


 (2) 

Section 1.1275-6 hedge

_(i) 

In general.

 A  1.1275-6 
hedge is any financial instrument (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section) such that the combined cash flows of the 
financial instrument and the qualifying debt instrument permit 
the calculation of a yield to maturity (under the principles of 
section 1272), or the right to the combined cash flows would 
qualify as a variable rate debt instrument under  1.1275-5 that 
pays interest at a qualified floating rate or rates (except for 
the requirement that the interest payments be stated as 
interest). A financial instrument that hedges currency risk, 
however, is not a  1.1275-6 hedge. 


 (ii) 

Limitation.

 A taxpayer cannot treat a debt instrument 
it issues as a  1.1275-6 hedge of a debt instrument it holds and 
a taxpayer cannot treat a debt instrument it holds as a  1.1275-6 
hedge of a debt instrument it issues. 


 (3) 

Financial instrument.

 For purposes of this section, a 
financial instrument is a spot, forward, or futures contract, an 
option, a notional principal contract, a debt instrument, or a 
similar instrument, or combination or series of financial 
instruments. Stock, however, is not a financial instrument for 
purposes of this section.

(4) 

Synthetic debt instrument. 

The synthetic debt 
instrument is the hypothetical debt instrument with the same cash 
flows as the combined cash flows of the qualifying debt 
instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge. 
(c) 

Integrated transaction

_(1) 

Integration by taxpayer. 


Except as otherwise provided in this section, a qualifying debt 
instrument and a  1.1275-6 hedge are an integrated transaction if 
all of the following requirements are satisfied_
(i) The taxpayer satisfies the identification requirements 
of paragraph (f) of this section on or before the date the 
taxpayer enters into the  1.1275-6 hedge. 
(ii) None of the parties to the  1.1275-6 hedge are related 
within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1) (other than 
parties that have made a separate-entity election under 
 1.1221-2(d)). 
(iii) Both the qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 
hedge are entered into by the same individual, partnership, 
trust, estate, or corporation (regardless of whether the 
corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations 
that files a consolidated return). 
(iv) With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. 
trade or business that issues or acquires a qualifying debt 
instrument or enters into a  1.1275-6 hedge through the trade or 
business, all items of income and expense associated with the 
qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge (other than 
interest expense that is subject to  1.882-5) would have been 
effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business throughout 
the term of the synthetic debt instrument had this section not 
applied. 
(v) The qualifying debt instrument, any other debt 
instrument that is part of the same issue as the qualifying debt 
instrument, or the  1.1275-6 hedge cannot have been part of an 
integrated transaction entered into by the taxpayer that has been 
terminated under the legging out rules of paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section. 
(vi) The  1.1275-6 hedge is entered into on or after the 
date the qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired. 
(2) 

Integration by Commissioner. 

The Commissioner may treat 
a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument (whether 
entered into by the taxpayer or by a related party) as an 
integrated transaction if the combined cash flows on the 
qualifying debt instrument and financial instrument are 
substantially the same as the combined cash flows required for 
the financial instrument to be a  1.1275-6 hedge. The 
circumstances under which the Commissioner may require 
integration include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(i) A taxpayer fails to identify a qualifying debt 
instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge under paragraph (f) of this 
section. 
(ii) A taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt 
instrument and a related party (within the meaning of section 
267(b) or 707(b)(1)) enters into the  1.1275-6 hedge. 
(iii) A taxpayer issues or acquires a qualifying debt 
instrument and enters into the  1.1275-6 hedge with a related 
party (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)). 
(iv) The taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction and 
subsequently enters into a new  1.1275-6 hedge with respect to 
the same qualifying debt instrument or other debt instrument that 
is part of the same issue. 
(d) 

Special rules for legging into and legging out of an 
integrated transaction

_(1) 

Legging into

_(i) 

Definition. 


Legging into an integrated transaction under this section means 
that a  1.1275-6 hedge is entered into after the date the 
qualifying debt instrument is issued by the taxpayer or acquired 
by the taxpayer, and the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section are satisfied on the date the  1.1275-6 hedge is entered 
into (the leg-in date). 
(ii) 

Treatment. 

If a taxpayer legs into an integrated 
transaction, the taxpayer treats the qualifying debt instrument 
under the applicable rules for accruing interest and OID up to 
the leg-in date, except that the day before the leg-in date is 
treated as the end of an accrual period. As of the leg-in date, 
the qualifying debt instrument is subject to the rules of 
paragraph (g) of this section. 
(iii) 

Anti-abuse rule. 

If a taxpayer legs into an 
integrated transaction with a principal purpose of deferring or 
accelerating income or deductions on the qualifying debt 
instrument, the Commissioner may_
(A) Treat the qualifying debt instrument as sold for its 
fair market value on the leg-in date; or 
(B) Refuse to allow the taxpayer to integrate the qualifying 
debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge.

(2) 

Legging out

_(i) 

Definition

_(A) 

Legging out if the 
taxpayer has integrated. 

If a taxpayer has integrated a 
qualifying debt instrument and a  1.1275-6 hedge under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, legging out means that, prior to the 
maturity of the synthetic debt instrument, the taxpayer disposes 
of or otherwise terminates all or a part of the qualifying debt 
instrument or  1.1275-6 hedge, the  1.1275-6 hedge ceases to meet 
the requirements for a  1.1275-6 hedge, or the taxpayer fails to 
meet any requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the 
taxpayer fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section but meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, the Commissioner may treat the taxpayer as not 
legging out. A taxpayer that disposes of or terminates both the 
qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge on the same 
day is considered to have disposed of or otherwise terminated the 
synthetic debt instrument rather than to have legged out. 
(B) 

Legging out if the Commissioner has integrated. 

If the 
Commissioner has integrated a qualifying debt instrument and a 
financial instrument under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
legging out means that, prior to the maturity of the synthetic 
debt instrument, the requirements for Commissioner integration 
under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not met or the 
taxpayer fails to meet the requirements for taxpayer integration 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the Commissioner 
agrees to allow the taxpayer to be treated as legging out. A 
taxpayer that disposes of or terminates both the qualifying debt 
instrument and the financial instrument on the same day is 
considered to have disposed of or otherwise terminated the 
synthetic debt instrument rather than to have legged out. 
(ii) 

Operating rules. 

If a taxpayer legs out (or is treated 
as legging out) of an integrated transaction, the following rules 
apply_
(A) The transaction is treated as an integrated transaction 
during the time the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of 
this section, as appropriate, are satisfied. 
(B) If the  1.1275-6 hedge is disposed of or otherwise 
terminated, the synthetic debt instrument is treated as sold or 
otherwise terminated for its fair market value on the leg-out 
date and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(D) of this 
section, any income, deduction, gain, or loss is realized and 
recognized on the leg-out date. Appropriate adjustments are made 
as of the leg-out date to reflect any difference between the fair 
market value of the qualifying debt instrument and the adjusted 
issue price of the qualifying debt instrument. For example, if a 
qualifying debt instrument is subject to  1.1275-4, a holder must 
use the principles of  1.1275-4(b)(9)(i) to compute interest 
accruals on the instrument after the leg-out date. 
(C) If the qualifying debt instrument is disposed of or 
otherwise terminated, the synthetic debt instrument is treated as 
sold for its fair market value on the leg-out date and the 
 1.1275-6 hedge is treated as entered into at its fair market 
value immediately after the taxpayer legs out. 
(D) If a taxpayer legs out of an integrated transaction by 
disposing of or otherwise terminating a  1.1275-6 hedge within 30 
days of legging into the integrated transaction, then any loss or 
deduction determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this 
section is not allowed. Appropriate adjustments are made to the 
qualifying debt instrument to take into account any disallowed 
loss. 
(e) 

Transactions part of a straddle. 

At the discretion of 
the Commissioner, a transaction may not be integrated under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section if, prior to the time the 
integrated transaction is identified, the qualifying debt 
instrument is part of a straddle as defined in section 1092(c). 
(f) 

Identification requirements

_(1) 

Identification by 
taxpayer. 

For each integrated transaction, a taxpayer must enter 
and retain as part of its books and records the following 
information_
(i) The date the qualifying debt instrument was issued or 
acquired by the taxpayer and the date the  1.1275-6 hedge was 
entered into by the taxpayer; 
(ii) A description of the qualifying debt instrument and the 
 1.1275-6 hedge; and 
(iii) A summary of the cash flows and accruals resulting 
from treating the qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 
hedge as an integrated transaction (i.e., the cash flows and 
accruals on the synthetic debt instrument). 
(2) 

Identification by trustee on behalf of beneficiary. 

A 
trustee of a trust that enters into a synthetic debt instrument 
may satisfy the identification requirements described in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section on behalf of a beneficiary of 
the trust.

(g) 

Taxation of integrated transactions

_(1) 

General rule. 


An integrated transaction is generally treated as a single 
transaction by the taxpayer during the period that the 
transaction qualifies as an integrated transaction. Except as 
provided in paragraph (g)(12) of this section, while a qualifying 
debt instrument and a  1.1275-6 hedge are part of an integrated 
transaction, neither the qualifying debt instrument nor the 
 1.1275-6 hedge is subject to the rules that would apply on a 
separate basis to the debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge, 
including sections 263(g), 475, 1092, 1256, or 1258, or   1.446- 
3, 1.446-4, or 1.1221-2. The rules that would govern the 
treatment of the synthetic debt instrument generally govern the 
treatment of the integrated transaction. For example, the 
integrated transaction may be subject to section 263(g) or, if 
the synthetic debt instrument would be part of a straddle, 
section 1092. Generally, the synthetic debt instrument is 
subject to sections 163(e), 1271 through 1275, and 1286 with 
terms as follows. 

(2) 

Issue date. 

The issue date of the synthetic debt 
instrument is the date the  1.1275-6 hedge is entered into by the 
taxpayer. 

(3) 

Term. 

The term of the synthetic debt instrument is the 
period beginning on the issue date of the synthetic debt 
instrument and ending on the maturity date of the qualifying debt 
instrument. 

(4) 

Issue price. 

The issue price of the synthetic debt 
instrument is the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt 
instrument on the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument. 

(5) 

Adjusted issue price. 

In general, the adjusted issue 
price of the synthetic debt instrument is determined under the 
principles of  1.1275-1(c). 

(6) 

Qualified stated interest. 

Qualified stated interest 
payments on the synthetic debt instrument are payments that would 
be treated as qualified stated interest under the principles of 
 1.1273-1(c) if the payments were stated as interest. 

(7) 

Stated redemption price at maturity_

(i) 

Synthetic debt 
instruments that are borrowings. 

If the synthetic debt 
instrument is a borrowing, the instrument's stated redemption 
price at maturity is the sum of all amounts paid or to be paid on 
the qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge, reduced 
by any amounts received or to be received on the  1.1275-6 hedge 
and any amounts treated as qualified stated interest on the 
synthetic debt instrument under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. 

(ii) 

Synthetic debt instruments that are loans. 

If the 
synthetic debt instrument is a loan, the instrument's stated 
redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts received 
or to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the 
 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by any amounts paid or to be paid on the 
 1.1275-6 hedge and any amounts treated as qualified stated 
interest on the synthetic debt instrument under paragraph (g)(6) 
of this section. 

(8) 

Source of interest income and allocation of expense. 


The source of interest income from the synthetic debt instrument 
is determined by reference to the source of income of the 
qualifying debt instrument under sections 861(a)(1) and 
862(a)(1). For purposes of section 904, the character of 
interest from the synthetic debt instrument is determined by 
reference to the character of the interest income from the 
qualifying debt instrument. Interest expense is allocated and 
apportioned under regulations under section 861 or under 
 1.882-5. 

(9) 

Effectively connected income. 

Interest income of a 
foreign person resulting from a synthetic debt instrument entered 
into by the foreign person that satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is treated as effectively 
connected with a U.S. trade or business. Interest expense of a 
foreign person resulting from an integrated transaction entered 
into by the foreign person that satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is allocated and apportioned 
under  1.882-5. 

(10) 

Not a short-term obligation. 

If the synthetic debt 
instrument has a term of one year or less, the synthetic debt 
instrument is not treated as a short-term obligation for purposes 
of section 1272(a)(2)(C). 

(11) 

Special rules for integration by the Commissioner. 

If 
the Commissioner requires integration, appropriate adjustments 
are made to the treatment of the synthetic debt instrument, and, 
if necessary, the qualifying debt instrument and financial 
instrument. For example, the Commissioner may treat a financial 
instrument that is not a  1.1275-6 hedge as a  1.1275-6 hedge 
when applying the rules of this section. The issue date of the 
synthetic debt instrument is the date determined appropriate by 
the Commissioner to require integration. 

(12) 

Retention of separate transaction rules for certain 
purposes. 

This paragraph (g)(12) provides for the retention of 
separate transaction rules for certain purposes. In addition, 
the Commissioner may require use of separate transaction rules 
for any aspect of an integrated transaction by publication in the 
Internal Revenue Bulletin (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this 
chapter). 

(i) 

Foreign persons that enter into integrated transactions 
giving rise to U.S. source income not effectively connected with 
a U.S. trade or business. 

If a foreign person enters into an 
integrated transaction that gives rise to U.S. source interest 
income (determined under the source rules for the synthetic debt 
instrument) not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or 
business of the foreign person, paragraph (g) of this section 
does not apply for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442, 
and 6049. These sections of the Internal Revenue Code are 
applied to the qualifying debt instrument and the  1.1275-6 hedge 
on a separate basis. For example, if a U.S. corporation issues a 
qualifying debt instrument and enters into a notional principal 
contract that is a  1.1275-6 hedge, the source of interest on the 
qualifying debt instrument is determined under section 861. In 
general, the interest constitutes U.S. source interest that is 
subject to withholding tax to the extent provided in sections 
871, 881, 1441, and 1442. The source of payments on the notional 
principal contract is determined under  1.863-7 and, to the 
extent paid to a non-U.S. person who is not engaged in a U.S. 
trade or business, constitutes non-U.S. source income that is not 
subject to U.S. withholding tax. 

(ii) 

Relationship between issuer and holder. 

Because the 
rules of this section affect only the taxpayer holding or issuing 
the qualifying debt instrument (i.e., either the issuer or a 
particular holder), any provisions of the Internal Revenue Code 
or regulations that govern the relationship between the issuer 
and holder of the qualifying debt instrument are applied on a 
separate basis. For example, taxpayers must comply with any 
reporting or disclosure requirements on any qualifying debt 
instrument as if it were not part of an integrated transaction. 
Thus, if required under  1.1275-4(b)(4), an issuer of a 
contingent payment debt instrument subject to integrated 
treatment must provide the projected payment schedule to holders.

(h) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of this section. In each example, assume that the 
qualifying debt instrument is a debt instrument for federal 
income tax purposes. No inference is intended, however, as to 
whether the debt instrument constitutes a debt instrument for 
federal income tax purposes. 

 




Example 1. Issuer hedge

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1997, V, 
a domestic corporation, issues a 5-year debt instrument for 
$1,000. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of 
interest at a rate equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR and a 
principal payment of $1,000 at maturity. On the same day, V 
enters into a 5-year interest rate swap agreement with an 
unrelated party. Under the swap, V pays 6 percent and receives 
1-year LIBOR on a notional principal amount of $1,000. The 
payments on the swap are fixed and made on the same days as the 
payments on the debt instrument. Also on January 1, 1997, V 
identifies the debt instrument and the swap as an integrated 
transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) 
of this section. 

(ii) 

Eligibility for integration. 

The debt instrument is a 
qualifying debt instrument because it is a variable rate debt 
instrument. The swap is a  1.1275-6 hedge because it is a 
financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash 
flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated. V 
has met the identification requirements, and the other 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. 
Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under 
this section. 

(iii) 

Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. 

The 
synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an 
issue price of $1,000 and provides for annual interest payments 
of $60 and a principal payment of $1,000 at maturity. Under 
paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the annual interest payments on 
the synthetic debt instrument are treated as qualified stated 
interest payments. Under paragraph (g)(7)(i) of this section, 
the synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at 
maturity of $1,000 (the sum of all amounts to be paid on the 
qualifying debt instrument and the swap, reduced by amounts to be 
received on the swap and the annual interest payments on the 
synthetic debt instrument). Therefore, the synthetic debt 
instrument has no OID. 



Example 2. Issuer hedge with an option

_(i) 

Facts. 


On January 1, 1996, W corporation issues for $1,000 a debt 
instrument that matures on December 31, 1998. The debt 
instrument has a stated principal amount of $1,000 payable at 
maturity. The debt instrument also provides for a payment at 
maturity equal to $10 times the increase, if any, in the value of 
a nationally known composite index of stocks from January 1, 
1996, to the maturity date. On January 1, 1996, W also purchases 
from an unrelated party an option that pays $10 times the 
increase, if any, in the stock index from January 1, 1996, to 
December 31, 1998. W pays $250 for the option. W identifies the 
debt instrument and option as an integrated transaction in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this 
section. 

(ii) 

Eligibility for integration. 

The debt instrument is a 
qualifying debt instrument because it is a contingent payment 
debt instrument. The option is a  1.1275-6 hedge because it is a 
financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash 
flows of the option and the debt instrument can be calculated. W 
has met the identification requirements, and the other 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. 
Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under 
this section. 

(iii) 

Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. 

The 
synthetic debt instrument is a 3-year debt instrument with an 
issue price of $1,000 that provides for a payment immediately 
after issuance of $250 and a payment of $1,000 at maturity. The 
synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at 
maturity of $1,250 and, therefore, has OID of $250. The $250 
payment reduces the adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt 
instrument to $750 immediately after it is issued. Therefore, 
the OID allocable to the first accrual period is based on the 
$750 adjusted issue price. See  1.1272-1(b). 



Example 3. Hedge with prepaid swap

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 
1, 1996, H purchases for 0D1,000 a 5-year debt instrument that 
provides for semiannual payments based on 6-month pound LIBOR and 
a payment of the 0D1,000 principal at maturity. On the same day, 
H enters into a swap with an unrelated third party under which H 
receives 10 percent, in pounds, semiannually and pays 6-month 
pound LIBOR semiannually on a notional principal amount of 
0D1,000. Payments on the swap are fixed and made on the same date 
that H receives payments on the debt instrument. H also makes a 
0D162 prepayment on the swap. H identifies the swap and the debt 
instrument as an integrated transaction under paragraph (f) of 
this section.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00010 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Eligibility for integration. 

The debt instrument is a 
qualifying debt instrument because it is a variable rate debt 
instrument. The swap is a  1.1275-6 hedge because it is a 
financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash 
flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated. 
Although the debt instrument is denominated in pounds, the swap 
hedges only interest rate risk, not currency risk. See 
 1.988-5(a) for the treatment of a debt instrument and a swap if 
the swap hedges currency risk. 
(iii) 

Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. 

The 
synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an 
issue price of 0D1,000 and provides for semiannual interest 
payments of 0D50 and a principal payment of 0D1,000 at maturity. 
Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the semiannual interest 
payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments. 
Under paragraph (g)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt 
instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is 0D838 (the sum 
of all amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument 
and the  1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the 
 1.1275-6 hedge and the semiannual interest payments on the 
synthetic debt instrument). Because the issue price of the 
synthetic debt instrument exceeds the instrument's stated 
redemption price at maturity, the synthetic debt instrument does 
not have OID. The synthetic debt instrument, however, does have 
0D162 of amortizable bond premium. The 0D162 prepayment on the 
 1.1275-6 hedge made by H on January 1, 1996, increases the 
adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt instrument to 0D1,162 
immediately after it is issued. 


Example 4. Legging into an integrated transaction by a 
holder

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, X corporation purchases 
for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 
2005. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of 
interest at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity 
equal to $1,000,000, increased by the excess, if any, of the 
price of 1,000 units of a commodity on December 31, 2005, over 
$350,000, and decreased by the excess, if any, of $350,000 over 
the price of 1,000 units of a commodity on that date. Assume 
that on the issue date the forward price of the commodity on 
December 31, 2005, is $370,000. The projected amount of the 
payment at maturity, determined under  1.1275-4(b)(4), therefore, 
is $1,020,000. On January 1, 1999, X enters into a cash settled 
forward contract with an unrelated party to sell 1,000 units of 
the commodity on December 31, 2005, for $450,000. Also on 
January 1, 1999, X identifies the transaction as an integrated 
transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) 
of this section. 
(ii) 

Eligibility for integration. 

X meets the requirements 
for integration as of January 1, 1999. Therefore, X legged into 
an integrated transaction on that date. Prior to that date, X 
treats the debt instrument under the applicable rules of 
 1.1275-4. 
(iii) 

Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. 

As of 
January 1, 1999, the debt instrument and the forward contract are 
treated as an integrated transaction. The issue price of the 
synthetic debt instrument is equal to the adjusted issue price of 
the qualifying debt instrument on the leg-in date, $1,004,804 
(assuming one year accrual periods). The term of the synthetic 
debt instrument is from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2005. 
The synthetic debt instrument provides for annual interest 
payments of $60,000 and a principal payment at maturity of 
$1,100,000 ($1,000,000 + $450,000 ^ $350,000). Under paragraph 
(g)(6) of this section, the annual interest payments are treated 
as qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph 
(g)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's 
stated redemption price at maturity is $1,100,000 (the sum of all 
amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the 
 1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the 
 1.1275-6 hedge and the annual interest payments on the synthetic 
debt instrument). 


Example 5. Abusive leg-in

_(i) 

Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, 
Y corporation purchases for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that 
matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument provides for 
annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent, a payment 
on December 31, 1998 of the increase, if any, in the price of a 
commodity from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998, and a 
payment at maturity of $1,000,000 and the increase, if any, in 
the price of the commodity from December 31, 1998 to maturity. 
Because the debt instrument is a contingent payment debt 
instrument subject to  1.1275-4, Y accrues interest based on the 
projected payment schedule. 
(ii) 

Leg-in. 

By December 1998, the price of the commodity 
has substantially increased and Y expects a positive adjustment 
on December 31, 1998. On December 20, 1998, Y enters into an 
agreement to exchange the two commodity based payments on the 
debt instrument for two payments on the same dates of $100,000 
each. Y identifies the transaction as an integrated transaction 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this 
section. Y disposes of the hedge on January 15, 1999. 
(iii) 

Treatment. 

The legging into an integrated transaction 
has the effect of deferring the positive adjustment from 1998 to 
1999. Because Y legged into the integrated transaction with a 
principal purpose to defer the positive adjustment, the 
Commissioner may treat the debt instrument as sold for its fair 
market value on the leg-in date, December 20, 1998, or refuse to 
allow integration. 


Example 6. Integration of offsetting debt instruments

_(i) 


Facts. 

On January 1, 1996, Z issues two 10-year debt 
instruments. The first, Issue 1, has an issue price of $1,000, 
pays interest annually at 6 percent, and, at maturity, pays 
$1,000, increased by $1 times the increase, if any, in the value 
of the S&P 100 Index over the term of the instrument and reduced 
by $1 times the decrease, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 
Index over the term of the instrument. However, the amount paid 
at maturity may not be less than $500 or more than $1,500. The 
second, Issue 2, has an issue price of $1,000, pays interest 
annually at 8 percent, and, at maturity, pays $1,000, reduced by 
$1 times the increase, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 Index 
over the term of the instrument and increased by $1 times the 
decrease, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 Index over the term 
of the instrument. The amount paid at maturity may not be less 
than $500 or more than $1,500. As of January 1, 1996, Z 
identifies Issue 1 as the qualifying debt instrument, Issue 2 as 
a  1.1275-6 hedge, and otherwise meets the identification 
requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) 

Eligibility for integration. 

Both Issue 1 and Issue 2 
are qualifying debt instruments. Z has met the identification 
requirements by identifying Issue 1 as the qualifying debt 
instrument and Issue 2 as the  1.1275-6 hedge. The other 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section are satisfied. 
Therefore, the transaction is an integrated transaction under 
this section. 
(iii) 

Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. 

The 
synthetic debt instrument has an issue price of $1,000, provides 
for a payment at maturity of $2,000, and, in addition, provides 
for annual payments of $140, which are treated as qualified 
stated interest payments under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. 
The synthetic debt instrument has a stated redemption price at 
maturity of $1,000 (equal to $2,000 to be paid on the qualifying 
debt instrument and  1.1275-6 hedge, reduced by the $1,000 
received on the  1.1275-6 hedge). As a result, the synthetic 
debt instrument has no OID. The payment of $1,000 received by Z 
on the  1.1275-6 hedge on January 1, 1996, increases the 
synthetic debt instrument's adjusted issue price to $2,000 
immediately after it is issued.

 

(i) [Reserved] 
(j) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective for 
qualifying debt instruments issued on or after the date that is 
60 days after final regulations are published in the 

Federal 
Register.

Payment by Employer of Expenses for Club Dues, Meals and Entertainment, and Spousal Travel



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains proposed regulations relating to reimbursements and other expense allowance arrangements
under section 62(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code), working condition fringe benefits under section
132(d) of the Code, and expenses for club dues, spousal travel, and business meals and entertainment that are disallowed
as a deduction to the employer under section 274(a)(3), (m)(3), and (n)(1) of the Code. The proposed regulations reflect
changes to the law made by sections 13209, 13210, and 13272 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 107 Stat.
469 (1993) (OBRA). The persons affected by the proposed regulations are persons who provide or receive the use of club
membership dues, spousal travel expenses, or business meals and entertainment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations under sections 62(c), 132(d), and 274 of
the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to reflect changes made to section 274 of the Code by sections 13209, 13210, and 13272
of OBRA (107 Stat. 469, 542). These provisions amended section 274 of the Code by limiting the deductible portion of
meal and entertainment expenses to 50 percent, by eliminating the deduction for club dues, and by restricting the
deduction for spousal travel. The amendments to the regulations under sections 62 and 132 of the Code concern the income
tax consequences to employees when their employer's (or third party payor's) deduction is disallowed by the amendments
to section 274 of the Code. Proposed rules relating to the definition of 

club 

for purposes of the dues deduction disallowance under section 274(a)(3) of the Code were published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 12, 1994 on page 41414.

Explanation of Provisions



Section 61(a)(1) of the Code states that, except as otherwise provided, gross income includes compensation for services,
including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items. In addition, if an employer reimburses an employee
for expenses paid by the employee in connection with the performance of services as an employee, the amount reimbursed
generally is includible in the employee's gross income.

Section 62(a)(2) of the Code allows an employee to deduct employer reimbursements for expenses paid by the employee
in connection with the performance of services as an employee from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income
when the amounts are paid under a reimbursement or other expenses allowance arrangement with his or her employer.
Section 62(c) of the Code provides that, for purposes of section 62(a)(2)(A), an arrangement will not be treated as
a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement if: (1) the arrangement does not require the employee to substantiate
the expense; or (2) the arrangement provides the employee the right to retain any amount in excess of the substantiated
amount.

Section 132 of the Code provides that certain fringe benefits provided by an employee to an employee may be excluded
from the employee's gross income. An employer-provided membership in any club organized for business, pleasure,
recreation, or other social purposes is a fringe benefit includable in gross income unless otherwise specifically
excluded. Similarly, an employer's payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual
accompanying an employee on business is a fringe benefit includable in gross income unless otherwise specifically
excluded. 

See 

 1.61-21(a) of the Income Tax Regulations. Section 1.132-5 of the regulations permits exclusion
of employer-provided membership in a club, or an employer's payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent,
or other individual, accompanying an employee on business as a working condition fringe benefit, provided that the
payments for these items would be deductible by the employee under sections 162 or 167 of the Code.

OBRA amended section 274 of the Code to disallow a deduction for (1) 50% of business meal and entertainment expenses;
(2) amounts paid or incurred for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social
purpose; and (3) amounts paid or incurred with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying the
taxpayer (or an officer or employee of the taxpayer) on business travel, unless the accompanying individual is an
employee of the taxpayer, the travel of the accompanying individual is for a bona fide business purpose, and the travel
expenses would otherwise be deductible by the accompanying individual.

The legislative history to OBRA indicates that Congress did not intend that the business meal and entertainment expenses
disallowance provided by section 274(n) of the Code should result in income to employees. ``The committee believes
that denial of some part of the deduction is appropriate as a proxy for income inclusion of the consumption element
of the meal or entertainment.'' H.R. Rep. No. 111, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 645 (1993). Thus, consistent with Congressional
intent as evidenced by the legislative history, these proposed regulations amend the regulations under section
62 of the Code to the extent necessary to provide that a reimbursement or advance for business meal and entertainment
expenses will not be considered wages subject to withholding and employment taxes under  1.62-2 of the regulations,
notwithstanding the deduction disallowance to the employer of 50 percent of that amount. 
The proposed regulations also amend the regulations under section 132 of the Code to provide that denial of a deduction
to the employer for the employer's payment of an employee's membership in a club, or for the employer's payment of travel
expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an employee on business travel, does not provide
those items from qualifying as working condition fringe benefits. These amounts may qualify as a working condition
fringe benefit to the extent that (1) the employer has not treated such amounts as compensation under section 274(e)(2)
of the Code; (2) the amounts would be deductible under section 162 (without regard to sections 274(a) and 274(M)(3));
and (3) the employee substantiates the expenses within the meaning of section 274.
An employer may choose to exercise the option of avoiding any section 274 disallowance at the employer level by characterizing
employer-provided club membership dues or payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other
individual accompanying an employee on business travel as compensation. Section 274(e)(2). If the employer makes
this election, the amount of such expenditure is fully includable in gross income by the employee as compensation.
The proposed regulations under section 132 of the Code do not provide the employee with any exclusion from gross income
in this situation because the section 274 disallowance applies to the employee.

The proposed regulations also modify  1.274-2(f)(2)(iii) of the regulations to include spousal travel
described in section 274(m)(3) of the Code among the expenses deductible by the employer when treated as compensation
pursuant to section 274(e)(2). To the extent that the employer treats all or parts of club dues as compensation to the
employee, the employer is permitted a deduction under section 162(a) of the Code pursuant to section 274(e)(2). The
Department of the Treasury and the IRS believe that items described in section 274(a)(3) and (m)(3) of the Code should
be treated similarly. Therefore, the proposed regulations modify  1.274-2(f)(2)(iii) of the regulations
to achieve this consistent treatment.



Clerical changes have been made to   1.274-2(c)(6) and 1.274-2(f)(2)(i) of the regulations
to alert the reader to the fact that these provisions apply only to transactions before January 1, 1987. Both paragraphs
pertain to a former version of section 274(e)(1) of the Code that was repealed by section 142(a)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform
Act of 1986.




Special Analyses





It has been determined that these proposed regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive
Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b)
of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do
not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant
to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business.




Comments and Public Hearing





Before adopting these proposed regulations as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
that are submitted (preferably a signed original and eight (8) copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. All comments
will be available for public inspection and copying in their entirety.



A public hearing has been scheduled for Friday, April 14, 1995, 10 a.m. in the IRS Auditorium, Seventh Floor, 7400 Corridor,
Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC. Because of access restrictions, visitors
will not be admitted beyond the building lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts.



The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing.



Persons who wish to present oral comments at the hearing must submit written comments and an outline of the topics to
be discussed and the time to be devoted to each topic by March 24, 1995.



A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person or team for making comments.



An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed.
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the hearing.




Drafting Information





The principal authors of these proposed regulations are David N. Pardys, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee
Benefits and Exempt Organizations), and John T. Sapienza, Jr., Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax
and Accounting), IRS. However, personnel from other offices of the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their
development.




List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1





Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




Proposed Amendments to the Regulations





Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is amended as follows:




PART 1_INCOME TAXES







Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows:








Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805  * * *








Par. 2. 

Section 1.62-2 is amended by adding a second sentence to paragraph (h)(1) as follows:




 1.62-2 

Reimbursements and other expense allowance arrangements.



* * * * *





(h) 

Withholding and payment of employment taxes_(1) When excluded from wages.

 * * * If an arrangement provides advances, allowances, or reimbursements for meal and entertainment
expenses and a portion of the payment is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan under paragraphs (d)(2) of this
section due solely to section 274(n), then notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section, these nondeductible
amounts are not treated as wages and are not subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes.




* * * * *







Par. 3. 

Section 1.132-5 is amended by adding paragraphs (s) and (t) to read as follows:



 1.132-5 

Working condition fringes.




* * * * *





(s) 

Application of section 274(a)(3).

 (1) If an employer's deduction under section 162(a) for dues paid or incurred for membership in any club organized
for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose, is disallowed by section 274(a)(3), the amount, if
any, of an employee's working condition fringe benefit relating to an employer-provided membership in the club is
determined without regard to the application of section 274(a) to the employee. To be excludible as a working condition
fringe benefit, however, the amount must otherwise qualify for deduction by the employee under section 162(a). If
an employer characterizes as compensation under section 274(e)(2) the amount paid for or incurred for membership
in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose, then the expense is deductible
by the employer as compensation and no amount may be excluded from the employee's gross income as a working condition
fringe benefit.



(2) 

Examples.

 These examples illustrate this paragraph (s):








Example 1.

 Assume that Company 

X

 provides Employee 

B

 with a country club membership valued at $20,000 which 

X

 does not treat as compensation under section 274(e)(2). 

B

 substantiates, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, that the club was used 40 percent for business
purposes. The business use of the club (40 percent) will be considered a working condition fringe benefit, notwithstanding
that the employer's deduction for the dues allocable to the business use is disallowed by section 274(a)(3). Therefore,


B

 may exclude from gross income $8,000 (40 percent of the club dues, which reflects 

B

's business use). 

B

 must include $12,000 in gross income as a fringe benefit (60 percent of the value of the club dues, which reflects 

B

's personal use). 

X

 may deduct as compensation the value of the club dues which reflects 

B

's personal use provided the amount satisfied the other requirements for a salary or compensation deduction under
section 162.





Example 2

. Assume the same facts as 

Example 1

 except that Company 

X

 treats the $20,000 which it pays for Employee 

B

's club dues as compensation under section 274(e)(2). 

B

 can substantiate, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section, that the club was used 40 percent for business
purposes. The business use of the club (40 percent), however, will not be considered a working condition fringe benefit
because the section 274(a)(3) disallowance will apply to 

B

. Therefore, 

B

 must include $20,000 (the entire of the club membership) in gross income.

(t) 

Application of section 274(m)(3). 

If an employer's deduction under section 162(a) for amounts paid or incurred for the travel expenses of a spouse, dependent,
or other individual accompanying an employee is disallowed by section 274(m)(3), the amount, if any, of the employee's
working condition fringe benefit relating to the employer-provided travel is determined without regard to the application
of section 274(m)(3). To be excludible as a working condition fringe benefit, however, the amount must otherwise
qualify for deduction by the employee under section 162(a). The amount will qualify for deduction and for exclusion
as a working condition fringe benefit if it can be adequately shown that the spouse's, dependent's, or other accompanying
individual's presence on the employee's business trip has a bona fide business purpose and if the employee substantiates
the travel within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. If the travel does not qualify as a working condition
fringe benefit, the employee must include in gross income as a fringe benefit the value of the employer's payment of
travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying the employee on business travel.
See   1.61-21(a)(4) and 1.162-2(c). If an employer characterizes as compensation under
section 274(e)(2) the amount paid for or incurred for the travel expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual
accompanying an employee, then the expense is deductible by the employer as compensation and no amount may be excluded
from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe benefit.


Par. 4. 

Section 1.274-2 is amended as follows:
1. The second sentence of paragraph (c)(6) is added.
2. The paragraph heading for (f)(2)(i) is revised.
3. The paragraph heading and introductory language of paragraph (f)(2)(iii) is revised.
The revised and added provisions read as follows:


 1.274-2

Disallowance of deductions for certain expenses for entertainment, amusement, or recreation.


* * * * *


(c) * * *
(6) * * * This paragraph (c)(6) applies to club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 1987.


* * * * *


(f) * * *
(2) * * *
(i) 

Business meals and similar expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1987.* * *


* * * * *


(iii) Certain entertainment and travel expenses treated as compensation.

 Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment (or for use of a facility in connection therewith) or for travel described
in section 274(m)(3), if an employee is the recipient of the entertainment or travel, is not subject to the limitations
on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to the extent that the expenditure
is treated by the taxpayer_

Contractors' Safety for Ammunition and Explosives



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary of Defense, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Defense (DoD) proposes to codify its revised explosives safety standards for ammunition and explosives
(A&E) work performed under DoD contracts. This proposed rule is necessary to minimize the potential for mishaps
that could interrupt DoD operations, delay project completion dates, adversely impact DoD production base or capability,
damage or destroy DoD-owned material/equipment, cause injury to DoD personnel, or endanger the general public.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Pursuant to the authority vested in the Secretary of Defense in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 172, DoD Directive 6055.9
established the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board as a joint activity of the Department of Defense subject
to the direction, authority and control of the Secretary of Defense. The majority of the standards impacting upon
the public were adopted prior to the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act. This proposed rule is intended
to ensure public awareness of the extent of the explosives safety standards as well as offer the public an opportunity
to comment on the standards. Written comments may be submitted to the addressee above. All comments will be available
for examination upon request.


Subpart Q is under development. When complete, it will provide information only_no requirements. The information
will address the HCSDS sometimes furnished with solicitations or contracts to provide an insight into potentially
hazardous characteristics of the materials involved in the production of the item addressed in the solicitation.
Contractors retain the ultimate responsibility for assuring the safety of their personnel and establishment.


Information provided by the HCSDS is derived from other sources. Verification of such data as shipping and storage
hazard division and storage compatibility group information must be done through the DoD Joint Hazard Classification
System (JHCS) or Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.


As stated in  184.47(d) to Subpart E, these classifications pertain to A&E packaged for transportation
or storage. Such hazard classification information may not be valid when applied to the hazards associated with manufacturing
or loading processes, For such processes, the materials and processes must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Sources
of information to support this analysis are available from service research and development organizations through
contract channels and other sources. The methodologies described in  184.199(d) to Subpart P for propellants
is an example of an acceptable approach. Subpart H,  184.73 through  184.81 provides examples of processes
requiring analysis to determine the hazards.


The benefits of this proposed rule in terms of the protection of the public and ensuring contract performance are expected
to balance its potential cost or administrative impacts. Only provisions related to conventional A&E operations
have been included in this proposed rule. No attempt was made to encompass general industrial safety, occupational
health concerns, chemical warfare agents, radiation, or over-the-road transportation requirements, because
these are either the responsibility of other regulatory agencies (for example, DOT, DOL/OSHA, or NRC) or may be addressed
elsewhere in the contract by the procuring activity. Budgetary effects of this proposed rule are minimal since existing
DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement coverage already requires compliance with safety requirements
in A&E solicitations and contracts. Finally, because this proposed rule is needed to minimize the potential
for A&E mishaps that could adversely impact DoD and the public, timely publication in the 

Federal Register

 is important.

Subpart C_Safe Practices 



 184.19 


General. 



This subpart provides general safe practices for all A&E operations addressed in this part. When these practices
exceed or differ from local or national codes or requirements, the more restrictive shall apply. 



 184.20 


Personnel and materials limits. 



(a) The cardinal rule to be observed in any location or operation involving explosives, ammunition, severe fire hazards,
or toxic materials is to limit exposure to a minimum number of personnel, for a minimum amount of time, to the minimum
amount of the hazardous material consistent with safe and efficient operations. All operations shall be examined
to devise methods for reducing the number of people exposed, the time of exposure, and the quantity of material subject
to a single incident. Determination of personnel limits requires that jobs not essential to a particular hazardous
operation be performed elsewhere; that no unnecessary personnel visit the location; and that frequent, consecutive
operations shall not be permitted in the same room or building without adequate dividing walls, firewalls, or operational
shields, depending upon the nature of the hazard. Personnel limits should allow for necessary supervision, workers,
and transient workers. 

(b) Determination of limits for hazardous materials requires a careful analysis of all facts including operation
timing, intraplant transportation methods, size of the items, and the chemical and physical characteristics of
the material. Lower limits are required for the more sensitive or hazardous materials. Limits should be established
for each operation, so that each worker may be charged with the responsibility of not exceeding the established limit.
Limits need not be expressed in units of weight or in the number of items as such. They may be given in terms of trays, boxes,
racks, or other units more easily observed and controlled. Limits shall not be based on the maximum quantity of explosives
allowed by the existing quantity/distance separations when lesser quantities of explosives will suffice for the
operations. 

(c) The maximum number of personnel and quantity of explosives permitted at any one time shall be prominently displayed
in all buildings, cubicles, cells, and rooms containing A&E. These limits shall be kept current, and enforced
by the supervisor, foreman, or worker in charge. The personnel and explosives limits for all operations shall be recorded
in the applicable standing operating procedure (SOP). Personnel limits need not be posted in storage magazines,
magazine areas, or transfer points. Explosives limits need only be posted in storage magazines for which the limit
differs from that for other magazines in the block, or when unusual circumstances prevent the limit from being readily
apparent. 



 184.21 


Standing operating procedures (SOPs). 



Prior to starting any operation involving hazardous materials, adequate SOPs shall be developed, reviewed, and
approved by qualified personnel. The SOPs shall be clearly written to avoid confusion and ensure process control
at all times. 

(a) 

Preparation

. All aspects of a procedure shall be examined to determine a safe and orderly course of action for accomplishing the
work. Controlled tests may be necessary in order to establish SOPs for certain operations. The SOP shall include,
at a minimum, such items as safety requirements; specific emergency procedures; personal protective clothing and
equipment; personnel and explosives limits for each operation; equipment designation; location and sequence of
operations; and the particulars regarding how, when, where, and by whom each task of the operation shall be performed.


(b) 

Dissemination

. Supervisors shall be responsible for explaining duties prescribed by the SOP to all personnel involved in an A&E
operation. 

(c) 

Posting

. Those portions of the approved SOP, determined by the managing authority to be necessary to facilitate operations,
shall be posted in a spot convenient to all stations involved in the operation. This need not be at the work station if
the worker could be distracted, causing an accident. Supervisory personnel shall assume responsibility for enforcing
provisions of the SOP; and should maintain copies of the entire document. 

(d) 

Emergency procedures

. Action to be taken in the event of electrical storms, utility or mechanical failures and the like, occurring during
the manufacturing, handling, or processing of A&E and other hazardous materials, shall be set forth in the SOP
as described in the preceding paragraphs, or shall be set forth in separate SOPs prepared specifically for such purposes.


(e) 

Recertification

. SOPs shall be constantly reviewed by qualified personnel, changed and recertified by the managing authority as
often as necessary to reflect improved methods, equipment substitutions, facility modification, or process revisions.

(f) 

Training. 

Operator training shall cover approved safety procedures, hazardous materials information, safety and warning
devices, personal protective clothing and equipment, and emergency equipment.


 184.22

Storage in operating buildings.


(a) Only those quantities of hazardous materials (excluding explosives, propellant and pyrotechnic materials)
essential for current operations shall be stored within an operating building. Explosive materials exceeding work
requirements shall be stored in a separate service storage magazine area located at the appropriate intraline distance
from the operating building or area, based on the quantity of explosives stored in the service magazine.

(b) If storage is required by operational necessity, and intraline distance is not available for a separate storage
magazine, contractors may designate in-process holding containers or structures within the operating building,
provided the following apply:

(1) Those containers or structures would preclude propagation from the operational location to the holding site
if an explosives mishap should occur at the operational site.
(2) Consideration is given to the structural containment afforded, venting, and the use of non-propagating packaging
within the temporary holding site.
(3) Quantities of A&E in these holding sites are kept as low as possible, not exceeding amounts required for one
half of a work shift.

(4) Procedures have been developed to minimize exposure during transfer operations.
(5) Plant managers acquire and approve documented test results that confirm non-propagation characteristics.
(c) If operationally required, A&E that are a part of the work in process within the building may be stored in operating
buildings non-operational hours, providing the following requirements are strictly observed:
(1) Explosives limits are not exceeded.
(2) Containers of bulk explosives or propellants are secured and covered.
(3) Processing equipment, such as powder hoppers and pipelines, is empty.
(d) Before an operation in a building shuts down for longer than a weekend or normal holiday period, all hazardous materials
should be processed through the facility. If this is not possible, as much of the in-process material as possible should
be processed and transferred to an approved storage area before shutdown; no new material should be introduced. The
additional precautions listed in  184.22(c), shall apply, and responsible personnel shall be informed of
the above storage conditions.


 184.23

Housekeeping in hazardous areas.



(a) Structures containing explosives shall be kept clean and orderly.
(b) Explosives and explosives dusts shall not accumulate on structural members, radiators, heating coils, steam,
gas, air, water supply pipes, or electrical fixtures.

(c) Spillage of explosives and other hazardous materials shall be prevented by proper design of equipment, training
of employees, provision for catch pans, and so forth. For example, hoppers should be large enough to comfortably accommodate
the size of charges used. A painted stripe on the inside of the hopper shall serve as a reminder of the proper filling
height. Catch pans or splash pans should be provided beneath drawoff pipes and TNT flakers, around transfer piping,
beneath powder bags on small arms ammunition charging machines, and so forth. Spillage shall be promptly removed.
(d) A regular program of cleaning shall be conducted to maintain safe conditions. General cleaning shall not be conducted
while hazardous operations are being performed.

(e) Hot water or steam should be used for cleaning floors in buildings containing explosives. When neither is practical,
sweeping compounds that are nonabrasive and compatible with the explosives involved may be used. Such compounds
may be combustible, but not volatile (closed cup flash point shall not be less than 230 
 F). Sweeping compounds containing wax shall not be used on conductive flooring. Because nitrated organic explosives
can form sensitive explosive compounds with caustic alkalies, cleaning agents containing such alkalies shall not
be used around them. 

(f) Nonferrous wire brushes may be used in cleaning explosives-processing equipment only when other methods of cleaning
are ineffective; a thorough inspection should follow such cleaning to ensure that no wire bristles remain in the equipment.
This applies also to cleaning magnesium ingot molds and molds for any other metal used in an explosive. Substituting
fiber brushes for hair brushes is recommended to reduce generation of static. 

(g) All loose explosives swept up from floors of operating buildings shall be destroyed. Explosives recovered from
sources other than ammunition breakdown operations and equipment shall be thoroughly inspected to determine disposition.
It may be reused, screened, reprocessed, or destroyed, as the situation warrants.



 184.24

Explosives waste in operating areas.


(a) At this writing, the Environmental Protection Agency is developing rules which shall apply to each contractor
beyond the scope of this part. Explosive safety should not be compromised while meeting environmental considerations.

(b) Each waste material generated in an explosives area shall require analysis to determine appropriate methods
for safe handling and disposition. All explosives waste and contaminated materials shall be kept in covered containers
marked to indicate their contents, preferably located in isolated bays or outside the buildings.
(c) Containers for scrap black powder and smokeless powders shall contain water. Certain pyrotechnic, tracer, flare
and similar compositions shall be totally immersed in mineral oil or fuel oil in the waste containers. Waste initiating
explosives shall be kept to a minimum, usually under water or other selected media, and shall be handled with great
care. Explosives waste materials should not be left in operating buildings overnight during normal periods of shutdown
or over weekends and holidays.

(d) Workers shall be trained to transport explosives wastes in designated vehicles (see  184.38) to storage
locations specifically assigned for that purpose. Explosives waste shall not be stored with serviceable explosives.
A minimum of magazine distance shall be maintained between locations where explosives wastes are stored, and those
used for serviceable ammunition and explosives.


 184.25

Procedure before electrical storms.



(a) When an electrical storm approaches, all personnel shall evacuate locations where lightning could initiate
explosions. Such locations include:
(1) Operating buildings or facilities containing explosives or explosives-loaded ammunition, not equipped with
lightning protection systems, and locations within unbarricaded intraline distance of such facilities;
(2) Buildings containing explosives dust or vapors, whether or not equipped with lightning protection systems,
and locations within unbarricaded intraline distance of such buildings;
(3) Magazines, open storage sites, or loading docks, not equipped with lightning protection systems; and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Locations, with or without lightning protection, where operations involving unprotected electro-explosive
devices or circuitry are being performed.
(b) A qualified person in authority should make the final decision about evacuation. When special warning is required
for shutdown, volunteer observers or a detector (lightning detection system) may be used.
(c) All personnel shall evacuate to locations identified in the SOP. These locations shall be at unbarricaded intraline
distance or greater, or in a shelter providing equivalent protection.


 184.26 

Explosives in process during shutdown.


When electrical storms cause evacuation of explosives buildings, operations requiring constant attention shall
be manned by the minimum number of personnel consistent with safety requirements. Once the process has reached a condition
in which it is considered safe to leave, the building shall be completely evacuated. Explosives processes requiring
constant attention should not be started when an electrical storm threatens.


 184.27 

Maintenance and repairs to equipment and buildings.


(a) All new or newly repaired explosives processing equipment shall be examined and tested to ensure that it is in safe
working condition before being placed in service.
(b) Before repairs can proceed on equipment exposed to explosives, a decontamination tag, signed by supervisory
personnel, shall be placed on the equipment. The tag shall certify all explosives have been removed from the equipment
or identify parts that could not be cleaned, and shall provide maintenance personnel with instructions on safe handling.
(c) Major repairs or changes shall not be undertaken in a building during regular operations until the hazardous material
has been removed and the employee in charge of the building informed.
(d) Repairs cannot start in an explosives location until all explosives have been removed from equipment, crevices,
areas beneath floors, within walls and pipes, and under fittings where explosives could be ignited. The entire area
should be wetted or washed down thoroughly. An inspection of the immediate vicinity shall assure no explosives remain.
(e) After repairing, maintaining or adjusting machines and equipment, an inspection shall be made to assure all tools
used for the work are removed. Before work resumes, operators should check their own equipment to ensure its safe operating
condition.
(f) Electricians shall not wear conductive shoes while working on electrical equipment. Exposed explosives and
other static-sensitive hazardous material shall be removed before work begins.
(g) Safe practices specified elsewhere in this part shall also apply to maintenance employees.
(h) Maintenance and tool rooms in an operating line should be separated from explosives by intraline distance. Protection
equivalent to that afforded by a suitable barrier shall be provided when this proves impractical.


 184.28 

Safety hand-tools.


(a) Hand tools constructed of wood or materials such as bronze, lead, and ``K'' Monel metal shall be used for work in
locations that contain exposed explosives or hazardous concentrations of flammable dusts, gases, or vapors. While
safer, the nonferrous metals used in so-called non-sparking tools may produce sparks.
(b) If their strength makes the use of ferrous metal hand tools necessary, exposed explosives and other highly combustible
materials shall be removed from the area as required in  184.27 (b) through (d).


 184.29 

Operational shields.


(a) The purpose of operational shields is to prevent propagation of explosions from one explosives operation or location
to another, to protect facilities and equipment and to provide personnel protection. Therefore, all A&E operations
and processes shall be assessed prior to work performance to determine the type of hazard involved, the level of risk
associated with the A&E material or item, and the corresponding level of protection normally provided.
(b) The primary hazards that accompany explosions and deflagrations are potential blast overpressure, fragmentation
(primary and secondary), and thermal effects. These hazards and the following factors shall be considered, as a minimum,
during the above assessment:
(1) Initiation sensitivity,
(2) Potential ignition sources,
(3) Quantity of A&E,
(4) Rate of burning,
(5) A&E and personnel resource exposures, and
(6) Protection capabilities of shields.
(c) When analysis of these factors indicates an unacceptable probability of explosion or deflagration, resources
shall be dedicated to additional protection for personnel and equipment. If operational shields are selected for
this purpose, they shall be tested prior to installation to assure compliance with the following criteria:
(1) Prevent propagation due to blast overpressure.
(2) Contain all fragmentation or direct fragments (primary and secondary) away from areas requiring protection.
(3) Contain thermal effects to prevent propagation.

<TEXT>
 

(d) Operational shields shall be tested under conditions that simulate the operational environment. A&E materials
or items used in the test shall correspond to those that may be involved in a maximum credible incident, plus a 25 percent
overcharge. Test methods, recording instrumentation and written documentation shall clearly demonstrate that
the above protection criteria are met before the operational shield is used. Shields meeting the requirements of
MIL-STD-398,
 

Shields, Operational for Ammunition Operations, Criteria for Design of and Tests for Acceptance,

 are acceptable. Analysis rather than testing of shields may be acceptable on a case-by-case basis. When the doors
of explosives processing equipment function as operational shields, interlocking devices shall be installed to
prevent the operator from opening the door while the equipment is in operation.





 184.30

Special clothing.



(a) A changing area shall be established for employees who must remove their street clothes to wear special clothing
(explosives plant clothing, anticontamination clothing, impervious clothing, and so forth). To avoid exposing
people not involved in A&E operations to unnecessary risks, special clothing worn during A&E operations
shall not be worn or taken away from the premises. Special clothing should not be altered. Cotton undergarments, including
socks, shall be worn whenever static electricity is a hazard.

(b) Explosives plant clothing, generally referred to as powder uniforms, shall be fastened with nonmetallic fasteners
and easily removable. Pockets should be of the lattice type. Pants and sleeves should be tapered and without cuffs,
and pants should extend over the tops of footwear. These garments should be flame resistant or made of flame retardant
material. Each plant should have laundering facilities available for removing contaminants from explosives plant
clothing. Hazardous waste procedures should be established for the laundry. Regular testing shall verify the effectiveness
of the laundering operations.

(c) When explosives contaminated clothing is sent to an off-plant laundry facility, the contractor is responsible
for informing the laundry of the hazards associated with the contamination and any special laundering or disposal
requirements.



 184.31 

Conductive footwear.



(a) When conductive mats, floors, and runners are required, operators shall wear conductive shoes. Personnel visiting
any such area shall wear conductive shoes, ankle straps, or similar devices, one on each leg.

(b) Tests of conductive shoes or equivalent, shall be made initially and daily thereafter to ensure that the resistance
from the person through the conductive shoes is less than or equal to one million ohms. Documentation of this testing,
to include calibration of test equipment, shall be kept by supervisory personnel. The test voltage shall not exceed
500 volts. The short circuit current across the electrodes (plates) shall not exceed 2.0 milliamperes (0.5 milliamperes
is preferred). The instruments shall have built-in safeguards preventing the test subject from experiencing electric
shock. Tests shall not be performed in rooms with exposed explosives. Shoes should be tested first without cleaning
the soles and heels; if the resistance does not exceed allowed levels, the shoes may be worn. If resistance exceeds
450,000 ohms per shoe, the pair shall be cleaned and retested. Sandpaper, solvents, or other agents affecting the
structure or conductivity of the sole materials should not be used. Separating or removing the conductive sock liner
from the conductive plug or depressing the conductive plugs below the surface of the insole of the shoe can cause high
resistance. Nonconductive stockings such as silk, wool, and synthetics; and foot powders, which have a drying action,
shall be avoided. Conductive shoes should be clearly labeled as such.



 184.32 

Materials handling equipment.



(a) Gasoline-, diesel-, and LP-powered equipment shall not be refueled inside warehouses or similar buildings containing
ammunition and explosives. If the fuel supply is exhausted while the equipment is inside a building, the equipment
shall be towed outside to a safe location for refueling: at least 20 feet from inert buildings, and inert loading docks;
and 90 feet from explosives locations or buildings. Doors and windows through which vapors may enter the building
shall be closed during refueling. Refueling trucks shall not be located close to explosives buildings during refueling
operations, but shall be parked as far as practicable from these buildings, in accordance with the above requirements.

(b) Gasoline-, diesel-, and LP-powered equipment shall not be stored in buildings containing explosives or ammunition
or on explosives loading docks or piers when A&E is present. A central storage location for gasoline-, diesel-,
and LP-powered equipment is preferred. Such a building should be located at least 50 feet from other buildings to avoid
a fire hazard.

(c) Gasoline-, diesel-, and LP-powered equipment shall receive periodic inspections of exhaust and electrical
systems with the results documented. Spark arresters shall be required on exhaust systems.



 184.33 

Parking of privately owned vehicles.



Controlled parking of privately owned vehicles within an establishment minimizes fire and explosion hazards and
prevents congestion in an emergency. Vehicles should be parked in designated areas only, at intraline distance and
outside of restricted areas. Vehicles shall not be parked so close to an explosives building or structure that fire
could spread from them to the building, or that they could impede firefighters.



 184.34 

Prohibited articles in hazardous areas.



Except as authorized, personnel shall not carry matches, cigarette lighters, or other flame-producing devices
into explosives areas. Personal articles that increase existing hazards are also prohibited.



 184.35 

Photographic materials in hazardous areas.



Photoflash bulbs or electronic flash attachments shall not be used around exposed explosives, explosive dusts,
flammable gases, or vapors. Only lighting equipment approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory shall
be used.



 184.36 

Operational explosives containers.



(a) Containers used for intraplant transportation or temporary storage of process explosives and energetic materials
shall be designed to prevent leakage. These containers should be equipped with covers (lids) and constructed of materials
in the following order of precedence:

(1) Conductive rubber or conductive plastic,

(2) Nonferrous metal-lined boxes without seams or rivet heads under which explosive dusts could accumulate,

(3) Paper-lined wooden boxes, or

(4) Fiber drums.

(b) These containers should be marked with the type of explosive or hazard involved.

(c) Because of their fragility and fragment potential, glass containers shall not be used.



 184.37 

Intraplant rail transportation.



This section addresses intraplant transportation of explosives and may exceed national requirements because of
material characteristics and operational hazards. When construction or major modification of transportation,
packaging, or loading facilities is planned or anticipated, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that applicable
Federal, state, and local requirements and those contained within this manual are met. The applicable requirements
promulgated by Department of Transportation (DOT) and other Federal or local regulatory agencies concerning preparation,
marking, and shipment of ammunition and explosives should appear in the contract.

(a) 

Operating rules. 

Local procedures to ensure safe and efficient rail movement of A&E shall be developed, and shall include the following
minimum requirements:

(1) Movements in the classification yards are considered switch movements. All others are considered transfer movements.
Before cars containing A&E move, air hoses shall be coupled, air brakes cut-in and in proper working order, and
the car doors closed. Cars should remain coupled while in motion. Safety precautions shall be observed when breaking
air hose connections. 

(2) When single explosives-loaded cars are spotted, the hand brakes shall be set and the wheels properly chocked.
When more than one car is spotted and its engine detached, the hand brakes shall be set on enough cars to ensure sufficient
braking. Hand brakes shall be set on the downgrade end of the cut of rail cars. Reliance should not be placed on the automatic
air brakes to hold spotted cars.

(3) A person should be stationed at the hand brake of a car mover when in use. 

(4) During transfer movements within establishments, full or partial loads in rail cars shall be blocked and braced
so they cannot shift position.

(5) Empty rail cars shall remain in warehouses, magazines, buildings, or loading docks until all warning placards
have been removed or reversed, as appropriate. 

(6) Special care shall be taken to avoid rough handling of cars containing A&E. These cars shall not be ``sent off''
while in motion and shall be carefully coupled to avoid unnecessary shocks. Other cars shall not be ``cut off'' and
allowed to strike a car containing explosives. 

(7) A buffer car should separate rail cars containing explosives and the switching engine when in motion. 

(8) Flags or signals at both ends of a rail car or cut of cars shall protect personnel working in, on, or under the cars.
During these periods, cars shall not be coupled or moved. 

(9) Portable transmitters and railroad locomotives equipped with two-way radios shall not transmit when passing
explosives operating buildings where electro-explosive devices are in use. The contractor shall determine minimum
safe distances based on radio frequency (RF), frequency modulation (FM), and amplitude modulation (AM) of the transmitter.


(b) 

Rail car inspections. 

(1) Qualified personnel shall inspect empty rail cars intended to transport A&E upon arrival, verifying that
the carrier has complied with DOT requirements. 

(2) Before loading, the brakes shall be set on cars spotted for loading, and bridge plates equipped with side boards
and stops shall be provided. 

(c) 

Loaded incoming rail car inspections. 

(1) Railroad cars with A&E should, upon arrival, be inspected at remote sites. If no problems are found, rail cars
may be opened for interior inspection or moved to the designated unloading point. 

(2) A&E-loaded cars on which foreign and suspicious articles have been attached outside or underneath the car,
or that have a defect which could affect the safety of the establishment or the contents of the car, shall be moved to
the suspect car site for disposition. 

(3) Cars should be inspected after unloading A&E to ensure that they are clean and free from loose explosives and
flammable materials, and that placards and car certificates have been removed. Explosives swept from the floors
shall be disposed of properly.



 184.38 

Intraplant motor vehicle transportation.



(a) 

Operating rules. 

Procedures for safe transportation of A&E in motor vehicles shall be developed locally, and should include the
following:

(1) Brakes shall be set and the wheels chocked while loading and un-loading on a grade. 

(2) A&E shall not be loaded or unloaded when a motor vehicle's engine is running, unless the engine is providing
power to accessories used in the loading and unloading, such as mechanical handling equipment. 

(3) Vehicles, including flat-bed, partly or completely loaded, shall have the load blocked and braced to prevent
shifting during transit. 

(b) 

Vehicle inspections. 

All motor vehicles used to transport A&E shall be inspected before loading to ensure the following:

(1) Batteries and wiring shall not come into contact with containers of A&E.

(2) Exposed ferrous metal in the interior of the vehicle body shall be covered with nonsparking material when scrap
and bulk explosives are being transported in containers that could be damaged, or when explosives could otherwise
become exposed. 

(3) A portable fire extinguisher of the appropriate class shall be carried on motor vehicles used for transporting
A&E. 

(4) Motor vehicles transporting A&E within the establishment but outside the explosives area, shall bear at
least two appropriate placards. These placards should be removed or covered whenever the vehicle is not loaded. Reflectorized
placards are preferred. 

(5) Motor vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines, used near explosives scrap, waste, or items contaminated
with explosives, shall have exhaust system spark arresters and carburetor flame arresters (authorized air cleaners).
They should be inspected and cleaned to prevent accumulation of carbon. 

(c) 

Loaded incoming vehicle inspections. 

(1) Vehicles with A&E should, upon arrival, be inspected at remote sites. If no problems are found, vehicles may
be opened for interior inspection or moved to the designated unloading point. 

(2) A&E-loaded vehicles on which foreign and suspicious articles have been attached outside or underneath the
car, or that have a defect which could affect the safety of the establishment or the contents of the vehicle, shall be
moved to the suspect car site for disposition. 

(3) Vehicles should be inspected after unloading A&E to ensure that they are clean and free from loose explosives
and flammable materials, and that placards and vehicle certificates have been removed. Explosives swept from the
floors shall be disposed of properly. 



 184.39 

Inspection of pyrotechnic, propellant and explosive mixers.



Mixers used for manufacturing pyrotechnics, propellants and explosives shall have an initial inspection prior
to use and shall be on a periodic inspection schedule during operating life. 

(a) The initial inspection shall, as a minimum, require radiographic and dye penetrant inspection of the blades and
blade to shaft areas, blade to bowl clearances, allowable tolerances, testing for proper function of operating systems
such as bowl positioning mechanisms, safety interlocks, fire detection and prevention and test of computer controller
software selfcheck.

<TEXT>
 

(b) Periodic inspection shall be provided during the operating life of the mixer. The inspection program shall be
based on manufacturer's recommendations, operating history of like mixers, and any items identified in hazards
analysis of the particular mixer and its operation. The inspection program shall include:

(1) Tests and visual inspection criteria to be performed prior to each use to include associated equipment which might
come loose and fall into the mixer.

(2) Periodic inspections of clearances between blades and bowl at sufficient points to detect any distortion of the
bowl or kettle.

(3) Inspection and test for drive system wear, bearings condition and gear alignment with loading to establish operation
within tolerances when applicable.

(4) Inspection and test of proper function of operating subsystems such as bowl handling, safety and fire and control,
including computer software selfcheck.

(c) It is recommended that large (over 80 gallon) vertical blade mixers in high torque applications have a dye penetrant
check of the blades annually or after every 300 hours of operation. Melt-cast kettles are not considered high torque
mixers. Also, it is recommended that an inspection of clearances and operating systems be performed after any maintenance,
unusual even such as severe weather exposure mishandling of bowl or mixer or long idle period.

(d) A log of the maintenance and inspection shall be maintained. Trend analysis of clearances should be used to detect
wear which might become hazardous.



Subpart D_Principles and Application of Quantity/Distance (Q/D), Standard Explosives Facilities, and Siting
Requirements



 184.40


General.



Explosives classes and divisions identified in this subpart are defined in TB 700-2,
 

Explosives Hazard Classification Procedures,

 and more fully explained in subpart F of this part. This subpart D sets forth the following:





(a) Rules for establishing quantities of explosives;

(b) Computations and determinations of quantity distance;

(c) Assessment of the explosion effects, such as facility damage and personnel injury expected at specific scaled
distances for Hazard Division 1.1, explosives;

(d) Recommended methods for controlling the effects of Hazard Division 1.1, explosions;

(e) Acceptable exposures at specific scaled distances;

(f) Types and general specifications of various ammunition and explosives facilities; and

(g) Siting requirements for specific facilities.



 184.41


Quantity/distance (Q/D).



(a) Quantity distances are determined by establishing a net explosive weight (NEW) at a point and measuring from that
point to an exposure. The source of a Q/D measurement is called a potential explosion site, or PES. For Q/D purposes,
one considers the total net explosives weight that will be involved in an accidental explosion at the PES. A PES may
be a round of ammunition, a vehicle, an operating building, or simply a location where explosives are stacked.

(b) Any building, vehicle, location, or ammunition that shall be protected from an accidental explosion at another
source, is called the exposed site, or ES. An ES may contain explosives requiring protection from a secondary explosive
source located a distance away. An ES may also be a home, stadium, high-rise apartment, a public highway or any other
facility or location requiring protection from an accidental explosion.

(c) Separation distances for Q/D purposes are measured in straight lines from the nearest part of the room, bay or structure
containing explosives (PES) to the nearest point of the exposed structure.



 184.42


Establishment of quantity of explosives and distances.



(a) 

Quantity of explosives.

 The Quantity/Distance tables are used to provide appropriate distances from potential explosion sites (PES). The
hazard classification of the A&E and the weight of explosives involved are primary characteristics governing
the use of Q/D tables. The definitions and methods for determining hazard classifications are in subpart F of this
part. Methods for determining the net explosives weight (NEW) is explained in the following:

(1) 

Mass-detonating explosives (Hazard Division 1.1).

 The total weight of explosives (NEW).

(2) 

Nonmass-detonating explosives

_(i) 

Propellants (Hazard Division 1.3).

 The total weight of the propellants alone is the net propellant weight.

(ii) 

Pyrotechnic items (Hazard Division 1.1 and Hazard Division 1.3).

 The sum of the net weights of the pyrotechnic composition and the explosives involved.

(iii) 

Bulk metal powder and pyrotechnic compositions.

 The sum of the net weights of metal powders and pyrotechnic compositions in the containers.

(iv) 

Other ammunition.

 The net weight of high explosives (Hazard Division 1.1), plus any blast contribution determined by test, if any, from
propellant, pyrotechnic components, or expelling charges (percent of Hazard Division 1.3).

(3) 

Combinations of mass-detonating and nonmass-detonating A&E (excluding Hazard Division 1.4).

 The total net weight of the mass-detonating and the nonmass-detonating A&E. If the nonmass-detonating items,
alone, require a greater distance than the total explosives so computed, then this greater distance is mandatory.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Combinations of nonmass-detonating ammunition and explosives of different class 1 divisions shall be treated
as follows: 

(1) Determine the required separation of each division. 

(ii) Use the greatest separation of those determined. 

(b) 

Q/D computations and determinations. 

(1) Throughout these requirements, NEW is used to calculate distance by means of formula D=KW

1/3,

 where D is the distance in feet, K is the appropriate risk factor and W is the NEW in pounds. Distance requirements are
sometimes expressed by the value of K, such as K9, K11, and K18 to signify K=9, K=11, K=18, respectively. 


(2) The quantity of explosives in a magazine, operating building, or other explosives site shall be the new weight
of all the explosives contained therein. Q/D shall be based on the H/D requiring the greatest separation, unless the
NEW is divided by walls or shields for that purpose.


(i) When dividing a quantity of mass-detonating explosives into smaller stacks, a suitable barrier or adequate separation
distance shall prevent propagation from one stack to another. Barriers designed and constructed in accordance with
TM 5-1300/AFM 88-22/NAVFAC P-397,
 

Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions, 

satisfy this requirement. In such cases, the explosives content of the stack requiring the greatest distance shall
govern. Otherwise Q/D computations shall be based on the sum of the mass-detonating explosives in all of the stacks.







(ii) Blast waves shall coalesce when two or more stacks of mass-detonating explosives detonate within short time
intervals (that is, when the time in milliseconds is less than 4 times the cube root of the explosive weight in pounds
for lateral target positions and less than 5.6 times the cube root of the explosive weight in pounds for axial target
positions). The resultant shock wave shall be that of a single detonation of a charge equal to the sum of the several
stacks. The actual separation time between successive detonations is influenced by the spatial separation, geometry,
and distribution of explosives; the character of the dividing wall or other barrier; and the sensitivity of the explosives.



(3) The quantity of explosives permitted in each of two or more locations shall be determined by considering each location
as a potential explosion site (PES). The quantity of explosives permitted in each of these locations shall be the amount
permitted by the distance specified in the appropriate Q/D tables considering each as a potential target site in turn,
except for service magazines (see  184.43(a)(7) and  184.43(b)(6)). 

(4) Quantity/distance tables are in Subpart F of this part. The formulae specified in Appendices A through D to Subpart
F of this part may be used to interpolate exact distances for Hazard Division 1.1 explosives. The notes to Appendix
L to Subpart F of this part provide distance formulae for Hazard Division 1.3 distances. 

(5) It is impractical to specify Q/D separations large enough to allow for the designed flight range of propulsive
units (rockets, missile motors, and catapults) that properly belong in Hazard Divisions 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3. Therefore,
maximum flight ranges for self-propelling munitions shall be disregarded. The distance required to afford protection
from fragments in credible accident situations, however, shall be established in accordance with the principles
in  184.52(f). 

(6) Separation distances for Q/D purposes shall be measured from the nearest part of an exposed structure or site,
to the nearest wall of the controlling subdivision or structure containing explosives, as appropriate. Separation
distances are measured along straight lines. 

(7) Where railroad cars or motor vehicles containing ammunition and explosives are not separated from operating
buildings, magazines, or open A&E storage sites in a manner precluding their mass detonation, the separation
distance shall be based on the total quantity of explosives (see  184.41(a)) and measured form the outside wall
of the building, railcar, vehicle, or edge of open stack closest to the target. If the explosives are separated into
smaller units so that mass detonation of the explosives in the railcars and motor vehicles and inside unit or units
shall not occur, the separation distance shall be measured from the controlling explosives unit, railcar or vehicle
closest to a target. 



(c) 

Hazard Division 1.1, explosion effects, exposure controls, and degrees of safety afforded. 

Facility damage and personnel injury from Hazard Division 1.1, A&E, principally depend on blast overpressure
and impulse, although for limited quantities fragment hazards may control Q/D. For general purposes, peak incident
overpressure is the blast parameter defining maximum permissible levels of exposure. However, in specific instances
the physical characteristics of exposed structures (such as mass, stiffness, ductility, and so forth) can make blast
impulse the principal damage-causing factor. 



(1) Separation distances for earth covered magazines (see Appendices D and E to Subpart F of this part) provide virtually
complete protection against propagation of explosions among earth-covered magazines by blast, fragments, or fire.
Some cracking of concrete barrels and rear walls, spalling and severe cracking of front walls, and damage to doors
and ventilators may, however, occur. 


(2) Aboveground magazine distances (see columns 10 and 12, Appendix D to Subpart F of this part) provide considerable
protection against propagation of explosions among above-ground magazines by blast. Depending on ammunition type,
however, there is a risk of delayed propagation by fragments or of fire spreading from one magazine to another. Properly
designed and placed barricades reduce the risk of communicating explosion through high-velocity, low-angle fragments.
Without barricades, this risk is high. 

(i) The above ground magazine separation distance of 6W

1/3

 feet corresponds to a peak overpressure level of 27 psi (1.8 bars) (1 bar=14.5 psi) when the explosion source is in the
open. Neither the overpressure nor any other pertinent blast parameter, such as impulse, shall be significantly
reduced by an ordinary storage building of conventional unstrengthened industrial construction at the explosion
site, or by the barricade required between aboveground magazines at this distance. A conventional unstrengthened
building exposed at this distance shall be destroyed, vehicles overturned and crushed, and all occupants killed.



(ii) The unbarricaded aboveground magazine separation distance of 11W

1/3

 feet corresponds to a peak overpressure level of 8 psi (0.5 bars) from an explosion source in the open. Blast observed
at this distance shall be suppressed only slightly by a storage building of conventional construction at the explosion
site. A conventional unstrengthened building exposed at this distance shall be destroyed. Blast will seriously
injure eardrums and lungs of any survivor, as will being blown down or stuck by fragments or building debris. Vehicles
will be severely damaged by blast and may be inoperable. 


(3) At blast overpressure of 12 psi (0.7 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 9W

1/3

 feet (see Appendices B and C to Subpart F of this part): 

(i) Unstrengthened buildings will suffer severe structural damage approaching total destruction. 

(ii) People at the exposed site will be killed or severely injured by being thrown about by blast or by building collapse.


(iii) Aircraft will be damaged beyond repair. If the aircraft are loaded with explosives, delayed explosions are
likely to result from subsequent fires.

(iv) Transport vehicles will be heavily damaged, probably to the extent of total loss.

(v) Direct propagation of explosion between two explosives locations is unlikely when barricades between them intercept
high-velocity, low-angle fragments (see  184.43(a)).

(vi) Improperly designed barricades or structures increase the hazard from flying debris; further, their probable
collapse threatens personnel and equipment.

(vii) Exposed structures housing personnel or containing equipment that is monetarily valuable or critically important
to the mission, may require hardening.

(4) At blast overpressure of 3.5 psi (0.24 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 18W

1/3

 (see Appendix B to Subpart F of this part):

(i) Direct propagation of explosion is not expected.

(ii) Delayed communication of explosion from fires, or equipment failure at the exposed site (ES), is possible.

(iii) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain serious damage, approximating 50 percent of the total replacement
cost.

(iv) Personnel will be critically injured or killed by fragments, debris, firebrands, and so forth.

(v) There is a 1 percent chance of eardrum damage to personnel.

(vi) Aircraft will be severely damaged from blast, fragments, and debris.

(vii) Transport vehicles' body panels will be dished and shatter-resistant window glass will crack. Though extensive,
this damage will not prevent the vehicles from operating.

(viii) Overpressure control by suppressive construction at the PES, or by protective construction at the ES, is recommended
if it is more economical than distance alone, or if distance cannot suffice.

(5) At blast overpressure of 2.3 psi (0.16 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 24W

1/3

 (for quantities up to 100,000 pounds, see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part).

(i) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain damage approximating 20 percent of their replacement cost.

(ii) Occupants of exposed structures may suffer temporary hearing loss or be injured by such blast effects as building
debris and being bodily thrown about.

(iii) Personnel in the open should not be seriously injured by the blast itself. Fragments and debris could, however,
cause injuries, depending on the PES structure and the fragmentation characteristics and amount of ammunition within.

(iv) Vehicles on the road should not be damaged unless hit by fragments or the operator loses control during the blast
wave.

(v) Aircraft appendages and sheet metal skin could be damaged by blast and possibly fragment penetrations, but should
be operational after minor repairs.

(vi) Barricading at the PES reduces injury and damage from fragments from limited quantities of explosives. Suppressive
construction at the PES or protective construction at the ES are practical ways of controlling blast over-pressure.

(6) At blast overpressure of between 2.3 psi (0.16 bars) and 1.7 psi (0.1 bars) effects and controls are intermediate
between those described in paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(7) of this section (for quantities between 100,000 and 250,000
pounds, see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part).

(7) At blast overpressure of 1.7 psi (0.1 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 30W

1/3

 (for quantities over 250,000 pounds, see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part):

(i) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain damage approximating 10 percent of their replacement cost.

(ii) Occupants of exposed unstrengthened structures may suffer injury from secondary effects, such as building
debris.

(iii) Aircraft landing and taking off could lose control and crash.

(iv) Parked military and commercial aircraft, with minor damage due to blast, should remain airworthy.

(v) Personnel in the open should not be seriously injured by the blast itself. Depending largely upon the PES structure
and the fragmentation characteristics and amount of ammunition within, however, fragments and debris could cause
injuries.

(vi) Barricading at the PES or application of minimum fragment distance requirements may reduce injury or damage
due to fragments from limited quantities of explosives.

(8) At blast overpressure of 1.2-0.90 psi (0.08-0.06 bars) occurring at scaled distance of 40W

1/3

-50W

1/3

 (see column 5, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part):

(i) Unstrengthened buildings will sustain damage approximating 5 percent of their replacement cost.

(ii) Personnel injuries are principally caused by glass breakage and building debris.

(iii) Personnel in the open should not be seriously injured by the blast itself. Depending largely upon the PES structure
and the fragmentation characteristics and amount of ammunition within, however, fragments and debris could cause
injuries.

(iv) Both orientation and limiting the surface area of exposed glass panels can reduce breakage and structural damage.



 184.43 

Permissible exposures to blast overpressure.

(5) Unmanned auxiliary power facilities, transformer stations, water treatment and pollution abatement facilities,
and other utility installations that serve the PES but are not integral, the loss of which would not create an immediate
secondary hazard. These do not need barricades. However, unmanned auxiliary power generating or converting facilities

(5) Parking lots for privately owned vehicles belonging to personnel at the PES. See  184.33.
(6) Service magazines that are part of operating lines. Distances are based on quantity/type of ammunition or explosives
in the service magazine(s), not in the operating building.
(7) Container stuffing and unstuffing operations that are routine support of PES. This applies to main support functions
set aside for support of manufacturing operations. Container stuffing and unstuffing in magazine areas are permitted
at intermagazine distances.
(c) At sites exposed to potential blast overpressure of 2.3 psi (0.16 bars) occurring at 24W

1/3

 (see column 8, Appendix A to Subpart F of this part), the following facilities or operations are permitted:

 184.44 

Ammunition and explosives facilities.


This section identifies the types, general specifications, and siting requirements of various magazines for ammunition,
explosives, and other dangerous materials.
(a) 

Barricades and earth cover for magazines_

(1) 

General. 

Both constructed barricades and undisturbed earth can protect ammunition and explosives, structures, and operations
against high-velocity, low-angle fragments, although the barricades may be destroyed in the process. Further,
barricades provide limited protection against blast in their immediate vicinity, provide no protection against
high-angle fragments, and are ineffective in reducing the blast pressure in the far field (inhabited building or
public traffic route distance).
(2) 

Barricade requirements. 

Protection is considered effective when barricades meet the following minimum requirements:
(i) The slope of a barricade will not be steeper than 2/3 (rise/run). To reduce erosion and facilitate maintenance
operations, future constructions should have a slope of 1/2.
(ii) The earth barricade shall consist of material described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(iii) Barricade height and length shall be determined as follows:
(A) 

Heights. 

Establish a reference point at the top of the far edge of one of the two stacks that the barricade is to separate. If the
tops of the stacks are at different elevations, this reference point shall be on the lower stack. Draw a line from the
reference point to the top of he other stack. Draw a second line from the reference point to form a 2 degree angle above
the first line. To limit barricade height, each should be as close as possible to the stack that served as the reference
point. See Appendices A and B of this subpart.
(B) 

Lengths. 

The length of the barricade shall be determined as shown in Appendix C of this subpart.

<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iv) Earth barricades meeting the previously identified requirements may be modified by substituting a retaining
wall, preferably of concrete, for the slope on one side. The other side shall have slope and thickness sufficient to
ensure that the width of earth required for the top is held firmly in place.
(v) Other barriers, such as earth-filled steel bin barricades for explosives-loaded aircraft, may also be used.
(3) 

Location of barricades

. The distance between the foot of the barricade and the stack of ammunition or explosives or the buildings containing
explosives represents a compromise. The shorter the distance, the shorter the height and length required for the
barricade. However, it may be necessary to extend the distance to provide access for maintenance and vehicles. If
it is impracticable to locate the barricades near the stack of ammunition or explosives or building containing explosives,
barricades may be located adjacent to the facility to be protected.
(4) 

Earth cover for magazines and barricades

. (i) Earth cover material for magazines and barricades shall be relatively cohesive (solid or wet clay and similar
types of soil are too cohesive and should not be used), free from unsanitary organic matter, trash, debris, and stones
heavier than 10 pounds or larger than 6 inches in diameter. The larger stones should be limited to the lower center of
fill and never used for earth cover over magazines. Compaction and surface preparation shall be provided, as necessary,
to maintain structural integrity and avoid erosion. Where cohesive material cannot be used, as in sandy soil, the
barricade or the earth cover over magazines should be finished with a suitable material to ensure structural integrity.



(ii) The earth fill or earth cover between earth-covered magazines may be either solid or sloped, in accordance with
the requirements of other construction features, but a minimum of 2 feet of earth cover shall be maintained over the
top of each magazine and a minimum slope of 2/3 (rise/run) starting directly above the spring line of each arch shall
be maintained. To reduce erosion and facilitate maintenance operations, future constructions should have a slope
of 2 horizontal to 1 vertical.
(b) 

Application of Q/D to earth-covered magazines

. (1) For application of quantity/distances, magazines shall not have been structurally weakened to the extent that
they could not be expected to prevent propagation of explosives. The specified thickness and slope of the earth cover
shall be maintained.
(2) Normally, earth-covered magazines shall not be constructed to face door-to-door. They should face in the same
direction with the long axes parallel to each other. In special cases where topographic or other important considerations
would result in different orientations, they shall be sited in accordance with  184.54.
(c) 

Policy on protective construction

. The present ``state of the art'' in protective construction is such as to permit any calculated level of protection
from explosion communication between adjacent bays or buildings, personnel protection against death or serious
injury from incidents in adjacent bays or buildings, and protection of vital and expensive equipment installations.
Therefore, the major obstacles in facility planning should be:




(1) Protection against explosion communication between adjacent bays or buildings and protection of personnel
against death or serious injury from incidents in adjacent bays or buildings. In situations where the protection
of personnel and facilities would be greatly enhanced or costs significantly reduced by having separate buildings
to limit explosion propagation rather than using protective construction and separation of explosive units within
one building, planning should reflect this fact.
(2) Provision of protection for vital and expensive equipment, if the additional cost is warranted.
(3) When an appropriate degree of protection can be provided either by hardening a target building or constructing
a source building to suppress/explosion effects, these factors may be taken into account and the distances/required
by the standard Q/D tables reduced. The rationale or test results justifying the reduction shall accompany A&E
site and general construction plans proposing reduced distances based on protective construction, when submitted
through the ACO for PCO approval.


 184.45


Specific siting requirements.



(a) 

Rail and truck holding yards

. (1) Generally, rail holding yards should be laid out on a unit car/group basis with each unit car/group separated
by the applicable aboveground magazine distance.
(2) If the rail holding yard is formed by two parallel ladder tracks connected by diagonal spurs, the parallel tracks
and the diagonal spurs shall be separated by applicable aboveground magazine distances for the unit/group/quantities
of high explosives.



(3) If the rail holding yard is a ``Christmas tree'' arrangement, consisting of a ladder track with diagonal dead-end
spurs projecting from each side at alternate intervals, the spurs should be separated by the applicable aboveground
magazine distance for the net quantity of high explosives in the cars on the spurs.
(4) Generally, truck holding yards should be laid out on a unit truck/group basis with each group separated by the applicable
aboveground magazine distances.
(5) Both rail and truck holding yards shall be separated from other facilities by the applicable Q/D criteria.
(6) In addition to the temporary parking of railcars, trucks or trailers containing ammunition and explosives, holding
yards also may be used to interchange truck trailers or railcars between commercial carrier and the contractor and
to conduct visual inspections.
(b) 

Classification yards

. (1) To protect the classification yard from external explosions, separation distances shall, at least, be the applicable
magazine distance.
(2) Specific quantity/distance separation is not required from the classification yard to targets other than explosive
locations when the classification yard is used exclusively for the following:


(i) Receiving, dispatching, classifying, and switching of cars.
(ii) Interchanging of trucks, trailers, railcars, or MILVANS between the common carrier and the establishment.
(iii) Conducting external inspection of motor vehicles and railcars, or opening of free-rolling doors of railcars
for the purpose of removing documents and making a visual inspection of the cargo.
(3) If the yard is used at any time for any purpose other than listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such as placing
or removal of dunnage or explosive items into or from cars, Q/D tables apply. See  184.42(b)(1) through (b)(7).
(c) 

Railcar and motor vehicle inspection stations

. (1) Specific quantity/distance separations are not required for inspection stations; however, they should be
as remote as practicable from hazardous or populated areas. The following activities may be performed at the inspection
station after railcars or motor vehicles containing ammunition and explosives are received from the delivering
carrier, before further routing within the installation:
(i) Visual inspection of railcar and motor vehicle exteriors.
(ii) Visual inspection of the cargo in vehicles (trucks, trailers, railcars, MILVANS, and so forth) that have passed
the external inspection previously indicated.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) Interchange of truck, trailers, railcars, or MILVANS between the common carrier and the establishment.

(2) If any activities, other than those previously listed, are conducted at the inspection station, Q/D tables apply.

(3) Any cars or trucks suspected of being hazardous shall be isolated consistent with applicable Q/D separation for
the hazard class and explosives quantity involved. This shall be accomplished before any subsequent action.

(d) 

Administration, industrial, and convenience areas.

 (1) Administration and industrial areas shall be separated from PES's by inhabited building distances.

(2) Auxiliary facilities such as heating plants, line offices, break areas, briefing rooms for daily work schedules
or site safety matters, joiner shops, security posts, and similar functions that are required to be at explosives
operations and servicing only one building or operation shall be so located and constructed as to provide prudent
fire protection.

(e) 

Underground tanks or pipelines.

 These should be separated from buildings or stacks containing A&E of Hazard Divisions 1.2 through 1.4 by a minimum
distance of 80 feet. The separation for Hazard Division 1.1, should correspond to the formula D = 3W

1/3

 with a minimum distance of 80 feet, unless the donor building is designed to contain the effects of an explosion.

(f) 

Storage tanks built on or above the surface of the ground.

 If protection of above-ground storage tanks is required, the distances in column 5, Appendix A to Subpart F of this
part shall apply.

(g) 

Recreational, training, and other such areas.

 Open areas between explosives storage and handling sites and between these sites and non-explosives buildings and
structures, should be carefully controlled, when used as employee recreation or training facilities. The severe
fragment hazard will usually extend from the explosion site to approximately the public traffic route distances.
Accordingly, exposed recreation and training facilities where employees are in the open shall be sited at not less
than public traffic route distances and as close to inhabited building distances as practicable. When structures,
including bleachers, are included as part of these facilities, they shall be sited at not less than inhabited building
distances.

(h) 

Demolition or burning areas.

 Sites for demolition and burning of explosives shall be separated from other facilities based on the hazards associated
with the quantity and type of material to be destroyed.

(i) 

Adjacent operating lines.

 These shall be separated from one another by no less than unbarricaded intraline distance (18W

1/3

) for the hazard class and explosive quantities involved, whether or not barricaded, and provided that ammunition
and explosives involved in each operating line present similar hazards. The criticality of survivability of one
or more of the operating lines may require that each line be given an inhabited building distance level of protection.

(j) 

A&E storage magazines.

 A&E storage locations that service the establishment in general shall be separated by appropriate inhabited
building distance (blast overpressure or fragmentation, whichever applies) from A&E operating lines/locations,
inert areas (warehouses, shops, administrative facilities, and so forth) and property boundaries.

(k) 

Spacing for movement of ammunition and explosives within operating lines.

 Items or groups of items of ammunition and explosives that are transported from one operating building to another,
or from bay to bay within an operating building, shall be separated to preclude the establishment of a path for the propagation
of an explosion or fire between the buildings or bays. For this purpose, the minimum spacing between items, or groups
of items, in transport shall be intraline distance unless reduced distances have been approved by the PCO.

Subpart E_Storage Compatibility System



 184.47


General.



(a) Storage of A&E is based on the capability requirements of this subpart and the hazard classification requirements
of Subpart F to this part.

(b) Storage compatibility groups (SCG) and hazard classification for DoD A&E items and materials are listed
in the Joint Hazard Classification System (JHCS) (see TB 700-2, 

Explosive Hazard Classification Procedures

). Additional information may be available from the procuring activity in the form of Hazardous Component Safety
Data Statements (HCSDS) for intermediate materials and items. When the solicitation or contract lacks such information,
it may be requested through contract channels.

(c) Compatibility and hazard classification information relating to other hazardous materials, including A&E,
not contained within the JHCS, can be derived from references such as those cited below.

(1) Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Transportation, Parts 100-199.

(2) National Fire Protection Association, Manual 491M.






(3) Data sheets developed by the National Safety Council.

(4) Data sheets developed by the Manufacturing Chemists Association.

(5) Manuals and books providing information on the properties of hazardous materials. There are a number of competent
guides to the safety precautions required when handling potentially hazardous materials. These guides typically
provide basic precautions, specific hazardous reactions, and industrial hygiene information. Additional guidance
for industrial hygiene and industrial medicine is available from the American Council of Governmental and Industrial
Hygienists and OSHA/NIOSH.

(d) The previous guidance is applicable for storage and transportation only and is not intended for in-process applications.
For in-process application, refer to Subpart F of this part.



 184.48


Storage compatibility grouping.



(a) All A&E are assigned one of thirteen compatibility groups (SCG).

(b) Storage principles. (1) The highest degree of safety in A&E storage could be assured if each item or division
were stored separately. However, such ideal storage is not generally feasible. A proper balance of safety and other
factors frequently requires mixing of several types of ammunition and explosives in storage.

(2) A&E shall not be stored with dissimilar materials or items that present hazards to the munitions. Examples
are mixed storage of A&E with flammable or combustible materials, acids, or corrosives.

(3) Different types of A&E may be mixed in storage, by item and division, provided they are compatible. A&E
are assigned to a SCG when they can be stored together without significantly increasing either the probability of
an accident or, for a given quantity, the magnitude of the effects of such an accident.

(4) A&E should be mixed in storage only when such mixing will facilitate safe operations and promote overall storage
efficiency.

(5) As used in these requirements, the term ``with its own means of initiation'' indicates that the ammunition has
its normal initiating device assembled to it and this device is considered to present a significant risk during storage.
However, the term does not apply when the initiating device is packaged in a manner that eliminates the risk of detonating
the ammunition if the initiating device should accidentally function, or when fuzed end items are configured and
packaged to prevent their inadvertent arming. The initiating device may even be assembled to the ammunition, provided
its safety features preclude initiation or detonation of the explosives filler of the end item if the initiating device
should accidentally function.

(c) Compatible ammunition and explosives. (1) Different kinds of A&E within one compatibility group are compatible
and may be stored together, except for some items in SCG K and L (see Appendix A to this subpart).

(2) Ammunition and explosives in substandard or damaged packaging, in a suspect condition, or with characteristics
that increase the risk in storage are not compatible with other A&E and shall be stored separately.

(d) Storage compatibility group. A&E are assigned to one of thirteen storage compatibility groups (A through
H, J, K, L, N, and S):

(1) 

Group A_initiating explosives.

 Bulk initiating explosives that have the sensitivity to heat, friction, or percussion necessary for use as initiating
elements in an explosive train. Examples are wet lead azide, wet lead styphnate, wet mercury fulminate, wet tetracene,
and dry PETN.

(2) 

Group B.

 Detonators and similar initiating devices not containing two or more independent safety features. Items containing
initiating explosives that are designed to initiate or continue the functioning of an explosive train. Examples
are detonators, blasting caps, small arms primers, and fuzes.

(3) 

Group C.

 Bulk propellants, propelling charges, and devices containing propellant with or without their own means of ignition.
Items that upon initiation will deflagrate, explode, or detonate. Examples are single-, double-, triple-base,
and composite propellants; rocket motors (solid propellant); and ammunition with inert projectiles. Liquid propellants
are not included.

(4) 

Group D.

 Black powder, high explosives (HE), and ammunition containing HE without its own means of initiation and without
propelling charge and fuzes with two or more safety features. A&E that can be expected to explode or detonate when
any given item/component thereof is initiated (except for fuzes with two or more safety features). Examples are bulk
TNT, composition B, wet RDX or PETN, bombs, and CBU's.

(5) 

Group E.

 A&E containing HE without its own means of initiation and with propelling charge. See paragraph (b)(5) of this
section. Examples are artillery ammunition, rockets, and guided missiles.

(6) 

Group F.

 Ammunition containing HE with its own means of initiation, not meeting requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this section,
and with or without propelling charge. HE ammunition or devices (fuzed), with or without propelling charges. Examples
are grenades, sounding devices, and similar items having an in-line explosive train in the initiator.

(7) 

Group G.

 Fireworks; illuminating, incendiary, smoke (including HC), or tear-producing munitions other than those munitions
that are water-activated or contain white phosphorus or flammable liquid or gel.

(8) 

Group H.

 Ammunition containing both explosives and white phosphorus or other pyrophoric material. Ammunition in this group
contains fillers which are spontaneously flammable when exposed to the atmosphere.

(9) 

Group J.

 Ammunition containing explosives and flammable liquids or gels, with or without explosives. Ammunition in this
group contains flammable liquids or gels other than those that are spontaneously flammable when exposed to water
or the atmosphere. Examples are liquid- or gel-filled incendiary ammunition; FAE devices; flammable, liquid-fueled
missiles; and torpedoes.

<TEXT>
 

(10) 

Group K. 

Ammunition containing both explosives and toxic chemical agents. Ammunition in this group contains chemicals specifically
designed for incapacitating effects more severe than lachrymation. Examples are artillery or mortar ammunition,
fuzed or unfuzed, grenades, and rockets or bombs filled with a lethal or incapacitating chemical agent (see note 8,
Appendix A to this subpart).

(11) 

Group L. 

Ammunition not included in other compatibility groups, having characteristics that do not permit storage with other
types of ammunition or kinds of explosives. Examples are water-activated devices; prepackaged, hypergolic liquid-fueled
rocket engines; TPA (thickened TEA); and damaged or suspect ammunition of any group. Types presenting similar hazards
(that is, oxidizers with oxidizers, fuels with fuels, etc.) may be stored together but not mixed with other groups.

(12) 

Group N. 

Ammunition containing only extremely insensitive detonating substance (EIDS); examples are bombs and warheads.

(13) 

Group S. 

Ammunition presenting no significant hazard. All hazardous explosive effects are confined and self-contained
within the item or package. An incident may destroy all items in a single pack but must not communicate to other packs.
Examples are thermal batteries, explosive switches or valves, and other ammunition items packaged to meet this criterion.

(e) Mixed storage.

(1) Mixing of SCG's is permitted as indicated in Appendix A of this subpart. For purposes of mixing, all items shall
be packaged in approved storage containers.

(2) Items from SCG's C, D, E, F, G, J, and S may be combined in storage, provided the net quantity of explosives in the items
or in bulk does not exceed 1000 pounds per storage site.

(3) In addition to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, items assigned to Hazard Division 1.4, SCG C, G, or S, may be combined
in storage without regard to explosives quantity limitations.

Subpart F_Hazard Classification and Q/D Criteria



 184.51

 General.



(a) This subpart outlines Q/D requirements applicable to storage, processing, and handling of A&E. The maximum
amount of explosives permitted at any location is determined by the distance from that location to other exposed sites
and the hazard classification assigned to the A&E involved. The applicable Q/D table in this subpart shall be
used to determine this distance. Greater distances than those shown in the tables should be used when practicable.

(b) Distances required in the standard Q/D tables may be reduced if structural data or engineering demonstrate that
explosion effects will be reduced or eliminated through containment, direction or suppression shields or building
volume. The rationale or test results justifying the proposed distance reduction shall accompany A&E site and
general construction plans when submitted through the ACO for the PCO's approval. See  184.7.



 184.52

 Hazard classes and class divisions.



(a) The United Nations Organization (UNO) classification system consists of nine hazard classes, with ammunition
and explosives included in Class 1; however, some items containing explosives components may be included in other
classes based upon the ``predominant hazard'' of that item (flammable liquids or compressed gas). Thirteen compatibility
groups are included for segregating ammunition and explosives on the basis of similar characteristics, properties,
and potential accident effects.

(b) The A&E hazard classes are further subdivided into ``divisions'' according to the associate hazards, including
the potential for causing personnel casualties or property damage as shown:








(c) DoD Explosives Hazard Classification Procedures (TB 700-2, NAVSEAINST 8020.8, TO IIA-I-47
and DLAR 8220.1) shall be used as a basis for assignment of hazard classes/divisions to all DoD ammunition and explosives.
As stated in  184.47(d), these classifications pertain to A&E packaged for transportation or storage.
Such hazard classification information may not be valid when applied to the hazards associated with manufacturing
or loading processes. For such processes, the materials and processes shall be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.
Sources of information to support this process of analysis are available from service research and development organizations
through contract channels, and other sources. The methodologies described in  184.199 for propellant is an
example of an acceptable approach. Sections 184.73 through 184.81 provide examples of processes requiring analysis
to determine the hazards.

(d) The separation of the A&E hazard classes into the several divisions does not necessarily mean that the different
items in a division may be stored together. Also, some items may appear in more than one division, depending upon factors
such as the degree of confinement or separation, type of packaging, storage configuration, or state of assembly.

(e) The maximum amount of explosives permitted in any location is limited by the Q/D criteria. Explosives limits shall
be established in amounts no greater than those consistent with safe and efficient operations.

(f) A numerical figure (in parentheses) is used to indicate the minimum separation distance (in hundreds of feet)
for protection from debris, fragments, and firebrands when distance alone is relied on for such protection. This
number shall be placed to the left of the division designators 1.1 through 1.3, such as (18)1.1, (08)1.2, and (06)1.3.
The following apply to minimum fragment distances:

(1) A hazardous fragment is one having an impact energy of at least 58 ft-lb and a hazardous fragment density is constituted
by at least one hazardous fragment impacting in an area of 600 square feet or less. Fragment distances do not indicate
the maximum range to which fragments may be projected.

(2) For divisions 1.1 and 1.3, a minimum distance number shall be used where the ranges of hazardous fragments and firebrands
EXCEED the distances specified for inhabited buildings in the applicable Q/D table.

(3) Minimum fragment distance protects personnel in the open; minimum firebrand distance primarily protects facilities.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


(4) Examples where minimum fragment and firebrand distances for division 1.1 and 1.3 need not be applied follow:


(i) Recreation or training facilities, if these facilities are for the exclusive use of personnel assigned to the
PES.


(ii) Between PES and relatively static inert storage areas.


(iii) Between facilities in an operating line, between facilities and holding sites in an operating line, between
operating lines, and between operating lines and storage locations normally separated by inhabited building distances
to protect workers and ensure against interruption of production.


(5) The minimum distance for protection from hazardous fragments shall be based on the debris producing characteristics
of the PES and the population density of the ES. For populous locations, the minimum distance shall be that distance
at which fragments, including debris from structural elements of the facility or process equipment, shall not exceed
a hazardous fragment density of one hazardous fragment per 600 square feet (56 m2). If this distance is not known, the
following shall apply:


(i) For all Hazard Division 1.1 A&E, the minimum distance to exposures shall be 670 feet for 100 pounds NEW or less.
In quantities of 101 to 30,000 pounds NEW, the minimum distance shall be 1,250 feet. These distances may be reduced
when it can be shown by test data that reductions are warranted or when other alternatives, as described in  184.52
(f)(6) through (f)(9) are used. For items that have been evaluated adequately, different minimum distances may be
used. (Facilities sited at 1,235 or 1,245 feet in accordance with past requirements shall be considered to be in compliance
with the 1,250 foot minimum requirement.)


(ii) For public traffic routes that are not probable sites for future construction, and for other exposures permitted
at public traffic route distances from PES, fragment and firebrand minimum distances for Hazard Divisions 1.1 and
1.3 may be reduced to 60 percent of these requisite distances.


(6) For sparsely populated locations on or off the establishment, the minimum fragment distance can be reduced to
900 ft. if certain specific conditions exist as follows:


(i) No more than 25 persons are located in any sector bounded by the sides of a 45 degree angle, with the vertex at the PES,
and the 900 ft. and 1,250 ft. arcs from the PES, and


(ii) The NEW of the PES does not exceed 11,400 pounds.


(7) Minimum fragment distances may extend onto uninhabited areas such as wildlife preserve, desert, prairie, swamp,
forest or agricultural land, adjacent to contractor facilities but not within control of the contractor. However,
without a restrictive easement in effect, construction of inhabited buildings or other exposures in these areas,
would reimpose minimum fragment distance.


(8) In lieu of the minimum fragment distances prescribed, other alternatives, which reduce or eliminate the fragment
hazard, may be used for requirements compliance, per  184.51(b). Examples include:


(i) Use distance demonstrated by testing, accident experience or engineering studies.


(ii) Use protective structures.


(iii) Use containment facilities or suppressive shields or other fragment control devices.


(iv) Design/locate equipment to reduce fragment generation or to control the direction of fragmentation.


(v) Use barricades or terrain where possible to stop low angle, high velocity fragments.


(9) Fragment distance need not be applied when it is demonstrated by structural analysis, shielding test or other
documentation that building construction and volume shall confine fragments and debris resulting from an explosives
accident.


(g) In the application of inhabited building and public traffic route distances, the property boundary shall be treated
as the governing target. In interpreting application to navigable waterways as public traffic routes, occasional
small fishing and pleasure boats may be ignored.

Hazard Division 1.1_mass detonating.

(a) Entire quantities of items in this division can detonate almost instantaneously. Some examples: bulk explosives,
some propellants, mines, bombs, demolition charges, torpedo and missile warheads, rockets, palletized projectiles
loaded with TNT or Composition B, 8-inch and larger high-capacity projectiles loaded with Explosive D, mass-detonating
CBU's, and mass-detonating ammunition components.

(b) Use Appendix A to this subpart to determine inhabited building and public traffic route distances, Appendices
B and C to this subpart for intraline distance, Appendix D to this subpart for intermagazine distance and Appendices
E and F to this subpart for fragment distances.



 184.54 

Application of intermagazine distances for Hazard Division 1.1 only.



(a) In applying the intermagazine distances given in Appendix D to this subpart, consideration shall be given to magazine
construction and orientation. For earth-covered magazine separation distances, the following conditions apply:

(1) When standard earth-covered magazines containing Hazard Division 1.1 ammunition are sited so that any one is
in the forward section, 60 degrees either side of the centerline of another, the two shall be separated by distances
greater than the minimum permitted for side-to-side orientations. The greater distances primarily protect door
and headwall structures against blast from a potential explosion site forward of the exposed magazine. When a blast
wave is reflect from a surface at other than grazing incidence (side-on orientation), the overpressure may be increased
substantially over the free-field value. High reflected pressure impulse can damage doors and headwalls and propel
the debris into the earth-covered magazine, communicating the explosion to the contents on impact. Some examples
of the application of these rules follow:

(i) If headwalls of both A and B are outside the 120-degree sector (60 degrees either side of the centerline), they may
be separated by the column 4 distances based on the largest quantity of Hazard Division 1.1 stored in either. This is
considered the equivalent of standard side-to-side separation with the optimum orientation_all earth-covered
magazines facing the same direction and axes parallel. See paragraphs (a) and (b), Appendix G to this subpart.

(ii) If headwall of A is outside the 120-degree sector of B, but headwall of B is inside the 120-degree sector of A, separation
distance between these two earth-covered magazines is determined by column 6, based on the largest quantity of Hazard
Division 1.1 in either earth-covered magazine. However, if the quantity in B were reduced to less than 1/10 of that
in A, or if the storage in B is not class 1, division 1, earth-covered magazine A would control as a potential explosion
site. Then, in accordance with  184.42, the distance shall be taken from column 4, based on the quantity in A;
that is, the quantity in A would not need to be reduced. See paragraph c, Appendix G to this subpart.

(iii) If headwalls of A and B are within the 120-degree sector of each other and are not provided with a separate door
barricade, Appendix D to this subpart, column 12 distances shall be used to separate them. If a door barricade is present
(meeting requirements of  184.44(a)) such as A to C, then column 10 distances may be used to determine separation
distances. See paragraph (a), Appendix G to this subpart.

(iv) Although no separate barricade is shown between A and B, more detailed analysis of a specific storage condition
of this type might show that the distribution of explosives within A and B is such that the earth fill of one or the other
or both meets the specifications of an effective barricade according to  184.44(a). In such a case, column 10
distances would apply between A and B. See paragraph (d), Appendix G to this subpart.

(v) Two additional standard earth-covered magazine orientations warrant analysis:

(A) Earth-covered magazines A and B significantly differ in length (paragraph (f), Appendix G to this subpart) or
are ``canted'' in such a manner that one of them is within the 120-degree sector off the headwall of the other, even though
a straight line between headwall A and earth-covered magazine B does pass through the earth cover of B. See Appendix
G to this subpart.

(B) If B is the potential explosion site and A is the exposed site, the limit for B would be determined by column 7. With
A as the potential explosion site, however, the limit for A would be based upon column 4.

(vi) For future construction when standard earth-covered magazines containing Hazard Division 1.1 ammunition
are sited so that any one is in the forward sector of another, the two shall be separated by distances greater than the
minimum permitted for side-to-side orientations. The forward sector, or ``front'', for earth-covered magazines
is the area 60 degrees either side of the magazine centerline with the vertex of the angle placed so that the sides of
the angle pass through the intersection of the headwall and side walls. The greater distances are required primarily
for the protection of door and headwall structures against blast from a PES forward of the exposed magazine, and to
a lesser extent due to the directionality of effects from the source. When a blast wave is reflected from a surface at
other than grazing incidence (side-on orientation), the overpressure may be increased substantially over the free-field
value. High reflected pressure and impulse can damage doors and headwalls and propel the debris into the earth-covered
magazine so that explosion is communicated by impact of such debris upon the contents.

(2) When considering relationships between standard earth-covered magazines and aboveground magazines or facilities
requiring intraline distances, each containing class 1, division 1, ammunition or explosives, the question regarding
the use of barricaded or unbarricaded distances arises. The following criteria shall apply:

(i) Aboveground magazines or facilities requiring intraline distances within the 120-degree sector in front of
a standard earth-covered magazine shall be provided unbarricaded distances, unless a separate effective intervening
barricade meeting requirements of  184.44(a)(2) is present, in which case barricaded distances may be applied.
See paragraph (g), Appendix G to this subpart.

(ii) Aboveground magazines or facilities requiring intraline distances outside of the 120-degree sector in front
of a standard earth-covered magazine shall be provided with barricaded distances whether or not a separate intervening
barricade is present. See paragraph (g), Appendix G to this subpart.

(b) Distances in column 4 apply to nonstandard, earth-covered magazines oriented so that all straight lines between
the side and rear walls of two magazines pass through an earth-covered surface of each; similarly, column 10 distances
apply to all orientations in which every straight line between two magazine passes through the earth cover of one and
only one of them. If the above conditions cannot be met, column 12 distances apply. The earth cover of nonstandard magazines
shall be equal to or greater than that required for standard earth-covered, arch-type magazines.

(c) Other factors limiting earth-covered magazine storage are as follows:

(1) Earth-covered magazines that are equivalent in strength to those specified under the definition of ``standard
magazine'' in Subpart S of this part are limited to 500,000 pounds NEW. Earth-covered magazines, not equivalent in
strength to those, are limited to 250,000 pounds NEW.

(2) Quantities above 500,000 pounds NEW in one storage location are not authorized except for liquid propellants.

(3) The distance given for 0 to 100 pounds NEW constitutes the minimum magazine spacing permitted.

(d) Examples given in   184.54 (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(v), apply only to the storage of Hazard Division
1.1, ammunition and explosives. Existing earth-covered magazines, regardless of orientation, meeting the construction
and barricading requirements of Subpart D of this part and consistent with the definition of ``magazine'' in Subpart
S of this part (and sited for any quantity of class 1, division 1), may be used to their physical capacity for the storage
of Hazard Division 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, A&E.

<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>

(a) Items in this division are those for which the principal hazards are fragment and blast, either individually or
in combination, depending on such factors as storage configuration, type of packing, and quantity. The designated
minimum distances that are specified are based on the limiting range of fragments for which protection by distance
is to be provided and shall be used for inhabited building and public traffic route distances. 

(b) The fragment hazard from items within a specified minimum distance category varies with existing conditions,
but is essentially the same for one as for many items or components. For these items, the required separation distances
are influenced heavily by packing, state of assembly, charge/weight ratio, and caliber. Items in this division usually
explode progressively when involved in a fire or otherwise initiated. Therefore, the distances prescribed shall
not be lessened if the quantity to be stored is less than the maximum quantity specified by the appropriate table. Use
Appendices H through K to this subpart for determining quantity/distance for Hazard Division 1.2.



 184.56 

Hazard Division 1.3_mass fire. 



Items in this division burn vigorously with little chance of being extinguished in storage. Explosions shall normally
be confined to pressure ruptures of containers and shall not produce propagating shock waves or damaging blast overpressure
beyond the magazine distance specified in Appendix L to this subpart. A severe hazard of the spread of fire may result
from burning container materials, propellant, or other flaming debris being tossed about by the force of pressure
ruptures. 



 184.57 

Hazard Division 1.4_moderate fire, no blast. 



Items in this division present a fire hazard with no blast hazard and virtually no fragmentation hazard beyond the
fire hazard clearance ordinarily specified for high risk materials. Separate facilities for storage and handling
of this division should not be less than 100 feet from other facilities, except those of fire-resistive construction,
which may be 50 feet from each other. The Q/D's for Hazard Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5 or 1.6 individually or in combination
are not affected by the presence of Hazard Division 1.4. Use Appendix M to this subpart for determining quantity/distance
of Hazard Division 1.4 material. 



 184.58 

Hazard Divisons 1.5 and 1.6. 



(a) This section describes Q/D standards for EIDS (substances) which are hazard classified 1.5, as well as ammunition
items loaded with EIDS which are hazard classified 1.6. Refer to Appendix N to this subpart. 

(b) Substances (1.5) and items (1.6) in these divisions are designed to have a very low probability of detonating under
normal storage and handling conditions. In order to be so classified, these A&E shall meet stringent tests prescribed
in TB 700-2. 

(c) Quantity/distance separations for Hazard Division 1.6 ammunition shall be based on the storage location and
configuration. This information is detailed in Appendix O to this subpart and footnotes thereto. A maximum of 500,000
NEW shall be permitted at any one location. Any special storage configuration and siting approved for Hazard Division
1.1 ammunition or explosives may be used for storage of like explosive weights of Hazard Division 1.6 ammunition.


(d) Blasting agents designated as Hazard Division 1.5 for transportation are considered to be Hazard Division 1.1
for Q/D purposes (storage). 

(e) When Hazard Division 1.6 is located with Hazard Division 1.1 or 1.5, Hazard Division 1.6 is considered Hazard Division
1.1 for Q/D purposes. When Hazard Division 1.6 is located with Hazard Division 1.2, Hazard Division 1.6 is considered
Hazard Division 1.2 for Q/D purposes. 

(f) When Hazard Division 1.6 is located with Hazard Division 1.3, add the explosives weight of the Hazard Division
1.6 to the weight of Hazard Division 1.3 and consider as Hazard Division 1.3 for Q/D purposes. 



 184.59 

Airfields. 



(a) These provisions do not apply to explosives items installed on aircraft or contained in survival and rescue kits
such as signals, flares, egress systems components, squibs and detonators for jettisoning external stores, engine
starter cartridges, fire extinguisher cartridges, destructors in electronic equipment, explosives components
of emergency kits and equipment, and other such items or materials necessary for safe flight operations. 

(b) These Q/D requirements shall be applied: 

(1) To any airfield at which A&E are handled or stored. 

(2) In conjunction with airfield clearance criteria as prescribed by DoD Components and 14 CFR part 77. Airfields,
heliports, and seadromes not used exclusively by DoD Components, combat aircraft parking areas, ammunition and
explosives cargo areas, alert hangars, and shelters shall be located as prescribed in Appendix P to this subpart.


(3) In separating ammunition and explosives facilities from inhabited buildings, public traffic routes, and other
ammunition and explosives facilities, in accordance with Subparts D and F of this part. 

(c) In applying the requirements prescribed in Appendix P to this subpart, distances shall be measured as follows:


(1) Loaded aircraft to loaded aircraft. Measure the distance from explosives on one aircraft to explosives on adjacent
aircraft. 

(2) Ammunition and explosives location to taxiways and runways. Measure from the nearest point of the A&E location
to the nearest point of the taxiway and to the centerline of the runway. 

(d) Separation distances between the following areas and from these areas to other targets shall be determined by
applying Appendix Q to this subpart:

(1) A&E cargo areas. 

(2) A&E storage facilities.

(3) A&E operating facilities.
(e) A&E shall be prohibited under approach/departure zones of fixed and rotary wing aircraft landing facilities.
The approach/departure zones for aircraft (surfaces or areas) are described in detail in airfield and airspace criteria
directives of the DoD Components. In general, approach/departure zones begin near the end of a runway or landing area
and extend outward to a given distance along, and symmetrically on each side of, the extended runway centerline or
the aircraft approach axis of a heliport. Such zones flare uniformly from the landing area outward to a prescribed
limit.


 184.60 

Pier and wharf facilities.


(a) 

Applicability and scope.

 This section applies to piers and wharfs and associated facilities at which ammunition and explosives may be handled,
or be present in ships' holds or service conveyances. Its provisions do not apply to ammunition or explosives stored
in ships' magazines and intended for the service of shipboard armament or aircraft. However, they do apply to loading,
off-loading, stowing, and shifting of such ammunition and explosives. Q/D's herein are for Hazard Division 1.1.
Effects of an explosion to be expected when these Q/D's are applied are described in Subpart D of this part. If only ammunition
and explosives of other class/division are involved the Q/D's for such hazards shall be applied as appropriate.
(b) 

Determination of quantity of explosives in a ship.

 (1) On board ship, the various types of ammunition and explosives are stored relatively close to each other, and a detonation
in the HE part of the cargo may receive considerable support from items that are considered normally to be only fragment
or fire hazards; therefore, the total quantity of explosives on board a ship shall be determined in accordance with
Subpart D of this part.
(2) When ship units are separated by 11W

1/3

 distances or greater, Q/D shall be based individually on the quantity of each ship unit. Lesser separation distances
require that the explosives in both ship units be totalled for Q/D purposes.
(c) 

Measurement of separation distance

_(1) 

Ships at a pier.

 Measurement of separation distances between ships shall be from the nearest point of one unit to the nearest point
of the other. Movement of cars passing through the clear space is considered as an operations risk. It will generally
be impracticable to separate berths at a single pier by enough distance to prevent mass detonation of ships containing
complete cargoes of Hazard Division 1.1 ammunition. To the extent operationally feasible, therefore, scheduling
shall be such as to reduce the number of such exposures and total time that they are required.
(2) 

Piers.

 The separation distances between piers shall be measured from the nearest point of the ship unit at one pier to the nearest
point of the ship unit under consideration at the other pier.
(3) 

Anchorages.

 Measurements from anchorages generally shall be from the boundary of the area designated for the scuttling site or
the explosives anchorage. In the case of the explosives anchorage, the separation distance to outside targets shall
depend upon whether:

<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The ship units that are loading or unloading within the explosives anchorage are separated properly, taking into
consideration location and the amount of explosives in each ship unit. The ship unit equivalent for an explosives
anchorage is a circle, the radius of which is the distance from the mooring buoy or the ship's anchor to the stern of the
ship or of the ammunition lighters alongside when riding to the full scope of the chain. To maintain proper separation
distance between loading or unloading ship units in the explosives anchorage, the ships shall moor or anchor so that
at no time will they have a separation distance less than 11W

1/3

 if quanities are not to be totalled.

(ii) The ships being loaded or unloaded at one area are separated properly from the loaded ships in another area and
whether the loaded ships within the loaded ship area are separated properly from each other. If the latter conditions
do not apply, the quantity for entering the table shall be the total quantity rather than the unit quantity.

(4) 

Dolphins or interrupted quays.

 Measurement of separation distance between ships moored to dolphins or interrupted quays shall be from the nearest
point of one unit to the nearest point of the other.

(5) 

Fixed targets.

 The measurement of separation distance from moored ships to fixed targets on land shall be from the nearest boundary
of the ship or barge unit to the nearest fixed target.

(d) 

Siting criteria and application of Q/D separation requirements_(1) Scuttling site.

 (i) A properly located scuttling site shall be provided, if practicable, for positioning a ship for its flooding or
sinking in the event a vessel catches fire and shall be moved to avert damage to other ships or piers. It shall have sufficient
sea room and depth of water to permit the sinking of the largest vessel that may be handled at the installation so that
the holds will be flooded completely at low water.

(ii) Since an explosion may occur while the vessel is being moved, the location of the scuttling site shall provide
the best available protection to other ships, piers, and shore installations.

(iii) The location of the scuttling site will depend on the greatest net quantity of mass-detonating explosives that
may be in a single ship at any one time. The Q/D tables to be used will depend on the particular types of targets.

(2) Explosives anchorage. The location of an explosives anchorage shall be separated not only from the main ship channel
or from normally traversed routes of ships entering or leaving the harbor by column 8, Appendix A to this subpart distances
but also by turning circles and stopping distances of the ships. Assuming that the diameter of the turning circle of
a ship is 1,000 yards, an explosives anchorage shall be located so that a ship in the channel with a jammed rudder will
clear an anchored explosives-laden ship. From the turning circle standpoint, the separation distances shall be
not less than 3,000 feet.

(i) 

Separation of ships at explosives anchorages.

 (A) When explosives anchorages are used for loading and unloading ships, as well as for fully loaded vessels anchored
at their berths, ships that are being loaded or unloaded shall be separated from fully loaded ships.

(B) When the explosives anchorage is used only for loading and unloading ships, to prevent mass detonation, ships
in the explosives anchorage shall be separated by at least 11W

1/3

 distances. Whenever posssible, these distances shall be increased to 18W

1/3

 to reduce the loss potential of any incident.

(C) Loaded ships shall be separated one from another by at least 18W

1/3

 distances.

(ii) 

Separation of explosives anchorages from other targets.

 Explosives shall be from anchorages separated explosives piers by 40 W

1/3

 distances except when the anchorage is used only for the loading or unloading of vessels. In such cases, 18W

1/3

 may be used.

(3) Separation distances of ship units in tandem at the sam pier. (i) Since the second ship would be in an area of heavy
fragment density from the exploding ship, it could be set afire and later caused to mass-detonate. A direct hit by a
steel fragment on ammunition alongside the ship or in an open hold could also cause a mass detonation. The separation
distances based on blast damage alone accordingly are not enough to take care of such fragment hazards. Berthing of
the two ships in tandem will help to decrease the fragment hazard to the explosives cargo of the second ship because
of the additional protection afforded by the bow or stern.

(ii) When two ships cannot be separated by 11W

1/3

 distances and are being loaded through all hatches, the spotting of cars and the loading of hatches in both ships should
be planned so as to put the greatest possible distance between open hatches of both ships, and between the trucks and
freight cars serving the two ships. When possible, the loading of the ships should be staggered.

(4) Separation of explosives ships from other ships. Explosives ships being loaded or unloaded shall be separated
from nonexplosives-carrying ships and from loaded explosives ships that are not underway by 40W

1/3

 distances. Column 8, Appendix A to this subpart distances shall be used for protection of ships that are underway.

(5) Occasional watercraft passing through Q/D arcs are not subject to Q/D requirements.

(e) 

Quantity/distance tables.

 Appendix R to this subpart shall be used in applying Appendix S to this subpart, Q/D. Appendix A to this subpart, Q/D
shall be maintained between explosives pier and wharf facilities and such ES's as administration and industrial
areas, terminal boundary, main ship channel, and public traffic routes. As ES, ship or barge units shall be separated
from explosives operating and storage facilities (including holding yards) by Column 5, Appendix A to this subpart,
distances. As PES, ship or barge units shall be separated from explosives operating facilities by Column 5, Appendix
A to this subpart, distances, and from explosives storage facilities by Column 2, Appendix S to this subpart (barricaded)
and Column 3 (unbarricaded), distances, as appropriate.

Notes:



1. The same distances are used for aboveground intermagazine distances (IMD) and intraline distances (ILD). Earth-covered
magazines, both standard and non-standard, may be used to their physical capacity for this hazard division, provided
they comply with the construction and siting requirements of subparts D and F of this part for Hazard Division 1.1.




2. For quantities less than 100 lbs, the required distances are those specified for 100 lbs. The use of lesser distances
may be approved when supported by test data and/or analysis.


3. Interpolation is permitted. For inhabited building distance (IBD) and public traffic route (PTR) use D=8W

1/3

. For aboveground IMD and intraline distance (ILD) use 5W

1/3

.



4. Unit risk distance applies as a minimum; that is, for IBD or PTR, D=40W

1/3

 or minimum fragment distance, whichever is greater; and for aboveground IMD or ILD, D=18W

1/3

, based on a single round of ammunition. Minimum fragment distance is based on hazardous fragment areal density requirements
as determined for Hazard Division 1.1 munitions.




5. For Hazard Division 1.6 items packed in non-flammable pallets or packing, stored in earth-covered steel or concrete
arch magazines when acceptable to the cognizant safety office of the PCO on a site-specific basic, the following quantity-distance
criteria apply, unless Appendix O to supart F of this part permits a lesser distance requirement; IBD and PTR_100 ft;
aboveground IMD and ILD_50 ft; earth-covered IMD_No specified requirement.

Subpart G_Liquid Propellant Requirements 



 184.62 


Application. 



(a) These criteria establish Q/D, storage compatibility groupings, and high explosives equivalencies for liquid
propellants. They apply to liquid propellant storage facilities (including missiles, rockets, and multi-compartment
tanks in which both liquid fuels and liquid oxidizers are stored). 

(b) If hazard classifications and storage compatibility groups for liquid propellants are not listed in Appendix
A to Subpart G of this part, they may be obtained from the PCO. 



 184.63 


Determination of propellant quantity. 



(a) For Q/D purposes, the net weight of propellant in a tank, drum, cylinder, or other container shall be used. The quantity
of propellant in associated piping (to the point(s) providing means for interrupting the flow in an incident) shall
be included in the net weight of propellant in a storage container. 

(b) When incompatible propellants are not separated by distances prescribed in Appendix B to Subpart G of this part
or provisions for preventing their mixing are not available, the combined quantity of the two shall be used with appropriate
HE equivalency (Appendix C to Subpart G of this part) to determine the Q/D (Appendix D to Subpart G of this part). 

(c) Appendix E to Subpart G of this part lists conversion factors (gallons to pounds) for the various liquid propellants.




 184.64 


Measurement of separation distances. 



(a) Separation distances shall be measured from the nearest hazard source (containers, buildings, or positive cutoff
point in piping, whichever is controlling). 

(b) If a building contains a small number of drums or cylinders, or if quantities of propellant in the building are subdivided
effectively, distances may be measured from the nearest container or controlling subdivision. 



 184.65 


Q/D considerations. 



(a) Q/D criteria in this section are based on these premises: construction materials shall be compatible with propellants
to which they may be exposed; design shall take into account the properties of the propellant; required fire protection
and drainage controls shall be provided; and other special controls (such as nitrogen padding, tank cooling, etc.)
shall be provided when required. 

(b) If group I, II, and III propellants are contaminated, Appendix B to Subpart G of this part is not applicable. In such
cases, group IV Q/D requirements shall apply except when the PCO specifically approves other criteria. 



 184.66 


Hazard grouping. 



Liquid propellants present various types and degrees of hazards. The following propellant groupings are based on
these hazards. 

(a) 

Group I

. Considered the least hazardous, these materials have a fire hazard potential and require separation distance as
specified in Appendix B to Subpart G of this part. When group I materials are stored with more hazardous materials under
conditions described in  184.67, Appendices C and D to Subpart G of this part, shall determine Q/D requirements.


(b) 

Group II

. Strong oxidizers, these materials may cause serious fires when they come into contact with material such as organic
matter. Appendix B to Subpart G of this part specifies quantity limitations and minimum distance requirements. When
group II materials are stored with more hazardous materials under conditions described in  184.67, Appendices
C and D to Subpart G of this part shall determine Q/D requirements. 

(c) 

Group III

. Hazardous fragmentation of the container, its protective structure, or other nearby material may be produced by
pressure rupture of the storage container or a vapor-phase explosion. Appendix B to Subpart G of this part specifies
quantity limitations and minimum distance requirements for this group. When group III materials are stored with
more hazardous materials, under conditions described in  184.67, Appendices C and D to Subpart G of this part
shall determine Q/D requirements. 

(d) 

Group IV

. These hazards are the same as for mass-detonating explosives (such as air blast overpressure and fragments from
the containers and surrounding equipment and material). Appendix D to Subpart G of this part shall determine Q/D requirements.

 184.67 

Hazards.



Aside from the fact that the propellants differ from each other, as explained for the above groups, the predominant
hazard of the individual propellant varies according to the location of the propellant storage and the operation(s)
involved. These conditions follow, in order of decreasing hazard:

(a) 

Range launch pads. 

Activities at range launch pads include research, development, and testing. The proximity of fuel to oxidizer, the
frequency of launchings and the possibility of fall-back (with resultant dynamic mixing on impact) make operations
at these facilities very hazardous. Explosives equivalents (Appendix C to Subpart G of this part) shall be used to
determine Q/D (Appendix D to Subpart G of this part). 

(b) 

Static test stands. 

Although these can involve experimental operations, the units remain static and are subject to better control than
dynamic ones. Except when run tankages for fuel and oxidizer are mounted one above the other, it is possible to separate
the tankages to reduce the hazard. Except as provided in  184.68, explosives equivalents (Appendix C to Subpart
G of this part) shall be used to determine Q/D (Appendix D to Subpart G of this part). 

(c) 

Ready storage. 

Ready storage may be located at a minimum of intraline distance from launch and static test stands, based on the propellant
requiring the greater distance. Normally, propellant from ready storage is not fed directly into an engine, as is
the case with run tankage (see  184.67 (g)). HE equivalents (Appendix C to Subpart G of this part) shall be used
for propellants in ready storage if the facility design does not guarantee against fuel and oxidizer mixing and against
propagation to, or initiation at, the ready storage facility when a mishap occurs at the test stand or launch pad. If
prevention of detonation of ready storage is assured, Q/D's shall be based on the prevailing fire or fragment hazards
(Appendix B to Subpart G of this part).

(d) 

Cold-flow test operations. 

Fire and fragment hazards (Appendix B to Subpart G of this part) govern if the system is closed (except for approved
venting) and completely airtight; if fuel and oxidizer are never employed concurrently, each has an isolated system,
and fittings are such that intermixing is impossible; and if the propellants are of required purity. Otherwise, HE
equivalents (Appendix C to Subpart G of this part) shall be used to determine Q/D's (Appendix D to Subpart G of this part).


(e) 

Bulk storage. 

This is the most remote storage with respect to launch and test operations, never being directly connected to any of
them. It consists of the area, tanks, and other containers therein, used to hold propellant for supplying ready storage
and, indirectly, run tankage where no ready storage is available. Individual bulk storage facilities shall be separated
from each other and from unrelated exposures in accordance with Appendices B and D to Subpart G of this part. If positive
measures are not taken to prevent mixing of group I, II and III fuels and oxidizers, TNT equivalents (Appendix C to Subpart
G of this part) shall be used to determine Q/D's (Appendix D to Subpart G of this part). 

(f) 

Rest storage. 

This temporary storage resembles bulk storage. Barges, trailers, tank cars, and portable hold-tanks (used for topping
operations) may be used as rest storage facilities. Fire and fragment hazards (Appendix B to Subpart G of this part)
govern. The transporter becomes a part of that storage to which it is connected during propellant transfer. 

(g) 

Run tankage (operating tankage). 

Run tankage (operating tankage) consists of the tank and/or other containers and associated piping used to hold the
propellants for direct feeding into the engine or device during operations ( 184.67 (c)). 

(h) 

Pipelines. 

A distance of 25 feet free of inhabited buildings shall be maintained on either side of the pipelines used for the transfer
of group II and III propellants between unloading points and storage areas or between storage areas and points of use.




 184.68 

Incompatible storage.



Except where effectively subdivided by intervening barriers or other positive means for preventing mixing, separation
distance between propellants of different compatibility groups shall be the inhabited building distance for the
propellant quantity and group that requires the greater distance. Where prevention of mixing is assured, incompatible
storage shall be separated from each other by intragroup distance. If different hazard groups are involved, the group
requiring the greater distance shall be controlling. 



 184.69 

Compatible storage.



Compatible storage of propellants of different hazard groups, shall be separated from other exposures by the greater
intragroup storage distance (see Appendix A to Subpart G of this part).

Subpart H_Manufacturing and Processing Pyrotechnics



 184.71

 General.



The safety precautions for manufacturing and processing pyrotechnics parallel those of many types of explosives
and other energetic materials. Pyrotechnics, as a group, display many different characteristics because they are
formulated for different purposes. Pyrotechnics can be divided into general categories, such as: Initiators (igniters);
illuminants; smokes; gas generators; sound generators; heat producers; and timing compositions. Each has its own
characteristics and attendant processing requirements. Knowledge of these characteristics is necessary to ensure
safety in processing. The range of characteristics associated with pyrotechnics includes easily initiated compositions
from those that burn in seconds at temperatures exceeding 2763 
 C (5000 
 F) through those that require substantial energy for initiation and have relatively low output temperatures.
As examples, the auto-ignition temperature for smoke Compositions is typically about 180 
 C while for illuminants it is about 500 
 C; illuminants burn approximately 2.7 times faster than smokes and the heat of reaction is 1.5 times as great;
infrared (IR) flare compositions are both hotter and faster-burning than illuminants. Many of the compositions
in the ignitor or initiator class are as sensitive to static electricity, friction, or impact as are initiating explosives
such as lead azide and lead styphnate. Initiation thresholds to such stimuli as impact, friction, and electrostatic
discharge must be known for safety in specific processes. The response of the material in terms of energy release shall
be considered in ensuring personnel safety. In addition to the safety precautions generally required for the handling
of explosives and other energetic materials, the following paragraphs provide specific guidance pertinent to pyrotechnic
operations.



 184.72

 Machinery, equipment, and facilities.



Except as provided for in this subpart, the design, layout, and operation of facilities and equipment shall follow
the mandatory provisions for the processing of explosives and other energetic materials contained elsewhere in
this part. Where guidance is not provided, operations should be governed by the results of hazard analyses performed
and documented to address specific operations. Since most pyrotechnic compositions are sensitive to initiation
by static electricity, bonding and grounding, along with other means of static elimination and control, have paramount
importance.



 184.73

 Weighing of raw materials.



Separate weight or measurement rooms, cubicles, or areas (dependent upon the quantity and sensitivity of the materials
handled) shall be provided_one for oxidizers and one for combustible materials and metallic powders. It is important
that containers, equipment, hand tools, scale pans, etc., used for weighing processes are not mixed with those weighing
or measuring oxidizers and fuels, particularly where distance rather than physical barriers separates these areas.
Positive measures shall be adopted to ensure the complete separation of such equipment and tools. Personnel weighing
or handling exposed oxidizers or fuels shall, at a minimum, wear flame retardant uniforms, cotton undergarments,
cotton socks, and conductive shoes.



 184.74

 Drying of materials.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The minimum temperature necessary to meet processing requirements shall be used to dry components and pyrotechnic
materials. Drying rooms or ovens shall meet the requirements of  184.169.



 184.75


Mixing and blending.



Mixing and blending of pyrotechnic compositions commands attention because most injury-producing accidents have
occurred during the mixing, blending, or subsequent cleanup operations. Because of the variety within and among
these compositions, no single type of mixer or blender can be the exclusively approved equipment for pyrotechnic
mixing and blending operations.

(a) Each mixing device shall be considered separately with respect to the composition to be processed. When a history
of safe operation has not been established, the type of mixer or blender and batch size should be evaluated by appropriate
hazard analysis or tests. Generally, devices that use a tumbling action shall be preferred to those using rotating
blades, to minimize points where frictional heat may develop or where accidentally introduced foreign material
can create hot spots through friction or crushing of composition. Mixers and blenders shall be equipped for pressure
relief, to preclude a transition from burning to detonation. Personnel exposures during charging and emptying of
mixers shall be minimal. When the energetic characteristics and quantities of composition involved so dictate,
mixers and blenders shall be charged, operated, and emptied remotely. When hazard analysis or testing has shown this
to be safe, mixers or blenders may be charged or emptied manually. Appropriate interlocks, clutch brakes, and similar
devices shall be used to preclude personnel exposure during mixer or blender operation, and to preclude the movement
of mixer or blender parts during periods when operators are present.

(b) Mixing and blending operations shall be conducted in buildings or cubicles designed for such purposes. Multiple
mixing or blending operations may be conducted in the same building, provided that each blender or mixer is located
in a separate room, bay, or cell, and separated from other operations by substantial dividing walls. Two or more mixers
or blenders may be located in the same cubicle, provided that the hazards are not increased by such installation. Normally,
this would require that the materials in process be of significantly low energy content or slow energy release and
the mixers be charged and emptied simultaneously. At least one wall or equivalent panel area in each bay shall be frangible
so as to provide pressure relief in the event of an incident. Cell arrangement and pressure relief areas shall be located
so that personnel cannot pass in front of these areas while mixers or blenders are operating.

(c) Exhaust ventilation equipment shall be installed on mixers or in bays where flammable solvents are used and interlocked
with the mixers. The interlock shall be designed to preclude mixer operation without ventilation although operation
of the ventilation system without the mixer is permitted. Vapor sensors should be used to give automatic warning of
a build-up of flammable vapors to a level approaching that of the lower explosive limit. Such sensors should be interlocked
to personnel access control devices. Ventilation system designs shall not permit propagation of an incident in one
bay to others served by the same system.

(d) The operation of mixers or blenders may be observed by remote means such as closed-circuit television, mirrors,
or transparent shield providing operator protection. Direct viewing of blender or mixer operation without intervening
barriers is prohibited.

(e) Manual scraping during the mixing or blending process is prohibited. Manual mixing or blending of fuels and oxidizers
is prohibited.

(f) The following are the minimum criteria for rotating blade mixing operations:

(1) The mix equipment shall be rigidly fixed and stable during mixing to preclude contact between the bowl and the mix
blades.

(2) Positive controls are provided to physically block or stop bowl or blender head movement in case of hydraulic malfunction
to assure clearance at all times between mix bowl and blades.

(3) Mix blades and shaft shall be rigid and structurally strong to ensure minimum flex from weight of the mix and speed
of the shaft.

(4) Any mixer electrical fixtures shall be explosion-proof rated, remotely located, or shrouded and pressurized
with inert gas. Purged systems automatically cut off if pressure is lost.

(5) Mix blade shaft should include adequate and compatible seals or packing glands to prevent migration of mix or solvent
vapor into bearings. Submerged bearings and packing glands should be avoided. If used, they shall be periodically
tested for contamination and cleaned.

<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00118 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(6) A program shall be established whereby mix blade shaft and bearings are monitored and changed before becoming
worn and allowing loose play in the blade shaft. Maintain a record of such checks, mixer blade adjustments, and any
damage to the mixer blades and bowls.
(7) Wet mixing shall not be started until adequate solvent is added to preclude dry mixing.
(8) The operating procedures shall contain provisions to verify acceptable blade/bowl clearance, bowl and shaft
rigidity, and bearing wear prior to introduction of materials.
(9) Electrical service to propellant mixers shall be interlocked with fire protection system controls so that the
mixer cannot start when the fire protection system is inoperative.


 184.76 

Pressing, extruding, and pelleting.


(a) Pressing operations shall be conducted with personnel protected by substantial dividing walls, barricades,
or operational shields; or shall take place at intraline distance from the operator and other operations. When it
is necessary to repair, adjust, or otherwise clear a jam on a press or extruder, the pyrotechnic material shall be removed
from the hopper and the bay or press room before such repairs or adjustments are made. Only those adjustments of ram
speed or conveyor speed routinely controlled by the operator may proceed with material in the bay. Under no circumstances
shall repair or adjustment requiring the use of tools be permitted with pyrotechnic material in the bay.
(b) The quantity of composition at the pressing location (behind the barricade) shall not exceed that required for
the components undergoing the pressing operation. The quantity of composition in the remainder of the building at
any one time shall not exceed the minimum required for a safe, efficient operation.
(c) Each individual press, extruder, or loading device shall be located in a separate building, room, or cubicle,
and be designed to limit an incident to that area and protect operators. Multiple installations may be permitted within
a bay or cubicle, provided that tests or hazard analysis demonstrate that facility and personnel hazards are not increased.
Adequate means of pressure relief shall be built into each bay or cubicle.


 184.77 

Assembly operations.


Individual assembly operations shall be adequately separated from each other, and shall be located in a separate
cubicle or building from mixing, blending, and consolidation operations. Pyrotechnic composition shall be kept
in closed or covered containers at all times except during processing. Surge, storage, and in-process transit between
operations shall also be accomplished with closed containers whenever not absolutely prohibited by the operational
configuration. Components in any assembly room, bay, or building, shall be limited to the smallest quantity necessary
for safe and efficient operations.


 184.78 

Granulation, grinding, and screening.


(a) Material to be reduced in particle size shall be processed over a mechanical or magnetic separator to remove foreign
materials before grinding. Following grinding, the material should be re-screened or passed over a magnetic separator.
(b) In the operation of ball mills, hammer mills, granulators, or screeners, the operator shall be protected from
the effects of a potential incident by substantial dividing walls or operational shields. Every effort shall be made
to fill and discharge grinding, granulating, and screening equipment remotely. Cleaning of such devices shall also
afford maximal operator protection.
(c) Working surfaces, containers, and hand tools shall be appropriately bonded and grounded.


 184.79 

Transportation.


Pyrotechnic compositions shall be moved in closed containers only. Individual containers and the transport vehicle
(hand cart, hand truck, etc.) should be fabricated of the lightest materials compatible with the composition and
having the requisite strength. This shall minimize fragment generation if an incident should occur. Transport vehicles
should be equipped with ``dead man'' brakes. On- and off-loading of transport vehicles should be conducted only in
weather-protected areas designated for this purpose. Racks or other support, suited to the size and shape of composition
containers, should be provided to prevent them from falling.


 184.80 

Rebowling.


Rebowling operations transfer materials, typically sensitive and in small quantities, from one container to another.
They may be done to recover remains of small quantities of materials, or to subdivide large masses for processing.
Operational shields shall be provided to protect operators.


 184.81 

Machining of pyrotechnic material.


(a) Machining of pyrotechnic materials shall be accomplished remotely.
(b) 

General requirements. 

(1) When required, coolant shall be compatible with the pyrotechnic composition. Positive automatic interlocking
devices shall ensure that the machine cannot be started until the coolant is flowing. These controls shall also be
capable of stopping the machine should the flow of coolant be interrupted. When it is essential to cut off the coolant
to adjust machine tools, it shall be restored, and all automatic controls operating, before machining resumes. If
a cutting edge overheats during machining, it is most dangerous when continuous contact with the pyrotechnic material
is maintained after the machine has stopped. It is, therefore, essential that coolant continue flowing until the
cutter is removed from contact with the pyrotechnic material.
(2) Sensors are recommended to detect tooling malfunctions or other potentially hazardous conditions. Machine
tool power-consumption monitors, tool force gages, sound or noise detectors, temperature-indicating devices,
or IR detectors can be used in this regard.

(3) Cutting tools shall be chemically compatible with the pyrotechnic material to be machined, capable of maintaining
a sharp cutting edge throughout the machine cycle.

(4) Control measures such as guides, bushings, and stops shall limit depth, diameter, and contour of the cut. The lineal
and rotational speed of tools for the machining of pyrotechnic material shall be the minimum necessary for safe and
efficient operation. Controls should be designed to prevent unintended operator adjustment.

(5) Drilling operations shall not impede the flow of chips and coolant in the bore. The drilling of small holes (one-quarter
inch or less) and any size of multiple drilling operation shall be performed by remote control, with operator protection,
unless documented hazard analysis or tests prove this unnecessary.

(6) Contoured cutting tools shall be removed from contact with the pyrotechnic material being machined before personnel
are permitted to enter the machining area. Frequently cleaning machine tools during operating hours shall prevent
residues from accumulating; a thorough cleaning shall conclude each work shift. Vacuum accumulator systems, immersion
in liquid coolant streams, or similar automatic means shall remove the pyrotechnic waste products. Only low pressure
(10 PSIG) compressed air may be used as a coolant and only when the scattering of pyrotechnic particles is contained
by a vacuum collection system. The coolant delivery tube shall have a metallic tip or nozzle grounded to the machine
to reduce static charges.

(c) 

Specific guidance for machining. 

(1) Drilling and facing operations for colored smoke compositions containing organic dyes, potassium chlorates,
and sugars should be conducted at not more than 2475 lineal inches per minute, with the feed rate adjusted to enhance
the machinability of the composition. For red phosphorous compositions, drilling and facing operations should
be conducted at not more than 1100 lineal inches per minute with the feed adjusted to minimize friction and heat buildup.
For extruded candles composed of magnesium, tetrafluoroethylene polymers, and fluoroelastomer binders, drilling
and machining operations shall be conducted at not more than 530 lineal inches per minute.

(2) Hand trimming and cutting of pyrotechnic candles may be permitted when supported by results of a hazard analysis
specific to that composition and candle configuration.

(3) Sawing operations require particular care, to prevent work from plunging into the saw blade and to ensure that
chips are removed from sawteeth before their next cutting pass. Plunging can occur when thin sections are force-fed
into coarse-pitch saw blades. To prevent this, a minimum of two saw teeth shall remain in contact with the work during
sawing, or the work feed shall be controlled. Chip accumulation in the saw teeth is a function of the material being
sawed, rate of feed, blade speed, tooth design, and flushing arrangement. Additional chip removal equipment such
as blade-wiping brushes may be required.



 184.82 

Spill control.



Spills of pyrotechnic composition and energetic ingredients pose potential hazards. In case of accident, the responsible
supervisor should be notified before any action to clean or contain the spill. Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
for pyrotechnic operations shall cover spill cleanup, either as part of the various operations detailed or as a separate
procedure. The procedures shall specify which actions are to be taken by whom and in what order. The recovery of the
spilled material and decontamination of the area shall also be addressed.



 184.83 

Collection of pyrotechnic wastes.



(a) Waste material and scraps shall be removed at regular intervals from all operating areas. All waste material shall
be segregated by type and compatibility, and kept separate from common wastes. Containers for these materials shall
be distinguished by color and labeled. Filled containers shall be placed at designated collection points.

(b) Special care shall preclude the mixing of small quantities of water with powdered or finely granulated metals.
Pyrotechnic waste may be maintained dry or submerged in water or oil, whichever is appropriate for disposal. Plastic
liners for waste containers facilitate cleaning. Liners should be conductive when contents are subject to initiation
by static electrical discharge.



 184.84 

Cleaning of pyrotechnic processing equipment.



(a) As pyrotechnic materials are sensitive to friction, impact, or static discharge, cleaning this equipment poses
hazards. Because personnel shall be near the equipment being cleaned, risks may exceed those of processing. Therefore,
cleaning shall receive the same planning and SOP coverage as production.

(b) Solvent solution flushing and cleaning by remote control is required for slurry-type mixing operations. For
other applications, the process equipment shall be flushed with a compatible solvent and drained, with the process
repeated as often as necessary to remove the pyrotechnic composition. High-pressure water wash may be used when compatible
with the pyrotechnic composition. Precautionary measures shall be taken when a solvent represents a fire or toxicological
threat. Runoff from cleaning operations shall be controlled to preclude the creation of a secondary hazard from the
spread of contamination.

(c) When remote cleaning cannot be used, personal protective equipment shall be designed and proven by test to afford
operator protection from the maximum quantity of material that could be present, and its use shall be required.



 184.85 

Personal protective equipment.



(a) Personal protective equipment shall not be relied upon as the primary means of operator protection. The primary
means should be by reducing the quantities being handled to the minimum necessary or by using operational shields.
Supplemental operator protection should be afforded by high-speed deluge systems designed and installed for such
purposes. The personal protective apparel prescribed in an SOP shall be based upon the hazards associated with the
operation.

(b) The minimum protective apparel for personnel exposed to open containers of pyrotechnic or energetic raw materials
shall consist of the following:

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Cotton undergarments and socks.
(2) Conductive-soled safety shoes.
(3) Flame retardant coveralls.
(4) Hair coverings.
(c) All employees exposed to hazardous quantities of pyrotechnic compositions shall wear the additional items described
in  184.85 (c)(1) through (c)(3), or their equivalent. The definition of hazardous quantities will depend
on the composition's energy output and sensitivity (as determined by hazard analysis or tests) and the nature of the
operation. Required levels of protective apparel shall be specified in appropriate SOP steps.
(1) Aluminized, thermally protective suit with hood and face plate.
(2) Aluminized, thermally protective trousers.
(3) Aluminized, thermally protective gloves or equivalent.
(d) When the items described above are required, the design and wearing shall ensure that no areas of the body are exposed.
Appropriate seals or joints shall be used to preclude flame intrusion where apparel items overlap or are joined. Particular
attention shall be given to possible gaps in coverage provided by the hood in order to prevent flame or hot gas impingement
on the face, head, or neck.


 184.86 

Additional controls.


(a) Many materials used to produce pyrotechnics are toxic, represent fire hazards, or both. Operations shall provide
protection from these threats. Vapor-and dust-removal and collection systems shall be provided where toxic or flammable
dusts or gases are generated. Design and installation of such equipment shall meet safety requirements.
(b) Blankets should be provided in easily opened containers within 25 feet of operations where they could be required
for wrapping burned employees. Alternate means of achieving the same effect should be provided when blankets are
not.
(c) When required, conductive shoes shall be checked for conductivity daily before the beginning of work, and retested
upon reentry into the building if the employee has walked over surfaces (grass, mud, oil, paint, etc.) which could
render the shoes ineffective. A log of the testing shall be maintained.


 184.87 

Reworking pyrotechnic components.


(a) All repair, reassembly, or similar operations on loaded pyrotechnic compositions shall take place in a separate
bay used only for that purpose.
(b) Consolidated or extruded pyrotechnic compositions shall normally be destroyed, not pulverized for reblending.
While HC smoke and such compositions are reusable, more sensitive materials, such as IR flare compositions, are not.


 184.88 

Fire protection.


When compatible with process materials, deluge systems may be used for the protection of mixing and blending operations,
screening, granulation, drying, and pressing or extrusion operations. The response time of the deluge system should
be selected to minimize the damage to process equipment and facilities. Hazard analysis of the operation may dictate
other applications.

Subpart I_Storage of Explosives and Ammunition



 184.90 

General.



A properly sited segregated and separate storage area is preferred for explosives storage. Earth-covered magazines
(igloo or other subsurface) offer the greatest protection to explosives. Such magazines are preferred for the storage
of all explosives. Earth-covered magazines provide protection from weather and fire, and relatively constant temperature
control.



 184.91 

Storage considerations.



Factors to consider when designating a structure for explosive storage are:

(a) Magazine construction and location.

(b) Quantity and characteristics of explosives to be stored.



 184.92 

Magazine operational regulations.



(a) No loose ammunition components, packing materials, conveyors, skids, dunnage, empty boxes, or other such items
shall be stored in magazines containing ammunition or explosives.

(b) No crew shall work in a spot that requires passing a second crew's work aisle or position to reach an exit in a magazine.
The number of crews should not exceed the number of exits. Doors shall remain unlocked and permit rapid egress.

(c) Flammable liquids, except when used as the chemical filler of ammunition, or as a prepackaged storable liquid
propellant, shall not be stored in magazines containing explosives.



 184.93 

Stacking.



(a) Ammunition and explosives should be stored in original shipping containers or equivalent. Explosives or ammunition
in stacks should be grouped and identified according to lots. General rules set forth in  184.93 (b) and (c),
shall be followed in the absence of applicable storage drawings.

(b) Methods used for stacking shall provide for good ventilation to all parts of the stack. Adequate dunnage shall
be used for this purpose.

(c) Aisles shall be maintained so that units in each stack may be inspected, inventoried, and removed for shipment
or surveillance tests. Block storage is permitted, provided adequate ventilation of stacks exists. Unobstructed
aisles shall be maintained to permit rapid egress.

(d) Only one light box, pallet, or unit should be allowed per lot in storage. Stacked light units should be readily visible
and immediately accessible.



 184.94 

Loose rounds, damaged containers.



Loose rounds of ammunition, or single fiber containers with rounds therein, shall not be stored in magazines containing
ammunition items packed in original shipping containers; however, they may be stored in magazines set aside for their
exclusive storage. Incomplete boxes of ammunition and explosives may be stored in magazines containing complete
boxes packed in original shipping containers. Conspicuously marked to identify contents and quantities, the incomplete
boxes shall be placed in designated locations. Explosives and ammunition in damaged containers should not be stored
in a magazine with ammunition in serviceable containers. Such containers should be repaired or the contents transferred
to new or serviceable containers. Open containers and containers with covers not securely fastened shall not be allowed
in magazines. Containers that have been opened shall be properly closed before being restored. Stored containers
should be free from loose dust and grit.



 184.95 

Repairs to magazines.



(a) Repairs should not be made to the interiors of magazines containing bulk explosives. Repairs to roofs, ventilators,
lightning rods, doors and other parts of, or appendages to, the exteriors of magazines containing bulk explosives
shall not normally require removing the explosives. Minor repairs may be made to the interiors of magazines containing
finished ammunition or ammunition components.

(b) The general safety requirements set forth in this part, particularly the elimination of fire hazards, shall be
followed when magazines are repaired. When necessary, baffles and screens should be used to confine sparks and flames
to heating apparatus.



 184.96 

Open storage (outdoors).



Open storage of A&E is prohibited.



 184.97 

Storage of bulk initiating explosives.



Bulk initiating explosives shall not be stored dry nor exposed to the direct rays of the sun. Containers of ample size
to hold the double bag of explosives are used for normal storage. Covers designed and constructed to prevent friction
and pinch points should be used. Covers of shipping containers used for long-term storage shall be equipped with a
port for observing the level of the liquid contents. The viewing port shall have a transparent plastic cover proven
compatible with the initiating explosives being stored. Bulk initiating explosives may, for expediency, be stored
in shipping containers without viewing ports, provided they are stored in magazines that will prevent freezing;
with containers on end, only one tier high; with passageways for inspection and handling. Bags of initiating explosives
in storage containers shall be under distilled water. Alcohol may be added to the distilled water to prevent freezing.



 184.98 

Rockets and rocket motors.



(a) In aboveground magazines, rockets and rocket motor items (in a propulsive state) should be pointed in the direction
least exposing personnel and property in case of fire or explosion.

(b) Rockets should be stored in dry, cool magazines, out of the direct rays of the sun. Prolonged exposure of rocket
ammunition to either high or low temperatures may increase the normal rate of deterioration or render the motors more
susceptible to ignition if handled improperly later.

Subpart J_Fire Protection 


 184.100 

General. 



This subpart provides general requirements for personnel developing and effecting fire protection and prevention
programs in A&E environments. 



 184.101 

Fire plan. 



A written fire plan shall be prepared. Although details may vary, plans for all establishments shall itemize the emergency
functions of each department or outside agency, indicating responsible individuals and alternates. 



 184.102 

Firefighting agreements. 



Voluntary and mutual agreements with nearby municipalities or industrial centers should include firefighting
procedures as established by the plant officials. Plant officials are responsible for informing the assisting firefighters
of particular procedures to be followed. Outside firefighters should not assist in fires involving A&E. If the
practical need for their doing so can be anticipated, they shall receive advance instruction in A&E firefighting
procedures. Outside firefighters shall never attack fires involving Hazard Divisions 1.1 and 1.2. 



 184.103 

Smoking. 



Smoking may take place only in safe, specifically designated and posted ``smoking locations.'' 

(a) Cigarettes, tobacco, and matches shall be discarded in ash receptacles only. They shall not be dropped into trash
cans. 

(b) Electric lighters with automatic pressure cutoffs shall be fixed, ensuring against removal. 

(c) At least one fire extinguisher shall be provided at smoking locations. 

(d) Persons wearing clothing contaminated with explosives or other dangerous material should not be permitted in
smoking areas. 



 184.104 

Hot work permits. 



A written permit shall be required for the temporary use of heat-producing equipment or devices when explosives or
highly flammable materials are involved. 


 184.105 

Portable fire extinguishers.




Hand extinguishers within buildings can squelch incipient fires before major damage is done. Portable equipment
may provide similarly valuable outside aboveground magazines and other buildings with explosives. 


 184.106 

Hazards in fighting fires involving ammunition and explosives. 




A fire hazard identification system shall be adopted. This shall assess relative dangers, up to the most hazardous
material stored. 

(a) The following fire symbol system is provided as a guide: 

(1) Fire divisions, numbered ``1'' through ``4,'' shall correspond to Hazard Divisions 1.1 through 1.4. 

(2) The lower the number, the greater the hazard: 






(3) Distinctively shaped placards, instantly recognizable from a distance, signify the different divisions. Each
placard, or symbol, shows the fire division number:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Black numbers appear on orange backgrounds as used by NATO, UNO, IMO, and DOT. Relectorized or luminous symbols
are preferred.

(b) 

Firefighting procedures. 

(1) General

(i) Fires should be immediately reported and may be fought without specific authorization. However, personnel should
evacuate and seek safety if fires involve explosive materials or cannot be controlled by equipment at hand. Training
of operational personnel shall cover the characteristics of explosive materials, including their reactions to
heat and fire, as well as what to do in case of fire.

(ii) Firefighters should be thoroughly informed of the specific reactions of A&E exposed to heat or fire.

(iii) Firefighters should be briefed on conditions at the scene before proceeding.

(iv) Ammunition contained both explosives and chemicals require special precautionary measures. See Subpart K
of this part.

(2) 

Specific. 

(i) Personnel shall not attempt to fight fires involving A&E in Hazard Divisions 1.1 and 1.2. Because this material
detonates with a fragmentation hazard, personnel shall evacuate immediately, using protective cover and activating
deluge systems and fire alarms while escaping. Individuals remain in danger until they reach shelters, although
reaching inhabited building distances in the open affords some safety. During exit drills, employees shall be advised
of the safest escape routes.

(ii) If the fire in a Hazard Division 1.1 or 1.2 buildings involves nonexplosive material and is small or in a segregated
container, an attempt may be made to extinguish the fire. After summoning firefighters, responsible parties should
attempt to meet them as they approach to brief them. When 1.1 or 1.2 materials are directly involved, firefighting
forces should maintain inhabited building distance from the fire. The safety of personnel fighting a 1.1 or 1.2 fire
depends on the accuracy of the information made available to all firefighting forces. No person shall reenter a burning
building containing 1.1 or 1.2 materials.

(iii) Personnel in the immediate vicinity of Hazard Division 1.3 explosives should activate deluge systems and alarms.
Unless the fire is minor, involves no explosive, and appears controllable, the firefighting organization shall
confine its efforts to preventing it from spreading to other buildings. Fire in Hazard Division 1.3 materials creates
a wide area of intense radiant heat, dangerous to personnel and equipment. The firefighting organization should
exercise extreme caution.

(iv) Hazard Division 1.4 A&E present a moderate fire hazard. Fires involving them shall be fought until extinguished.



 184.107 

Automatic sprinkler systems.



Properly installed and maintained automatic sprinklers reduce fire losses. They are particularly useful for load
lines; explosives manufacturing; receiving, shipping, inspection, and ammunition workshops; and demilitarization.



 184.108

Clearance under sprinklers.



At least 18 inches shall separate sprinkler deflectors from store materials piled 15 feet high or less; in all other
cases, the clearance shall be at least 36 inches. A minimum clearance of 36 inches shall be maintained between sprinklers
and extremely hazardous materials, and between sprinklers and baled storage, regardless of height.



 184.109

Deluge systems.



(a) Deluge systems should supplement sprinklers when the hazards are high, as in powder hoppers and cutters. Rate
of rise, light-actuating, ultraviolet, or other quick-action devices for automatic control of deluge systems are
recommended. Quick-acting manual controls should serve as backup.

(b) To ensure immediate drenching of all parts of the machine, the distribution outlets (nozzles, sprays, heads,
etc.) should be as near the explosive's exposed surface as permitted by the outlet discharge pattern. When explosives
are under tight hoods or covers inside machines, distributing outlets belong inside the enclosed space.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


(c) Nonmetallic, internally spring-held caps should protect outlets exposed to explosive vapors, gases, or dust.
Upon exertion of pressure within the outlet, the cap shall pop immediately. Caps should be attached to outlets to prevent
their dropping into equipment during a deluge.


(d) Required water flow and pressure should be determined for the hazard.


(e) Periodic inspections of deluge systems shall ensure that they are in proper operating condition.


(f) The deluge valve should allow for automatic and manual activation. Manual activation devices shall be placed
at exits in explosives-operating buildings. They may also be located at the operator stations when hazard analysis
determines the risk to personnel acceptable.


(g) National Fire Protection Association Standards No. 13,
 

Installation of Sprinkler Systems,

 and No. 15,
 

Water Spray Fixed Systems, 

contain basic installation rules.






 184.110

Hazards in fighting fires involving liquid propellants.




For safety's sake, firefighters shall know the burning characteristics and specific hazards of liquid propellants.
Burning liquid propellants fumes are generally toxic, so firefighters should remain on the upwind side. Protective
clothing should include an approved, self-contained breathing apparatus.



 184.111

Firebreaks.




The primary purpose of vegetation control is to limit the probability of fires causing a hazard to ammunition and explosives
areas. Therefore, a firebreak, at least 50 feet wide in all directions, shall be maintained around magazine areas,
aboveground magazines and explosives operating buildings/locations. Firebreaks need not be devoid of vegetation
but the growth shall be controlled to prevent rapid transmission of fire. Maintenance of firebreaks around earth-covered
magazines is not required. However, combustible material and large trees shall be removed. Vegetation around ventilators
on earth-covered magazines shall be controlled to prevent transmission of fire into the magazine.



Subpart K_Specific Chemicals



 184.113

for the establishment of local safety requirements. Publications listed below are acceptable as guides in the formulation
of safety requirements except where they conflict with the requirements of this part:

 184.114 

Repairs to acid equipment.



(a) Before a pipeline, pump, or other equipment exposed to acid is dismantled for repairs, it should be drained and
washed down with water. All pressure shall be relieved; valves, switches, etc., shall be tagged or locked to prevent
the accidental application of pressure or the introduction of acid into the line. Branch lines where pockets may exist
require particular attention. All pumping on the system connected with parts under repair should cease, with starters
tagged and locked, unless blank flanges in the lines cut off the affected parts from the pump. In breaking a flange,
the bottom bolts should be loosened first and the first line allowed to sag slightly, permitting the liquid to run out
by gravity. Spilled liquid shall be disposed of properly after the repairs. Absent other information, chemical pipelines
shall be assumed to contain liquid. 

(b) Repairing used-steel acid tanks presents two types of hazards. Even a trace of weak acid or weak acid sludge shall
violently react on the metal, generating gases. These could cause an explosion if welding is carried out on the tank.
Personnel working inside the tank risk serious poisoning from the gases. Therefore, before repairs start, the tank
shall be washed out, filled with water, then drained. If any acid remains, it may be necessary to apply soda ash solution
and steam, then fill the tank with water, repeating the original procedure. Before entering tanks, check that sufficient
oxygen is present. When someone is working inside the tank, an observer shall be present, with at least one other person
available for rescue work, should the worker in the tank be overcome; such personnel shall receive training in tank
rescue work. Those entering tanks shall have respiratory protective equipment, life belts, or harnesses and lifelines.


(c) 

Neutralizing spills. 

Slaked (hydrated) lime shall be available to neutralize spilled acid. A 10 to 20 percent solution of sodium bicarbonate
shall remove acid from floors or equipment. Because neutralization generates heat, care shall be taken in cleaning
large quantities of acid. Soda or other alkaline solutions shall neutralize all places made slippery by acid, which
shall then be flushed with water. 

(d) 

Mixing acid with water. 

The acid shall be added to the water, never the water added to the acid, when significant amounts are being diluted.
Acid should be added slowly with agitation. Weak acid replacing water as the diluting agent requires similar precautions.
Solutions shall be thoroughly mixed, particularly in steel tanks. 

(e) 

Empty containers. 

Carboys that have contained acids shall be thoroughly drained before being offered for transportation. They shall
be shipped in the same manner as full items. 



 184.115 

Mixed acids.



Mixed acids include mixtures of sulfuric and nitric acids used in the nitration of various explosives constituents.
The pressure of liberated gases sometimes causes carboys of mixed acids to rupture violently. Mixed acids can start
fires, generate gases that cause explosions, and emit poisonous oxides of nitrogen. Mixed acid containing not less
than 10 percent of nitric acid shall not freeze at ordinary temperatures and shall not actively attack steel storage
tanks. 



 184.116 

Waste acids (spent acids). 



Waste acids usually contain small amounts of nitrobodies, so present the hazard of explosive material. Spent acid
from the manufacture of nitroglycerin and liquid esters are particularly hazardous. 



 184.117 

Nitric acid. 



Nitric acid forms explosive compounds with most organic materials. With most oxidizable material, it forms flammable
compounds, some of which are subject to spontaneous ignition. Nitric acid fire creates exceedingly toxic oxides
of nitrogen. Buildings where nitric acid is used shall have proper ventilation. Enough space shall separate them
to allow for firefighting forces; also, to prevent the accumulation of acid ``fumes'' (sometimes colorless, at other
times identifiable, ranging from dark yellow to brown). The first symptoms of nitrous poisoning are usually followed
by a latent period, when the victim feels comfortable though the poisoning continues. For this reason, anyone with
even mild symptoms of nitrous poisoning shall immediately be made completely still and attended by a physician as
soon as possible.



 184.118 

Sulfuric acid (oil of vitriol). 



Concentrated sulfuric acid chars wood, cotton, and vegetable fibers, usually without causing fire, but oleum (fuming
sulfuric acid) usually does cause fire in these materials. The addition of water may create heat sufficient to cause
a fire or explosion, and greatly increases the corrosive properties of oleum. This does not preclude the use of large
quantities of water to dilute or dissipate small quantities of acid. Sulfuric acid shall not be stored with nitric
acid, volatile or flammable liquids, or oxidizing agents. It may be stored in carboys, drums, tanks, glass bottles,
and in large outdoor tanks. All precautions listed for sulfuric acid apply to oleum. In an emergency, sand, earth,
or other noncombustibles may be used to absorb oleum spilled or leaking from storage containers. Once the crisis has
passed, the oleum-soaked mass can be neutralized with solid carbonates, such as calcium carbonate. 



 184.119 

Oxidizing agents.



The following discussion is limited to the inorganic oxidizing agents, because the organic agents, such as nitrobenzene,
are often violent explosives and should come with special storage and handling instructions. Inorganic oxidizing
agents include the chlorates, perchlorates, peroxides, and nitrates of barium, sodium, potassium, strontium,
ammonium, etc. Their ability to furnish oxygen renders oxiding agents hazardous, and violent explosions may occur
when they are mixed or contaminated with minute quantities of certain carbonaceous and combustible materials such
as wood, paper, metal powders, sulfur, etc. The violence of reaction depends upon subdivision, extent of contamination,
degree of confinement, and type of initiation. Shoes, clothing, and other combustible materials covered with dust
or solutions of oxidizing agents also represent dangers. Intimate mixtures of finely divided oxidizers and fuels
are very sensitive to heat, friction, and impact.



 184.120 

Handling oxidizing agents. 



(a) Oxidizing agents shall be stored and processed only in fire-resistive rooms or buildings. They shall be separated
from fuels, flammable materials, metal powders, and acids until processing.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00126 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Equipment for processing oxidizing agents shall not be used for fuels, flammable substances, metal powders,
etc. It should be constructed of non-combustible materials only.

(c) Solutions of oxidizing agents shall be placed in nonabsorbent, non-combustible containers only.

(d) Damaged combustible containers shall not be repaired in the storage building because of the risk of contamination
and ignition. Discarded containers shall serve no other purpose, but shall be burned in the open. Combustible containers
infused with oxidizing agents burn fiercely if ignited, and may explode.

(e) Employees handling oxidizing agents should wear flame-resistant clothing as minimal protection. Contaminated
clothing should be stored in metal cabinets until laundered.

(f) Spills of small quantities of oxidizing agents during processing shall be cleaned up immediately. If large quantities
are spilled, the uppermost layers may be salvaged if free of contaminants.



 184.121


Chlorates.



(a) Chlorates mixed with sulfur, sulfides, or other readily oxidizable material may cause spontaneous ignition.
Sulfur presents a greater hazard than sulfides. Adding phosphorus to a sulfur-chlorate mixture increases the danger.
Shellac, potassium, sodium nitrate with petroleum derivatives, and powdered metals render chlorates sensitive;
mixtures of trinitrocresol or picric acid and chlorates should be avoided since they are particularly sensitive.
Chlorates shall never be mixed with ammonium salts since the ammonium chlorate that could form could spontaneously
explode. Moisture of 0.5 percent or more in mixtures containing chlorates is considered dangerous because of the
possible formation of chloric acid.

(b) Substituting sodium chlorate for potassium chlorate in any of the above-described mixtures increases the hazard.

(c) Ammonium chlorate decomposes spontaneously. When mixed with perchlorates it constitutes a major hazard.

(d) Barium chlorate is very toxic. In storage, it poses a greater danger than potassium chlorate.

(e) Zinc chlorate, in contact with certain organic materials, explodes under the influence of slight friction, percussion,
or shock. When involved in a fire, it is life-threatening.

(f) Storage of chlorates should preclude contact with other combustible material, organic or inorganic. Broken
or damaged containers and spilled material should be promptly removed and destroyed.

(g) Fires involving chlorates should be fought with solid streams of water or with water fog. With solid streams, firefighters
can maintain a greater distance but steam explosion becomes a danger requiring precautionary measures. Water fog
offers the advantage of quicker cooling. Its normal smothering action, however, is obviated by the ability of chlorates
to furnish oxygen to the fire.

 184.122

Perchlorates.



Perchlorates form slightly less sensitive mixtures than do chlorates and should be substituted whenever possible.
Advantages of using perchlorates include this reduced sensitivity to impact and friction, the nonformation of a
free acid when moisture is present, and greater safety in the event of accidental contact with the weak acids that form
the principal part of many gums used in binding pyrotechnic mixtures.

(a) Ammonium perchlorate alone does not easily explode. It is stable at ordinary temperatures, but decomposes at
a maintained temperature of 302
 F (150
 C). It has the same degree of sensitivity to impact as picric acid. It becomes a high explosive when mixed with
flammable materials and metal powders.

(b) Containers for perchlorates and chlorates in storage include lined wooden boxes, kegs, barrels, and iron drums.
All damaged and broken containers shall be removed from the storehouse and spilled material swept up and destroyed
promptly.

(c) Fires involving perchlorates alone may be fought with water.



 184.123

Peroxides.



(a) 

General.

 Solid peroxides decompose easily in the presence of moisture and shall therefore be stored in a cool, dry place. They
pose a severe fire hazard, particularly when incorporated with combustible materials. Sodium peroxide shall be
protected from contact with water, which renders it explosive. Hydrogen peroxide of approximately 30 percent strength
is unstable, liberates oxygen, and resembles the solid peroxides.

(b) 

High-strength hydrogen peroxide.

 (1) High-strength hydrogen peroxide (90 percent or greater) is shipped in specially designed containers with vents
and stored only in containers vented to the atmosphere, constructed so that foreign material shall not enter the containers.
It shall be stored in a cool, shaded location used only for that purpose. Containers of hydrogen peroxide shall never
exceed 15 or 20 above ambient temperatures. Larger increases in temperature may indicate a decomposition of the hydrogen
peroxide. Operators shall report any undue heating of hydrogen peroxide drums to the person in charge, and the area
shall be evacuated immediately. A water spray system, installed in every hydrogen peroxide storage location, shall
be turned on immediately upon observation of overheated storage drums. If hydrogen peroxide is to be stored for long
periods, high-purity aluminum containers shall be used.

(2) All tanks, tubes, and fittings shall be thoroughly cleaned. The recommended procedure involves immersing parts
in a pickling solution of 0.5 percent sodium hydroxide at room temperature for 1 hour, washing with clear water, drying,
immersing in a 5 percent solution of CP sulfuric acid at room temperature for 1 hour; washing, drying, and leaving in
a 25 to 30 percent solution of hydrogen peroxide for at least 24 hours, then draining off the solution. The part is then
ready for use.

(3) Hydrogen peroxide burns and discolors skin. All persons handling this material should wear face shields, rubber
gloves, and rubber trousers on the outside of rubber boots. Running water shall be available in the storage area; any
part of the skin touched by hydrogen peroxide shall be immediately washed with water. Spillages of hydrogen peroxide
shall be immediately washed away with water.

(4) Only the following materials should be used in equipment coming in contact with high strength hydrogen peroxide:
``Pyrex'' glass, high-purity aluminum, pure tin, ``Keroseal'' or equivalent. Stainless steel types 304, 309, 310,
316, 321, and 347 are suitable for periods of 2 months or less.

(c) 

Fires.

 Fires involving peroxides, except sodium peroxide, may be fought with water. Sodium peroxide fires shall be smothered
with sand, ashes, dirt, or rock dust.



 184.124

Nitrates.



(a) 

General.

 Many nitrates are not flammable in themselves, and are usually stored in wooden boxes, kegs, or barrels. Ammonium
nitrate, however, is shipped in special waterproof bags or metal containers. Barium nitrate is sometimes stored
in iron drums. Regardless of the type of container, it shall be moisture-proof. Nitrates shall be stored in a dry place,
since they cake in the presence of moisture.

(b) 

Ammonium nitrate.

 (1) Ammonium nitrate in confinement can detonate with the violence of a high explosive, but this would require a relatively
heavy initiator. Under the effect of heating alone, ammonium nitrate shall decompose. Contamination with chlorides,
sulfur, nitrobodies, charcoal, metallic nitrates, metal powders, petroleum derivatives, and oxidizable carbonaceous
materials sensitizes ammonium nitrate, accelerates its decomposition, and increases the violence of the reaction.
Zinc or lead contamination lowers the decomposition temperature to 200 
 F. Galvanized metals and lead solder shall not, therefore, be used in the vicinity of ammonium nitrate operations.
The burning of ammonium nitrate and combustible material such as wood or paper containers, produces a gas mixture
that under proper conditions of pressure may detonate with sufficient force to initiate the detonation of ammonium
nitrate. Fires involving ammonium nitrate shall be vented to the greatest practicable extent because air acts as
a diluent for the hazardous gases, minimizing the probability of explosion.

(2) In high pan (evaporating) operations, deluge systems should be provided over the pans for use in case of fire. Temperatures
used to heat the liquor may not exceed 317 
 F (saturated steam at 100 psi). High pan operations shall be located at class 1.1 distances from adjacent structures
other than the graining building. The graining building, however, shall be protected from the high pans by a barricade.
The class 1.1 distances specified above may be based on the maximum quantity of ammonium nitrate contained in any one
high pan.

(3) Fires involving nitrate should be fought with large quantities of water, never with steam. Solid hose streams
enable the fire to be fought from a greater distance but introduce the hazard of steam explosion, particularly if the
nitrate is molten; therefore, the hose streams shall be directed from behind a protective barrier. Under some circumstances,
when the fire is in the incipient stage and accessible, water fog may be used to an advantage but it shall have no smothering
action since the burning material provides its own oxygen.

(4) Storage of ammonium nitrate in explosives storage magazines is preferred. When stored in an area where there is
a possibility that explosives may be projected into the nitrates, the requirements for class 1.1 explosives are applicable.
When stored in an area with fire hazards only and separated by more than intraline distances from areas containing
ammunition, ammonium nitrate may be stored in accordance with the requirements governing the storage of a class 1.3
solid propellant.

(i) Buildings, other than earth-covered magazines, used for the storage of ammonium nitrate, shall be of a type easily
vented if fire occurs, in order that the gases produced during combustion and considered potential sources of explosion
to the commodity are dissipated. The floors of such buildings shall be of a type to prevent hazardous impregnation
by the nitrate.

(ii) Stacking within storage buildings other than earth-covered magazines should anticipate stacks no larger than
the 12 by 12 feet plan dimension, and not higher than 7 feet. Aisles not less than 3 feet wide shall be maintained around
each stack and between the sides of the building. The use of wood dunnage should be restricted to reduce the quantity
of combustible materials present.

(iii) Broken packages or containers shall be removed from the building and the spilled material swept up and destroyed
promptly.



 184.125

Powdered metals: aluminum, magnesium, and aluminum alloys.



(a) Since a rise in the temperature of metal powders can result from contact with water and ignition may ensue, precautions
shall be taken to prevent water from contacting the material. All buildings where powdered metals are stored or processed
shall be vented adequately at the highest point of the room or building to prevent the accumulation of evolved hydrogen
gas that results from the reaction between powdered metals and moisture, except when stored in watertight containers.

(b) Exposed material that may be at a low temperature should be brought to or near the room temperature under conditions
of low relative humidity before being placed in the operating room.

(c) Heating equipment shall be installed in service magazines, when required, to bring the closed containers and
contents to a temperature approximately that of the operating building.

(d) Efforts should be made to maintain relative humidity between 50 and 55 percent in locations where metal powders
are exposed, so as to avoid the hazard of static electricity while preventing condensation.

(e) Operators should be cautioned to wear sweatbands on their foreheads and take other precautions to prevent perspiration
from falling onto powdered metals.

(f) Care should be exercised in locating pipes, to prevent condensation on cold pipes forming droplets of water and
falling upon hazardous material. Leaking water pipes can cause ignition.

(g) Powdered metals in metal containers with tight covers may be stored in general warehouses, provided that they
are remote from oxidizing agents. The storage place shall be dry.

(h) When compounded with oxidizing agents, powdered metals present a dangerous fire and explosion hazard.
(i) Very fine suspended dust from powdered metals is an explosion hazard comparable to that of explosive gases and
may be initiated easily by discharges of static electricity.
(j) Powdered metals exposed to air are dangerous fire hazards and burn with intense heat. Metallic oxide formed by
the burning within drums effectively blankets such fires, confining them, if undisturbed, to the place of origin.
(k) Fires shall not be fought with ordinary streams of water because of the danger of liberating large quantities of
hydrogen gas, a severe explosion hazard. Fires involving small quantities of powdered metals may be combated with
a fog nozzle or specially designed commercial extinguishing powders gently applied to prevent the fire from spreading.
If large quantities of powdered metals become involved in a fire and escape from their storage containers, firefighting
efforts shall be directed primarily to prevention of fire spreading to other facilities. Where friction sensitivity
is not a concern, smothering fire with sand may be effective.
(l) Trained personnel shall repair or maintain buildings or equipment where metallic powders are involved, and then
only with the following precautions: powder or dust shall be removed, nonsparking tools shall be used, hammer impacts
that could cause sparks shall be avoided, flashlights shall be of approved type, equipment shall be grounded, undue
friction shall be prevented, and open flames shall not be used.
(m) Zirconium powder can explode violently when in contact with cupric oxide or lead oxide. Other metallic powders
exhibit this property under certain conditions. National Fire Prevention Association, 491M,
 

Hazardous Chemical Reactions, 

provides information regarding reactions between metallic powders and other chemicals.




 184.126 

Charcoal.


(a) Charcoal is subject to spontaneous ignition in the presence of moisture, although pit charcoal is less likely
than the chemical byproduct charcoal, and soft wood charcoal less so than hardwood charcoal. The following conditions
promote the spontaneous ignition of charcoal: forced cooling after burning; drying after absorbing moisture; and
contact with alcohols and oils (particularly for charcoal in which a fire has been extinguished). Pulverized charcoal
is a definite fire hazard. The gases from burning charcoal contain carbon monoxide and are toxic.
(b) Permanent or reserve storage of large quantities of charcoal is not recommended. Charcoal should be stored in
airtight containers or in bags piled in tiers with skeleton or gridwork floors between tiers to provide ventilation.
It should be isolated and remove from oxidizing agents. Bulk storage of charcoal is prohibited.


 184.127 

Sulfur.


(a) Sulfur compounded with chlorates and several other oxidizing agents forms highly sensitive explosive mixtures.
Sulfur presents a spontaneous ignition hazard when mixed with carbon, lamp black, fats, and oils. Burning sulfur
produces toxic gases and fumes.
(b) Sulfur may be stored in wooden boxes, kegs, or barrels. Large quantities may be stored in bulk. It should be isolated
and remote from oxidizing agents with which it forms highly sensitive explosive mixtures.


 184.128 

Flammable solids.


Guanidine nitrate, dinitrophenol, DNT, and dinitrobenzene are examples of flammable solids. These materials may
be stored in wooden boxes or barrels lined with moisture-proof paper. They should be stored in fire-resistant locations,
preferably in magazines. When strongly initiated they may act as explosives. Dinitrophenol may explode at elevated
temperatures.


 184.129 

Volatile flammable liquids.


(a) Common examples of volatile flammable liquids are ether acetone, gasoline, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol (wood
alcohol), benzene, toluene, xylene, and amyl acetate. These volatile liquids may, if unconfined, evolve vapor in
explosive concentrations. Ethyl and isopropyl ethers tend to form explosive peroxides, especially when anhydrous.
Evaporation to near dryness shall be prevented. Volatile flammable liquids shall not be used to wash or clean equipment
or parts of buildings except when specifically authorized as process requirements.
(b) Some flammable liquids such as paints, varnishes, and enamels may, under certain conditions, be subject to spontaneous
ignition. They shall therefore be isolated from sources of heat, in locations where any heat produced shall readily
dissipate. Only noncombustible sweeping compounds should be used for cleaning up materials of this type.


 184.130 

Calcium carbide.


Small quantities of calcium carbide may be stored in general warehouses in airtight tin cans or iron drums. Large quantities
should be stored only in separate noncombustible buildings or detached weatherproof sheds. The storage place should
be dry and well ventilated. Calcium carbide, in itself a slight fire hazard, reacts violently with water, liberating
large quantities of acetylene gas which, with air, forms explosive mixtures.


 184.131 

Sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) and potassium hydroxide.


These materials may be stored in general warehouses in airtight iron drums. Permanent storage of large stocks is not
recommended. These chemical products may become a fire hazard when mixed with nitro compounds or other materials.
Their action is corrosive and caustic; mixed with water, they create heat.


 184.132 

Metallic sodium.


Metallic sodium may be stored in airtight steel drums and may be stored under kerosene or nitrogen, but not under chlorinated
hydrocarbons. Its violent reaction with water liberates hydrogen and causes heat, producing a serious fire and explosion
hazard.

 184.133


Nitrocellulose and derivatives.



Nitrocellulose includes various types of nitrated cotton or wood pulp, depending on the nitrogen content. When dry,
it is extremely sensitive to shock and friction and readily accumulates static charges. It is highly flammable and
explosive, burning rapidly and producing very little smoke or residue. Impure, it is subject to spontaneous ignition.
Storage of dry nitrocellulose is not permitted as it possesses all the hazards of a sensitive and easily ignited high
explosive. Nitrocellulose with 25 to 30 percent moisture content is stored in zinc-lined boxes or metal drums and
is substantially nonexplosive when stored in an area where explosives or ammunition cannot be projected into it.



 184.134


Red phosphorus.



Red phosphorus forms sensitive mixtures with oxidizing agents, posing a dangerous fire hazard. It may be stored in
general warehouses in metal drums or metal containers included in wood boxes. Phosphine gas may form in containers
of red phosphorous; protective measures should be used when opening these.



 184.135


Thermite (TH).



Thermite, a mixture of iron oxide, aluminum, and other substances, is a dark gray granular mass. To burn, it requires
an igniter. At 4300 
 F, iron oxide reduces to molten iron, causing rapid burning. Thermate is a mixture of thermite, grained aluminum,
barium nitrate, sulfur, and lubricating oil.



 184.136


Incendiary bombs.



Incendiary bombs may consist of a combustible body of magnesium metal alloy containing an igniter composition such
as thermate. When ignited, the body of the bomb burns at about 
3700 
 F. Other types (such as IM, NP, PTI) have steel cases filled with thickened fuel. These operate by ejecting the
burning fuel over a wide area. Incendiary bombs are difficult to extinguish.



 184.137


Colored smoke mixtures.



These mixtures contain dye for smoke and some fuels. They do not contain hexachloroethane (HC). Respiratory protection
shall be worn for protection against heavy concentrations of smoke.



 184.138


Smoke.



FM or FS in smoke form shall not usually produce effects requiring treatment. Smoke in high concentrations from CN-DM,
CN, and HC is toxic, and anyone unprotected by a mask subjected to this should receive medical attention. Corrosive
on the skin, liquid FS or FM should be immediately washed with copious quantities of water, then flushed with mild sodium
bicarbonate solution.



 184.139


Adamsite (DM).



DM is a greenish yellow to black solid, melting at 383 
 F. Smoke from the burning agent causes irritation in the nose and throat even in minimal concentrations. Longer
exposure causes tightness of the chest, headache, sneezing, coughing, intense nausea, and weakness. The symptoms
increase in severity for some time after exposure, and temptation to remove the mask should be resisted. Irritation
produced by this agent is so intense that an intolerable concentration is reached long before it becomes dangerous
to life. The effects may last for several hours, but no permanent injury is caused. If DM is spilled, it should not be
swept or handled in any way so as to cause dust formation: DM should be wet thoroughly before it is swept. For first aid
treatment, remove victim to fresh air and flush nose and throat areas with bicarbonate of soda solution. Let victim
breathe an alcohol, chloroform, and ammonia mixture. Evacuate to hospital for medical treatment.



 184.140


O-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS).



(a) CS is a white crystalline powder similar to, but more powerful than, CN. It has a minimum purity of 96 percent; insoluble
in water and ethanol, it is soluble in methylene chloride. CS1 is a micropulverized powder. CS2 is a modified CS1, treated
with liquid silicone to increase fluidity and persistency.

(b) A protective mask; ordinary coveralls secured at the neck, wrist, and ankles; and rubber gloves shall provide
protection.

(c) Exposure incapacitates within 20 to 60 seconds and, after the affected individual reaches fresh air, the effects
continue for 5 to 10 minutes. Eyes burn, tear copiously, and involuntarily close. Exposure also causes coughing,
difficulty breathing, chest tightness, a stinging sensation, a running nose, and dizziness or a swimming sensation
in the head. Heavy concentrations of CS, which has a pepper-like odor, shall also cause nausea and vomiting. To prevent
stinging and reddening of the skin, personnel touched by CS dust or particles should not shower for 6 hours. Individuals
affected by CS should move to fresh air, face the wind, and should not rub their eyes. To remove accidental gross contamination,
personnel should remove clothing and immediately flush the body with copious amounts of water to remove most of the
agent; apply 5 percent sodium bisulfite solution to remove remainder (except in or around eyes); then rinse the entire
body.

(d) Area decontamination is required with CS, which settles as a dust. Any such accumulation shall be removed, either
by vacuuming or washing down the area with detergent solution followed by a clear water rinse.



 184.141


Sulfur trioxide-chlorosulfonic acid mixture (FS)



This is a heavy liquid acid with an acrid odor. It fumes strongly in air, decomposes above 154 
 F, and is used solely as a smoke-producing agent. Exposure to heavy concentrations may cause severe irritation
to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Inhalation of concentrated fumes causes coughing and strangulation, a
constricted feeling around the chest, and a burning sensation in the nose and throat. When the mixture comes in contact
with moisture, it forms hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, both of which corrode metals and fabrics. Any FS on clothing
or skin should be wiped off with a dry cloth, and the contaminated area flushed with large amounts of water. Itself nonflammable,
FS may cause fires if spilled on flammable material, particularly under damp conditions. Leaking munitions containers
should be removed from the magazine and contents poured on the ground in a suitable area. Spillage can be removed with
large quantities of water. Small quantities of water added to FS react violently.



 184.142


Titanium tetrachloride (FM).

Titanium tetrachloride is a heavy, colorless liquid acid with a pungent odor. When it leaks it produces a massive amount
of smoke. It is used solely to produce smoke and has slight toxic effects. Liquid FM shall burn the skin, however; and
quantities of smoke cause a choking sensation and difficulty breathing; a protective mask is required for the comfort
of the worker. In extremely heavy concentrations, protective mask canisters may become clogged to such an extent
as to render breathing difficult; in enclosed places, serious injury can result. Large quantities of water can remove
liquid FM from the skin. Leaking munitions containers should be removed from the magazine and destroyed by pouring
contents on the ground in a disposal area. Spillage can be removed with large quantities of water.



 184.143

Hexachloroethane mixture (HC).



HC, a gray-colored powder without characteristic odor, consists largely of a hexachloroethane, zinc oxide, and
aluminum mixture. HC reacts with water which can start it burning; it burns rather slowly with the evolution of a dense
cloud of smoke. Respiratory protection shall be worn by personnel exposed to any concentration of HC smoke.



 184.144

Burning mixture (CN-DM).



CN-DM is a mixture of chloroacetophenone and diphenylamine chloroarsine with pyrotechnic material. Respiratory
protection is required when this mixture burns.



 184.145

Phosphorus munitions agents.



(a) 

General

. At present, white phosphorus (WP) and plasticized white phosphorus (PWP) are the only two chemical agents in this
group; they have somewhat similar characteristics.

(b) 

White phosphorus

. WP is a yellowish, wax-like substance, melting at 110 
 F. Its most characteristic property is that it spontaneously ignites when exposed to air, burning with a yellow
flame and giving off a large volume of white smoke. Smoke in field concentrations is not toxic, fumes are toxic. WP is
intensely poisonous when taken internally.

(c) 

Plasticized white phosphorus

. PWP is finely divided WP suspended in a gel of rubber and xylene.



 184.146

Storage for phosphorus munitions.



(a) 

General

. Phosphorus munitions should be stored in fire-resistive magazines with concrete floors or in earth-covered magazines
in a manner facilitating inspection.

(b) 

Temperature control

. White phosphorus filling in munitions becomes liquid at 111 
 F. When exposed to air, WP shall ignite; in cases when a burster is in the projectile, it may explode. Below 111

 F the filling is solid and shall not leak; for this reason, the temperature shall be kept below 111 
 F.

(c) 

Position of munitions

. Where temperature is likely to reach 111 
 F, WP munitions shall be stacked upright, sitting on their bases, so that a 
subsequent drop in temperature shall not solidify the WP in a position affecting the ballistics of the item.



 184.147

Special protective equipment for phosphorus munitions.



(a) 

General

. Special equipment, including that required for first aid, should be readily available to personnel working where
phosphorus munitions are stored, processed, or handled.

(b) 

Personal protective equipment

. Personal protective equipment consisting of flameproof gloves and coveralls and face shield, sufficient in number
to equip all personnel required to work with phosphorus munitions, shall be centrally stored and maintained under
close supervision. These items shall be issued to personnel working with WP- or PWP-filled items and shall be worn
whenever munitions containers leak.



 184.148

First aid for phosphorus burns.



Phosphorus buried in the flesh is absorbed and may result in systemic poisoning. The tissues immediately around the
burn are particularly affected by the absorbed phosphorus. Untrained personnel administering first aid should
immediately plunge burned areas into water, then wrap them in wet gauze.



 184.149

Leaking phosphorus munitions.



(a) 

General

. White smoke immediately alerts observers to leaks in WP munitions. Spontaneous ignition occurs when air contacts
the WP. Only prompt action can combat the great risk of fire posed by leaking WP munitions.

(b) 

Immediate action on discovering leaking munitions

. During operations, the person discovering the leaking munitions shall, when practicable, submerge the leaker
in one of the tubs provided. (Rubber protective equipment does not give adequate protection when exposed to high temperatures
such as produced by burning phosphorus. When burning phosphorus adheres to gloves, the gloved hands should be dipped
in water.)

(c) 

Disposal of leaking munitions

. After a single leaking item has been immersed in water, it should be disposed of in an area where fragmentation shall
not be a hazard, smoke shall not create a nuisance, and no dry vegetation could be ignited.

(1) An item that does not contain a fuze or burster shall be removed to the demolition ground and destroyed by static
firing. All personnel shall retire to a safe distance before the projectile is exploded.

(2) The fire shall be extinguished before a filled item with a fuze or burster, not in a container, is handled or moved.
This is extremely hazardous, and shall be carried out under the direction of an expert in demolition techniques, familiar
with chemical munitions. After the flames have been extinguished, the instructions given in  184.149(c) shall
be followed.



 184.150

Removal of phosphorus munitions.



(a) 

General

. After leaked phosphorus has been doused and contained by water, the water can evaporate, making it possible for the
phosphorus to reignite. Phosphorus that has self-extinguished by forming a crust can reignite if the crust is broken.

<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Procedures

. Small amounts of phosphorus are best removed by first scraping with a putty knife or other such implement, then removing
what remains with a blowtorch or similar appliance. This method of removing phosphorus shall not be attempted until
all loaded munitions have been removed.
(c) 

Surveillance

. The magazine should be kept under surveillance for at least 2 weeks, as fire may recur. Any deep cracks or crevices
in the floor should be filled up with cement mortar before munitions are returned in the magazine.



 184.151


Incendiary and smoke munitions.



Munitions in this group include incendiaries and signaling smokes.



 184.152


Special protective equipment for incendiary and smoke munitions.


Boxed and unboxed incendiary and smoke munitions may be handled without special protective equipment. Respiratory
protection should be available, however. Personnel exposed to burning munitions or bulk chemicals should wear protective
masks.



 184.153


First aid for incendiary and smoke munitions injuries.


No unusual first aid treatment is required for personal injuries incurred handling incendiary-to-incendiary or
smoke-to-smoke munitions. Burns should be treated in the same manner as those caused by flame. Persons exposed to
high concentrations of smoke should be hospitalized.



 184.154


Leaking incendiary and smoke munitions.


Personnel handling leaking items need not generally wear protective equipment, but masks should be worn during exposure
to burning munitions. Leaking munitions containing incendiary and smoke agents shall be segregated.


 184.155


Fire in incendiary and smoke munitions magazines.


In magazines containing incendiary or smoke munitions, primary firefighting efforts shall be confined to preventing
fire from spreading. Water is not used to fight fires of thermite or mixtures containing fine metallic powders such
as magnesium or aluminum. Incipient fires may be smothered by spraying with dry chemical fire extinguishers or covering
with sand. Fire in magazines containing incendiary-to-incendiary or smoke-to-smoke munitions shall be fought
with water only when large quantities of water can completely douse relatively small quantities of munitions.


Subpart L_Safety Requirements for Explosives Facilities


 184.157


General.


This subpart contains minimum safety requirements for existing, new, or modified explosives facilities and equipment.
For facilities primarily used for general industrial operations, the requirements of this subpart shall apply in
areas performing explosives work.


 184.158


Requirements.


Special properties of materials and operational hazards may require that national, Federal, and local requirements
be exceeded. In such cases, requirements in this subpart shall apply.


 184.159


Requirements for buildings.


(a) 

Building exteriors

. Exterior wall and roof coverings of operating buildings should be noncombustible and, whenever possible, frangible,
of ``breakaway'' construction. The buildings should have no basements and should not exceed one story, except to
meet process requirements.
(b) 

Interior walls, roofs, and ceilings

. Interior wall surfaces and ceilings of operating buildings which might house loose, finely divided explosives
materials shall be smooth, free from cracks and crevices, fire resistive and, if painted, be covered with high-gloss
paint, to minimize dust accumulation and facilitate cleaning. As further protection against dust, ledges should
be avoided; any that exist shall be beveled or kept clean. Wall joints and openings for wiring and plumbing shall be
sealed against dust. Roofs and walls should be as light as practicable, constructed and supported to vent an internal
explosion with the formation of few large fragments. Firewalls and dividing walls constitute exceptions. When class
II hazard locations exist as defined by the 

National Electric Code

 

 (NEC), (National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard No. 70,
 suspended ceilings and hollow walls are prohibited in explosives facilities. Recommended practice is to install
insulation and covering directly on the underside of the roof deck.





(c) 

Floors and work surfaces

. Floors and work surfaces shall be constructed to facilitate cleaning, with no cracks or crevices in which explosives
could lodge. Nonsparking floors and work surfaces are required in all locations where exposed explosives or hazardous
concentrations of flammable vapor or gas are present. When grounding is necessary, conductive floors (mats or similar
static-dissipating floor surfaces), tabletops, and other work surfaces shall be provided. Cove bases at the junctions
of walls and floors are preferred. No exposed nails, screws, or bolts in work surfaces shall be permitted.
(d) 

Substantial dividing wall

. (1) Substantial dividing walls, constructed in accordance with the requirements of TM 5-1300,
 

Structures to Resist the Effects of Accidental Explosions

, separate independent concentrations of high explosives so they do not need to be added when determining Q/D requirements.





(2) Openings in dividing walls for conveyors, pass-through boxes, or other uses, should be avoided. However, in locations
where operationally necessary, the following apply:
(i) The opening(s) shall not be larger than the minimum needed for the material's safe passage.
(ii) Closures shall have equivalent wall-strength characteristics and fusible links.
(e) 

Exits and doors

. No explosives hazard shall occupy space between an operator and an exit. Exit doors in buildings containing explosives,
except storage magazines, should be casement-type and glazed with non-shatterable plastic material. All interior
doors should open in the direction of the flow of material through the building and should open onto unobstructed passageways.
(f) 

Emergency egress

. When standard exits and fire escapes do not provide for rapid enough egress from work levels above the ground floor,
other means of emergency egress (that is, safety chutes) shall be provided.
(g) 

Passageways

. Weather-protected passageways between buildings or magazines should be of noncombustible construction and equipped
with fire stops to interrupt a fire's progress.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(h) 

Roads and walkways.

 Good all-weather roads should be provided. Only roads serving a single magazine or explosives processing building
(including its service facilities) may dead end, and then, only at the magazine or building. The road system should
be designed to make it unnecessary to pass through an explosives area to travel from one place to another. Walkways
and roads at the entrance to or between adjacent buildings containing explosives should be boardwalks or hard surfaced,
preventing employees from tracking stones, grit, and other foreign material into operating buildings.

(i) 

Windows and skylights.

 Non-shatterable glazing is preferred where an explosion accompanied by falling or projected glass could cause injury.
When glazing with conventional glass is used, the hazard may be reduced by covering it with properly fixed plastic
or wire mesh screening.

(j) 

Drains and sumps.

 (1) All drain lines handling explosive wastes shall have sumps or basins of sufficient capacity for the removal of
explosives by settling. The drains shall be of adequate capacity; free of pockets; and with slopes of at least one-quarter
inch per foot to prevent explosives settling-out in the drain line, rather than in the sump or settling basin intended
to collect them. Sumps shall be so designed that suspended and settleable solid explosive material cannot be carried
beyond the sumps in the wash waters, and so overflow shall not disturb any floating solids. The settling rate of the
material and the usual rate of flow shall be taken into account in determining the sump's capacity. The design shall
also permit easy removal of collected explosives, and shall allow for retention of those that float on water until
they can be skimmed off. Bolted sump tanks or other types of construction that permit the explosives to settle in obscure
or hidden spaces are prohibited.

(2) Care shall be taken to preclude deposition of explosives from sump effluent due to drying, temperature changes,
or interaction with other industrial contaminations. Sweeping and other dry collecting measures should be used
to keep appreciably water soluble explosives out of the drainage system.

(3) Drains between the source of explosive and the sump shall be troughs with rounded bottoms and with removable ventilated
covers to facilitate inspection for accumulation of explosives. Waste liquids shall not be run into close drains
and sewers. Drains shall be inspected periodically and necessary steps taken to prevent the buildup of explosives
deposits in them. Drains and sewers containing explosive waste materials shall not be connected in a manner to empty
such wastes into the normal sewage systems carrying inert or sanitary wastes.

(k) 

Hardware:

 (1) Hardware in buildings containing exposed explosive materials, explosive dusts, or vapors should be of nonsparking
material. Installation of hardware (piping and ducts) should not be affixed to blowout panels or walls.

(2) Fasteners such as nuts and bolts which could accidentally drop into explosives or explosive constituents shall
be prevented from doing so by being drilled and thonged or otherwise secured.

(l) 

Ventilation.

 Exhaust fans through which combustible dust or flammable vapor pass shall be equipped with nonferrous blades, or
the casting shall be lined with nonferrous material. Motors shall be of the proper National Electric Code (NEC) class
for the hazard (National Fire Protection Association Standard No. 70). Exhaust systems shall be cleaned and serviced
on a regular scheduled. The entire system shall be bonded and grounded.

(m) 

Steam for processing and heating.

 Process steam is that which is in direct contact with explosives, used directly in their manufacture; or that which,
in case of equipment failure, would exhaust directly into contact with explosives or explosive fumes. Steam used
for heating operating buildings containing explosives should have a maximum pressure of 5 psi (228 
 F). When necessary, process steam may exceed 5 psi, up to 15 psi. The exterior of stem or hot water pipes in contact
with wood, paper or other combustible materials shall not exceed 160 
 F. When steam temperature must exceed 228 
 F in hazardous locations, steam lines shall be covered and painted with an impervious material or otherwise
protected against contact with explosives. Requirements for steam pressure exceeding 15 psi shall be evaluated
by the contracting officer on a case-by-case basis. When a reducing valve is used, no relief valve shall be bypassed
in a manner permitting circumvention of the pressure reducing equipment. The production of superheated steam caused
by the throttling action of reducing valves shall be prevented. Use of a ``water leg'' or water column to control steam
pressure of 5 pounds or less is recommended. When close control of steam temperature is necessary, indicating and
recording pressure or temperature gauges shall be installed. Such devices should be tested periodically and the
test results recorded. When electrical resistance to ground is high, steam lines shall be properly grounded where
they enter buildings.
(n) 

Tunnels. 

To prevent possible communication of an explosive, shockwave and blast shall receive special consideration in designing
and constructing tunnels between buildings containing explosives.


 184.160


Electrical requirements.


The installation and use of electrical equipment within explosives buildings, magazines, and explosives facilities
shall comply with the latest edition of the NEC (NFPA Standard 70), at a minimum, except as otherwise specified herein.
In planning electrical equipment for special occupancies or for hazardous locations as defined in the NEC, it is often
possible to locate equipment in less hazardous or nonhazardous areas, reducing the quantity of special equipment
required and decreasing the hazard.
(a) 

Hazardous locations. 

(1) Electrical equipment and installations in hazardous locations (classes I, II, and III, as defined in the NEC (NFPA
Standard No. 70) shall in all cases comply with the requirements of the code for division 1.
(2) When electrical equipment is installed in those areas that fall into the categories of both class I and class II,
the equipment shall be of a type used in both locations. The installations shall be in accordance with the requirements
for division I hazardous locations.
(b) 

Alternate power source. 

In special processes and operations requiring a continuous supply of power, provisions shall be made for an alternate
source.

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

 Electric power lines.

 To prevent broken wires from hitting the building, the distance separating overhead transmission and service lines
from magazines and buildings containing explosives shall be greater than that between the poles or towers supporting
the lines, unless an effective means is provided to ensure that energized lines on breaking cannot come into contact
with the facility or its appurtenances; for example, cable trays and messenger lines. In no case shall overhead transmission
lines pass within 50 feet of magazines or other explosives buildings. Service lines of all types shall, except for
local telephone connections and similar low-voltage intercom or alarm systems, be run underground from a point at
least 50 feet away from the building. With regard to siting, electric transmission lines (those carrying 69 KV or more)
and the tower or poles supporting them shall be located no closer to PES's than:

(1) Inhabited building distance if the line in question is part of a grid system serving a large area off the establishment.

(2) Public traffic route distance if loss of the line shall not create serious social or economic hardships. (Public
traffic route an inhabited building distances shall be based on airblast overpressure only; fragment distances
shall not be used.)

(3) Electric transmission lines which can be interrupted without loss of power, i.e., power is rerouted through existing
lines and/or networks, shall be separated from explosives sites in accordance with  184.160(c).

(d) 

Motors.

 Electric motors should not be installed in class I or class II hazardous locations. They should be outside any such
room or building. They should be connected to the process building only through mechanical glands or apertures adequately
sealed against entrance of hazardous materials into both the location where motors are positioned and the motor enclosure
itself.

(e) 

Motor controls, circuit breakers, and safety switches.

 (1) Circuit breakers, safety switches, service entrance switches, and speed controllers for hazardous locations
should be installed on steel racks:

(i) In separate buildings connected only by electrical conduits between the small building housing the control equipment
and the buildings containing the electrical equipment for hazardous locations. Such conduits shall be provided
with sealing fittings to prevent communication of flame or arcs from the starters to the hazardous area.

(2) Limit switches, pressure switches, float switches and any other control devices which for practical operating
reasons cannot be located outdoors shall bear the approval of the Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., or other nationally
recognized testing agencies. Electrical conduit connections to such equipment shall comply with the requirements
of the latest edition of the NEC (NFPA Standard No. 70) for the specific hazard.

(3) The primary electric supply to an entire explosive area should be so arranged that it can be cut off by switches located
at one or more central points away from the area.

(f) Flashlights and lanterns. Flashlights and hand lanterns powered by low-voltage dry cell batteries and miners'
cap lamps, approved as ``Permissible'' by the United States Bureau of Mines or, for class I hazardous locations, by
Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., or other nationally recognized testing agencies, may be used in both class I and
class II hazardous locations.



 184.161



Lightning protection.



When lightning protection systems are installed, the installation, inspection, and maintenance shall be in accordance
with the National Fire Protection Association, 

Lightning Protection Code,


 at a minimum.





 184.162



Static electricity and grounding.



(a) Detailed discussions of the hazards of static electricity and ways of reducing it are published by the National
Fire Protection Association, Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., the United States Department of Commerce, and
the Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior. Where static spark discharge may be hazardous, NFPA Standard
No. 77,
 

Static Electricity, 

shall apply except as otherwise specified herein.





(b) Grounding of equipment. Bonding straps shall bridge contact points where oil, paint, or rust could disrupt electrical
continuity. Permanent equipment in contact with conductive floors or tabletops is not considered adequately grounded.
Static grounds shall not be made to gas, steam, or air lines, dry pipe sprinkler systems, or air terminals of lightning
protection systems. They may be made to water pipes, ground cones, buried copper plates, driven ground rods, or to
down-conductors of lightning protection systems. All grounds shall be interconnected if a structure is equipped
with a lightning protection system. Metallic bonding and grounding cables, straps, or clamps shall be compatible
with the explosives being processed.

(c) Belts. Conductive belting shall be used wherever static is a hazard. Such belting shall have a resistance to ground
not exceeding 600,000 ohms. Static combs shall not be used to drain off static generated from belting or pulleys used
in the presence of hazardous concentrations of explosives dust or flammable vapors.

(d) Testing equipment grounds. Grounding systems shall be tested for electrical resistance and continuity when
installation has been completed and, in the case of active equipment, at locally determined intervals. The ground
systems of equipment inactive longer than 1 month shall be tested for resistance and continuity before reactivation.
All exposed explosive or hazardous materials shall be removed before testing. All test records should be kept. In
ground-resistance testing, equipment should be considered as a unit. All conductive parts of equipment shall be
grounded so that resistance does not exceed 25 ohms, unless 10 ohms is required for lightning protection. To ensure
compliance with ohmic requirements, resistance of the belting is to be excluded in measuring the total resistance
to ground for belt-drive machinery. The rate of static generation should be considered before changes in grounding
systems are made.

(e) Conductive floors. Conductive floors and conductive shoes shall be used for grounding personnel at operations
with exposed explosives with electrostatic sensitivity of 0.1 joule or less, such as primer, initiator, detonator,
igniter, tracer, and incendiary mixtures. Materials sensitive to static sparks, easily ignited or detonated, include
lead styphnate, lead azide, mercury fulminate, tetrazene, diazodinitrophenol, potassium chlorate-lead styphanate
mixtures, igniter compositions, grade B magnesium powder, and exposed layers of black powder dust. Dust from solid
propellants can be ignited from spark energy, making conductive floors and shoes necessary where such dust is present.
Air and dust mixtures of ammonium picrate, tetryl, tetrytol, and solid propellants are also sensitive to static electricity
discharge. Many flammable liquids and air mixtures tested (ethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, acetone,
and gasoline) can be ignited by human static discharge. Therefore, areas where personnel might come into contact
with the kinds of explosives or mixtures enumerated above shall be equipped with conductive floors, except when the
hazards of dust/air or flammable vapor/air mixtures are eliminated by adequate housekeeping, dust collection,
ventilation, or solvent recovery methods.

(1) Conductive floors are also required when operations involve the following:

(i) Exposed electro-explosive devices such as squibs, detonators, primers, etc.

(ii) Electrically initiated items, such as rockets, with exposed circuitry.

(iii) Hazardous materials that could be ignited by human static discharge.

(2) When a hazard remains localized, conductive floors and footwear are not required throughout an entire building
or room. In such cases, conductive mats or runners may be used. These mats and runners shall meet all the specifications
and test requirements that apply to conductive floors.

(f) Conductive floor specifications. Conductive floors, made of nonsparking materials such as lead, conductive
rubber, or conductive flooring compositions, shall meet the following requirements:

(1) The flooring and its grounding system shall provide for electrical resistance not to exceed 1 million ohms.

(2) The surface of the installed floor shall be free from cracks and reasonably smooth, and the material shall not slough
off, wrinkle, or buckle under operating conditions. Conductive tiles are not recommended for areas where explosives
dust can cause contamination, because the large number of joints, and the tendency of tiles to loosen, create areas
where explosives dust can lodge, not amenable to normal cleanup procedures. Where conductive floors and shoes are
required, the resistance of conductive shoes on a person plus the resistance of floor to ground shall not exceed 1 million
ohms total. Tabletops used with exposed explosives or dusts should be covered with a properly grounded conductive
material meeting the same requirements as those for the flooring. The conductive floors shall be compatible with
the particular materials to be processed.

(g) Initial tests of conductive floors shall be followed by others at least semiannually. The test results shall be
permanently recorded. Testing shall proceed only when the room is free from exposed explosives and flammable gas
mixtures.

(1) The resistance of the floor shall be more than 5,000 ohms in areas with 110 volts service and 10,000 ohms in areas
with 220 volts service, and less than 1 million ohms in all areas as measured between a permanent ground connection
and an electrode placed at any point on the floor and also as measured between two electrodes placed 3 feet apart at any
points on the floor. Measurements shall be made at five or more locations in each room and at least two of the points shall
be heavily trafficked areas. If the resistance during a measurement changes appreciably with time, the value observed
after the voltage has been applied for about 5 seconds shall be considered to be the measured value. These resistance
values do not apply to metallic floors.

(2) The operation and maintenance of test instruments shall be entrusted to competent personnel.

(h) Humidification. Humidification that maintains relative humidity above 60 percent effectively prevents static
electricity accumulations and subsequent discharges. This technique involves pre-operational checks and regular
monitoring of the humidity levels throughout the day. It cannot be used with metallic powders, some pyrotechnical
mixtures, and other materials susceptible to spontaneous ignition in air with 60 percent relative humidity.

(i) Ionization. Ionization is electrical neutralization and serves as an effective method of removing static charges
from certain processes and operations. Methods of application can be found in NFPA Standard 77, 

Static Electricity.

(j) Neither ionization or humidification may be substituted for conductive floors (where required).

Subpart M_Safety Requirements for Specific Explosive Materials and Operations



 184.164

General.




This subpart provides the minimum safety requirements necessary for the prevention of mishaps involving specific
explosives materials and operations that, unless properly controlled, make casualties to personnel, material,
equipment, and facilities highly probable. They apply to similar operations and equipment, specifically addressed
or not. These requirements, to be used as a basis for developing local program requirements, are in no way comprehensive.
The contractor is responsible for analyzing each operation and developing procedures to control or eliminate actual
or potential hazards.



 184.165

Properties of explosives.




Knowledge of properties of specific types of explosives is critical to the establishment of proper hazard controls.


(a) Properties of initiating explosives. 

Initiating explosives include lead azide, mercury fulminate, lead styphnate, and tetracene. They manifest extreme
sensitivity to friction, heat and impact. When involved in a fire, they can be expected to detonate without burning.
In storage, initiating explosives shall be kept wet with water or water/alcohol mixtures. Every effort shall be made
to prevent the liquid from freezing; frozen explosives material shall not be handled. Emphasis shall be placed upon
cleanliness and general housekeeping since contamination of these explosives with foreign, particularly gritty,
material markedly increases their sensitivity. Water used for storage shall be free of bacteria-forming impurities
which could react to form gases. Lead azide shall not be allowed contact with copper, zinc, or alloys containing any
concentration of such metals because of the likely formation of other azides that are more sensitive than the original
lead azide. Likewise, mercury fulminate shall not be allowed contact with aluminum, magnesium, zinc, brass, or bronze.


(b) 

Properties of boostering explosives. 

Explosives used for this purpose include tetryl, RDX, PETN, and RDX with added ingredients. These explosives have
sensitivities between initiating explosives and those of explosives used as bursting charges such as TNT. They may
be ignited by heat, friction, or impact and may detonate when burned in large quantities or at too great a depth. Some
of these materials are toxic when taken internally or by skin contact and special precautions are necessary to protect
personnel. Local exhaust ventilation, enclosed process systems, automatic handling systems, etc., should be used
to minimize dust in the employee's breathing zone.


(c) 

Properties of bursting explosives. 

Bursting explosives include explosive D (ammonium picrate), amatol, picric acid, TNT, tritonal, RDX compositions,
HMX compositions, torpex, DBX, and HBX. In general, these materials are less sensitive than initiating or boostering
explosives. Alkaline cleaning agents or other alkaline products should not be permitted in buildings where large
quantities of these explosives are handled. Amatol forms sensitive compounds with copper and brass. Where explosive
D is processed, lead fusible links and solder-type sprinkler heads should not be used. DBX is an aluminized explosive
that is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts with metals in the same manner as amatol. HBX is also an aluminized explosive
that outgasses when exposed to water and may create internal pressure when loaded into ammunition. HMX compositions
usually result in a very powerful explosive with a high degree of thermal stability. Pentolite tends to separate into
its ingredients (PETN and TNT) and should, therefore, be handled as carefully as PETN. Picratol is a mixture of TNT
and explosive D; the precautions necessary when handling either shall be observed. Picric acid is highly acidic,
corrosive, and toxic; it shall be isolated from lead and lead compounds. Tetrytol is a mixture of tetryl and TNT which
is stable in storage but exudes at 149 
 F. Dry tetrytol slightly corrodes magnesium and aluminum alloys, and wet tetrytol slightly corrodes a copper,
brass, aluminum, magnesium, mild steel, and cadmium-plated mild steel. TNT is stable and does not form sensitive
compounds with metals. It shall, however, form sensitive compounds in the presence of alkalies. It also exhibits
well-recognized toxic properties. Torpex is an aluminized explosive used mainly in underwater ordnance. Non-hygroscopic
and noncorrosive, it is stable in storage but may outgas (hydrogen) and produce internal pressure when loaded into
ammunition. Tritonal is a mixture of TNT and aluminum powder and is more sensitive to impact than TNT. Tritonal shall
not be exposed to water. Plastic bonded explosives are conventional high explosives with plastic binders such as
polystyrene, viton, estane, etc. Their sensitivity varies with the composition. The series most frequently encountered
are identified by prefix PBX or LX and a number.


(d) 

Properties of other explosives. 

Other military explosives frequently encountered include black powder and nitroglycerin. Black powder is a mixture
of potassium or sodium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur, highly sensitive to friction, heat, and impact. It deteriorates
rapidly on absorption of moisture but retains its explosive properties indefinitely if kept dry. Nitroglycerin's
extreme sensitivity to impact and friction is such that it is manufactured only as needed. Frozen nitroglycerin,
while less sensitive than liquid, may undergo internal changes upon thawing and, if enough heat is generated, may
detonate.


(e) 

Research of additional properties. 

The foregoing does not comprehensively catalog explosives and properties, but indicates how significantly they
can differ. For this reason, it is imperative that contractors investigate pertinent properties before handling
these or other explosive materials. Contractors are responsible for understanding all aspects of ammunition and
explosives needed to fulfill contractual obligations.



 184.166

Handling low-energy initiators.




Typical precautions, such as shielding and safety glasses, shall be supplemented by the following measures, as appropriate,
when manufacturing, processing, using, or testing low-energy initiators (initiated by 0.1 joule of energy or less).


(a) All metal parts of equipment shall be electrically bonded together and grounded.


(b) Personnel shall wear clothing that prevents generation of static electricity. Conductive shoes shall be tested
with a resistance meter before an operator enters an area where low-energy initiators are being processed.


(c) When low-energy initiators are being handled, personnel shall be directly grounded by wrist straps. The resistance
reading, taken once daily when the operator is wearing the strap, shall be between 250,000 and one million ohms when
measured from opposite hand to ground. Special contact creams may be used to decrease the resistance to the required
value.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) Glass, acrylic, or polycarbonate materials required for transparent shielding shall be periodically coated
with an anti-static material to prevent buildup of static electricity.

(e) The sounding of a static electricity alarm, installed with the setting best able to provide ample warning, signals
that work shall stop until the problem has been located and corrective action taken.

(f) Work shall not start in air-conditioned areas until relative humidity and temperature have been checked (see
 184.162(h)).

(g) No metal surface subjected to rubbing or friction shall be painted. If a lubricant is necessary, it should be of
a composition that shall not increase the metal's surface resistance above 25 ohms.

(h) Work on or with initiators shall be performed in areas equipped with conductive floors and table tops. Exceptions
may be made with the initiators are in their original packaging, or are in part of a finished metallic end item affording
them complete protection from electromagnetic or electrostatic energy.

(i) Work shall not be done in the vicinity of actual or potential electromagnetic or electrostatic fields. Sources
of static electricity and electromagnetic energy include radio transmission, electrical storms, transformer
stations, high voltage transmission lines, improperly grounded electric circuitry, rotating equipment, belts,
etc. Adequate lightning protection and grounding and adequate resistances for fixed sources of energy shall be established
for locations with low-energy initiator operations. These shall be shielded to afford protection against local
mobile radio transmission.

(j) Electrical equipment shall be located out of the range of an operator working with a low-energy initiator. With
soldering irons, it may be advisable to ground and limit energy to levels below initiating thresholds.

(k) When not part of an end item or end item subassembly, initiators shall be transported only when packed according
to the latest packing specifications for low-energy initiators.



 184.167 

Laboratory operations.



(a) Research and development laboratories and testing facilities constitute a separate category involving guidance,
restrictions, and relief from certain requirements prescribed in this part.

(b) Each operation at facilities designed for blast and fragment confinement shall be reviewed to ensure that the
explosives limits are within the laboratory or test area capability. Explosives limits and safe separation distances
shall be adjusted as the capability to confine fragment and blast decreases.

(c) A total-confinement facility shall be inspected after a detonation to ensure structural integrity, possibly
reducing the explosives limits to prevent future blasts from exceeding the retention capability.

(d) Each proposed program for the laboratory or test facility shall be reviewed to determine all potential hazards.
Considerations shall include:

(1) Structural limitations of the facility.

(2) Remote control viewing and operating equipment, if required.

(3) Special safety precautions for personnel elsewhere in the building.

(4) Safe separation distances.

(5) Required deviations from other sections of this part.

(6) SOPs, which shall at a minimum include the following:

(i) Protective clothing.

(ii) Warning signals.

(iii) Fire and other emergency procedures.

(iv) Special testing of equipment needed before operations (such as stray voltage and calibration checks).

(v) Removal of all explosives not needed for the operation.

(vi) Arrangements for overnight storage of necessary explosives.

(vii) Inspection and cleanup procedures after a test or detonation.

<TEXT>
 

(e) Laboratories shall use no more explosives than absolutely required for a given operation. Particularly hazardous
laboratory operations involving new or relatively unknown explosives should be done by remote control. Operational
shields shall be used in these operations and in new or untested applications of explosives. 

(f) When laboratories and testing facilities are shielded properly to prevent the release of fragments, the minimum
incremental safe separation distances of Appendices A and B to this subpart shall apply to operations, facilities,
and personnel. 

(g) If the proposed storage facilities will confine the blast and fragments, or if the incremental safe separation
distances are as indicated in  184.167(f), up to 15 pounds of explosives, may be stored without consideration
of storage compatibility. However, the operation shall be reviewed, as stated in  184.167(d). 



 184.168 


Electrical testing of ammunition and ammunition components. 



(a) 

Type of test equipment

. Electrical and electronics test equipment should use the weakest possible power source. Batteries shall be preferred
to 110-volt power sources. No Power source should be capable of initiating the explosives item being tested. When
exceptions shall be made because more power is needed, steps shall be taken to prevent delivery of power to the explosives
item in quantities sufficient to initiate. Safeguards shall be provided against the possibility of human error.


(b) 

Layout of test equipment

. Test equipment shall be placed in hazardous atmospheres only when absolutely necessary. Unless the test equipment
is, under all circumstances, incapable of initiating the test item, operational shields are required for personnel
protection. The most reliable way of attaining and retaining this initiation incapability is by protecting the test
equipment, including leads, from electromagnetic induction and radiation fields and electrostatic energy, and
by providing the test equipment with a weak power source. 

(c) 

Use of test equipment

. Test equipment shall be used only as intended by original design. The equipment shall be maintained by qualified
personnel, with operator adjustments limited to those required for testing. 



 184.169 


Heat-conditioning of explosives and ammunition. 



(a) All ovens, conditioning chambers, dry houses, and similar devices and facilities shall be provided with dual
independent fail-safe heat controls. For devices or facilities heated by steam only, the requirement for dual heat
controls shall be satisfied if the steam pressure is controlled by a reducing valve (maximum pressure of 5 psi, unless
otherwise authorized) on the main building steam supply, and a thermostat. 

(b) Heat-conditioning devices shall be able to discharge overpressure from an internal explosion. Barriers or catching
devices shall restrain blowout panels, doors, and other venting apparatus, to prevent excessive displacement during
an accidental explosion. 

(c) Heat-conditioning devices shall be vented to permit any gases produced to escape. 

(d) Steam should be used to heat conditioning devices; when electric heating elements are unavoidable, they shall
be located where there is no possibility of contact with explosives or flammable materials. 

(e) The blades of a fan in a heat-conditioning device shall be of non-sparking material; its electric motor shall be
installed externally. The air shall not recirculate if the heating surfaces exceed 228
 F or if the air contains materials that could collect on the heating coils. 

(f) Electrical equipment and fixtures in or on a heat-conditioning device used for explosives or flammable material
shall be approved for use in the hazardous atmosphere in question. 

(g) The interior of a heat-conditioning device shall be free of crevices, openings, and other protuberances not easily
cleaned, where dust or flammable material could lodge. 

(h) All noncurrent-carrying metal parts of a heat-conditioning device shall be interconnected and electronically
grounded. 

(i) Heat-conditioning devices should be installed in isolated locations, set up to give personnel maximum protection
from the effects of an incident. When warranted, operational shields and other personnel protection measures shall
be used. 

(j) Safe separation distances or protective construction shall ensure against an explosives incident in one heat
conditioning device from propagating to others. No hazardous materials shall be placed in a room or cubicle containing
a heat-conditioning device, unless it can be shown that an accident in the conditioning device would not involve the
other materials. 

(k) Heat-conditioning device operating procedures require: 

(1) Limiting the explosive materials in the device to the type and quantity authorized for the specific device. 

(2) Familiarity with the critical parameters of explosives compositions before processing in a heat-conditioning
device. The device shall not exceed limits established for the hazardous composition being conditioned. 

(3) Checking heat-conditioning device temperatures at specified intervals during operation. 

(4) Cleaning the conditioning devices, ducts, vacuum lines, and other parts of the equipment subject to contamination
by hazardous materials, before introducing a different item or composition for conditioning. 



 184.170 


Spray painting. 



(a) Loaded ammunition shall not be electrostatically spray painted. 

(b) Water wash or dry filter-type spray booths shall be used for loaded ammunition.

(c) Controls for ventilating fan motors for spray painting booths shall be interlocked with the controls for the paint
sprayer. With this arrangement, failure of the ventilating system will shut off power to the paint sprayer.

(d) High-voltage electrically powered paint-spraying equipment shall be installed in accordance with the requirements
of National Fire Protection Association, Standard No. 33,
 

Static Electricity,

 as applicable.





(e) Conventional equipment used for spray painting in standard spray booths shall meet the requirements of NFPA Standard
No. 33. The nozzles of all spray guns shall be electrically grounded because of the static electricity generated.



 184.171

 Drying freshly painted loaded ammunition.



Ovens used in drying loaded ammunition shall comply with the National Fire Codes. Other requirements include the
following:

(a) Automatic thermostatic controls shall regulate temperatures once they reach a maximum determined by the ammunition
and explosives involved. It is recommended that temperatures not exceed 170 
 F.

(b) Automatic internal sprinkler systems shall equip each oven and shall conform with NFPA Standard No. 13,
 

Installation of Sprinkler Systems.

 Automatic operation of the system may be accomplished by approved electrical heat-actuated devices, installed
as required for NEC-defined class I, division 1, group D, hazardous locations. Refer to NFPA Standard No. 70, 

National Electric Code.







(c) Hot air or other means may supply heat, provided ammunition and explosives are kept from contact with coils, radiators,
and heating elements.

(d) In case of power failure, the heat supply for any conveyor system shall automatically stop.

(e) Electric drying units that are not approved for use in class I hazardous locations should be designed so that solvent
vapor concentration in the oven is kept below 25 percent of its lower explosive limit.



 184.172

 Rework, disassembly, renovation, and maintenance.



(a) Rework and disassembly operations shall not usually be conducted with other inert or explosives operations.
However, when concurrent scheduling cannot be avoided, operations shall be sufficiently distanced from one another
to protect adjacent personnel and equipment, and prevent propagation to adjacent explosives. Such separation may
be accomplished with Q/D, operational shielding, or the remote control of operations.

(b) The operator and all other personnel shall be fully protected during rework and disassembly operations known
or expected to use force exceeding assembly specifications.

(c) If A&E items have been assembled normally, the same equipment, tools, methods, and applied forces may be used
to disassemble them. In such cases, only that personnel protection required during the assembly operations is also
required during the rework or disassembly operations. Care shall be taken, however, to ascertain that the assembly
was normal and that the surfaces to be separated are not corroded and not sealed with metallic applicants.

(d) When renovation or maintenance not adequately addressed in the contract is required, the contractor shall request
specific safety guidance through contract channels.



 184.173

 Munitions loading and associated operations.



(a) 

Screening and blending high explosives.

 Bulk high explosives intended for processing shall be screened or visually inspected and passed over a magnetic separator
to detect extraneous material for removal. Screening equipment shall not subject explosives to pinching, friction,
or impact. Explosives screening units without exhaust ventilation shall be thoroughly cleaned as often as necessary
and after every shift, to prevent hazardous accumulations of explosives dusts.

(b) 

Screening and blending initiating explosives.

 Suitable operational shields shall be provided for screening and blending operations involving initiating explosives,
or operators shall be located at intraline distance from screening and blending facilities.

(c) 

Explosives melting.

 (1) Temperatures used for melting explosives and keeping explosives molten should not exceed 228 
 F. However, steam pressures up to 15 psi (250 
 F) may be used to melt composition B and similar binary explosives and to maintain a molten state.

(2) Melt unit valves and melt mix draw-off or other lines carrying molten explosives shall provide against friction
or impact capable of initiating the explosives. Diaphragm-type valves should be disassembled and inspected regularly.
Damaged or old diaphragms shall be replaced so no cracks allowing metal-to-metal contact can develop. Draw-off lines
should be constructed to prevent exposure of threads, fastening screws, and bolts, both outside and between the flanges.
A sealing compound should be used to prevent explosives seepage or vapor condensation on the contacting surfaces
of the bolts, flanges, screws, and nuts. Melt mix kettle draw-off pipes should be electrically connected to items
being filled during draw-off operations. Items shall be individually grounded unless tests show that grounding
through contact surface is adequate.

(3) Wet-type collectors effectively remove dust and vapors from exhausted air, and are recommended for melt mix exhausting
systems. Water in the wet collector will not be recirculated unless the system removes hazardous suspensions. Water
retaining such explosives shall be discharged to a sump designed to keep such explosives wet. The exhaust and collecting
equipment shall be regularly inspected and flushed of explosives accumulations. When protective construction
prevents propagation of a detonation between melt kettles, a complete dust and vapor collection system shall equip
each kettle.

(d) 

Agitation.

 Agitation nitrators, washers, and other machines which, because of the hazard of the process and the possibility
of the process material decomposing, are equipped with mechanical agitators, shall have at least two means of agitation,
each operating from an independent power source to maintain agitation if one fails.

(e) 

Machining of explosives.

 (1) High explosives, cased or uncased, that may be machined without special personnel protection and without coolant,
if no metal-to-metal contact is involved, include: Amatol, Octol, TNT, composition B, explosive D, and RDX/TNT compositions
containing 60 percent or less RDX.

(2) High explosives, cased or uncased, that may be machined without special personnel protection provided a coolant
is directed on the tool and explosives at their point of contact and no metal-to-metal contact is involved, include:
baratols, pentolite (50-50 and 10-90), tetrytol, and cyclotols (composition B less than 60-40;
that is, 70-30).

(3) When essential, other high explosives may be machined by remote control, with the operator protected by a suitable
operational shield; however, initiating explosives should not be machined if desired shapes or sizes can be obtained
by other means, such as forming.

(4) When an unprotected operator is involved in drilling, only a single drill, with a diameter greater than 1/4 inch,
shall be used.

(5) Machining of cased explosives is permitted in an operation requiring removal of metal before or after tool contact
with the explosives filler, provided that operators are protected by operational shields and perform it by remote
control.

(6) Where wet machining is to be performed, automatic interlocking devices shall prevent machining from starting
until coolant is flowing. These controls shall also be capable of stopping the machining if the coolant flow is interrupted.
When coolant flow must stop for adjustment of machining tools, positive means shall be devised to ensure that flow
of coolant is restored and all automatic control devices are operating before machining can resume.

(7) The lineal and rotational speeds of tools used for the machining of explosives shall be maintained at the minimum
necessary to perform the operation safely and efficiently. These shall not exceed 210 linear feet per minute nor 525
revolutions per minute. The rate of feed should likewise be the lowest consistent with safety and efficiency, based
on the explosive materials being machined.

(8) Pneumatically or hydraulically driven machine tools are preferred for all machining operations on high explosives.
Control mechanisms for hydraulic and pneumatic equipment shall prevent unauthorized personnel from tampering
with speeds.

(9) In all machining operations on cased or uncased high explosives, procedures during tool adjustments shall prevent
contact between moving parts of the machining equipment and metallic parts of the case or holding fixtures.

(10) Machining tools shall be compatible with the explosives being processed. Dull or damaged tools shall not be used
for machining high explosives.

(11) The explosives products resulting from machining operations shall be removed by an exhaust system meeting NEC
requirements, or by immersion in a stream of water flowing away from the operation. Refer to NFPA Standard No. 70.

(12) Machining of explosives of questionable quality during an ammunition and explosives demilitarization process
shall be accomplished by remote control, with operators protected by operational shields.

(f) 

Assembly and crimping of complete rounds.

 Each assembly and crimping operation shall be separated from other operations by structures or shielding sufficient
to contain any fragments produced.

(g) 

Pressing explosives.

 (1) Each pelleting operation involving black powder, tetryl, TNT, or other explosives of similar sensitivity; and
each operation involving the pressing or reconsolidating of explosives, shall be conducted in a separate room or
cubicle having walls of sufficient strength to withstand an explosion of all explosives present.

(2) Pressing or reconsolidating explosives in small caliber rounds, tracer bodies, tetryl lead-ins, detonators,
and similar items shall be performed on machines having consolidating stations designed to preclude propagation
between stations and provide adequate operator protection. Operators shall be behind tested protective barriers
during such operations.

(3) Punches and dies shall be in matched sets that have passed inspection. All punches and dies used in explosives pressing
operations shall undergo a rigid test, such as a magnaflux or X-ray, before use and regularly thereafter. In a pelleting
press, punches and dies shall be replaced with matched sets checked and calibrated by a control laboratory.

(h) 

Protection of primers.

 Equipment, transportation, and operations shall be designed to protect loose primers or primers in components from
accidental impact or pressure. When feasible, a protecting cap shall cover the primer.

(i) 

Explosives washout and flashing facilities.

 When washout operations are placed in operating buildings or other locations, they shall be separated from other
operations by operational shields or proper distances. Ammunition items subjected to washout operations shall
be subsequently inspected to ensure against residual explosives contamination. When contamination is confirmed,
decontamination shall precede disposal. Decontamination of ammunition items by flashing (exposure to flame) shall
be performed at the explosives destruction (burning) area or in approved incinerators.

(j) 

Heat sealing equipment.

 Electric heat sealing machines should be separated from other operations. Temperature limits for heat sealing equipment
shall be established, with a safety factor below the ignition temperature of explosives, propellants, or pyrotechnics
involved.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(k) 

Rebowling operations. 

Rebowling operations involving lead azide and primer mixes shall be performed by remote control, with the operator
protected by an operational shield.

(l) 

Thread cleaning. 

(1) Nonferrous picks shall be used for thread cleaning. Stainless steel brushes may be used to clean threads of explosives-loaded
projectiles if a fuze seat liner separates the thread cleaning operation from the explosive charge. Operators do
not need operational shields; however, thread cleaning operations should be separated from unrelated operations.

(2) Power-actuated thread-chasing tools may be used to clean loaded projectiles when threads are imperfect because
of previously applied sealers, provided the operation is performed within a separate cubicle and by remote control.
Hand-operated thread-chasing tools may be used when no explosives are present in the threads.

(3) Neither correcting cross threads nor thread cutting shall be performed on projectiles containing explosives.
Straightening crossed threads is considered thread cutting.

(m) 

Profile and alignment gaging operations. 

(1) Operational shields shall enclose each profile and alignment gaging operation, excluding small arms ammunition,
to protect adjacent operations. The layout of the equipment and the operational procedures shall be developed to
minimize personnel injury and property damage in case of accident.

(2) During chamber gaging of high caliber fixed ammunition, the gage should be pointed toward a dividing wall or other
barrier and the round inserted and removed by the same operator. In no case shall the round be left in the gage. Rounds
of mortar ammunition shall be gaged before attaching propellant increments and, unless prohibited by the design
characteristics, before assembly of the ignition system.

Subpart N_Testing Requirements



 184.175

Program requirements.



The contractor is responsible for the safety of testing programs and shall designate an individual to be responsible
for each program. Technical information about the ammunition items, explosives, and weapon systems shall be considered
so that the required safety measures may be engineered into the test plans.



 184.176

Operating precautions.



Special safety precautions to be considered during SOP development:

(a) Protection for percussion elements, i.e., primers, caps, etc., shall be provided in the design of equipment,
transportation, and operations to protect them from accidental initiation.

(b) Cartridges and projectiles larger than 60mm, when hand carried, shall be handled one at a time.

(c) Fuzed projectiles shall not be handled by the fuzes alone.

(d) Powder charges shall be transported in closed containers to prevent accidental ignition.

(e) Only trained personnel shall perform operations on explosives-loaded ammunition components.

(f) No work, adjustment, or observation should be permitted on a weapon system that is loaded and ready for firing,
except to check and adjust azimuth and elevation. In no case shall a lanyard be attached until the piece is ready to be
fired. No one shall step over the lanyard once it is attached. On weapons equipped with safety locks, the lock may be
released after the lanyard has been attached. In the case of small arms, the bolt shall be kept open at all times except
where actually firing.

(g) Ammunition and explosives material, except inert components, shall not be delivered to machine shops or other
locations not specifically designated for this work or modification without the approval by responsible contractor
authority.

(h) The premature or improper mixing of fuels and oxidizers, as associated with liquid propellants, shall be avoided.
This applies particularly at test stands and test facilities when transferring liquid propellants.

(i) Remote control of mechanical devices shall replace manual activation whenever possible.

(j) Guns operated by remote control shall be equipped with cease fire devices for halting operations when a hazardous
condition occurs. These devices shall be independent of the regular controls so operations can be stopped if the regular
controls should fail.



 184.177

Test hazards.



(a) Inert-loaded or minimum-charged ammunition should be used in lieu of explosives-loaded items when the test objectives
are not affected.

(b) When temperature-conditioning rooms or boxes are utilized, the following shall apply:

(1) Firings from temperature-controlled facilities shall be on an azimuth approved by the contractor's responsible
representative. No weapon shall be fired in an enclosed area unless the muzzle is located outside the port opening.
Destruction tests, excess pressure tests, and tests of classes of guns known to be unsafe (where the possibility of
breech failures exists) shall be conducted with portable shields or equivalents placed on each side of the breech
and with a protective plate to the rear of the mount, forming a barrier.

(2) All equipment used in the temperature conditioning of explosives shall comply with Q/D requirements, unless
in explosives buildings.

(3) Hot temperature conditioning equipment shall have dual, independent, automatic controls to prevent the desired
testing temperature from being exceeded. Controls shall be designed to fail in the off position.

(c) No firing shall be permitted unless people in the area are under adequate cover.



 184.178

Test clearance.

</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00144 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Clearance, to be obtained before performing each test, shall be granted only by responsible contractor personnel
with jurisdiction in the danger area where the test is to be performed. When reburied, air space clearances shall be
obtained in accordance with local and

 Federal Aviation Administration Handbook


 requirements.




(b) The contractor personnel responsible for the test areas where the weapon system is located shall obtain the necessary
coordination and clearance from their counterparts when a test may encroach upon other danger areas.
(c) To ensure that danger areas are clear of personnel and ships, vessels, and other craft, clearance for impact and
airburst danger areas shall be obtained before firing on or over water.


 184.179 

Warning and communication systems.


A warming system shall be established for each testing program, comprising some combination of flags, lights, and
sound signals. If personnel authorized to enter a test area are not familiar with the system, they shall be escorted
by knowledgeable personnel. Test areas should be equipped with adequate communication facilities, such as telephone
and radio.


 184.180 

Specific items for test.


The safety requirements for testing specific items of ammunition vary according to the type of ammunition, design
features, explosives characteristics, test facilities, climate and terrain environment, and other related factors.
These factors shall be considered and specific test criteria included in the test plan.
(a) 

Recoilless weapons.

 (1) All personnel shall be protected against breech blast and malfunction of the round. The danger area in open range
firing shall extend to the rear of the weapon: 300 feet for calibers up to and including 75mm and 450 feet for all others.
The danger zone may be reduced only when effective barricades confine the blast effect.
(2) The safety switch on a rifle shall not be advanced to the firing position until the breechblock is closed and all
preparations for firing are completed.
(3) Because the blast from salvo firing can obscure a misfire, ripple firing is preferred. When salvo firing cannot
be avoided, a wait of at least 2 minutes shall precede the opening of any breechblock after a one-volley salvo.
(4) Unburned propellant from any test firing shall not accumulate in the surrounding area. Safe methods shall be developed
for cleanup, decontamination, and disposal.
(b) 

Pyrotechnics.

 Shielded enclosures should be used when testing pyrotechnic items inside a building. Enclosures should be vented
to the outside, preferably through the roof, to prevent exposure of personnel to flame, toxic gases, and heat, and
to prevent rupture of the enclosures.
(c) 

Static tests of propellant motors and engines.

 Static test stands are used for solid propellant motors and liquid propellant engines in any combinations. Fire,
blast, and fragments shall be considered in establishing safe distances. Static test stands shall be designed to
restrain motors and engines undergoing tests.


 184.181

Malfunctions.


For the purposes of this part, malfunction applies to the ammunition and the weapon systems or pieces involved.
(a) 

Cook-off.

 Automatic function, or cook-off, of a round left in a hot gun for an extended period is possible in tests involving a
high rate of fire, particularly with machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. This possibility largely depends upon
the gun's rate of heat dissipation. High air temperature, low wind velocity, low elevation of the gun, and confinement
of the gun are also factors. To prevent cook-off, the barrel of the empty gun shall be frequently cooled. If a round is
retained or remains in a hot gun with the breech closed, people in the vicinity shall remain under cover until the gun
has cooled. If a round jams and the breech fails to close, personnel in the danger zone shall take cover and remain there
until the gun has cooled.
(1) Adequate cooling periods are:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00145 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The danger zone for personnel in the vicinity of the gun firing explosive ammunition shall be: 




(3) The danger zone down range shall be maintained as for actual firing until the danger of cook-off has passed.

(b) 

Premature burst.

 If a premature burst occurs, the test shall be suspended or the lateral limits of the danger zone increased in accordance
with prescribed safety distances before the test continues. The increased lateral limits shall be maintained until
the particular test is completed.

(c) 

Misfire.

 After a misfire, all persons shall stand clear of the breech, in case the round functions and the gun recoils. All electrical
connections that could cause firing of the gun shall be disconnected. The appropriate danger zone for the actual firing
shall be maintained during the waiting period, until the danger of cook-off has passed. The removed round shall be
immediately placed where subsequent detonation could not cause injury or damage. In the case of misfires involving
small-caliber rockets and small-arms ammunition, the rounds should be immersed in water (unless the results of prior
analyses or investigations preclude such practice). Misfire procedures shall be established to include attempts
to refire weapons, waiting periods, cooling, operational precautions, and disposition of ammunition. Once these
procedures have been carried out, the firing pin and mechanism shall be checked, and the barrel of the gun examined
to ensure that it is clear; then firing may resume. Appendices A through H of this subpart provide general guidance
on what to do when misfires occur.

(d) 

Hangfire. 

A hangfire is a delayed firing occurring as a short time lag between the striking of the firing pin on the primer and the
ignition of the primer, igniter, or propellant. All hangfires shall be immediately reported to responsible personnel.
This is particularly important for early detection of trends. In these cases, the firing of a particular lot of ammunition
shall be suspended unless responsible authorities advise differently.



 184.182 

Ammunition and dud recovery.



Open-air test area recovery requirements follow:

(a) 

Making. 

When projectiles or bombs with live fuzes, live boosters, or high explosive are fired for impact on, or burst over,
a recovery field, observers stationed in a protected place shall record the location of duds and exploded rounds.
Before leaving a recovery field or impact area, personnel in charge of cleaning the fields shall mark duds and exploded
rounds with the appropriate color-coded flag or device. Where locations cannot be marked, fields shall be posted
with warning signs and entry shall be restricted.

<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) 

Policing.

 Personnel shall be prohibited from touching or in any way disturbing dud ammunition. Unfuzed or inert-fuzed live
ammunition or ammunition components that have failed to function during a test shall be recovered only in accordance
with the SOP developed by the contractor.
(c) 

Destruction.

 All types of ammunition and explosives shall be disposed of in accordance with this part, contract requirements,
or instructions provided by the contracting officer.


 184.183

Personnel shelters.


(a) 

General.

 Responsible personnel shall require all within the danger zone to take cover during tests where fragmentation might
occur. The person charged with attaching the lanyard shall be the last to leave the gun emplacement, and shall advise
the responsible person that all personnel are clear before any firing.
(b) 

Portable bombproofs for fire observation.

 All portable bombproofs used for fire observation shall be on the gun side of the impact point; no closer than 200 yards
from the impact point; and in the sectors between compass headings 45 and 80 degrees and between 280 and 315 degrees
(compass centered on impact point with 0 and 360 degrees at the firing point). When the impact will result in fragmentation,
the bombproof should be located behind the firing line in the sectors between compass headings 100 and 135 degrees
and between 225 and 260 degrees (compass centered on firing point with 0 and 360 degrees at the impact point). It should
be so oriented with respect to the impact that no wall surface is presented to fragmentation at an angle greater than
60 degrees. This can usually be done by centering one intersection of the walls of a square or U type bombproof, or pointing
the apex of a pointed V type, toward the impact point. Under no circumstances shall the orientation expose the rear
of the bombproof to gunfire and fragmentation. Observations from bombproofs shall be indirect, using mirrors, periscopes,
or other suitable devices. Refer to Appendix I to this subpart.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00147 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Ammunition shall not be placed in any gun until it is in firing position and ready to shoot.



(b) Safety devices on gun mounts and ranges shall be kept in operating condition and tested before use. If a malfunction
occurs, test operations shall cease and a report made to the responsible supervisors.





(c) Every weapon removed from a firing position, storage case, or rack; or picked up by any operator, shall be inspected
for the presence of ammunition in the chamber, magazine, or feed mechanism, and for obstruction in the bore.





(d) The chamber, magazine, and feed mechanism of all guns should be open during handling and transportation. When
practicable, a safety block should be used in the chambers of weapons.



(e) Primers of misfired rounds may be hypersensitive; precautions should be taken during their removal from the gun,
handling, and disposal.





(f) Firing on ballistic ranges, expect in function and casualty tests, shall be from fixed rests.




(g) When sand butts are used to stop bullets, a reinforced concrete wall should be constructed at sufficient distance
behind the retaining wall to permit inspection. This is necessary because bullets tend to tunnel through the sand
and penetrate the retaining wall after continued firing. To discover any such penetration, the inner face of the second
wall should be inspected frequently. If terrain effectively protects the rear of the range, no concrete wall is necessary.




(h) Because bullets tend to ricochet from a sand bank, the roofs of enclosed ranges should be protected, to prevent
penetration.



(i) When water traps are used to receive a fired bullet, interlocks shall be provided to prevent firing of the test weapon
if water pressure failure occurs.





(j) Unburnt propellant from any test firing shall not accumulate in the surrounding area. Safe methods shall be developed
for cleanup, decontamination and disposal.



 184.185 

Velocity and pressure tests. 



Special high pressure tests or tests of unknown pressure ammunition shall be performed only when personnel are protected
against injury from gun failures. Operational shields or remote control firing of guns serves this purpose.






 184.186

Primer drop tests.






(a) Cases continuing live primers shall be marked and separated from those containing fired primers.




(b) The collecting tube and areas where primer dust could accumulate shall be regularly inspected and cleaned.

Subpart O_Collection and Destruction Requirements for Ammunition and Explosives



 184.188 

General.



This subpart provides safety requirements for the collection and destruction of ammunition and explosives. At this
writing, the Environmental Protection Agency is developing rules which apply to each contractor beyond the scope
of this part. Explosive safety should not be compromised while meeting environmental considerations.



 184.189 

Protection during disposal operations.



(a) Operational shields and special clothing shall protect personnel in facilities with explosives materials.
Fragmentation hazards require, at a minimum, overhead and frontal protection for personnel. Shelters should be
located at the inhabited building distance appropriate for the quantity and type of materials being detonated. Personnel
shall use such protective measures when destroying explosive materials by detonation and when burning explosive
materials that may detonate. Personnel shall not approach the burning site, but shall wait until the fire is out.

(b) Personnel shall never work alone during disposal and destruction operations. Warning sings or roadblocks shall
restrict the area. One person, available in an emergency, should observe from a safe distance while another performs
the operations.



 184.190 

Collection of ammunition and explosives.



(a) 

Water-soluble materials.

 Enough water should be used in neutralizing ammonium picrate (explosive D), black powder, and other soluble materials
to ensure their complete dissolution. As little material as practicable should be dissolved at one time. Sweeping
floors before washing them down reduces the amount of dissolved material in the wash water. When uncertainty exists
concerning the purity and composition of wash water, experts shall be consulted.

(b) 

Solid wastes.

 Explosive-contaminated solid waste material shall be collected; placed in closed containers; and swiftly removed
to buildings for treatment or holding, or to the burning ground for destruction.

(c) 

Explosives dusts.

 (1) High explosives dusts such as TNT, tetryl, explosive D, composition B, and pentolite should be removed by a vacuum
system. A ``wet collector'' that moistens the dust near the point of intake and keeps it wet until the dust is removed
for disposal is preferred for all but explosive D, which should be collected in a dry system.

(2) More sensitive explosives such as black powder, lead azide, mercury fulminate, tracer, igniter, incendiary
compositions, and pyrotechnic materials may be collected by vacuum, provided they are kept wet close to the point
of intake. Collect each type, representing a different hazard, separately, so that black powder, for example, cannot
mix with lead azide. Provision should be made for releasing any gases that form. The use of vacuum systems for collecting
these more sensitive materials should be confined to operations involving small quantities of explosives, that
is, operations with fuzes, detonators, small-arms ammunition, and black powder igniters. To minimize the fire and
explosion hazard, collection of scrap pyrotechnic, tracer, flare, and similar mixtures in No. 10 mineral motor oil
or equivalent is required. Materials collected in the dry state shall be placed in an oil-containing receptacle available
at each operation throughout the shift. The oil level should be about 1 inch above the level of any pyrotechnic mixture
in the container. Containers of scrap explosive shall be removed from the operating buildings for disposal at least
once per shift. Applicably rated class B firefighting equipment shall be available when oil is used.

(d) 

Design and operation of collection systems.

 (1) Collection systems and chambers shall be designed to prevent pinching thin layers of explosives or explosive
dust between metal parts. Pipes or ducts used to convey dusts require flanged, welded, or rubber connections. Threaded
connections are prohibited. The system shall prevent explosives dusts from accumulating in parts outside the collection
chamber. Pipes or ducts conveying high explosives shall have long radius bends. Systems for propellant powder may
use short radius bends provided they are stainless steel, with polished interior. Vacuum application points should
be kept to a minimum. Each room requiring vacuum collection should have a separate exhaust line to the primary collection
chamber; if this is not possible, no more than two bays shall be serviced by a common header. Wet primary collectors
are preferred. The length of vacuum line from points of application of vacuum to the wet collectors should be short.
A single secondary collector shall service as few primary collectors as possible. Not more than two dry primary collectors
shall be connected to a single secondary collector (wet or dry type). If an operation does not create a dust concentration
potentially posing a severe health hazard, manual operation of the suction hose to remove explosives dust is preferred,
since permanent attachment to the explosive dust-producing machine increases the likelihood of propagation through
the collection system of a detonation at the machine. Manually operated hose connections to explosive dust-producing
machines should not interconnect.

(2) Two collection chambers shall be serially installed ahead of the pump or exhauster to prevent explosives dust
from entering the vacuum producer in a dry vacuum collection system.

(3) Slide valves for vacuum collection systems are permitted; however, there shall be no metal-to-metal contact.
An aluminum slide operating between two ebonite spacer bars or similar, compatible materials will eliminate unacceptable
metal-to-metal contact.

(4) Dry-type portable vacuum collectors, limited to five pounds of explosives, shall be located in a separate cubicle
having substantial dividing walls, or outside the building; never in a bay or cubicle with explosives. Wet-type portable
vacuum collectors may be placed in explosive operating bays or cubicles, provided the quantity of explosives in the
collector is limited in accordance with the requirements of  184.190(e)(1) through (e)(3). For dry collection
of quantities in excess of five pounds or wet collection of quantities in excess of 15 pounds, the provisions of  184.190(e)(1)
through (e)(3) also apply.

(5) The design of wet collectors shall provide for proper immersion of explosives, breaking up air bubbles to release
airborne particles; and for removal of moisture from the air leaving the collector, to prevent moistened particles
of explosives from entering the small piping between the collector and the exhauster or pump.

(6) At lease once every shift, explosives dust shall be removed from the collection chamber to eliminate unnecessary
and hazardous concentrations of explosives. The entire system should be cleaned weekly, with parts dismantled as
necessary.

(7) The entire explosives dust collecting system shall be electrically grounded. The grounding shall be tested on
a locally determined schedule.

(8) Small vacuum systems positioned close to work stations shall be shielded.

(e) 

Location of collection chambers.

 (1) Whenever practicable, dry-type explosives dust collection chambers, except portable units, shall be located
in the open, outside operating buildings, or in buildings set aside for the purpose. To protect operating personnel
from blast and fragments from the collection chamber, a barricade or operational shield appropriate for the hazardous
quantities involved, shall be provided between the operating building and the outside location or separate building
housing the collection chamber. At least 3 feet shall separate the collection chamber from the barrier wall.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) When locating dry-type collection chambers outside the operating building is not feasible, a separate room shall
be set aside for this purpose in the building. This room shall neither contain other operations nor be used as a communicating
corridor or passageway between other operating locations when explosives are being collected. Walls separating
the room from other portions of the operating building shall meet the requirements for operational shields for the
quantity of explosives in the collection chamber. If more than one collection chamber is to be located in the room,
the room shall be subdivided into cubicles, with only one collection chamber per cubicle.

(3) Stationary and portable wet-type collectors may be placed in explosives operating bays or cubicles, provided
the quantity of explosives in the collectors does not exceed five pounds. Placed in separate cubicles, quantities
may increase to 15 pounds. For wet collectors containing more than 15 pounds, location requirements set forth in  184.190
(e)(1) through (e)(2) apply.

(f) 

Explosives/munitions awaiting destruction.

 Material awaiting destruction when stored in the open shall be inhabited building distance from explosives being
destroyed. Provided with adequate frontal and overhead protection, material awaiting destruction may be stored
at intraline distance from the explosives being destroyed. All such material shall be protected against accidental
ignition or explosion from ambient storage conditions or from fragments, grass fires, burning embers, or blast originating
in materials being destroyed.

(g) 

Containers for waste explosives.

 Containers for these explosives shall be the original closed packages or equivalent. Closures shall prevent spillage
or leakage of contents when handled or overturned, and shall not pinch or rub explosives during closing and opening.
Containers shall be marked clearly to identify contents. No containers constructed from spark-producing or easily
ignited material shall be used.



 184.191


Destruction sites.



(a) 

Site criteria.

 (1) Destruction of ammunition and explosives shall occur as far as possible from magazines, inhabited buildings,
public highways, runways, taxiways, and operating buildings. Separation distances shall be at least 1,250 feet
or the applicable fragmentation distance unless pits or similar aids limit the range of fragments. Natural barricades
should be used between the site and operating buildings or magazines. The possibility that the explosives may detonate
when being burned requires use of appropriate protective barriers or separation distances for the safety of personnel
and property. Explosives shall not be burned or detonated on concrete, nor in areas having large stones or crevices.

(2) In all disposal and destruction activities, the number of A&E units or the explosives quantity that may be
destroyed safely at one time shall be predetermined consistent with safe and efficient operations. When tests or
other substantiated documentation reveal that fragments and debris are adequately controlled, appropriate inhabited
building distances may be used for separation of the destruction site based on the maximum amount of explosives to
be destroyed.

(3) Firefighting equipment should be available to extinguish grass fires and to wet down the area between burnings
and at the close of operations.

(4) Ordinary combustible rubbish should not be disposed of near areas where explosives and explosives-contaminated
material are destroyed.

(b) 

Material and equipment usage.

 (1) Detonation of ammunition or explosives should be initiated by electric blasting caps, using blasting machines
or permanently installed electric circuits energized by storage batteries or conventional power lines. When items
to be detonated are covered with earth, the initiating explosives should be primed with enough primacord to allow
connecting the blasting cap above ground level.

(2) Special requirements for using electric blasting caps and electric blasting circuits follow.

(i) The shunt shall not be removed from the lead wires of the blasting cap until the moment of connection to the blasting
circuit. If the shunt shall be removed to test the blasting cap before priming the charge, short circuit the lead wires
again following the test by twisting the bare ends of the wires together. The wires shall remain short circuited in
this manner until the moment of connection to the blasting circuit.

(ii) When uncoiling the leads of blasting caps, the following shall apply:

(A) No one shall hold the cap at its explosives end.

(B) The explosives end of a hand-held cap should be pointed down, away from the body, to the rear.

(C) The wires shall be held carefully so that there is no tension where it connects to the cap.

(iii) The lead wires of electric caps shall be straightened as necessary by hand. These wires shall not be thrown, waived
through the air, or uncoiled by snapping as a whip.

(iv) Firing wires shall be twisted pairs. The connection between blasting caps and the circuit firing wires shall
not be made unless the power ends of the circuit leads (firing wire) are shorted and grounded.

(v) Electric blasting or demolition operations and unshielded electric blasting caps shall be at safe distances
from radio frequency energy transmitters.

(vi) The blasting circuit shall be tested for extraneous electricity before electric blasting caps are connected
to firing wires. To do so, arrange a dummy test circuit similar to the actual blasting circuit except that a radio pilot
lamp of known good quality, using no electricity, shall substitute for the blasting cap. If this pilot lamp glows in
the dark, indicating possibly dangerous amounts of RF energy, blasting operations shall proceed with non-electric
blasting caps and safety fuses. Other instruments, such as the DuPont ``Detect-A-Meter'' or ``Voltohmeter,'' may
be substituted for the radio pilot lamp used in testing.

(vii) If the exposure is to radar, television, or other microwave transmitters, the actual blasting circuit, with
blasting cap included but without other explosives, shall be used to test for extraneous electricity. Personnel
performing such tests shall be protected from the effects of an exploding blasting cap.

(viii) Blasting and demolition operations shall be suspended during electrical storms, approaching as well as in
progress. At first sign of an electrical storm, cap wires and lead wires shall be short-circuited, and all personnel
removed from the demolition area to a safe location.

(ix) A galvanometer shall test the firing circuit for electrical continuity before it connects with the blasting
machine. Before completing the circuit at the blasting machine or panel and signaling for detonation, the individual
assigned to make the connections shall confirm that everyone in the vicinity is in a safe place. This individual shall
not leave the blasting machine or its actuating device for any reason and, when using a panel, shall lock the switch
in the open position until ready to fire, retaining the only key.

(x) When transported by vehicles with two-way radios, and when in areas presumed to have extraneous electricity,
blasting caps shall be in closed metal boxes.

(3) When conditions prevent the use of electrical initiators for detonation, safety fuses shall be used. At the beginning
of each day's operation and whenever a new coil is used, the safety fuse's burning rate shall be tested. The fuse shall
be long enough for personnel to retire to a safe distance. Under no circumstances shall the fuse length be less than
that required for a 2-minute burning time. Approved crimpers shall be used to fix fuses to detonators. Only fuses small
enough in diameter to enter the blasting cap without forcing shall be used. All personnel except the fuse-actuator
shall retire to the personnel shelter or leave the demolition area before ignition.

(c) 

Servicing of destruction site. 

(1) Vehicles transporting explosive material to burning or demolition grounds shall meet the requirements of this
part. No more than two persons shall ride in the cab. No one shall ride in the truck bed.

(2) Vehicles should be unloaded immediately and withdrawn from the burning or demolition area until destruction
operations are completed. Containers of explosives shall not be opened before the vehicle has departed.

(3) Containers of explosives or ammunition items to be destroyed at the destruction site shall be spotted and opened
at least 10 feet from each other and from explosive material set out earlier, to prevent rapid transmission of fire
if premature should occur.

(4) Empty containers shall be closed and removed to prevent charring or damage during burning of explosives. Delivery
vehicles on the return trip shall pick up empty containers.



 184.192 

Destruction by burning.



(a) No mixing of an explosive with extraneous material, other explosives, metal powder, detonators, or similar items
shall occur without authorization.

(b) Because of the danger of detonation, ammunition and explosives shall not be burned in containers or in large masses,
except as directed by competent contractor authority.

(c) Beds for burning explosives shall be no more than 3 inches deep. Wet explosives may require a thick bed of readily
combustible material underneath and beyond to ensure that all the explosives shall be consumed upon ignition. An
ignition train of combustible material leading to the explosives shall be arranged so that both it and the explosives
burn against the wind. When wind velocity exceeds 15 miles per hour, no disposal by burning shall take place. For direct
ignition of a combustible train, either a safety fuse long enough to permit personnel to reach protective shelter
or a black powder squib initiated by an electric current controlled from a distance or protective structure shall
be used. Tying two or more squibs together may be necessary to ensure ignition of the combustible train. Combustible
materials are not needed for burning solid propellants ignited by squibs. The sites of misfires shall be evacuated
for at least 30 minutes, after which two qualified persons shall approach the position of the explosives: one shall
examine the misfire; the other shall act as backup. Watching the examination from a safe distance, with natural or
artificial barriers or other obstructions for protection, the backup shall be prepared to rush to the examiner's
aid should an accident occur.

(1) Loose, dry explosives may be burned without being place on combustible material if burning shall be complete,
leaving the ground uncontaminated. The ground shall be decontaminated often, for the safety of personnel and operations.
Volatile flammable liquids shall not, at any stage, be poured over explosives or the underlying combustible material
to accelerate burning.

(2) Wet explosives shall always be burned on beds of nonexplosive materials.

(3) RDX should be burned in wet form to prevent detonation.

(4) Pyrotechnic materials in oil containers shall be emptied into shallow metal pans before burning. The open containers
may be burned with the explosives.

(d) Parallel beds of explosives prepared for burning shall be separated by not less than 150 feet. In subsequent burning
operations, care shall be taken to prevent material being ignited from smoldering residue or from heat retained in
the ground from previous burning operations. Unless a burned-overplot has been saturated with water, then passed
a safety inspection, 24 hours shall elapse before the next burning.



 184.193 

Destruction by detonation.



(a) Detonation of ammunition or explosives being destroyed should occur in a pit not less than 4 feet deep and covered
with not less than 2 feet of earth. The components should be placed on their sides or in that position exposing the largest
area to the influence of initiating explosives. Demolition blocks shall be placed in intimate contact on top of the
item to be detonated, secured by earth packed over them. Under certain circumstances, materials such as bangalore
torpedoes and bulk high explosives may be substituted for demolition blocks.

(b) Local regulations, atmosphere conditions, earth strata, etc., determine how many projectiles and explosives
shall be destroyed at one time, both in pits and open sites. Taking these variables into account, the acceptable quantity
shall be based on criteria in Subpart D of this part. The procedure should be used for destruction of fragmentation
grenades, HE projectiles, mines, mortar shells, bombs, photoflash munitions, and HE rocket heads that have been
separated from motors. When a demolition area is remote from inhabited buildings, boundaries, work areas, and storage
areas, detonation may be accomplished without the aid of a pit, space permitting.

(c) After each detonation, the surrounding area shall be searched for unexploded material and items.

(d) In cases of misfires, the procedures in  184.182(c) shall apply.



 184.194 

Destruction by neutralization.



Certain ammunition and explosives may be disposed of by neutralization. Methods of neutralization include dissolving
water-soluble material and chemical decomposition. The contractor, responsible for investigation which of these
is most appropriate, shall comply with all applicable local, State, and Federal requirements for disposal and contamination
operations.

 184.195

Destruction chambers and incinerators.



(a) 

General.

 Small, loaded ammunition components such as primers, fuzes, boosters, detonators, activators, relays, delays
and all types of small-arms ammunition, should be destroyed in destruction chambers and deactivation furnaces.
Explosives scrap incinerators should be used for burning tracer and igniter compositions, small quantities of solid
propellant, magnesium powder, sump cleanings, absorbent cleaning materials, and similar materials. Destruction
chambers and incinerators should be equipped with suitable pollution-control devices, such as multiple chamber
incinerators with thermal incinerator afterburners. The final incineration should take place at 1400
 F, minimum.

(b) 

Operation of incinerators.

 (1) The feeding conveyor shall not be operated until the incinerator temperature is high enough to ensure complete
destruction. Temperature recording devices should be installed.

(2) To remove accumulated residue, incinerators shall be shut down and thoroughly cooled. Repairs shall be made only
during shutdown. Personnel entering the incinerator to clean it shall be provided with respiratory protection,
to prevent inhalation of toxic dusts or fumes, such as mercury from tracers and lead from small-arms ammunition.

(c) 

Operation of destruction chambers and deactivation furnaces.

 (1) Operation shall be by remote control.

(2) Operators shall not approach the unprotected side of the concrete barricade to replenish fuel, adjust the oil
flame, or for any other reason, until enough time has elapsed for explosives in the chamber to go off. To keep the feedpipe
chute or conveyor obstruction-free, regular inspections shall take place.

(3) Components shall be fed into the chamber a few at a time. The exact number permitted at one time for each type of component
shall be posted in a place easily seen from the operator's working position.

(4) Guards shall be installed on conveyor-feeding mechanisms to facilitate feeding and to prevent items from jamming
or falling.



 184.196

Support in disposal of waste.



If Government-owned ammunition items or explosives are declared excess or residual and the contract says nothing
about disposition, the contractor shall request instructions from the responsible Contract Administration Office.
A contractor having trouble safely disposing of residual (scrap) ammunition items or explosives related to contractual
operations may request help from the Contract Administration Office.



Subpart P_Manufacturing and Processing Propellants



 184.198

General.



(a) These requirements are applicable to propellant manufacturing and augment other requirements contained in
this part.

(b) The safety precautions for fabrication of solid propellants, propellant loaded items, gun ammunition, and rocket
motors follow the generally accepted principles used for many types of explosives and energetic materials. Solid
propellants can be divided into general categories such as single, double, and triple base, castable composite,
and modified double base composite; e.g., castable composite propellant modified with explosive plasticizer such
as nitroglycerin.

(c) Although processing safety considerations for finished propellant items and loaded rocket motors are similar,
each propellant type has its own characteristics for processing of raw materials, intermediate compositions, and
final processing. Hazards data testing of intermediate and finished propellant shall be accomplished to define
the requirements that ensure safety in processing. Initiation thresholds to such stimuli as impact, friction, heat,
and electrostatic discharge shall be known for specific processes and handling situations. Response of the materials
in terms of energy input sensitivity and magnitude of energy release shall be considered to evaluate and properly
apply the guidelines in this subpart. Safety precautions for ignition system fabrication shall follow the general
requirements for manufacturing and processing of pyrotechnics given in subpart H of this part. (An exception to this
requirement is the processing of a propellant grain igniter which shall be the same as motor propellant until grain
is mated with the initiator assembly.)

(d) In addition to generally accepted safety precautions for handling of explosives and other energetic materials,
the following paragraphs provide general guidance pertinent to the manufacturing of solid propellants and loaded
items and solid propellant rocket motors.



 184.199

In-process hazards.



(a) During scale up from research and development of new materials to an existing solid propellant manufacturing
process, determine the chemical, physical, physiological and explosive hazards of raw materials, intermediate
compositions, processing aids, and final solid propellant, both uncured and cured.

(b) Testing shall determine thermal stability, chemical compatibility of ingredients, exothermic reactions,
and sensitivity to ignition or detonation from friction, impact, and electrostatic discharge. Additionally, deflagration-to-detonation
and card-gap test data can be valuable. Applicable tests may be selected TB 700-2, 

Explosives Hazard Classification Procedures.

(c) Minimum testing may satisfy the classification requirements for several in-process operations. For example:

(1) If reliable data exists that indicate that the propellant mixing operations are class/division 1.1 no testing
would be needed to adopt this classification.

(2) If testing shows that uncured propellant will detonate, the casting and curing operations shall be considered
exposed to class/division 1.1 hazards.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-1-00152 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) If detonation tests show that the cured propellant will detonate, all operations with cured or curing propellant
shall be considered as exposed to class/division 1.1 hazards.


(d) Safety information for all materials used in the formulation shall be available as required. Personnel shall
be trained on the hazards involved in propellant process situations.



 184.200


Quantity/distance (Q/D) requirements.

be operated to conform to the latest Q/D requirements for the class/division of the material in the in-process condition.



 184.201


Separation of operations and buildings.



(a) Propellant and rocket motor manufacturing and processing shall be done in special areas_operating lines_whose
boundaries are separated from all other areas outside the line in accordance with appropriate Q/D criteria.


(b) Sequential operations on rocket motors can generally be treated as one process operation in one building. Exception
examples are shown in Appendix A to this subpart.



(c) The required separation between buildings (sites, pads, or other such locations), which form a single production
or operating line, shall be in accordance with quantity/distance criteria.


(d) When the hazard classification of a propellant has not been established, classify the propellant during site
and construction planning as the most hazardous class/division that might possibly apply during manufacturing
and processing.


(e) Safety shelters, lunch rooms, convenience buildings, and private vehicle parking for personnel working in an
operating building should be constructed and shall be sited in accordance with applicable Q/D criteria.



 184.202


Equipment and facilities.




(a) Except as provided for in other applicable documentation, the design, layout, and operation of facilities and
equipment for solid propellant operations shall follow the mandatory provisions. Where guidance is not provided,
operations should be governed by the results of hazard tests and analyses performed and documented to address specific
operations. As some propellants can be sensitive to initiation by static electricity, bonding and grounding of equipment,
tooling, and rocket motors along with other means of static elimination and control should be given special consideration.
Conductive work surfaces and floors or floor mats shall be provided for assembly of igniters and igniter subassemblies.


(b) Nonsparking and nonrusting materials, which are chemically compatible with the propellant material, shall
be used for equipment, tooling, and machinery that will come in contact with propellant or propellant ingredients.


(c) Certain solid propellant operations involve significant energy input which enhances the possibility of ignition.
Examples are rolling mills, machining and drilling operations. In these situations, complete hazard analysis and
evaluation shall be conducted prior to starting the operation.


(d) Space heating, air conditioning, and propellant hot air cure oven equipment shall be designed and operated to
prevent accumulation of solvent vapors (whether flammable or nonflammable), explosive dusts, and nitroglycerin
vapors (or other nitroester vapors) that may present an ignition, explosion, or personnel hazard. Ovens shall have
dual or redundant temperature controls.



(e) Exposed radiant surfaces in the form of S-shaped smooth pipe or fin-type radiators, so positioned that they can
be easily cleaned, are considered suitable types of radiators because of the ease with which they can be cleaned. Other
types of radiators are acceptable, but are less desirable because of cleaning difficulties.


(f) When mechanical ventilating equipment is used in operations involving potential concentrations of solvent
vapors, dusts, and nitroester vapors, the electric motor and motor controls shall not be located directly in the potentially
contaminated air stream and the system shall be provided with a suitable means of collecting condensate.


(g) Air conditioning and cure oven air-circulating equipment of the closed system type shall be designed to prevent
contaminated air from contacting the air motor and controls. Recirculated air shall be monitored to ensure concentration
of vapors and dusts do not reach flammable (or explosive), or personnel threshold limits. Electric motors and controls
shall be dustproof and vaporproof electrical equipment. Air mover blades should be nonmetallic.


(h) The equipment shall be rigidly fixed and stable during mixing to preclude contact between fixed and movable parts.
Any mix bowl lift-mechanism (elevator) is to be designed so blade-to-blade and blade-to-bowl clearances are assured
during the complete operation cycle.


(i) Positive controls shall be provided to physically block or stop bowl or mixer head movement in case of drive mechanism
malfunction. Assure blade-to-blade and blade-to-bowl clearance is maintained at all times.


(j) Mix blades and shaft shall be rigid and structurally strong to ensure minimum flex from viscosity of the mix and
speed of the shaft.


(k) Electrical components of all mixers shall meet the appropriate electrical classification, be remotely located,
or shrouded and purged with inert gas. Purged systems shall be designed to provide automatic warning if gas pressure
is lost.


(l) Mixer blade shafts shall be equipped with seals or packing glands that prevent migration of liquids or solvent
vapors into bearings. Submerged bearings and packing glands should be avoided. However, if used, they shall be periodically
tested for contamination and cleaned.


(m) A program shall be established to detect significant changes in blade/shaft position relative to mixer head.
Clearances between mix blades and mixer bowls shall be checked at regular intervals based on operating time and experience
to make sure the clearance is adequate. Maintain a record of such checks, mixer blade adjustments, and any damage to
the mixer blades and bowls.


(n) Mix bowl, blades, and drive unit are to be electrically bonded and grounded.
(o) Inspect blades and other moving parts of new mixers and replacement parts for old mixers. Inspect (magnaflux and/or
X-ray) for cracks, crevices, and other flaws.


(p) Electric service to propellant mixers shall be interlocked with fire protection system controls so that the mixer
cannot start when the fire protection system is inoperative.


(q) All process equipment which applies energy to in-process propellant should be checked regularly for wear and
misalignment. A record of these checks and maintenance performed should be maintained for the process equipment.


(r) Equipment performing sequential operations on propellants, such as extrusion and cutting, shall be controlled
to prevent interference.



 184.203


In-process quantities and storage.



(a) Only the amount of propellant and loaded subassemblies needed to ensure a safe and efficient workflow shall be
present in an operating building when operations are being conducted. This does not preclude short-term storage
of larger quantities in an operating building when not in use for other operations.

(b) Operating buildings of standard construction may be used for storage of completed assemblies with or without
installed ignition system. There shall be no other operation in progress and quantity/distance shall be in compliance
with requirements.
(c) Production igniters may be stored in designated areas within an assembly/disassembly facility.
(d) Indoor storage is preferable for all types of explosives and is mandatory for bulk high explosives, solid propellants,
and pyrotechnics. Priority of existing indoor storage should be given to items requiring the most protection from
the weather (based on the method of packing). Solid propellant and propellant materials shall be protected from overheating
by exposure to direct sunlight when in transit or on temporary hold.
(e) The propulsive characteristics and the ignition probability of explosive items such as propellant loaded devices,
rocket motors, assist take-off units, and missiles shall be taken into consideration during all logistical phases
in order to obtain as much safety as possible under the circumstances. Because of the great number of types and sizes
of propellant loaded devices and conditions of assembly encountered, it is not feasible to present anything other
than general safety guidance in this part. Thus, every effort should be made to prevent ignition of any units being
manufactured, assembled, disassembled, handled, stored, transported or deployed. Approved flight restraining
devices (tie-downs) shall be used to the maximum extent possible and are required if probability of ignition is reasonably
high. When doubt exists as to whether a given item or configuration (state of assembly) is propulsive or nonpropulsive,
the item shall be treated as propulsive until pertinent technical information can be obtained.


 184.204 

Ingredients processing.


(a) Weighing, measuring, and handling raw materials. 

(1) Scales for weighing raw materials shall be electrically grounded, where needed, to properly protect the operation.
This grounding is especially important where flammable or combustible materials are involved.
(2) Separate weight or measurement rooms, cubicles, or areas (dependent upon the quantity and sensitivity of the
materials handled) shall be provided. Oxidizers and metallic powders weighing shall be separated from each other
and from other materials by physical barriers rather than distance.
(3) It is important that containers, equipment, hand tools, scale pans, etc., used for weighing processes are not
mixed with those weighing or measuring oxidizers and fuels, particularly where distance rather than physical barriers
separates these areas. Positive measures shall be adopted to ensure the complete separation of such equipment and
tools.
(4) The designated use of space and equipment shall not be changed without a thorough cleaning and inspection to make
sure that all traces of the previous material have been removed if any possibility exists that materials are incompatible.
(b) 

Oxidizer processing. 

(1) Solid propellant oxidizing agents are perchlorates, nitrates, nitroesters, and nitramines used in solid rocket
motor propellants.
(2) Avoid contaminating an oxidizer agent with any metal or chemical (fuel) which may result in a more sensitive composition.
(3) Use closed systems as much as possible for dust, humidity, and tramp material control.
(4) Flexible connections (socks) in pipes or duct systems which convey oxidizer materials and dust socks in collectors
or hoopers should be fabricated of fire-retardant materials. These materials shall be chemically compatible with
the oxidizers to which they shall be exposed.
(5) The pipes and duct systems shall be made electrically continuous. Threaded joints and fittings in contact with
oxidizer should be avoided. Quick clamp neuter end pipe joints are preferred.
(6) Static control measures shall be used to dissipate static charges to an acceptable level if oxidizer is transported
by fluidization.
(c) 

Oxidizer drying. 

(1) The safe temperature for drying each material shall be established and shall not be exceeded at any point in the
drying apparatus or drying room.
(2) Use thermostatic controls to prevent the maximum safe temperature from being exceeded in the drying process.
Redundant controls are required.
(3) Electrical heating elements that may contact the oxidizer or oxidizer dust shall not be used.
(4) Dust should be held to a minimum in the drying process. A dust collection system shall be used if dusting can create
a potential hazard.
(5) Care should be exercised to ensure incompatible materials are not being dried simultaneously in the same drying
process. An oven, drying room, etc., used for processing flammable or other incompatible materials should not be
used for drying oxidizers until it has been cleaned, inspected, and found to be free of any contaminating residual
materials.
(d) 

Screening oxidizers. 

(1) When screening for process purposes, the screening equipment shall be constructed so oxidizer material is not
subjected to pinching, friction, or impact as a result of metal-to-metal contact. Rooms in which screening units
are operated shall be kept thoroughly clean to eliminate hazardous accumulations of dust.
(2) Oxidizer screens shall be electrically grounded and bonded to the receiving vessel.
(e) 

Blending oxidizers. 

(1) If gases are generated during blending of oxidizer, a suitable means of gas pressure relief shall be designed into
the blender.

(2) The blender shall be electrically bonded throughout.
(3) Blending equipment shall be constructed so oxidizer material is not subjected to pinching, friction, or impact
between metal-to-metal surfaces.
(4) When ammonium perchlorate is blended using powered mechanical equipment, operating personnel shall be protected.
Remote control of mechanical blending is advisory.
(5) When powered mechanical methods are used for blending mass-detonating materials (such as REDX or HMX), the operation
shall be remotely controlled and personnel protected (See Note 1 to Appendix A to this subpart).
(f) 

Grinding oxidizers. 

(1) When impact-type mills are used, there shall be sufficient clearance between stationary and moving parts to prevent
metal-to-metal contact. Clearances shall be checked as often as needed to ensure they are adequate. Mill bearings
should be wind swept (purged) to prevent contamination. Impact-type grinders shall not be used for mass-detoning
materials.
(2) Oxidizer feed materials shall be passed through a screen mesh with openings no greater than the clearance between
hammer and plate. Screen mesh size for ammonium nitrate should be the smallest that allows free flow of the prills.
Magnetic separations shall be used if screening is not possible.
(3) Use only compatible lubricants in grinding equipment.
(4) Heat sensitive devices should be installed on the bearing housing of grinding and conditioning equipment.
(5) Determine the cleaning cycle and method used for grinding equipment and include in operating procedures.
(6) Grinding operations should be provided with wet dust-collection systems, where appropriate.
(7) Pneumatic grinding operations shall be thoroughly grounded and bonded to provide for electrostatic charge dissipation.
(g) 

Preparation of fuel compositions. 

(1) Sensitivity characteristics of fuel compositions should be determined prior to production mixing operations.
(2) Establish compatibility of materials. Develop procedures that preclude the formation of highly sensitive compositions
or hazardous conditions during processing, such as, dry AP and powdered metal mixtures.
(3) Equipment, piping, and vessels used in fuel preparation should be bonded to form a continuous electrical path
with each other and to building ground. When metallic powder and flammable liquids are transferred (poured) from
one container to another, the containers should be bonded together prior to transfer.
(4) Minimize the formation and accumulation of dust in all preparation operations.
(5) Fume hoods, dust socks, closed systems, and dust/fume vacuum exhaust hoses are to be used, as appropriate, to prevent
vapors and dust getting into the operating areas.
(h) 

Transfer operations. 

(1) Finely divided powdered ingredients should be transferred by methods that control flow rate and minimize electrostatic
charge generation which would result from ``slug'' dumping.
(2) Flammable solvents should be transferred only after the transfer and receiving vessels have been electrically
bonded to eliminate electrostatic potential differences.


 184.205 

Mixing.


(a) Secure hardware and associated equipment to prevent loose items falling into mixers.
(b) Liquids and powders to be added to the mix vessels shall first pass through a screen or orifice with an opening(s)
less than the smallest clearance in the mixer. Smaller amounts of material may be added directly, provided a positive
means exists to ensure the material does not contain any foreign material.
(c) Materials which cannot be screened and are opaque or not easily inspected should be examined by other means, such
as X-ray.
(d) When consistent with the process system and requirements, a cover shall be placed over the mixer bowl after changing
or mixing operations are completed. This is to prevent the accidental introduction of foreign objects into the mixer
and also to preclude sunlight impinging directly on the materials in the bowl.
(e) Use only nonsparking devices to scrape down the sides and blades of mixtures by hand. Set up controls to prevent
these and other devices from being accidentally introduced into the mixer.
(f) Account for all loose tools and equipment before starting or continuing mixing operations.
(g) Do not allow objects in the mixer operating area (such as jewelry, pens, and coins) that may accidentally be introduced
into mixers. Suggest using pocketless coveralls.
(h) Direct and unobstructed routes shall be provided for personnel egress from mixer buildings or bays.
(i) Personnel shall not attempt to fight propellant fires.
(j) Propellant mixers should be equipped, inside and outside of the mixing vessel, with a high-speed deluge system.

 184.206 

Casting and curing.



(a) Local attendance during cast operations is permitted provided a thorough safety review of the operation is conducted.

(b) Multiple or production line type casting is permissible provided provision is made to prevent propagation of
an incident between individual cast bells or pits.

(c) All cast piping and tooling in contact with propellant shall be smooth for ease of cleaning and be free of cracks,
pits, crevices, and weld slag. Threaded joints should be avoided as much as possible. Joints requiring disassembly
as a process operation or for cleaning should not be threaded type.

(d) Cast tooling and mandrel designs shall permit no metal-to-metal friction or impact sites.

(e) Valves through which propellant flows shall be designed to prevent propellant from being pinched or compressed
between two metal surfaces.

lines shall have a relief valve downstream of the regulator.

(i) Equip each vessel with a blowout disk (burst diaphragm) designed to blow out at less than 120 percent of the vessel's
maximum allowable working pressure. The design shall allow for the release of the potential rapid rise of pressure
in the vessel should the propellant ignite.

(j) Pressure relief is to be provided when propellant is cured or cast under pressure.


(k) Pressurization and depressurization for propellant cure shall be done remotely.

(l) Casting vessels should be physically or electrically disconnected from lifting devices during cast operations.



 184.207 

Extrusion processes.



(a) Extrusion presses and compression molding equipment should be designed to remove air from the propellant before
compaction and extrusion begin. Assure that procedures provide for checking operation of the vacuum system and cleaning
it of propellant residue and condensed vapors such as those generated from nitroglycerin volatization.

(b) Ramheads should be checked for alignment with the press bore to preclude metal-to-metal contact. Flashing removal
should be included in the process procedures.

(c) Interlocks shall be provided to preclude press operation during loading or other attendant operations.



 184.208


Propellant loaded items.



(a) When operations are performed on cured propellant contained in pressure vessels or rocket motor cases and there
is a significant risk of ignition due to energy inputs (such as electrical check of pyrotechnic devices), the unit
should be secured in a fixture capable of withstanding the rated thrust of the assembly times a factor 2.5, minimum.

(b) When mechanically applied force is required to ``breakaway'' the mandrel or other tooling embedded in propellant,
it should be applied by remote control. However, see Appendix A to this subpart for exceptions.

(c) Moving loaded motors with cores in place is, generally, not recommended. If loaded motors containing cores shall
be moved, however, the core and motor case shall be supported by or suspended from a common source or in some manner locked
or tied together to prevent independent movement of either.

(d) Hazard characteristics of individual propellants to be cut, machined, or contoured, shall be evaluated and considered
in determining the safest method to use.

(e) Propellant machining equipment shall be designed:

(1) To prevent contact of cutting tools or blades with motor cases and other metal objects.

(2) To minimize generation of heat.

(3) To facilitate removal of dust and chips, and to afford personnel protection. The motor or grain should be X-rayed
prior to trim if there is a possibility that metal or other foreign objects may be in the propellant.

(f) Propellant dust, chips and shavings shall be removed frequently from the work area during machining and contouring.

(g) Rocket motors in final assembly process should be positioned to permit ready access to all sides of the motor. Aisles
and exit doors are to be kept clear and unobstructed. All exit doors shall have quick-release hardware.

(h) The number of items in the final assembly building shall be the minimum consistent with a safe and efficient operation.

(i) Grounding of propellant loaded assemblies in storage is optional and is to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

(j) If the process requires removing an igniter shorting clip, the igniter shall remain shorted until immediately
before insertion. Igniter shall remain nonshorted for only the minimum time required for the operation.

(k) Provide means for controlled dissipation of static electrical charges during igniter insertion. 

(l) Operations that involve electrical continuity checking/testing of ignition systems installed in rocket motors
are to be conducted according to thoroughly reviewed and approved procedures. If review indicates that an unacceptable
potential for ignition exists, these checks shall be conducted by remote control with the motor mounted in a test stand
designed to withstand the thrust of the motor times a factor 2.5, minimum. 



 184.209 

Disassembly. 



(a) Process equipment and tooling that requires disassembly as a process operation shall be designed as much as possible
to avoid metal-to-metal movement and trapping of explosive material. 

(b) Sanitary, external clamp fittings should be used on pipe assemblies for propellant transfer. 

(c) Disassembly of equipment and tooling which is nonroutine, such as necessary for equipment repair or for securing
the process, should not be started until evaluation of potential hazards from trapped material or process residuals.

Change house

. A building provided with facilities for employees to change to and from work clothes. Such buildings may be provided
with sanitary facilities, drinking fountains, lockers, and eating facilities.


Classification yard

. A railroad yard used for the receiving, dispatching, classifying, and switching of cars.


Compatibility

. Ammunition and explosives are considered compatible if they may be stored or transported together without significantly
increasing either the probability of an accident or, for a given quantity, the magnitude of the effects of such an accident.


Deflagration

. A rapid chemical reaction in which the output of heat is sufficient to enable the reaction to proceed and be accelerated
without input of heat from another source. Deflagration is a surface phenomenon with the reaction products flowing
away from the unreacted material along the surface at subsonic velocity. The effect of a true deflagration under confinement
is an explosion. Confinement of the reaction increases pressure, rate of reaction and temperature, and may cause
transition into a detonation.


Demilitarize

. To disarm, neutralize, and accomplish any other action required to render ammunition and explosives innocuous
or ineffectual for military use.


Detonation

. A violent chemical reaction within a chemical compound or mechanical mixture evolving heat and pressure. A detonation
is a reaction that proceeds through the reacted material toward the unreacted material at a supersonic velocity.
The result of the chemical reaction is exertion of extremely high pressure on the surrounding medium forming a propagating
shock wave that is originally of supersonic velocity. A detonation, when the material is located on or near the surface
of the ground, normally is characterized by a crater.







Dud

. Explosive munition that is not armed as intended, or that has failed to function after being armed.


Establishment

. Any plant, works, facility, installation, or other activity.


Explosion

. A chemical reaction of any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that, when initiated, undergoes a very rapid
combustion or decomposition releasing large volumes of highly heated gases that exert pressure on the surrounding
medium. Also, a mechanical reaction in which failure of the container causes the sudden release of pressure from within
a pressure vessel; for example, pressure rupture of a steam boiler. Depending on the rate of energy release, an explosion
can be categorized as a deflagration, a detonation, or a pressure rupture.


Explosive

. Any chemical compound or mechanical mixture that, when subjected to heat, impact, friction, detonation, or other
suitable initiation, undergoes a very rapid chemical change with the evolution of large volumes of highly heated
gases that exert pressures in the surrounding medium. The term applies to materials that either detonate or deflagrate.


Explosives facility

. Any structure or location containing ammunition and explosives.


Exposed site (ES)

. A location exposed to the potential hazardous effects (blast, fragments, debris, and heat flux) from an explosion
at a potential explosion site (PES).







The distance to a PES and the level of protection required for an ES determine the quantity of ammunition or explosives
permitted in a PES.



Fire-resistive

. Applies to generally combustible materials or structures that have been treated or have surface coverings designed
to retard ignition or fire spread.


Firebrand

. A projected burning or hot fragment from which thermal energy is transferred to a receptor.


Firewall

. A wall of fire-resistive construction designed to prevent the spread of fire from one side to the other. A firewall
also may be termed a ``fire division wall.''


Flame-resistant

. Applies to combustible materials, such as clothing, which have been treated or coated to decrease their burning
characteristics.


Flammable

. Combustible. A flammable material is one that is ignited easily and burns readily.


Fragmentation

. Breaking up of the confining material of a chemical compound or mechanical mixture when an explosion takes place.
Fragments may be complete items, subassemblies, pieces thereof, or pieces of equipment or buildings containing
the items.


Hangfire

. Temporary failure or delay in the action of a primer, igniter, or propelling charge.





Hazard analysis

. The logical, systematic examination of an item, process, condition, facility, or system to identify and analyze
the probability, causes, and consequences of potential or real hazards.


High explosive equivalent or explosive equivalent

. The ratio of the weight of TNT to that of another explosive when both quantities produce equivalent blast effects
at the same distance from their detonations. The ratio is expressed as a percent.


Holding yard

. A location for groups of railcars, trucks, or trailers used to hold ammunition and explosives for interim periods
before storage or shipment.


Hypergolic

. The term used to describe the self-ignition of certain fuels and oxidizers upon contact with each other.


Inhabited building

. A building or structure, other than an operating building, occupied in whole or part by human beings; or a building
or structure where people customarily assemble, such as a church, schoolhouse, railroad station and similar transportation
facilities, store, theater, or factory, inside or outside the establishment.


Inhabited building distance

. That separation between explosives locations (PES) and non-associated locations (ES) requiring a high degree
of protection from an accidental explosion. Such exposed sites include facility boundaries, wholly inert administrative
facilities, the public, etc.


Inspection station

. A designated location at which trucks and railcars containing ammunition and explosives are inspected.

types and general specifications of various magazines for ammunition and explosives follow: 
(1) Reinforced concrete, arch-type, earth-covered magazines whose construction is at least equivalent in strength
to the requirements of The Office of Chief of Engineers (OCE), Department of the Army, drawings 652-686 through
652-693, December 27, 1941, as revised March 14, 1942, 33-15-06, 33-15-58 (atomic blast
resistant), 33-15-61, and 33-15-74. For new construction use drawings 35-15-74.
 




(2) Magazines constructed according to Navy drawings 357428 through 357430, August 19, 1944, and modified in accordance
with NAVFAC drawing 626739, March 19, 1954; and NAVFAC drawings 627954 through 627957, 764597, 658384 through 658388,
724368, 751861, 764596, 793746, and 793747.
 




(3) Box-type A magazines constructed according to NAVFAC drawings 1404000 through 1404007; box-type B magazines

(oval 1 -ga steel arch) is no longer approved for new construction; however, existing magazines are considered ``standard.''
For new construction of large magazines of this type use the earth-covered steel, semi-circular-arch magazine design
shown on Army OCE drawing number 421-80-01, and for new construction of smaller magazines of this type
use OCE drawing number AW 33-15-65 addressed above. 


Mass detonating explosives

. High explosives, black powder, certain propellants, certain pyrotechnics, and other similar explosives, alone
or in combination, or loaded into various types of ammunition or containers, most of which can be expected to explode
virtually instantaneously when a small portion is subject to fire, to severe concussion or impact, to the impulse
of an initiating agent, or to the effect of a considerable discharge of energy from without. Such an explosive will
normally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects. Explosive propagation may occur immediately to other
items of ammunition and explosives stored sufficiently close to and not adequately protected from the initially
exploding pile with a time interval short enough so that two or more quantities shall be considered as one for quantity-distance
(Q/D) purposes. 


Maximum credible event (MCE)

. In hazards evaluation, the MCE from a hypothesized accidental explosion, fire, or agent release is the worst single
event that is likely to occur from a given quantity and disposition of ammunition and explosives. Event shall be realistic
with a reasonable probability of occurrence, considering the explosion propagation, burning rate characteristics,
and physical protection given to the items involved. The MCE evaluated on this basis may then be used as a basis for effects
calculations and casualty predictions. 


Military pyrotechnics

. Ammunition manufactured specifically for use as signals, illuminants, and like items.

are or may be conducted, excluding streams that are not navigable by barges, tugboats, and other large vessels, unless
they are used extensively and regularly for the operation of pleasure boats.


NEW. 

Net Explosive Weight, expressed in pounds.


Nitrogen padding (or blanket). 

Filling the void or ullage of a closed container with nitrogen gas to prevent oxidation of the chemical therein and
to avoid formation of a flammable atmosphere above the liquid. Nitrogen padding (or blanket) also means maintaining
a nitrogen atmosphere in or around an operation, piece of equipment, etc.


Noncombustible. 

Not burnable.


Operting building. 

Any structure, except a magazine, in which operations pertaining to manufacturing, processing, handling, loading,
or assembly of ammunition and explosives are performed.



Operating line. 

A group of buildings, facilities, or related work stations so arranged as to permit performance of the consecutive
steps in the manufacture of an explosive or in the loading, assembly, modification, and maintenance of ammunition.



Operational shield. 

A barrier constructed at a particular location or around a particular machine or operating station to protect personnel,
material, or equipment from the effects of a possible localized fire or explosion. Operational shields, when designed
in accordance with MIL-STD-398 should protect personnel and assets from thermal, pressure, and fragmentation
hazards resulting from an accidental or intentional detonation and deflagration of ammunition or explosives. Existing
reinforced concrete walls built to resist the effects of accidental explosions and designed and built in accordance
with requirements applicable at the time of construction may be used as operational shields, with the following guidance
as a minimum requirement:


(1) A 12-inch reinforced concrete wall (see definition ``substantial dividing wall'' of this subpart) provides
adequate protection for operations involving an item containing 15 pounds TNT equivalent or less of high explosives
when the nearest part of the item is at least 3 feet from the wall and the item is 2 feet from the floor. Care shall be taken
to use appropriate equivalence data for close-in effects. Explosives characterized by greater brisance than that
of TNT may have very high equivalencies at small distances from the explosives. When equivalence data is not available,
existing 12-inch reinforced concrete walls may be used for operational shields for protection from items containing
not more than 6 pounds of high explosives.
(2) A 30-inch reinforced concrete wall provides adequate protection against the effects of an item containing not
more than 50 pounds TNT equivalent of high explosives. The same separation distance as stated in paragraph (1) of this
definition applies. When equivalence data is not available, a 30-inch wall may be used for an operational shield for
protection from items containing not more than 20 pounds of high explosives.
(3) A 36-inch reinforced concrete wall provides adequate protection against the effects of an item containing not
more than 70 pounds TNT-equivalency of high explosives. The separation distance as stated in definition ``operational
shield,'' paragraph (1) of this definition applies. When equivalence data is not available, a 36-inch wall may be
used for an operational shield for protection from items containing not more than 28 pounds of high explosives.


Potential explosive site (PES). 

The location of a quantity of explosives that will create a blast, fragment, thermal, or debris hazard in the event
of an accidental explosion of its contents. Quantity limits for ammunition and explosives at a PES are determined
by the distance to an ES.


Prohibited area.

Quantity/distance (Q/D)

. The quantity of explosives material and distance separation relationships providing defined types of protection.
These relationships are based on levels of risk considered acceptable for the stipulated exposures and are tabulated
in the appropriate Q/D tables. Separation distances afford less than absolute safety.


Renovation

. That work performed on ammunition, missiles, or rockets to restore them to a completely serviceable condition;
usually involves the replacement of unserviceable or outmoded plants.


Restricted area

. Any area, normally fenced, from which personnel, aircraft, or vehicles, other than those required for operations,
are excluded for reasons of safety.


Runway

. Any surface on land designated for aircraft takeoff and landing operations, or a lane of water designated for takeoff
and landing operations of seaplanes.


Service magazine

. A building in an operating line used for the intermediate storage of explosives materials. The amount of explosives
normally is limited to a minimum consistent with safe, efficient production.


Standard earth-covered magazine (igloo)

. An earth-covered, arch-type magazine, with or without a separate door barricade, constructed according to an approved
standard drawing.

Static test stand. 

Locations whereon liquid propellant engines or solid propellant motors are tested in place.



Substantial dividing wall. 

An interior wall designed to prevent simultaneous detonation of explosives on opposite sides of the wall. However,
such walls may not prevent propagation (depending on quantities and types of explosives involved).

(1) Substantial dividing walls are one way of separating explosives into smaller groups to minimize the results of
an explosion and allow a reduction in Q/D. These walls do not protect personnel near the wall from high explosives because
the spalling of wall surface opposite the explosion source may form dangerous secondary fragments.

(2) Reinforced concrete-type walls may vary in thickness, but shall be at least 12 inches thick. At a minimum, both
faces shall be reinforced with rods at least 1/2 inch in diameter. The rods shall be spaced not more than 12 inches on
centers horizontally and vertically, interlocked with the footing rods and secured to prevent overturning. Rods
on one face shall be staggered with regard to rods on the opposite face and should be approximately 2 inches from each
face. Concrete should have a design compressive strength of 2,500 psi or more. The capability to prevent simultaneous
detonation is based on a limit of 425 net pounds of mass-detonating explosives. All storage plans and Q/D calculations
shall be based on the total quantity of mass-detonating explosives on both sides of a dividing wall when the quantity
of either side exceeds 425 pounds. Explosives should be 3 feet or more from the wall.

(3) Retaining walls filled with earth or sand shall be at least 5 feet wide, with earth or sand packed between concrete,
masonry, or wooden retaining walls.



Suspect truck and car site. 

A designated location for placing trucks and railcars containing ammunition or explosives that are suspected of
being in hazardous condition. These sites also are used for trucks and railcars that may be in a condition that is hazardous
to their content.



Taxiway/taxilane. 

Any surface designed as such in the basic airfield clearance criteria specified by 14 CFR part 77, Objects Affecting
Navigable Airspace.








Unit risk. 

The risk to personnel and/or facilities that is associated with debris, fragment and/or blast hazards that is the
result of the detonation of a single round of ammunition.



Waiver. 

Written authority that provides a temporary exception, permitting deviation from mandatory requirements of this
part. It generally is granted for short periods of time pending cancellation as a result of termination of scheduled
work commitments or correction of the waived conditions.

a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Cam Lewis, Project Officer for the Patrol
Commander, and Lieutenant Commander Craig Juckniess, Project Attorney, Eleventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Discussion of Proposed Regulation



The event prompting a need for these proposed Special Local Regulations is the IACC Citizen Cup and Louis Vuitton Cup
Semi-Finals and Finals, and the America's Cup Match Races which will be conducted in the San Diego area on several series
of dates during the period mid-March through May 1995. In addition, races in the Citizen Cup Defender Selection Series
and Louis Vuitton Cup Challenger Selection Series will be held on several series of dates during the period January
through mid-March 1995; Special Local Regulations establishing measures promoting the safety of these races are
the subject of separate rulemaking (CGD11-94-009).

These proposed regulations are intended to promote safe navigation on the waters of the San Diego Bay, Mission Bay
and the IACC race venue during the IACC Citizen Cup, Louis Vuitton Cup, and America's Cut Match Races by controlling
the traffic entering, exiting, and traveling within these waters. The anticipated concentration of spectator and
participant vessels associated with these races poses a safety concern, which is addressed in these special local
regulations.

Within the geographic area of applicability of these proposed special local regulations, speed limits and operating
requirements have been proposed for orderly passage to and from the IACC shore facilities and race venue.

Speed limits and operating requirements are also proposed for other vessel traffic operating within the regulated
areas during times when most IACC and spectator vessels are expected to transit the harbors. During these same times,
vessels shall not operate exclusively under sail within the regulated areas.

On each specified race date, these regulations will be in effect in San Diego Bay and Mission Bay during two periods:
Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 noon; and again in the afternoon for a two-hour period which will fall between 2:30
p.m. and 7 p.m. Selection of the afternoon regulatory period will depend on the time of termination of race activities
for that date. Notice for commencement and termination of the afternoon regulatory period will be made by Broadcast
Notice to Mariners; a 15-minute advance notice of commencement of the afternoon regulatory period will also be broadcast.

The nature of the winner selection process and other circumstances may dictate that races will not actually be conducted
on dates specified as race dates. In the event of cancellation or postponement of races scheduled for a particular
date, the Patrol Commander's election not to implement these regulations on that date will be announced via Broadcast
Notice to Mariners.

The proposed regulations also provide for a one-way traffic pattern and a five knot speed limit. These requirements
will be activated by the Patrol Commander when necessary to ensure the safety of navigation. Activation of these additional
regulations will be announced by patrol vessels on scene and by Broadcast Notice to Mariners.

Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are proposed for the period of these regulations to promote smooth traffic
flow and ensure access to docks and piers.

These proposed Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within
the navigable waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating
in and viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside
the navigable waters of the United States.

All vessels which fail to comply with these proposed regulations while operating within the regulated areas during
the regulatory periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties
presented in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et. seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).

For reasons set forth in the above Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposed regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
(44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



The environmental impact of this proposal has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's
Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit.
A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District
Office at the address listed under 

ADDRESSES.

The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of
this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant
environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public
docket, and is available for review at the address listed under ADDRESSES.

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve Illinois' May 18, 1994, request to
repeal the Stage II vapor recovery control requirements in the Illinois State Implementation Plan for ozone in the
East St. Louis (Metro-East) ozone nonattainment area which consists of three Illinois counties: Madison , Monroe
and St. Clair. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the USEPA is approving this action as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial
action and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final
rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated
in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and
all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not
institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so
at this time.

Proposed Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans and 
Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; 
Commonwealth of Kentucky

AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On November 12, 1993, the Commonwealth of Kentucky through the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet
(Cabinet) submitted a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Kentucky portion of the Ashland-Huntington
nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O

3

). The Kentucky portion of the moderate O

3

 nonattainment area includes Boyd County and a portion of Greenup County. On November 12, 1992, West Virginia requested
to redesignate their portion of the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area and action is being taken by Region 3 in
a separate notice. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed if sufficient data are available to warrant
such changes. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal because it will
meet the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become a federally
enforceable part of Kentucky's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the moderate nonattainment area. In this action,
EPA ia also proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Kentucky's 1990 baseline emissions inventory because it meets
EPA's requirements regarding the approval on baseline emission inventories.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q). Under section 107(d)(1)(C), EPA designated Boyd County of the Ashland-Huntington
area as nonattainment by operation of law with respect to O

3

 because the area was designated nonattainment immediately before November 15, 1990. The nonattainment area was
expanded to include portions of Greenup County per section 107(d)(1)(A)(i) (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR
56762 (Nov. 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.318.) The area was classified as moderate. 


The moderate nonattainment area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the O

3

 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), during the period from 1991 through 1993. Therefore, in an effort
to comply with the CAA and to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS, on November 12, 1993, the Commonwealth of Kentucky
submitted for parallel processing an O

3

 maintenance plan and requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the O

3

 NAAQS and EPA found the request complete. On July 21, 1994, the Commonwealth revised the maintenance plan to address
public comments, and EPA comments dated December 16, 1993, and May 5, 1994. 
On February 7, 1994, Region 4 determined that the information received from the Cabinet constituted a complete redesignation
request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes
of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify
when the Cabinet first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous
policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the amended CAA, including redesignation
submittals, would not be determined complete. 

See

 ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines,'' Memorandum
from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X, dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale
for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria (40 CFR part 51, appendix
V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for mandatory submittals. (

See

 Memorandum at 3-4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory submittals under the CAA,
EPA changed its policy with respect to redesignation submittals to conform to the existing completeness criteria.
Therefore, EPA believes the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation
request submittals, at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception (

See 

58 FR 38108 ``Approval and Promulgation of Maintenance Plan and Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes
for Carbon Monoxide, State of New York'' published July 15, 1993, and ``State Implementation Plans (SIP) Actions
submitted in Response 

to Clean Air Act (CAA) Deadlines,'' Memorandum from John Calcagni to Air Program Directors, Region I-X, dated October
28, 1992). 
The Kentucky redesignation request for the Ashland moderate O

3

 nonattainment area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following
is a brief description of how the Commonwealth of Kentucky has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance
plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under
its analysis of the redesignation request. 


1. The Area Must Have Attained the O

The Commonwealth of Kentucky's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring
data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Most recent ambient air quality monitoring
data for calendar year 1991 through calendar year 1993 show an expected exceedance rate of less than 1.0 per year of
the O

3

 NAAQS in the nonattainment area (

See

 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H). The area has continued to demonstrate attainment to date. Because the nonattainment area
has complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar
year period, the area has met the first component of attainment of the O

3

 NAAQS. The Commonwealth of Kentucky has also met the second component of attainment of the O

3

 NAAQS by committing to continue monitoring the moderate nonattainment area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. 


2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the CAA 


On January 25, 1980, August 7, 1981, November 24, 1981, November 30, 1981, and March 30, 1983, EPA fully approved Kentucky's
SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 6092, 46 FR 40188, 46 FR 57486, 46
FR 58080, and 48 FR 13168). The approved control strategy did not result in attainment of NAAQS for O

3

. Additionally, the amended CAA revised section 182(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and
added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement
that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed the Kentucky SIP and ensures that it contains
all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted its redesignation
request. 


A. Section 110 Requirements 


Although section 110 was amended by the CAA, the Kentucky SIP for the moderate nonattainment area meets the requirements
of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes
that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with
the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).

B. Part D Requirements 


Before the moderate nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, the Commonwealth must have fulfilled
the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which
it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment
areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O

3

 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area is classified
as moderate (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.318). The Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted the request for redesignation
of the moderate nonattainment area on November 12, 1993. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the
Commonwealth of Kentucky must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c)
and 176, and is also required to meet the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D, specifically sections 182(a)
and (b). 


a. Subpart 1 of Part D 


Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator, but no
later than three years after an area has been designated to nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements
were applicable to classified ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1993, the date that the Commonwealth
of Kentucky submitted a complete redesignation request for the Kentucky portion of the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment
area. Therefore, the Commonwealth was not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. Upon
the redesignation of this area to attainment, the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) provisions contained
in part C of title I are applicable. On January 25, 1978, September 1, 1989, November 6, 1989, November 13, 1989, November
28, 1989, February 7, 1990, and June 23, 1994, the EPA approved revisions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky's PSD program
(43 FR 3360, 54 FR 36307, 54 FR 46613, 54 FR 47211, 54 FR 488887, 55 FR 4169 and 59 FR 32343). 
Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable state SIP. The
requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded
or approved under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other
Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted
by states must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress
provided for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the implementation of Title I informed
states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date [

see

 57 FR 13498t 13557 (April 16, 1992)]. 
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity
regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both transportation
and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan
approved under CAA Section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851
of the general conformity rule, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is required to submit SIP revisions containing transportation
and general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November
25, 1994 and December 1, 1994, respectively. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they
are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(V) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation
request. 

On July 21, 1994, the Commonwealth of Kentucky revised their maintenance plan to commit to revise the SIP by November
25, 1994, to be consistent with the final Federal regulations on conformity. In addition, the Division for Air Quality
and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet are cooperating in adopting regulations consistent with the final conformity
regulation. 


b. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 


The CAA was amended on November 15, 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.
EPA was required to classify O

3

 nonattainment areas according to the severity of their problem. On November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694), the Ashland-Huntington
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was designated as moderate O

3

 nonattainment. Because the Ashland-Huntington area is a moderate O

3

 nonattainment area, it is required to have met the requirements of sections 182(a), (b) and (f) of the CAA. EPA has analyzed
the SIP and determined which requirements have been met and for which requirements further action is required. In
the instances where further action is required, SIP revisions meeting those requirements must be fully approved
in order for EPA to find that all the applicable 
requirements of the CAA have been met. Thus, final approval of this redesignation is contingent upon the final approval
of the additional SIP submittals described below.

(1) Section 182(a)(1)_Emissions Inventory. 

Section 182(a)(1) of the CAA required an inventory of all actual emissions from all sources, as described in section
172(c)(3) to be submitted by November 15, 1992. On November 13, 1992, the Cabinet submitted an emission inventory
on the Ashland-Huntington area. The Cabinet submitted revisions on October 15, 1993, and July 8, 1994, addressing
EPA comments. EPA is proposing to approve the inventory in this notice. Final approval of this redesignation is contingent
on final approval of the emissions inventory. 


(2) Section 182(a)(2), 182(b)(2)_Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). 

Subsequent to the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments, Boyd county was designated as not meeting the O

3

 NAAQS on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962). The Commonwealth was subsequently required to revise its O

3

 SIP for this area to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Clean Air Act. On January 25, 1980,
August 7, 1981, November 24, 1981, November 30, 1981, and March 30, 1983, EPA fully approved Kentucky's SIP as meeting
the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 6092, 46 FR 40188, 46 FR 57486, 46 FR 58080, and
48 FR 13168). On December 31, 1987, EPA deemed that this control strategy had not resulted in the attainment of the NAAQS
for O

3

 in the Ashland-Huntington area. Consequently, Greer C. Tidwell, Region 4 Regional Administrator, sent a letter
to Wallace G. Wilkinson, Governor of Kentucky, on May 26, 1988. This letter, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the
1977 CAA, notified Kentucky that the SIP was substantially inadequate to achieve the NAAQS for O

3

 in Ashland-Huntington and called upon the Commonwealth to revise the SIP. 
The 1990 CAA amended section 182(a)(2)(A), and Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that O

3

 nonattainment areas correct their deficient RACT rules for O

3

 (RACT Fix-ups). Areas designated nonattainment before amendment of the CAA and which retained that designation
and were classified as marginal or above as of enactment are required to meet the RACT Fix-ups requirement. Under section
182(a)(2)(A), those areas were required by May 15, 1991, to correct RACT regulations as required under pre-amendment
guidance.

1

 The SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated corrections necessary for specific nonattainment
areas. Ashland-Huntington was previously subject to RACT requirements for ozone. Therefore, this area is subject
to the RACT fix-up requirement and the May 15, 1991, deadline. 




The 1990 CAA also amended section 182(b)(2) which required RACT on all major sources of VOCs for O

3

 nonattainment areas designated moderate and above (RACT Catch-ups) by November 15, 1992. The RACT Catch-ups provision
required the state to submit a revision to the SIP to implement RACT on: (1) each category of VOC sources in the area covered
by a CTG document issued between the enactment of the CAA and the date of attainment; (2) all VOC sources in the area covered
by any CTG issued before the date of the CAA; and (3) all other major stationary sources of VOCs that are located in the
area. 
Kentucky failed to meet the May 15, 1991, deadline date for RACT fix-ups and EPA notified the Commonwealth on June 25,
1991, that a finding of failure to submit had been made. This finding of failure to submit was published on October 22,
1991 (56 FR 54554), triggering the: (1) 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section
179(a); (2) the Administrator's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m); and (3) the 2-year
time clock for promulgation of the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) VOC regulations for this area as required by
section 110(c)(1). 
The 18-month period prior to application of mandatory sanctions ended on April 22, 1993. Kentucky submitted SIP revisions
through the Cabinet to EPA on February 12, 1992, October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993, all prior to
the April 22, 1993, deadline. Because the revisions addressed all RACT Fix-up deficiencies and were found to contain
all required administrative and technical components, the 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions
under section 179(a) was stopped. A 

Federal Register

 approving the SIP revision submitted on February 12, 1992, was published on October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54516). A 

Federal Register

 approving the SIP revisions submitted on October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993, was published on June
23, 1994 (59 FR 32343). 
The February 12, 1992, October 20, 1992, February 17, 1993, and March 4, 1993, submittals also addressed all of the
RACT Catch-up requirements except the requirement of RACT on all other major stationary sources of VOC that are located
in the area, i.e., all sources that are not covered by a CTG. There is one source in the Ashland-Huntington area that
is not covered by a CTG. This source will be subject to a source specific SIP revision requiring VOC RACT. Action on this
SIP revision will be under a separate notice on or before final action is taken on this redesignation request. The approval
of this redesignation request is contingent upon the approval of this source specific SIP revision. 


(3) Section 182(a)(3)_Emissions Statements. 

Section 182(a)(3) of the CAA required that the SIP be revised by November 15, 1992, to require stationary sources of
oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

) and VOCs to provide the state with a statement showing actual emission each year. On January 15, 1993, the Cabinet
submitted an emission statement rule. The Cabinet will submit revisions to the emission statement rule to address
EPA comments. Action on this SIP revision will be under a separate notice on or before final action is taken on this redesignation
request. Final approval of this redesignation is contingent on final approval of the emissions statement rule.

(4) Section 182(b)(1)_15% Progress Plans. 

Section 182(b)(1) of the CAA required states to submit a revision to the SIP by November 15, 1993, to provide for VOC
emission reductions by November 15, 1996, of at least 15% from baseline emissions accounting for any growth in emissions
after the date of enactment of the CAA. The Commonwealth failed to submit the required revisions and as a result, on
April 1, 1994, EPA issued a finding letter notifying Kentucky of a finding of failure to submit. This finding of failure
to submit triggered the: (1) 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a); (2)
the Administrator's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m); and (3) the 2-year time clock
for promulgation of the FIP 15% regulations for this area as required by section 110(c)(1). However, the letter acknowledges
the submittal of this redesignation request to attainment and stated that if the redesignation request to attainment
is approved then requirements for a 15% plan SIP will be unnecessary for the Ashland-Huntington area. Therefore,
upon approval of this redesignation request, the sanctions clock will stop. As the requirement to submit a 15% plan
did not come due until November 15, 1993, the 15% plan requirement is not an applicable requirement for purposes of
the evaluation of this redesignation request. 


(5) Section 182(b)(3)_Stage II. 

Section 182(b)(3) of the CAA required moderate areas to implement Stage II gasoline vapor recovery systems unless
and until EPA promulgated onboard vapor recovery (OBVR) regulations. On January 24, 1994, EPA promulgated the OBVR
rule, and, as section 202(a)(b) of the CAA provides that once the rule is promulgated, moderate areas are no longer
required to implement Stage II. Thus, the Stage II vapor recovery requirement of section 182(b)(3) is no longer an
applicable requirement. 


(6) Section 182(b)(4)_Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M). 

The CAA required all moderate and above areas to revise the SIP to include provisions necessary to provide for a vehicle
inspection and maintenance program. The Commonwealth failed to submit the required revisions and as a result, on
April 1, 1994, EPA issued a finding letter notifying Kentucky of a finding of failure to submit. This finding of failure
to submit triggered the: (1) 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a); (2)
the Administrator's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m); and (3) the 2-year time clock
for promulgation of the FIP I/M regulations for this area as required by section 110(c)(1). However, the letter acknowledges
the submittal of this redesignation request to attainment and stated that if the redesignation request to attainment
is approved then requirements for an I/M SIP will be necessary for the Ashland-Huntington area only as a contingency
measure. Therefore, when this redesignation request is approved, the sanctions clock will stop and the program will
be a contingency measure in the maintenance plan. 


(7) Section 182(b)(5)_New Source Review (NSR). 

The CAA required all classified nonattainment areas to meet several requirements regarding NSR, including provisions
to ensure that increased emissions of VOCs compounds will not result from any new or major source modifications and
a general offset rule. The Cabinet submitted a NSR rule on February 17, 1993, to incorporate VOC and NO

X

 permit review requirements for new and modified sources in Kentucky's O

3

 nonattainment areas. The revised permit requirements meet new offset ratios and additional provisions for moderate
O

3

 nonattainment areas. This rule was approved by EPA on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32343). (EPA notes that under the policy announced
in the memorandum, ``Part D New Source Review (part D NSR) Requirements for Areas Requesting Redesignation to Attainment'',
dated October 14, 1994, from Mary D. Nichols to Air Division Directors I-X, approval of the NSR submittal is not
necessarily required for approval of a redesignation.) 


(8) Section 182(f)_Oxides of Nitrogen (NO

X

) 

requirements. 

Section 182(f) of the CAA requires states with areas designated nonattainment for O

3

 and classified as moderate and above to impose the same control requirements for major stationary sources of NO

X

 as apply to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These control requirements, NO

X

 RACT and NO

X

 NSR, were to be submitted to EPA in a SIP revision by November 15, 1992. EPA adopted a policy pursuant to section 110(k)(4)
of the CAA to conditionally approve NO

X

 RACT SIPs which committed to provide EPA with specific enforceable measures within one year of the date of approval
of the commitment. EPA's committal SIP policy was challenged in 

Natural Resources Defense Council v. Browner_

in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full Opinion, dated May 6, 1994, the
Court found that EPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded the EPA's statutory authority, but concluded
that ``EPA properly extended'' to November 15, 1993, the deadline for submittal of fully enforceable NO

X

 RACT SIPs. As a result of this court case, the deadline to submit NO

X

 RACT rules was November 15, 1993. Therefore, because that date is after the Commonwealth submitted the redesignation
request, NO

X

 RACT is not an applicable requirement for this redesignation request.

3. The Area Has a Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the CAA


Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended
CAA, EPA has determined that Kentucky will have a fully approved O

3

 SIP under section 110(k) for the moderate nonattainment area when EPA approves SIP submissions regarding the emissions
inventory, VOC RACT for stationary sources not covered by a CTG, and emission statements. Final action will be taken
prior to or at the same time as final approval of this redesignation. 


4. The Air Quality Improvement Must Be Permanent and Enforceable


Several control measures have come into place since the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area violated the O

3

 NAAQS. Of these control measures, the reduction of fuel volatility from 10.5 psi in 1988 to 9.0 psi in 1992, as measured
by the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), and fleet turnover due to the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) produced
the most significant decreases in VOC emissions. The table below lists the actual enforceable emission reductions
which are responsible for the recent air quality improvement in the Kentucky portion of the nonattainment area. The
VOC emissions in the base year are not artificially low due to a depressed economy. The technical support document
(TSD) contains additional information on these reductions. 





5. The Area Must Have a Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Pursuant to Section 175A of the CAA


Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the state must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. 
In this notice, EPA is proposing approval of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's maintenance plan for the Ashland-Huntington
nonattainment area because EPA finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky's submittal meets the requirements of section
175A. 



A. Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory 


On November 13, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted comprehensive inventories of VOC, NO

X

, and CO emissions from the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area. The inventory included biogenic, area, stationary,
and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory was
projected to a 1993 attainment inventory using population growth rates. The 1993 inventory can serve as an attainment
inventory because the O

3

 NAAQS was not violated during the 1993 year. The CO and the biogenic VOC values are included as a part of the 1990 base
year emission inventory. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by county and source category.
Finally, this inventory was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance
year inventories are included in this notice for VOCs and NO

X

. Refer to the TSD accompanying this notice for more in-depth details regarding the base year inventory for the Ashland-Huntington
nonattainment area. This notice proposes approval of the base year inventory for the Ashland-Huntington area. 






B. Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories


As summarized in the following tables, totals for VOC, and NO

X

 emissions were projected from the 1990 base year, to the 1993 attainment year and out to 2005. These projected inventories
were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. Refer to EPA's TSD accompanying this notice for more in-depth details
regarding the projected inventory for the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area.

Projections indicate that there was an emissions decrease in VOCs and NO

X

 in the nonattainment area from the 1993 attainment baseyear to 2005. However, the projections show a temporary increase
in NO

X

 emissions of less than 2%. EPA believes this increase to be insignificant, and therefore, EPA believes that these
emissions projections demonstrate that the nonattainment area will continue to maintain the O

3

 NAAQS. 


C. Verification of Continued Attainment 


Continued attainment of the O

3

 NAAQS in the nonattainment area depends, in part, on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's efforts toward tracking indicators
of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The Cabinet will develop periodic emission inventories
every three years beginning in 1996 and will evaluate these periodic inventories to see if they exceed the baseline
emission inventory by more than 10%. If a 10% exceedance occurs, the state will evaluate existing control measures
to see if any further emission reduction measures should be implemented. 
The Commonwealth of Kentucky's contingency plan can also be triggered by an air quality exceedance. If an exceedance
occurs, the Commonwealth will evaluate existing control measures to see if any further emission reduction measures
should be implemented. The Commonwealth of Kentucky contingency plan 

will be
