ADMINISTRATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE UNITED STATES 


Proposed Information Collection Request Submitted to OMB 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Administrative Conference of the United States.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administrative Conference of the United States has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for
approval a proposed version of an interview protocol to be used in an evaluation of the Environmental Protection Agency's
negotiated rulemaking program. Potential interviewees include participants in selected negotiated rulemaking
processes and selected rulemakings undertaken under conventional rulemaking processes. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Administrative Conference of the United States is sponsoring an evaluation of the use of negotiated rulemaking
at the Environmental Protection Agency. A portion of the evaluation involves use of an interview protocol to gather
information from participants in several of EPA's negotiated rulemakings, which will be compared to information
gathered from participants in several rulemakings that EPA conducted using conventional rulemaking procedures.
Interviewees will be drawn from samples of participants, including agency personnel, the regulated communities,
state and local governments and others who participated in the rulemaking processes. The total burden is estimated
to be 400 hours. The average burden per respondent is expected to be one hour, and will occur only once. It is expected
that there will be approximately 400 respondents. The Administrative Conference has asked the OMB for expedited
review of this request.

The petitioner submitted comments concerning the respondents' questionnaire responses on September 16 and October
16, 1994. 
At the request of the petitioner, on October 18, 1994, the Department postponed its preliminary determination until
no later than December 9, 1994 (59 FR 53634, October 25, 1994). 
On October 7, 1994, the respondents' counsel submitted comments concerning surrogate country selection. The petitioner
submitted its comments on October 7 and 14, 1994. 
On November 3, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to all producers and exporters in the investigation.
The respondents submitted responses to these questionnaires on November 21, 22, 23 and December 8, 1994. 


Postponement of Final Determination 


Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on December 9, 1994, the respondents requested that, in the event of an
affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the Department postpone its final determination
until 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination in the 

Federal Register

. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling reasons
for denial exist, we are doing so. 


Scope of the Investigation 


The product covered by this investigation is furfuryl alcohol (C

4

H

3

OCH

2

OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or a pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture
of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble
dyes. 
The product subject to this investigation is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.0000 of the U.S. Harmonized
Tariff Schedule (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written
description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 


Period of Investigation 


The period of investigation (POI) is December 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994. 


Nonmarket Economy Country Status 


The Department has treated the PRC as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (

see, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Saccharin from the PRC 

(59 FR 58818, November 15, 1994). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn
our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as
an NME for purposes of this investigation. 


Separate Rates 


Qingdao I&E and Sinochem Shandong I&E each has requested that it be assigned a separate, company-specific
dumping margin. Their respective business licenses each indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated
in the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China 

(59 FR 22585, 22586, May 2, 1994) (

Silicon Carbide

), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these
two respondents are eligible for consideration for separate rates. 
To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes
each exporting entity under a test arising out of the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China 

(56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (

Sparklers

) and amplified in 

Silicon Carbide

. Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where the respondents can demonstrate
the absence of both 

de jure 

and 

de facto 

governmental control over export activities.

1. Absence of De Jure Control 



The respondents in this investigation have submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of 

de jure

 control. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,''
adopted on April 13, 1988 (

1988 Law

) and ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved
on August 23, 1992 (

1992 Regulations

), both of which indicate that the responsibility for managing enterprises ``owned by all of the people'' is with the
enterprises themselves and not with the government. They have also submitted the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration
of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (

Export Provisions

). 

The 

1988 Law 

and 

1992 Regulations 

shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 

1988 Law 

provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible
for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers, and purchase their own goods and materials. The 

1988 Law 

also has other provisions which support a finding that enterprises have management independence from the government.
The 

1992 Regulations 

provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production
decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell
their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII);
dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval (Article
XVII). 

The 

Export Provisions 

list those products subject to direct government control. While furfuryl alcohol is included on the list of commodities
that are subject to export quotas, the quotas are confined to exports to the countries of the European Community and
Japan and are not applicable to PRC exports to the United States. There is no indication that the export prices to the
United States of furfuryl alcohol are subject to governmental control. 

The existence of these enactments indicates that Qingdao I&E and Sinochem Shandong I&E are not 

de jure 

subject to governmental control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and
regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC
Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' 

in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93-133 

(July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that an analysis of 

de facto 

control is critical to determining whether the respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control. 



2. Absence of De Facto Control 



The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to 

de facto 

governmental control of its export functions: (1) whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of
a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements;
(3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management;
and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding
disposition of profits or financing of losses (

see Silicon Carbide

). 

Qingdao I&E and Sinochem Shandong I&E each has asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices; (2)
it negotiates contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management operates
with a high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government control over
selection of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to sell its assets
and to obtain loans. In addition, questionnaire responses indicating that company-specific pricing during the
POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters (

i.e.

, the prices for comparable products differ among companies). This information supports a preliminary finding that
there is a 

de facto

 absence of governmental control of export functions. 

Consequently, Qingdao I&E and Sinochem Shandong I&E have preliminarily met the criteria for the application
of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses
are supported by verifiable documentation.

Surrogate Country



Where the Department is investigating imports from an NME, section 773(c)(1) of the Act directs us to base foreign
market value (FMV) on the NME producers' factors of production, valued in a market economy that is at a level of economic
development comparable to that of the NME under investigation and that is a significant producer of comparable merchandise.
We have done so in this case.

Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent
possible, in one or more market economies that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME
country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that Indonesia
is the most suitable surrogate for purposes of this investigation. Based on available statistical information,
Indonesia is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC. Further, Indonesian government statistics
and other data indicate that the country is a significant producer of the product under investigation. Based on available
information, Indonesia is the only surrogate country, of those identified by our Office of Policy, that meets both
of these criteria. For those factors that we have been unable to value using information from Indonesia, we have used
India as the surrogate. India is economically comparable to the PRC and is a significant producer of furfuryl, which
is comparable to furfuryl alcohol within the meaning of section 773(c)(1). Furfuryl is the feedstock, and the major
input, in the production of furfuryl alcohol. When a furfuryl producer sees a demand for furfuryl alcohol, the facilities
necessary to produce the furfuryl alcohol are usually added on site. (

See

, memorandum to the file from Donna Lea Berg to John Brinkmann, Surrogate Producers of Furfuryl Alcohol, dated November
22, 1994, and memorandum from David Mueller, Director, Office of Policy to Gary Taverman, Director, Office of Antidumping
Investigations, dated August 2, 1994, Furfuryl Alcohol from the People's Republic of China, Non-Market Economy
Status and Surrogate Country Selection.)



Fair Value Comparisons



To determine whether sales of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC by Qingdao I&E and Sinochem Shandong I&E were
made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of the notice.



United States Price



We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
directly by the Chinese exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States.

For the two responding exporters, we calculated purchase price based on packed, CIF U.S.-port or FOB Chinese-port
prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. As necessary, we made deductions for foreign inland freight,
containerization, port storage, foreign brokerage and handling expenses, and marine insurance, valued in India.
Where applicable, we made deductions for ocean freight based on rates of a market-economy shipper. (For a complete
analysis of USP deductions, see the calculation memorandum for this proceeding on file in Room B-099 of the Main
Commerce Department building.)



Foreign Market Value



In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories
in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the two responding exporters. To calculate FMV, the reported
factor quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values from Indonesia for those inputs purchased
domestically from PRC suppliers. Where inputs were imported from market economy countries and paid for in a market
economy currency, we used the actual costs incurred by the producers to value those factors (

see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic
of China

, 56 FR 55271, October 25, 1991).

The respondents have argued that the PRC prices for the major input in the production of furfuryl alcohol (

i.e.

, furfuryl) are market determined. Thus, the respondents assert that the Department should rely on the domestic prices
of furfuryl in the PRC. We disagree with this argument and have not used the prices for these inputs in calculating FMV.
Our practice is to afford respondents the opportunity to show that the 

subject merchandise

 is produced within a market-oriented industry. Showing that a respondent purchases one input at a market-determined
price is relevant to but, alone, not sufficient for granting market-oriented treatment (

see e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the PRC

, 57 FR 29705, July 6, 1992).

<TEXT>
 

In determining which surrogate value to use for each factor of production that was not sourced from a market-economy
country, we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information that is: (1) an average non-export
value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party, or most contemporaneous
with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive. 

With the exception of corn cobs and furfuryl, we used Indonesian import prices taken from the Indonesian 

Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports, 

November 1993. For furfuryl and corn cobs, we relied on a December 5, 1994, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S.
Embassy in Indonesia. We were unable to find public information on corn cobs. In the case of furfuryl, the publicly
available data that we found was inconsistent (

see

 attachment three of the concurrence memorandum to this proceeding). 

We used Indonesian transportation rates taken from a September 18, 1991, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S.
Embassy in Indonesia to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the furfuryl alcohol
factories. In those cases where the respondent failed to provide any information on transportation distances and
modes, we applied, as the best information available, the furthest distance and the more expensive mode of transport
available from the surrogate information we had selected. 

To value electricity, we used public information from 

Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region, 

(January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. For other energy inputs, we relied on values for Indonesia
published in 

Energy D&eacute;tente, 

and Indonesian 

Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports, 

November 1993. 

To value labor amounts, we used labor rates published by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department
of Labor, in 

Foreign Labor Trends_Indonesia, 

1994. 

We adjusted the factor values, when necessary, to the POI using wholesale price and consumer price indices published
by the International Monetary Fund. 

To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages specific to the furfuryl alcohol industry based on a December
2, 1994, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. 

For general expense percentages, we used the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials, labor, and overhead costs
calculated for each factory. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory
overhead, and general expenses. We did not have Indonesian values for either general expenses or profit. 

We added packing based on Indonesian values obtained from a December 2, 1994 U.S. State Department cable from the U.S.
Embassy in Jakarta. 



All Other Rate 



MOFTEC and CCCMMC have identified two PRC exporters of furfuryl alcohol to the United States during the POI. Both have
responded in this investigation. Accordingly, we have based the All Other Rate on the weighted average of the margins
calculated in this proceeding.

We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT)
decision in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. v. United States,

 834 F. Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). (

See Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Calcium Aluminate Cement, Cement Clinker and Flux
from France,

 59 FR 14136 (March 25, 1994).) 



Foreign Market Value 



In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of the subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since the total volume of subject
merchandise sold by ISL in South Africa during the POI was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third
country sales for such or similar merchandise, we determined that the home market was viable within the meaning of
19 CFR 353.48(a). Therefore, we based FMV on home market sales. 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.46, we calculated FMV based on FOB storage or delivered prices to unrelated customers.
We treated both pre-sale home market movement expenses and pre-sale home market warehousing expenses as indirect
expenses and adjusted for these expenses under the exporter's sales price offset provision set forth in 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2),
as appropriate. 

We treated post-sale home market inland freight as a direct expense and deducted this expense from FMV. Pursuant to
19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses.
We recalculated home market credit expenses based on gross prices exclusive of imputed value added tax expenses.
We also deducted from FMV rebates and the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses including, where
appropriate, inventory carrying costs, pre-sale warehousing expenses and certain home market inland freight expenses.
The deduction for home market indirect selling expenses was capped by the sum of U.S. indirect selling expenses, in
accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1) and (2). We deducted home market packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. 

We adjusted for taxes in accordance with our practice. (See the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.)


Although we allowed a discount, we did not deduct an amount for quantity discounts because ISL failed to place adequate
information on the record to demonstrate that the discount met the criteria for quantity discounts set forth in 19
CFR 353.55(b) (

see

 concurrence memorandum). We did not exclude home market sales of furfuryl alcohol packed in drums from the base of
home market sales used for comparison to U.S. sales, as requested by ISL, because ISL did not demonstrate that these
sales were outside its ordinary course of business. 



Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank. 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all information that we determine is acceptable for use in making
our final determination. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of furfuryl alcohol from South Africa that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or
after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins,
as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The less than fair value
margins are as follows: 





ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination or 45 days after
our final determination.

Foreign Market Value 



In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of the subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since the total volume of subject
merchandise sold by IRCT in Thailand during the POI was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third country
sales for such or similar merchandise, we determined that the home market was viable within the meaning of 19 CFR 353.48(a).
Therefore, we based FMV on home market sales. 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we compared U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level of trade. 

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.46, we calculated FMV based on FOB storage or delivered prices to unrelated customers.
We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight and insurance, and unloading charges. We also deducted
direct selling expenses including technical services, credit, and commissions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a).
Finally, we deducted the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses. The deduction for home market
indirect selling expenses was capped by U.S. indirect selling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and
(2). 

We deducted home market packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. 

We adjusted for value-added taxes in accordance with our practice. (

See

 the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.) 



Cost of Production 



Based on our analysis of the petitioner's allegation, we found ``reasonable grounds to believe or suspect'' that
IRCT made home market sales below its COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act. The Department initiated
an investigation to determine whether IRCT made home market sales at prices below its COP over an extended period of
time. Because IRCT's COP questionnaire response is not due until December 27, 1994, it is not possible to consider
this information for the preliminary determination. This information will be considered in our final determination.




Currency Conversion 



We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with 19 CRR 353.60. 



Preliminary Margin Calculation 



Based on the calculation methodology outlined above, we preliminarily calculate a margin of zero percent for U.S.
sales of furfuryl alcohol from Thailand. 



Verification 



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all information that we determine is acceptable for use in making
our final determination.

<USDEPT>COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Procurement List Addition </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the Procurement List.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a filter element to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons
who are blind or have other severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 5, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR
40010) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. Comments were received from the current contractor for the filter
element, indicating that addition of the element to the Procurement List would have a sizeable negative impact on
the contractor. The contractor also indicated that it had been impacted in the past two years by losing the opportunity
to bid on three other filter elements, one of which had been added to the Procurement List and the others set aside for
other Government procurement preference programs. 


In assessing the severity of impact of a Procurement List addition on a contractor, the Committee generally begins
by comparing the expected value of the contract with the current contractor's total sales. The Committee also takes
into account other recent additions to the Procurement List where the affected contractor was the current contractor.
In this case, the percentage of sales which the contractor would lose, along with the loss suffered in one recent addition
to the Procurement List, does not reach the level which the Committee considers to be severe adverse impact on the contractor.

Because no contractor is guaranteed to receive a contract under the competitive bidding system, the Committee does
not normally consider loss of the opportunity to bid on subsequent contracts to constitute severe adverse impact.
In this case, the commenting contractor was not the current contractor for the other filter element added to the Procurement
List which the contractor mentioned in its comments. Consequently, the Committee does not believe that loss of opportunity
to bid on the filter element now being added to the Procurement List adds to the severity of impact which the contractor
will experience.

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the commodity listed below is suitable for procurement by 
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity 
to the Government. 
2. The action will not have a severe economic impact on current 
contractors for the commodity. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodity to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodity proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 
Filter Element,


4130-01-103-8339. 



This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

<DOCTITLE>Procurement List Additions </DOCTITLE>

AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Additions to the Procurement List.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List tree marking 
paint and tracer element to be furnished by nonprofit agencies 
employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On September 2, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who 
Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 45666) 
of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
Comments were received from six members of Congress, the current 
contractor, two other firms that regularly bid on the items, an 
association representing paint manufacturers, and several past and 
present representatives of the Federal agency that is the primary 
user of the tree marking paints. 



Several commenters raised questions about the capability of the 
nonprofit agency to provide the tree marking paints in accordance 
with the Government's quality, quantity, and delivery requirements, 
including the possibility of negative effects on the Federal timber 
management program. They also challenged the nonprofit agency's 
ability to continue the ongoing product development efforts that 
are critical to providing the customer with a paint that is as 
effective and safe as possible. They noted that such development 
has been facilitated by the competition among paint firms to obtain 
future contracts: competition that would no longer exist if the 
paints were added to the Procurement List. 

Several other points made by more than one commenter related to 
potential problems associated with the lack of continuing competition if the tree marking paints were added to the
Procurement 
List for future provision by only one organization and its 
preferred supplier(s). The problems cited include the inability of 
the Government to continue to realize decreasing prices for the 
paints; the absence of backup capability to supply the paints in 
the event the nonprofit agency fails to perform; and adverse 
impacts on the three firms that have invested significant resources 
in developing and maintaining the capacity to furnish the paints. 
Several commenters suggested that in light of these concerns, only 
a portion of the tree marking paints required by the Government 
should be added to the Procurement List. 

With respect to the capability of the nonprofit agency to provide 
the tree marking paints in accordance with Governmental requirements, both the central nonprofit agency representing
the nonprofit 
agency in question and the Government agency which purchases the 


paints have inspected the nonprofit agency. Both have informed the 
Committee that they consider the nonprofit agency capable of 
supplying the paints in accordance with Governmental quality, 
quantity, and delivery requirements. The customer has also 
certified that the nonprofit agency's tree marking paints meet its 
Qualified Products List requirements. 

In regard to the other points, the Committee is satisfied that the 
approach to be used by the nonprofit agency in supplying the paints 
will avoid the problems raised by the commenters, and has concluded 
that splitting the requirement would be inappropriate. The 
nonprofit agency's approach will permit current and past contractors for the paints, as well as other suppliers with
expertise 
in paint formulation, to compete annually to supply the nonprofit 
agency with the paints or base concentrates that constitute the 
major part of the end product furnished to the Government. 

The opportunity for continued substantial involvement_on a 
competitive basis_in supplying the paints should provide ample 
incentive for profit-making paint contractors to participate in 
future development efforts associated with these particular paints. 
The Committee is also persuaded that the nonprofit agency will be 
able to support ongoing product development efforts because of its 
track record in working with paint firms to upgrade and reformulate 
other paints being supplied to the Government under the JWOD 
Program. In addition, in the unlikely event that none of the three 
commenting paint firms decides to compete to supply the paint, the 


nonprofit agency has promised to work with another firm (or firms) 
to develop a different Qualified Products List tree marking paint. 
This will assure that the incentive to continue improving the 
product to achieve a competitive advantage remains. 

Continuing competition among qualified firms to supply the paints 
will also provide the opportunity for further price reductions as 
a result of competition. If such competition produces reductions 
in the price of the paints or concentrates, the Committee's fair 
market pricing system will pass along those reductions to the 
Government. 

With respect to backup capability, the continued involvement of the 
three paint firms which commented in supplying materials for the 
tree marking paints in question, as well as tree marking paint 
sales by at least one of those firms to other markets support a 
conclusion that they could assume responsibility for furnishing the 
product if the nonprofit agency experienced problems. Moreover, 
the nonprofit agency has provided information demonstrating backup 
capability using one of its other facilities as well as commercial 
aerosol packagers. 

In considering impact on the three commenting paint firms of adding 
the tree marking paints to the Procurement List, the Committee 
noted that each will retain the opportunity to compete to supply a 
substantial component of the end product. Consequently, any 
potential impact on those suppliers of placing the tree marking 
paints on the Procurement List is significantly less than would be 

the case if they had no sales prospects associated with the paints. 
However, even in the absence of the opportunity to compete, none of 
the commenting firms will in the Committee's judgment experience 
severe adverse impact as a result of the addition of the paints to 
the Procurement List.

With respect to the current contractor, the annual value of this 
contract represents an extremely small percentage of its total 
sales. As a result, even taking into account that firm's recent 
investment in specialized filling equipment, the Committee does not 
consider the loss in question to constitute severe adverse impact. 
With respect to the other two firms, one of which has not received 
a contract for these paints for several years, because neither is 
a current contractor, their objections to the addition must be 
considered objections to losing the opportunity to bid on future 
procurements for the tree marking paints. Under the competitive 
bidding system, no bidder is guaranteed that it will receive a 
contract. Accordingly, the Committee does not consider loss of the 
opportunity to bid on future procurements to constitute severe 
adverse impact. 

Several commenters questioned whether the nonprofit agency would 
meet the requirement of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act that 75 
percent of the direct labor hours be performed by people who are 
blind. One commenter suggested that the action might not create 
much employment for people who are blind. Another question 

involved the appropriateness of a majority of the sales dollars 
going to a for-profit company. 

The JWOD Act's direct labor requirement with regard to nonprofit 
agencies employing blind persons stipulates that 75% of the total 
direct labor hours performed by such a nonprofit agency be carried 
out by people who are blind. Contrary to the suggestion by certain 
commenters and confirmed by a court decision, there is no 
requirement that 75% of the total direct labor required to produce 
a commodity be performed by people who are blind. Every year for 
the past decade, people who are blind have performed over 85% of 
the direct labor hours at the nonprofit agency in question. 
Consequently, the Committee has concluded that the organization not 
only meets, but substantially exceeds the direct labor requirements 
of the JWOD Act. 

In considering items for the Procurement List, the Committee 
focuses on the amount of employment the item will generate for 
people with severe disabilities. The amount of sales dollars paid 
to for-profit entities is not an appropriate criterion since 
providing most commodities to the Government requires nonprofit 
agencies to make substantial purchases of materials from for-profit 
firms. In this case, the Committee is satisfied that the amount of 
employment that will be generated for people who are blind 
justifies placing the paints on the Procurement List. 

Two commenters mentioned the risk assessment study currently 
underway because of Federal employee concerns about the paints' 

effects on their health and safety. One questioned the nonprofit 
agency's ability to develop any new formulations required as a 
result of the study, while another expressed concerns that the 
study would be compromised by the addition of another paint. As 
indicated above, the Committee is satisfied that the nonprofit 
agency, working with other firms involved in formulating paints, 
will be able to develop new formulations in response to internal or 
external initiatives. In addition, both the nonprofit agency and 
the Federal agency which has commissioned the risk assessment study 
confirmed that the nonprofit agency's Qualified Products List 
paints are already included in the study. Consequently, the 
Committee has concluded that adding the paints to the JWOD Program 
will not compromise the study's results. 

Two of the three commenting paint firms argued that tree marking 
paints should not be added to the Committee's Procurement List 
because they are not commodities and, thus, the Committee has no 
authority over them. The firms argue that the paints are very 
complex and time-consuming to produce, while a commodity is a 
commonly available item. 

The word ``commodity,'' as used in the JWOD Act, is a generic term 
for a product. Nonprofit agencies are currently producing many 
highly complex items for the Government under the JWOD Program. 
Some of these, like the tree marking paints, are Qualified Products 
List items. The Committee finds no basis in its legislation or 
past practice that would lend credibility to the contention that 


tree marking paints are not commodities within the meaning of the 
Act. 

Several commenters, including all three paint firms, contended that 
the nonprofit agency would not be able to supply the paints at fair 
market prices as required by the JWOD Act. One cited the agency's 
inability to win the contract through the competitive bidding pro- 
cess as evidence of its position. The nonprofit agency has been 
advised of the fair market prices as calculated from the most 
recent set of bids on the basis of the Committee's fair market 
pricing procedures. The nonprofit agency has indicated through its 
central nonprofit agency that it is willing to supply the paints 
using those prices as the base prices for the paints, in accordance 
with the Committee's fair market pricing system. 

Comments were also received regarding concerns about the adverse 
impact of adding the tree marking paints to the Procurement List on 
the economies of areas in which two of the three paint firms have 
production facilities. The Committee believes that any potential 
impact on these areas' economies is outweighed by the creation of 
employment for people who are blind, whose national unemployment 
rate substantially exceeds that of people who are not blind or do 
not have severe disabilities. 

One of the paint firms commented that the nonprofit agency is not 
a manufacturer or regular dealer under the Walsh-Healey Public 
Contracts Act, and thus should not be permitted to supply the 
paints under the JWOD Program. The manufacturer/regular dealer 

requirement was repealed by section 7201 of the Federal Acquisition 
Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103-455.

One Federal agency representative commented that, contrary to the 
Committee's finding in its notice announcing the proposed addition, 
placing the paints on the Procurement List would result in 
additional reporting by the Federal Government. However, the 
Committee's finding, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 
applied to additional reporting requirements on small entities, not 
on the Federal Government. This same commenter challenged the 
Committee's statement in its proposal notice that there are no 
known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the JWOD Act 
objectives in connection with the tree marking paints. Since the 
commenter suggested no such alternatives and did not explain his 
conclusion, the Committee has no basis on which to determine that 
some other alternative exists. 

As a result of changes in the nonprofit agency's supply approach 
following the comment period, representatives of the three commenting paint firms and their trade association appeared
before several 
Committee members and staff prior to the preparation of a decision 
package. At that meeting, they identified potential obstacles to 
supplying the nonprofit agency with paints or concentrates. 
Problems cited included liability risks for the paint firms since 
they could not control the nonprofit agency's treatment of their 
paints during the packaging and distribution process, the complex 
nature of the paints, and the possibility that the approach 
proposed might result in flawed paints because they would have to 
be handled by a second entity prior to reaching the customer. 

One paint company representative questioned the ability of the 
nonprofit agency to schedule shipments from the paint companies and 
to the customer in a way that was consistent with the paints' 
shelf-life requirements. Another representative expressed doubt 
that her firm could compete with a paint or concentrate supplier 
located in the same town as the nonprofit agency. All requested 
additional time to explore the problems and opportunities associated with supplying the paints or concentrates
to the nonprofit 
agency. 

The Committee recognizes that the approach to be used by the 
nonprofit agency differs from that currently being employed by the 
paint companies, but is not persuaded by the evidence presented 
that the obstacles cited by the paint companies and their association are insurmountable. The Committee notes that
working out 
liability responsibilities with suppliers is a normal business 
process and that at least two of the four firms identified as 
potential suppliers of the paints or concentrates have not raised 
the liability issue as a concern. Moreover, the nonprofit agency 
has indicated that the application of routine testing procedures 
would identify responsibility for any problems with the paints, 
thus eliminating the paint manufacturers' concerns that they would 
be held liable for mistakes made by others. The Committee believes that these same testing procedures will assure
that the products 
received by Government customers meet Federal specifications. 

With respect to potential shelf-life problems, the Committee 
believes that the nonprofit agency's record with other products 
with shelf-lives, including paints and a first aid kit containing 
several medical items, demonstrates that the agency's quality 
control expertise is sufficient to prevent the shipment of paints 
without adequate shelf-lives. The Committee does not believe the 
objection of one paint company to competing with a supplier in the 
nonprofit agency's city is a sufficent reason for rejecting the 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. Location advantages and 
disadvantages are present in all open market competition, and other 
factors often outweigh disadvantages associated with transportation 
costs. In this respect, the Committee notes that although the 
other two firms have similar location disadvantages, neither has 
raised this as an obstacle. 

At the end of the appearance, the Committee gave the paint companies and trade association an opportunity to submit
written versions 
of their presentations, which they decided against doing. The 
Government agency which buys the paints needs to procure them 
immediately. In the absence of evidence that the Committee's 
proposed approach would cause insurmountable problems in producing 
the paint, the Committee has decided that no further delay in 
adding the paints to the Procurement List is acceptable.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the Procurement List.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a service to be 
furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or 
have other severe disabilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On July 1, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 33958) of 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 


Comments were received during the development phase of this 
addition to the Procurement List from the current contractor, who 
alleged that the Committee had failed to follow its own regulations 
by not giving him actual notice of the proposed addition. The 
contractor also alleged that loss of this Brunswick Naval Air 
Station contract, together with two others lost to the Committee's 
program in 1993 and the probable loss of another in 1994 would have 
a significant impact on the contractor's business. The contractor 
also alleged that the Committee and NISH are prejudicial towards it 
in their choices of services being added to the Procurement List. 

The Committee is required by its law, at 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2), to use 
the informal rulemaking procedure set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553 when 
adding commodities or services to the Procurement List. This 
rulemaking procedure mandates notice in the 

Federal Register

 rather 
than actual notice to affected parties. In this case, the 
contractor later received actual notice, as the Committee wrote to 
him requesting sales data for the company and responding to the 
other allegations in his comments. The Committee's letter, and a 
subsequent telephone conversation between the contractor and the 
Committee's Executive Director, emphasized that the Committee would 
consider the impact of the addition on the contractor to be minimal 
if the data was not submitted. Nevertheless, the contractor failed 
to submit the data and conceded in the telephone conversation that 
the impact of losing the Brunswick contract alone would not be 
severe. 

In reaching its conclusion that adding the Brunswick food service 
to the Procurement List would not have a severe adverse impact on 
the contractor, the Committee took into account the impact of the 
two 1993 additions to the Procurement List, as well as a 1989 addi 
tion where the firm was the current contractor. The Committee also 
declined to process an addition action for the other contract (a 
food service in Mississippi) mentioned by the contractor as a 
possible additional loss to the Committee's program. This decision 
reflected the Committee's concern that placing the Mississippi food 
service contract on the Procurement List at this time might cause 
severe adverse impact on the contractor. As the decision 
indicates, the Committee has taken pains to assure that its actions 
do not have a disproportional impact on this contractor, so the 
Committee denies any prejudice towards the contractor. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, 
fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or 
most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the 
service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the service 
to the Government. 
2. The action will not have a severe economic impact on current 
contractors for the service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the service proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 



Food Service Attendant, 
Naval Air Station Galley, 
Building 201, 
New Brunswick, Maine

 


This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

 On July 15, 29, October 21, 28 and November 4, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely
Disabled published notices (59 F.R. 36168, 38586, 53141, 54169 and 55256) of proposed additions to the Procurement

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning

2. The action will not have a severe economic impact on current 
contractors for the commodities, military resale commodities and

accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodities, military 
resale commodities and services proposed for addition to the 
Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following commodities, military resale

Notice of Intent To Prepare Environmental Impact Statement for the Conversion of F-15 Fighter Aircraft at Dobbins
AFB, Marietta, Georgia, to B-1B Bomber Aircraft at Robins AFB, Warner Robins, GA


The United States Air Force and the Air National Guard are announcing their intent to prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) to analyze the proposed action regarding the conversion of F-15 fighter aircraft at Dobbins
AFB, Marietta, GA to B-1B bomber aircraft at Robins AFB, Warner Robins, GA. This will be known as the Robins B-1B
EIS.
The Air National Guard also proposes to modify training airspace that services the Savannah Combat Readiness Training
Center (CRTC) area. Existing charted airspace which includes the Quick Thrust Military Operations Areas (MOAs),
Fort Stewart MOAs, Gator MOAs, would be modified and named Coastal MOA. Restricted Area R-3007 would also be
modified. These proposed modifications are primarily designed to accommodate realistic training requirements
for military fighter units including Air Force, Navy and Marines and would also satisfy realistic training requirements
of the B-1B.
The proposed actions under consideration would address the conversion of the F-15 aircraft to B-1B aircraft
and the resultant potential environmental impacts at both sites, the airspace training requirements for the B-1B
in the region, and the modification of training airspace servicing the Savannah CRTC.
The Air Force and Air National Guard are planning to conduct a series of Scoping meetings on the following dates and
times at the indicated locations:



1. A. L. Burruss Auditorium, Southern College of Technology, Marietta, Georgia, January 5, 1995, 7:00 PM.
2. Wellston Center, 155 Maple Street, Warner Robins, Georgia, January 10 and 11, 1995, 7:00 PM
3. Altamaha Technical Institute Auditorium, Jesup, Georgia, January 12, 1995, 7:00 PM.



The purpose of these meetings is to present information concerning the proposed actions and alternatives under consideration
and to solicit public input with respect to issues to be addressed, effort to be expended, and alternatives that should
be addressed in the EIS. Questions or clarifications concerning the proposal or any other information presented
will be answered as they relate to the scope of the effort anticipated.
The Scoping meetings will include opportunities for clarification of the proposal and statements from representatives
of government agencies and the public. To ensure the maximum opportunity for public participation, initial presentations
and questions by individuals will be limited to a maximum of five minutes until all those desiring an opportunity to
speak have been accommodated. Additional presentations and questions will be accepted at the end of the meeting.
Submission of written comments and questions will be accepted. Submission of written comments is encouraged but
is not required. Written comments and questions of any length submitted at the meeting or during the scoping period
will be considered in their entirety and will carry the same weight as oral comment.
To ensure the Air Force and the Air National Guard have sufficient time to consider public input on issues and alternatives
in the preparation of the Draft EIS, comments should be submitted to the address below by February 1, 1995. The Air Force
and Air National Guard will accept comments at the address below at any time during the environmental impact analysis
process.
For further information concerning the preparation of the EIS for the Robins B-1B EIS, or to provide written
comment, contact: Program Manager, Robins B-1 EIS, Air National Guard Readiness Center, ANGRC/CEVP, 3500
Fetchet Avenue, Andrews Air Force Base, MD 20331-5157.

An applicant should note that the U.S. Postal Service does not uniformly provide a dated postmark. Before relying
on this method, an applicant should check with its local post office.
An applicant is encouraged to use registered or at least first class mail. Institutions that submit institutional
participation applications and required documents after the closing date will not be considered for funding under
the campus-based programs for award year 1995-96.


Applications and Required Documents Delivered by Hand. 

An institutional participation application and required documents delivered by hand must be taken to the U.S. Department
of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education, Institutional Participation Division, 7th & D Streets, S.W.,
GSA Building, Room 3532, Washington, D.C. 20407. We will accept hand-delivered applications between 8:00 a.m. and
4:30 p.m. (Eastern time) daily, except Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. An institutional participation
application for the 1995-96 award year that is delivered by hand will not be accepted after 4:30 p.m. on the closing
date.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the three campus-based programs, the Secretary allocates funds to eligible institutions of higher education.
The Secretary will not allocate funds under the campus-based programs for award year 1995-96 to any currently
ineligible institution unless the institution files its ``Application for Institutional Participation'' and
other required documents by the closing date. If the institution submits its institutional participation application
or other required documents after the closing date, the Secretary will use this application in determining the institution's
eligibility to participate in the campus-based programs beginning with the 1996-97 award year.



For purposes of this notice, ineligible institutions only include:

(1) An institution that has not been designated as an eligible institution by the Secretary but has previously filed

Department of Public Utilities (Wallingford), dated November 30, 1994; 
 

First Amendment to the Transmission Service Agreement 

between the Northeast Utilities Companies and CMEEC, dated November 30, 1994; 
 

Second Consolidated Amendment to Life-of-Unit Contracts 

between CL&P and CMEEC, dated November 30, 1994; and

in the first paragraph of this notice. NUSCO states that termination of these rate schedules as of the requested effective
date is necessary in order to effectuate the proposed arrangements and has notified Wallingford of the proposed termination,
as the only affected purchaser.

4. Transwestern Gathering Company 


[Docket No. CP95-112-000] 


Take notice that on December 5, 1994, Transwestern Gathering Company (TGC), P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1188,
filed in Docket No. CP95-112-000 a petition under Rule 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure
(18 CFR 385.207) for an order declaring that upon the completion of the acquisition by TGC of certain gathering and
processing facilities from Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), such facilities will be exempt from
the Commission's jurisdiction.

1

 





TGC states that the gathering facilities are located in Clark County, Kansas; Beaver, Comanche, Custer, Ellis, Harper,
Roger Mills and Woodward Counties, Oklahoma; Cimmaron, Crane, Gray, Hansford, Hemphill, Hutchinson, Lipscomb,
Loving, Ochiltree, Pecos, Reeves, Roberts, Sherman, Ward and Winkler Counties, Texas, and Eddy, Lea, Roosevelt,
and Chaves Counties, New Mexico. TGC states that the facilities to be transferred are contained in 51 Transwestern
systems and are described in detail in Exhibit T of Transwestern's application, which exhibit is incorporated herein
by reference. 
TGC states that it will offer gathering, dehydrating and compression services to producers and shippers seeking
such services and will provide such services on a basis that is not unduly discriminatory. In addition, TGC contends
that it will be enabled to compete with the numerous other non-jurisdictional gatherers and processors of gas in the
States of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico upon granting of the petition. 
It is stated that the gathering facilities TGC will acquire perform services in the production area prior to transportation
in interstate commerce. TGC contends that these facilities and services are within the production and gathering
exemption of the Natural Gas Act (NGA). As a result, they should be declared wholly exempt from the Commission's NGA
jurisdiction. 
TGC states that the Commission has already disclaimed jurisdiction over gathering facilities which have been spun
down to interstate pipeline companies' non-regulated affiliates in several cases.

2

 TGC seeks a disclaimer of jurisdiction as to the gathering facilities from the Commission similar to that in 

Mid-Louisiana 

and 

Arkla Gathering Services. 





According to TGC, the Commission, in determining whether facilities are exempt production and gathering facilities,
has relied upon the primary function test described in 

Farmland Industries, Inc., 

23 FERC   61,063 (1983) and 

Amerada Hess Corporation, et al., 

52 FERC   61,268 (1990) and 67 FERC   61,254 (1994). Under the primary function test, TGC states that the
Commission considers the length and diameter of a facility, the extension of the facility beyond the central point
in the field, the geographical configuration of the facility, the location of processing plants and compressors,
the location of wells along all or part of the facility and the operating pressure of the facility. 
TGC argues that the Commission has also indicated that the criteria in 

Farmland 

are not exclusive, and that other criteria, including the purpose, location and operation of the facility, the general
business activity of the owner and whether the jurisdictional determination is consistent with the objectives of
the NGA or Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), may well be considered.

3

 Additionally, TGC contends that the Commission, in reaching its determination on the primary function of the facilities,
has indicated that it will weigh all the relevant factors and a determination of gathering does not require a finding
that all the criteria point in the same direction.

4

 






TGC submits that, in general, there is an overall total of approximately 1,795.13 miles of pipeline segments which
will be transferred to TGC with diameters ranging from 2 to 20 inches. It is stated that approximately 3.97 miles (0.002
percent) are 2 inches in diameter; 1.12 miles (0.001 percent) are 3 inches in diameter; 765.81 (43 percent) are 4 inches
in diameter; 413 miles (23 percent) are 6 inches in diameter; 217 miles (12 percent) are 8 inches in diameter; 245 miles
(14 percent) are 10 inches in diameter; 61 miles (3 percent) are 12 inches in diameter; 71 miles (4 percent) are 16 inches
in diameter; and 17 miles (one percent) are 20 inches in diameter. TGC states that the lengths and diameters of the facilities
are consistent with a gathering determination. 
According to TGC, the central point in the field test, in general, is not applicable to the facilities involved here.
This is because, as a rule, the facilities exhibit characteristics which exempt them from the application of the test.
However, even if the test were applied to the facilities, the central point would be the points where all gas collected
along the facilities is delivered for transmission into one of Transwestern's transmission lines. TGC states that
since the gathering facilities are all upstream of the central points on each of Transwestern's systems, application
of the central point in the field test would support a finding that the primary function of the facilities is gathering.

TGC states that the Commission has indicated that gathering systems commonly fall into three types of configurations:
(1) web-like; (2) short and small in diameter; and (3) backbone or spine-like. It is stated that the short, small diameter
lines connect wells or fields directly to mainline transmission or other ``backbone'' gathering systems, and that
the backbone structures are generally longer and larger in diameter with numerous feeder lines interconnected along
their length. TGC contends that the facilities to be transferred by Transwestern all exhibit configurations which
are typical of gathering systems. 
TGC submits that there are a total of 80 compressor units with a total of 60,696 horsepower (hp) located on the facilities.
It is stated that 26 percent of the units have less than 300 hp; 14 percent have between 300 and 700 hp; 20 percent have
between 700 and 999 hp; 30 percent have between 1,000 and 1,199 hp and 10 percent have more than 1,200 hp. TGC states that
all of the compressor units being transferred by Transwestern are incidental to the gathering function because they
are either compressors used to boost low pressure gas to pressures which enable the gas to be moved to the next compressor
station or used to boost gas to pressures which enable the gas to enter one of Transwestern's transmission lines. Thus,
TGC concludes that the primary function of compression on the facilities is consistent with a finding of gathering.

According to TGC, a total of eight treater plants, which treat gas prior to its transmission to ensure that the gas is
pipeline quality, will be transferred by Transwestern. As such, TGC argues that the primary function of the plants
is entirely consistent with a finding that the facilities are gathering. 
TGC contends that there are approximately 2,979 wells located along the length of the facilities to be transferred
by Transwestern. Of the 42 systems containing facilities to be transferred, TGC states that 3 have 200 or more wells
connected to them; 6 have between 100 and 199 wells connected to them; 10 have between 50 and 99 wells; 13 have between
16 and 49 wells and 10 have fewer than 16 wells. It is stated that all the lines leading to the wells have very small diameters,
usually consisting of 4-inch diameter pipe. TGC submits that application of this criterion supports the conclusion
that the facilities in question perform a gathering function.

TGC states that the operating pressures of the lines range from 25 psig to 950 psig. It is stated that, where the operating
pressures tend toward the higher range, such pressures are necessary to enable the gas to enter Transwestern's transmission
system. TGC states that the operating pressures of the segments being transferred by Transwestern are consistent
with the operating pressures of other systems which the Commission has found to be gathering. 
Once the facilities are transferred by Transwestern, TGC submits that they will be owned and operated by an entity
engaged in the gathering of natural gas as a business. TGC states that it will be competing with other similar entities
in the Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico production areas. 
While each of the 

Farmland 

criteria need not be met for each of the facilities to be found gathering, TGC argues that it has demonstrated that,
on the whole, the primary function test has been met with regard to the facilities to be transferred by Transwestern.
As a result, TGC submits that the Commission should disclaim jurisdiction over the facilities and find that they perform
a gathering function under Section 1(b) of the NGA. 
Comment date: December 29, 1995, in accordance with thie first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this
notice.

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Pipeline Corporation, et al.; </DOCTITLE>
Natural Gas Certificate Filings 


December 7, 1994. 


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Northwest Pipeline Corporation 


[Docket No. CP95-104-000] 


Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City,
Utah 84158, filed in Docket No. CP95-104-000 a request pursuant to   157.205 and 157.216 of
the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon by
removal its existing Piceance Creek Meter Station (Piceance Station) located in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, under
Northwest's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-433-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural
Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Northwest proposes to abandon and remove the Piceance Station due to a lack of contract obligations for service since
1989 and the fact that Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) has removed its immediately adjacent interconnecting
downstream facilities, thus making it operationally impossible for Northwest to continue to deliver natural gas.
The Piceance Station is located in Section 8, Township 2 South, Range 96 West, in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, at milepost
0.05 on Northwest's Piceance Creek Lateral. The Piceance Station currently shares the station site with other facilities
which will continue to be operated by Williams Gas Processing Company. The estimated cost of removal is $7,000 and
the station site will be regraveled. 
In Docket No. CP67-141 (37 FPC 304) Northwest's predecessor was authorized to construct and operate the Piceance
Station for providing service under special Rate Schedule X-17. The Piceance Station consisted of a 4-inch

2. Colorado Interstate Gas Company 


[Docket No. CP95-106-000] 


Take notice that on November 30, 1994, as supplemented December 5, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O.

Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80944, filed in Docket No. CP95-106-000 a request pursuant to   157.205
and 157.208 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.208) for authorization
to construct and operate a new lateral pipeline facility, under CIG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83-21-000,
pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection. 
CIG proposes to construct and operate the Parachute Creek Lateral (Parachute), a new 16-inch pipeline and appurtenant
facilities in Garfield and Rio Blanco Counties, Colorado at an estimated cost of $9,302,000 for the receipt of gas
from fields located in the Piceance Basin in Garfield County, Colorado. CIG states that Parachute will connect to
CIG's 20-inch Uinta Basin Lateral which in turn connects to CIG's 22-inch and 24-inch Wyoming Main Line. 
Specifically, CIG proposes to construct 36.8 miles of 16-inch pipeline and a meter station consisting of two 6-inch
meter runs to receive the gas into the lateral. CIG states that long term (10 year) signed contracts with Snyder Oil
Corporation and UtiliCorp United Inc. for 37,000 Dth per day supporting the need for the proposed Parachute facilities
are included as an appendix to its application. Additionally, CIG states that it will hold an open season for capacity
on the lateral with capacity awarded based on net present value. CIG further states that compression may be installed
should firm capacity being requested exceed the available capacity. 


Comment date: 

January 23, 1995, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 


3. K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. 


[Docket No. CP95-113-000] 


Take notice that on December 5, 1994, K N Interstate Gas Transmission Co. (K N Interstate), P.O. Box 281304, Lakewood,
Colorado, 80228, filed in Docket No. CP95-113-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural
Gas Act for authorization to install, own and operate certain jurisdictional pipeline and compression facilities,
all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
K N Interstate proposes to install, own and operate 43.9 miles of 16-inch pipeline, running parallel to its existing
mainline, from a point near the town of Casper in Natrona County, Wyoming to a point near the town of Douglas in Converse
County, Wyoming; 8.0 miles of 16-inch pipeline to connect the Douglas Processing Plant to K N Interstate's mainline
near the town of Douglas in Converse County, Wyoming; and a 2,000 horsepower compressor at the Guernsey Compressor
Station in Platte County, Wyoming. K N Interstate estimates the cost of the facilities to be $14.9 million.
It is stated that K N Interstate currently operates a gas processing plant at Casper, Wyoming, which is used to process
supplies of gas received from sources west of Casper. It is stated that the plant is a lean oil absorption plant which
uses Freon, a chlorofluorocarbon, as a refrigerant. K N Interstate states that since the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons
is being phased out, K N Interstate must take action with regard to the Casper Plant. K N Interstate submits that its
best course of action involves the closure of the Casper Plant and the construction of pipeline facilities to facilitate
the movement of unprocessed gas to an existing processing plant located near Douglas, Wyoming, for processing.

K N Interstate states that it is faced with capacity constraints on its pipeline system downstream of Casper. K N Interstate
further states that based on the results of an open season, shippers have indicated an interest in additional capacity,
in the amount of 83,500 Mcf per day. K N Interstate maintains that, in addition, the development of new gas supplies
from sources west of Casper support the need for additional pipeline capacity out of the area. K N Interstate submits
that it can solve the capacity constraint downstream of Casper and move incremental volumes of gas as they are developed
by selecting a pipe sized larger than that which would be necessary to move only the unprocessed gas stream east of Casper
and adding a new compressor unit at an existing compressor station. K N Interstate maintains that such a configuration
will result in increased system reliability, flexibility and redundancy. 

K N Interstate states that the proposed facilities will enable K N Interstate to close its Casper Processing Plant
and move the gas currently being processed at Casper to the Douglas Processing Plant. In addition, K N Interstate states
that the proposed facilities will enable K N Interstate to transport incremental volumes of up to 47,500 Mcf per day
from the west end of its transmission pipeline system. K N Interstate further states that it will charge the firm transportation
rates that result from its current rate proceeding for transportation of gas through the proposed facilities.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statements and Regulations; Availability of EPA Comments </DOCTITLE>



Availability of EPA comments prepared 
November 28, 1994 through December 2, 1994 
pursuant to the Environmental Review 
Process (ERP), under Section 309 of the 
Clean Air Act and Section 102(2)(C) of 
the National Environmental Policy Act 
as amended. Requests for copies of EPA 
comments can be directed to the Office of 
Federal Activities at (202) 260-5076. 

An explanation of the ratings assigned to 
draft environmental impact statements 
(EISs) was published in FR dated 
April 10, 1994 (59 FR 16807). 



Draft EISs 



ERP No. D-BLM-K67027-AZ Rating EO2, 
Cypus Tohono Open Pit Mine Expansion Project, 
Plan of Operation Approval and Drilling Permit, 
Implementation, Tohono O'odham Nation, Papago 
Indian Reservation, Pinal County, AZ. 

Summary: EPA expressed environmental objections with the 
potential discharges from ponds and the open pit into 
groundwater. EPA recommended the final EIS provide 
more information on potential acid drainage formation, 
metals present in areas where there is potential for 
mobilization, and permeability of materials used to 
line pads and ponds. The final EIS should evaluate 
an alternative which includes increasing the 
stormwater containment capacity of the pregnant leach 
solution ponds to handle a 100-year, 24-hour storm. 
The final EIS also needs to provide analysis of the 
Clean Water Act Section 404 compliance. 

ERP No. D-FHW-E40755-NC Rating EC2, 
US 70 Improvements Project, I-40 to the 
Intersection of US 70 and US 70 Business, Funding 
and COE Section 404 Permit, Wake and Johnston 
Counties, NC. 

Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding 
wetlands and air quality and requested additional 
information on wetlands mitigation and socio-economic 
impacts. 

ERP No. D-UAF-L11025-AK Rating EO2, 
Alaska Military Operations Areas (MOAs) Temporary 
MOAs Conversion to Permanent MOAs; New MOAs 
Creation; MOAs Modification; Supersonic Aircraft 
Operations and Routine Flying Training, 
Joint/Combined Flying Training and Major Flying 
Exercises Activities, Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. 

Summary: EPA had environmental objections based on impacts 
to biological and recreation resources, potential 
adverse effects on subsistence activities and 
potential noise impacts on off-base residents. 
Additional information and clarification is needed to 
describe cumulative adverse impacts and mitigation 
effectiveness monitoring, develop more specific 
noise thresholds for impacted species and describe 
the conformity of the proposed action with 
requirements of Executive Order 12898. 

ERP No. D-USN-D11023-MD Rating EC2, 
Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 
Base Realignment and Construction, Patuxent River, 
St. Mary's, Calvert and Charles Counties, MD. 

Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding water 
conservation and requested that wetlands and forest 
habitat be more clearly defined in the final EIS. 



Final EISs 



ERP No. F-BLM-E65044-FL Florida Land and Resource Management Plan, 
Implementation, Split-Estate Federal Mineral 
Ownership (FMO), several counties, FL. 

Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns over habitat 
loss from the proposed alternative and suggests the 
Withlacoochee State Forest prohibit future limestone 
sales. The final EIS was responsive to other concerns 
EPA expressed in the draft EIS. 

ERP No. F-CGD-D50005-VA Parallel Crossing of the Chesapeake Bay, 
Construction and Operation, US 13 between the 
Delmarva Peninsula and southeastern Virginia, 
Funding, COE Section 10 and 404 Permits and CGD 
Bridge Permit, Virginia Beach, Northampton County, 
VA. 

Summary: EPA continued to express environmental objection to

Agreement with respect to induced growth. 

ERP No. F-FHW-J40129-WY 
US 14/16/20 Highway Improvements, Cody to 
Yellowstone National Park Highway, Funding and COE 
Section 404 Permit, Shoshone National Forest, 
Park County, WY. 

Summary: EPA had no objections to the project as proposed. 
Earlier concerns regarding water quality were 
addressed in the Final EIS. 

ERP No. F-TVA-E65041-00 Land Between The Lakes (LBL) Natural Resource 
Management Plan, Implementation, KY and TN. 

Summary: EPA had environmental concerns regarding timbering and 
encouraged reductions in these impacts. EPA felt that 
the preferred alternative increased resource 
preservation. 

ERP No. F-UMT-J40119-UT I-15/State Street Corridor Highway and Transit 
Improvements, Funding, Salt Lake County, UT. 

Summary: EPA had no objections to the project as proposed.

<DOCTITLE>Reissuance of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Permit For Dewatering and Petroleum
Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State of Florida </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Rule_Reissuance of a NPDES General Permit to the State of Florida.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Regional Administrator, EPA, Region IV is reissuing the final National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) General Permit No. FLG830000 to facilities within the political boundary of the State of Florida. This final
reissued NPDES general permit contains effluent limitations, prohibitions, reporting requirements and other
conditions on facilities which discharge uncontaminated groundwater associated with dewatering or treated groundwater
and/or storm water incidental to the groundwater cleanup operation which have been contaminated by automotive gasoline,
aviation and/or diesel fuels. This permit authorizes discharges from facilities currently located in and discharging
to surface waters within the political boundary of the State of Florida, and any new treatment facilities placed in
operation during the term of this permit. Reissuance of this final NPDES will allow general dewatering and cleanup
actions at petroleum contaminated sites to begin without the delays of individual NPDES permit issuance procedures.



For facilities seeking coverage for general dewatering discharges, coverage under the general permit is automatic,
upon the permittee's receipt of acceptable groundwater screening values, as described in Part I.A.3(c) of the general
permit. The effluent from these general dewatering activities shall be monitored within thirty (30) days after commencement
of the discharge and once every six months for the life of the project to maintain coverage under the general permit.
Additionally, short-term pump tests, eight (8) hours in duration or less, shall be automatically covered upon receipt
of the permittee's Notice of Intent (NOI) by EPA and the permittee will be responsible for meeting the requirements
of Parts I.A.1 or A.2. DMRs shall be submitted within thirty (30) days after completion of the pump test discharge.

Except for facilities meeting the above conditions, all other facilities seeking coverage under the general permit
by NOI requests will be responded to by written notification of coverage by certified mail from the Director, Water
Management Division, U.S. EPA Region IV. This method of notification will be applicable to both new dischargers applying
for coverage for the first time and existing dischargers which are seeking coverage under the reissued general permit.
Facilities which are currently discharging under the previous NPDES general permit are required to submit another
NOI requesting coverage under the reissued general permit by February 14, 1995, in accordance with Part II, Section
F(b).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction 


On Thursday, August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), EPA, Region IV proposed the issuance of the draft NPDES General Permit.
During the 30-day comment period, a request for an extension of the comment period was received, and on Tuesday, October
25, 1988 (53 FR 43035), the comment period was extended to November 15, 1988. On Monday, July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986),
EPA, Region IV issued the Final NPDES General Permit for Petroleum Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State
of Florida. 
On Friday, February 22, 1991 (56 FR 7379), EPA, Region IV published a notice of a proposed modification to the NPDES
General Permit for Petroleum Fuel Contaminated Ground/Storm Waters in the State of Florida (56 FR 7379) to include
dewatering activities. On Thursday, August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), the final modification was issued. The general
permit expired on July 16, 1994. On Monday, September 19, 1994, EPA Region IV published a notice concerning the reissuance
of the general permit (59 FR 47862) that is being issued in final form today. 
The Region received comments from eight (8) commentors. All the public comments received during the 30-day comment
period are included in the administrative record and were considered by Region IV in the formulation of a final determination
of the conditions of today's final permit. 
For reference, Region IV published a detailed fact sheet with the proposed draft permit in 59 FR 47862. The Region is
incorporating by reference that fact sheet as part of the final fact sheet for today's final permit. The discussions
presented in the previous fact sheet should be consulted in reviewing the applicability and scope of the final permit
conditions. 
A formal hearing is available to challenge any NPDES permit issued under 40 CFR 124.14 except for a general permit.
Persons affected by a general permit may not challenge the conditions of a general permit as a right in further agency
proceedings. They may instead either challenge the general permit in court, or apply for an individual permit under
40 CFR 122.21 as authorized at 40 CFR 122.28 and then request a formal hearing on the issuance or denial of an individual
permit. Additional information regarding these procedures is available by contacting Ms. Gwen Eason, Office of
Regional Counsel, at the address above or at (404) 347-2309. 


II. Other Legal Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12291 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291
pursuant to Section 8[b] of that order. 


B. Paperwork Reduction Act 


EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in this final general permit under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.  3501 

et seq. 

The information collection requirements of this permit have already been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget in submissions made for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean Water Act. 


C. State Certification Requirements 


Section 301(b)(1)(c) of the Act requires that NPDES permits contain conditions which ensure compliance with applicable
State water quality standards or limitations. Section 401 of the Act requires that States certify that Federally
issued permits are in compliance with State law. This permit is for operations discharging to waters within the State
of Florida. Pursuant to 40 CFR 124.53, EPA requested certification of the permit on September 15, 1994. On October
27, 1994, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection waived certification of the general permit. 


D. Effective Date 


The final NPDES general permit issued today, December 6th, 1994, is effective on December 7, 1994. 


E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


After review of the facts presented in this document, I hereby certify, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  605(b),
that this NPDES general permit will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Moreover,
the permit reduces a significant administrative burden on regulated sources.

Summary of Comments 


Appendix A_Public Comments 


Public notice of the draft permit reissuance was published 
at 59 FR 47862 (September 19, 1994). Additionally, the 
permit was publicly noticed in five (5) major cities in the 
State of Florida on September 16, 1994, (Public Notice 
Number 94FL0167), to allow comments from interested parties 
which would be considered in the formulation of a final 
decision regarding reissuance of the proposed draft NPDES 
General Permit No. FLG830000. 
The following parties responded with written comments on 
reissuance of the proposed NPDES general permit: Florida 
Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Chevron 
Research & Technology Company, Morgan Lewis & Bockius, Mobil 
Oil Corporation, Exxon Company, Walt Disney World Company, 
Florida Chemical Industry Council and the United States Fish 
and Wildlife Service. 
Comment 1: The Florida Department of Environmental 
Protection (FDEP), Bureau of Waste Cleanup, submitted 
comments by letter dated October 3, 1994, which commented on 
Part I.A.3 of the general permit. The FDEP wanted 
clarification concerning the intent of Part I.A.3. FDEP 
stated that the statement on Page two (2) of the 
introduction states that `` Except for facilities meeting the 
conditions of Part I.3, written notice of intent to be 
covered by the reissued NPDES general permit shall be 
provided to the Permit Issuing Authority prior to initiation 
of discharge to waters of the United States,'' implies that 
this includes subparts of Part I.3., including I.3.(a), (b), 
and (c). FDEP stated that this implies that for discharges 
that are either uncontaminated or are contaminated with 
petroleum only and are treated, notification to EPA is not 
required. It was stated that this is not consistent with 
the phrase under I.3(a) which states ``upon receipt of 
written EPA notification of coverage that the Notice of 
Intent (NOI) request is complete, these short-term 
discharges may commence.'' The State mentioned that this 
implies that not only must prior notification be given by 
EPA for the short-term discharges from sites contaminated by 
petroleum only, but that the person responsible for the 
discharge must wait for a reply from EPA, and this 
inconsistency should be reconciled. 
Response: EPA agrees that the referenced statement on page 
2 of the introduction is incorrect. It has been corrected 
to read, ``except for facilities meeting the conditions of 
Part I.A.3(c), written NOI to be covered by the reissued 
permit shall be provided to the Permit Issuing Authority.'' 
Comment 2: FDEP stated that it is not reasonable to wait 
for a response from EPA in order to initiate a short-term 
discharge for the following reasons: (1) Chapter 62-770, 
requires that a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) be submitted to 
the FDEP within 2 months of approval of a Contamination 
Assessment Report (CAR), and that it is routine to require 
pump tests to design information for the RAP, plus identify 
aquifer characteristics. FDEP stated that it is not 
reasonable to delay the RAP by requiring prior approval from 
EPA of these simple 8 hour pump tests. (2) Due to varying 
hydrogeological conditions in Florida, local departments 
commonly perform dewatering activities in their right-of-way 
of previous retail service stations, plus have no 
information before commencing these activities on the 
existence of petroleum contamination. FDEP stated that 
these construction projects should not be delayed for an 
extended period to wait on response from EPA, since mobile 
treatment units can be deployed and designed to meet EPA's 
discharge limitations in the NPDES general permit. (3) 
During dewatering for construction and replacement of 
underground storage tanks, FDEP mentioned that it was not 
reasonable for the tank installation to be delayed for an 
extended period of time; especially since discharges from 
these operations only last for a few hours at a time and 
mobile equipment used is very reliable in achieving EPA's 
discharge standards.

Response: EPA concurs with FDEP reason No. 1 above which 
allows short-term 8 hour pump tests at sites which have 
identified petroleum contamination, to be covered upon 
receipt of the NOI by the Permit Issuing Authority. Only 
short-term pump tests, 8 hours in duration or less, designed 
to obtain information on aquifer characteristics, will be 
automatically covered upon receipt of the permittee's NOI, 
and the permittee will be responsible or meeting the 
discharge limitations of Part A.1 or A.2. General Permit 
numbers will be assigned to these sites and DMR's sent with 
a copy of the general permit and a letter acknowledging 
receipt of the Notice of Intent. 
EPA responds to reasons 

#

 2 and 

#

 3 as proposed by the FDEP, 
which would allow coverage by simply submitting an NOI for 
local departments dewatering projects or scheduled 
dewatering during gasoline tank replacements. It is EPA's 
understanding that the construction activities described in 
No. 2 and No. 3 are planned well in advance of the 
initiation of the dewatering process. For this reason, EPA 
sees no reason to exempt these sites from NOI requirements. 
Unless preliminary groundwater assessments have been 
performed along the right-of-way project prior to startup, 
even the local departments may be unaware of an contaminated 
plume that may be encountered during the road widening, or 
excavation projects. The potential problem EPA expects in 
waiving NOI requirements for these activities, is the lack 
of sufficient data to cover these operations. The better 
approach would be for the permittee to survey potential 
problem areas well in advance of the dewatering startup, 
identify the type of contamination and seek discharge 
coverage under the NPDES general permit using the NOI 
process, for those potentially contaminated groundwater 
discharge areas. 
Comment 3: FDEP also questioned whether the indicator 
criteria values listed under Part I.A.3, should be analyzed 
using untreated groundwater or treated groundwater. FDEP 
also stated that if the intent of Part I.A.3 is to allow 
short term discharges from sites contaminated with petroleum 
only, then the indicators should be applied to treated 
recovered groundwater, because if these indicators were 
applied to untreated groundwater, this would preclude 
discharges from sites contaminated with petroleum only. 
However, FDEP stated that applying these indicator values to 
the treated effluent may allow treatment alternatives that 
are capable of removing the metals listed and become 
eligible to discharge under the general permit, since the 
indicator values were not exceeded (even if the source of 
contamination was not petroleum in nature). 
Response: EPA notes that the indicator values apply to 
untreated representative groundwater samples from the 
vicinity of the proposed produced groundwater discharge. 
These could be tests from monitoring wells, recovery wells, 
or samples of produced groundwater taken prior to any 
treatment and would not allow treatment alternatives capable 
of removing metals to be covered by this general permit. 
It should be emphasized that the intent of Part I.A.3 is to 
allow the discharge of produced groundwater from an 
uncontaminated site activity. If the site is contaminated 
with petroleum fuels, the permit refers back to Parts I.A.1 
or I.A.2. 
Comment 4: FDEP requested EPA's determination on a 
particular issue before the finalization of the general 
permit. FDEP stated that many petroleum sites are located 
in urban areas, and other possible sources of contamination 
may be located in the vicinity of the petroleum site. In 
these situations commingling of plumes from non-petroleum 
sites may occur. It was noted that many sites performing 
Contamination Assessment Reports (CARs) had detected low 
levels of TCE or PCE for many sites which had a dry cleaner 
in the vicinity. FDEP stated that since these solvents had 
similar characteristics and were volatile, most treatment 
system designs based on permit effluent requirements for the 
petroleum compounds will easily remove the PCE or TCE to 
non-detectable levels without any oversizing of equipment or 
additional treatment processes. FDEP stated that other 
compounds in relatively low concentrations from off site 
sources should not preclude eligibility of the general 
permit for the overall cleanup, which is to remediate the 
petroleum plume and requested EPA's determination on the 
issue. 
Response: EPA in it's initial conception of the general 
permit, only made specific reference to contamination from 
petroleum fuels and referenced gasoline, aviation gas, 
diesel and jet-fuel. The intent in issuing this general 
permit was to provide general permit coverage for the 
discharge of treated petroleum contaminated groundwater. To 
cover other sources of contamination will require additional 
research and public participation. Because the general 
permit expired on July 16, 1994, EPA sees an urgency to 
reissue this permit; therefore, EPA may consider this issue 
in the future through a permit modification. EPA, after 
collecting sufficient information, may consider the 
inclusion of other chemicals associated with dry cleaners in 
the near future, but due to the lack of sufficient 
information, will not address it at this time.

Comment 5: Chevron Research and Technology Company, by 
letter dated October 4, 1994, requested a copy of the NPDES 
Best Management Practice (BMP) Guidance Document. 
Response: EPA sent the NPDES BMP Guidance document to 
Chevron on October 13, 1994. 
Comment 6: Morgan, Lewis & Bockius (ML&B), Counselors at 
Law, by letter dated October 15, 1994, made two comments 
concerning the permit. ML&B mentioned that all references 
to Florida Administrative Code Chapter 17-770, 17-302, or 
any other ``17-'' should be changed to Chapter ``62-770, or 62- 
302, and mentioned that Chapter ``62-'' is where the current 
law is found. ML&B also mentioned that the Fact Sheet 
should contain some discussion of discharge to ``surface 
waters'', the triggering event. ML&B also mentioned that the 
permittee should know where to go in order look up the 
definition of ``surface waters'' or discharges to surface 
waters. Mentioned that these issues and basic guidance 
thereon may ensure that all facilities obligated under the 
general permit actually apply for coverage and discussion of 
this significant jurisdictional issue in the Fact Sheet or 
permit itself seems appropriate. 
Response: EPA refers the commentor to the Clean Water Act 
(CWA) which requires that point source discharges of 
pollutants to waters of the United States be covered by 
NPDES permits. The definition of ``point source'' and ``waters 
of the U.S.'' can be found at 40 CFR Section 122.2. 
Additionally, all references that refer to Florida 
Administrative Code Chapter ``17'' will be changed to Florida 
Administrative Code Chapter ``62.'' 
Comment 7: Mobil Oil Corporation (MOC), by letter dated 
October 17, 1994, supported the reissuance of the general 
permit, since it is more efficient and cost effective 
approach to permitting routine activity than the individual 
permitting process. MOC raised several concerns on the 
draft NPDES general permit concerning the new requirements 
of the whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests. MOC stated that 
the need for WET testing has not been established. It was 
stated that the Fact Sheet cited that the chemical criteria 
was significantly more stringent than Florida's water 
quality standards and MOC stated that meeting the chemical 
criteria, coupled with the required treatment processes 
should be more than adequate to protect aquatic life. 
Response: In response to MOC comment, EPA notes that the 
chemical specific discharge limitations mentioned do provide 
adequate protection to meet Florida's chemical specific 
water quality standards. However, since previous toxicity 
monitoring tests did indicate that a number of effluents 
were toxic, which is also a violation of Florida 
Administrative Code (FAC) Section 17-4.244(3)(a), WET limits 
were incorporated into the permit. 
Comment 8: MOC stated that if WET testing is required, the 
procedure outlined in Part V should be modified. MOC stated 
that if the compliance limit for WET testing is an LC50 

>

 
100%, the requirement for a full concentration test is not 
warranted and only a screening test (control and 100% final 
effluent only) should be run to demonstrate compliance. 
Response: Regarding Mobil's comment on the use of multiple 
dilutions, per the EPA acute WET protocol manual (EPA/600/4- 
90/027F) cited in the September 19,1994 

Federal Register

 
notice, such dilutions are recommended to assess NPDES 
compliance for all WET tests (pg. 47-48). They provide more 
information about the dose-response of the test, increase 
the statistical power of the test, and decrease the inherent 
variability found in conducting a single test concentration 
with a control.

Comment 9: MOC stated that there was no advantage to 
static-renewal versus the static procedure for these 
discharges and recommended the static procedure for these 
WET tests. 

Response: Regarding Mobil's comment that static tests only 
be conducted, the EPA acute WET protocol manual (EPA/600/4-90/027F) cited in the 

Federal Register

 notice above mandates 
the use of static renewal tests for all tests exceeding 48 
hr (pg. 57, 61, 65, 69). Because the acute WET tests 
specified in this notice are 96-hrs. in duration, static 
renewals tests must be conducted. 

Comment 10: MOC also recommended that the mandatory 
requirement that recommended concurrent standard reference 
toxicant (SRT) testing be removed, since this provides 
limited information on the quality of the testing 
laboratory. MOC mentioned that requiring facilities to pay for these 
studies, when they receive no benefit is inappropriate. 

Response: Regarding Mobil's comment on the required 
concurrent standard reference toxicant (SRT) testing with 
each WET test, the September 19,1994 

Federal Register

 notice 
does allow for monthly SRT results to be submitted in lieu 
of such concurrent tests. Regarding Mobil's comment on 
requiring contract laboratories to conduct such SRT testing, 
EPA does not currently have a national laboratory 
certification program for WET. EPA does acknowledge that 
some states do have such a certification program. Until a 
national certification program is established, EPA must have 
some means to assess the quality of a given laboratory's 
performance. The use of SRTs is one way of making that 
assessment. EPA notes that permittees have the option of 
using in-house capabilities to conduct such WET tests. 
However, when permittees rely on outside laboratories to 
conduct WET tests for NPDES compliance purposes, the use of 
SRTs is required. EPA disagrees with Mobil's comment that 
such SRT tests have no benefit for the permittee. On the 
contrary, such SRT testing serves to validate the quality 
and precision of the WET tests conducted by the contract 
laboratory on behalf of the permittee that are submitted to 
the permitting authority. 

Comment 11: MOC mentioned that facilities covered by the 
existing, but expired general permit may be required to 
perform another testing requirement, such a EPA 624 and 625 
although this sampling was performed for the existing 
general permit. 

 
Response: EPA does not agree that facilities already 
discharging under the general permit be excluded from 
performing an additional test analysis on the effluent using 
EPA methods 624 or 625 priority pollutant scan. This 
requirement conforms with the reapplication data necessary 
for individual permits in which a permittee is required to 
retest the effluent to obtain accurate information which 
determine possible changes in effluent characteristics. 
This priority pollutant scan shall be performed within 60 
days of startup of the produced water discharge, or within 
60 days after receipt of notification of coverage from EPA 
for facilities currently discharging under the previous 
general permit. 

Comment 12: Exxon Company (EC), by letter dated October 20, 
1994, stated that some risk-based analysis is an important 
element in establishing water quality criteria for certain 
processes, and that the proposed 1.0 ug/l benzene effluent 
limit appears to be absent of any risk-based approach. EC 
stated that scientific data does not warrant the restrictive 
1.0 ug/l benzene effluent limit for release into surface 
water and is even more stringent than that required under 
Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 17-302.530 for Class I 
potable water supplies and recommended that the national 
limit of 5.0 ug/l be substituted as the benzene effluent 
limit.

Response: EPA concurs that the 1.0 ug/l limit for benzene 
is more stringent than Florida's water quality standards. 
The limitation for benzene is based on the best treatment 
technology available and happens to be more stringent than 
FAC 17-302.530(9)[4/25/94], Class I potable water supplies 
which is 1.18 ug/l. The 1.0 ug/l limitation is also more 
stringent than Florida Class III water quality standard, 
which requires an annual average limitation of 71.28 ug/l 
for benzene. Therefore, since technology has proven capable 
of consistently maintaining the 1.0 ug/l limitation for 
benzene and numerous permittees have consistently designed 
treatment systems that meet the requirements of the NPDES 
general permit, EPA will retain the benzene limit. In 
addition, maintaining the 1.0 ug/l benzene limit complies 
with Section 402(o)(1) of the Water Quality Act of 1987, 
which states that a permit may not be renewed, reissued, or 
modified to contain effluent limitations which are less 
stringent than the comparable effluent limitations in the 
previous permit except in compliance with Section 303 
(d)(4). 

Comment 13: Exxon Company (EC) mentioned that the 
acceptable pH for treated effluent under the previous and 
proposed NPDES general permit is 6.0-8.5 standard units 
(SUs), and mentioned that many lakes and streams in Central 
and North Florida have a pH range of 5.0-6.0 SUs. EC 
stated that many influent pH samples for remedial pump and 
treat systems are also in this range and recommended 
reducing the allowed lower limit from 6.0 to 5.5 SUs. 
Response: In response to EC comments, the pH language in 
the current proposed draft permit does allow some variation 
for pH depending on natural background of the receiving 
water. However, this natural background data must be 
furnished to EPA by the permittee in the initial NOI 
request; in order to be considered in determining the pH 
range for the facility during the notification of coverage 
request. It should be noted that the pH of the receiving 
stream, not the influent or effluent, influences the pH 
permit limits. 

Comment 14: Exxon Company (EC) commented on Part I.A.3 
concerning the screen for metals that would indicate 
contamination from sources other than petroleum fuels. EC 
mentioned that it is unwarranted to require screening for 
additional metals that are not ordinarily considered 
constituents of petroleum fuels as a basis for securing a 
NPDES general permit for petroleum fuel contamination. EC 
mentioned that if there is a cause for this additional 
screening at a particular site, the regulatory processes in 
place will generate the additional site investigation and 
testing needed, instead of testing every site whether 
justified or not and recommended that the screening for 
other metals be removed as a requirement from the NPDES 
general permit. EC mentioned that if additional metal 
testing is required, annual testing is much more appropriate 
than semi-annual, especially for groundwater remedial 
systems at underground storage tank cleanup sites. 


Response: In response to Exxon Company (EC) comments, EPA 
clarifies the misconception that contaminated petroleum fuel 
sites must perform the Part I.A.3 testing requirements for 
metals; these discharges must comply only with the 
requirements of Part I.A.1 or I.A.2. EPA refers to the 
general applicability of Part I.A.3, that allows produced 
water discharges from any noncontaminated site, which could 
include dewatering for tank removals, construction activity, 
or aquifer pump tests from water wells. Any point source 
discharge of pollutants to waters of the U.S. requires an 
NPDES permit, regardless of whether the site is contaminated 
or uncontaminated. EPA, in its approach to covering 
dewatering of produced groundwater associated with any 
activity, placed the burden for verification on the 
permittee for determining that the site groundwater has not 
been contaminated with sources other than petroleum fuels. 
Requiring all permittees to perform this screening allows 
facilities performing dewatering activities to be placed 
under the general permit, assuming that the screening 
reveals no contamination from sources other than petroleum 
fuels. 


Comment 15: Exxon Company (EC) mentioned that the Discharge 
Monitoring Report forms should be revised and the reporting 
procedure should be simplified. Also, mentioned that the 
quality of forms initially received from EPA tend to become 
illegible when photocopied. EC also requested that EPA 
retain the current level of bioassay testing instead of 
increasing the frequency as proposed. 


Response: EPA will send original Discharge Monitoring 
Reports to the permittee so that more legible photocopies 
can be produced. EPA recommends that these originals be 
maintained by the permittee for copying purposes. 
In reference to the bioassay requirements, permittees which 
have previously obtained coverage under this general permit, 
which effluents have not demonstrated unacceptable toxicity 
(LC 50 < 100%), may continue to sample 1/year. All sampling 
procedures and test methods must comply with Part V. It 
should be noted that the permit limit identified in Part V 
is applicable to those facilities covered by this general 
permit under Sections 

I.A.1 

and 

I.A.2

.

Comment 16: Walt Disney World (WDW) Company, by letter 
dated October 18, 1994, submitted comments on the Reissuance 
of the NPDES General Permit for the State of Florida. WDW 
made general comments concerning the proposed effluent 
limitations for (1) Total Organic Carbon and (2) pH, for 
discharge of uncontaminated produced groundwater. WDW 
mentioned most of the uncontaminated groundwater below their 
property exceeds EPA's proposed total organic carbon (TOC) 
limitation solely because of its naturally ocurring 
properties. WDW indicated that only lakes on the property 
fall below the 10 mg/l requirement and four isolated 
wetlands had TOC values averaging better than 90 mg/l or 
better, with all other TOC values ranging between 10 and 65 
mg/l. WDW mentioned that these organic compounds are 
naturally occurring and large; greater than 500 molecular 
weight, most of which consist of humic acids which generally 
come from the decomposition of organic matter. 

Response: EPA concurs that some elevated TOC levels are the 
result of naturally occurring conditions. Therefore, EPA 
will revise the language in Part A.3 to read as follows: If 
any of the analytical test results, (except TOC, benzene or 
naphthalene), exceed the above screening values the 
discharge is not authorized by this general permit. For 
excessive benzene or naphthalene concentrations, see Part 
A.3(a) below. For initial excessive TOC values that may be 
caused by naturally-occurring, high molecular weight organic 
compounds, the permittee may submit additional information 
which describes the method used to prove that these 
compounds are naturally occurring compounds. This 
additional information shall be submitted to EPA during the 
filing of the NOI request for coverage under the general 
permit. EPA will review this data and determine if coverage under 
the general permit is appropriate. 

Comment 17: Walt Disney World (WDW) made comments 
concerning the pH limitation as proposed in the NPDES 
general permit. WDW mentioned that the pH of the waters on 
the WDW property range between 3.7 and 7.7 standard units. 
WDW mentioned that the general permit should allow discharge 
of uncontaminated produced groundwaters into any receiving 
waters so long as the produced groundwater pH falls within 
the lower and upper background pH limits of the receiving 
waters as determined from sampling data submitted by the 
applicant in the Notice of Intent (NOI) request. 

Response: Since the pH requirements as proposed are based 
on Florida Administrative Code (FAC) Section 17-302.530(52)(c), EPA will retain the language in the final
NPDES general permit. 


Comment 18: The Florida Chemical Industry Council (FCIC), 
by letter dated October 21, 1994, mentioned that the 
proposed permit requires all produced groundwater discharges 
to submit analytical results to EPA, regardless of project 
size or duration even if contamination is undetected. FCIC 
mentioned the permit should allow a de minimis limit, so 
that very small construction projects will not be required 
to report and would eliminate small projects that do not 
involve cleanup at uncontaminated sites. 

Response: The Clean Water Act (CWA) does not allow for 
exclusion based on the volume of the discharge. However, 
having all potential permittees perform the analytical 
screen for any produced groundwater discharge to surface 
waters of the U.S., places the burden on the potential 
discharger to verify that the groundwater is uncontaminated 
prior to discharge regardless of the length of discharge. 
The CWA requires that all point source discharges of 
pollutants to waters of the U.S. be authorized by NPDES 
permits. 

Comment 19: The United States, Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS) submitted general comments on the NPDES general permit 
No. FLG830000. The FWS recommended that the permit be 
denied unless it includes discharge limitations and other 
appropriate permit conditions that will assure the 
maintenance of natural pre-project habitat quality, 
including: (a) Water quality, (b) sediment quality and, (c) 
vegetative species diversity and abundance, plus the best 
available technology and scientific data be utilized to 
avoid any adverse effects on fish and wildlife, their 
behavior, and the reproduction of any species. 


Response: Since some technology based limits in this 
general permit are more stringent than Florida's water 
quality standards, and the Water Quality-based limits are 
based on Florida's water quality standards, EPA believes 
that the maintenance of pre-project water quality will be 
maintained. Additionally, the requirement to perform acute 
toxicity testing on more sensitive organisms assures that 
adequate monitoring is in place to avoid potential adverse 
impacts on fish and wildlife. 



III. Other Changes to Final NPDES General Permit at 
Issuance: 



1. The word ``Dewatering'' was added to the title of the 
final issued permit to indicate that the permit covers 
general dewatering.

2. In Part I.A.3 the language was revised to read: The 
following are the minimum reporting requirements for 
all produced groundwater dischargers which have 
acceptable screening value results as described below: 
Additionally, the language was revised to allow 
initial sampling to begin within thirty (30) days 
after commencement of discharge. 
3. In Part I.A.3(c) and in Part II, Section F(g), the 
language was revised to allow the short summary and 
analytical results to be sent one (1) week after 
discharge begins.

Part I 


A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements: Existing Sources and New Dischargers 


1. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit and 
lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is authorized 
to discharge treated groundwater and storm water that has been 
contaminated by Automotive Gasoline. It is anticipated that these 
contaminated waters will be treated by air stripping, followed by 
activated carbon adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment 
to meet the following effluent limitations. 
Such discharges shall be limited and monitored by the permittee as 
specified below: 






An LC

50

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will 
constitute a violation of Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 
(July 11, 1993)  62-4.244(3)(a) and the terms of this permit. The 
testing for this requirement must conform with Part V of this permit. 

For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the effluent shall 
not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 
6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5 units, unless the 
permittee submits natural background data in the NOI request 
confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If 
natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling 
data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less 
than 6.0 units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 units in marine 
waters, the pH shall not vary below natural background or vary more 
than one (1) unit above natural background for fresh and coastal 
waters. If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed 
by sampling data from the permittee in the NOI request, is 
determined to be higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above 
natural background or vary more than one (1) unit below natural 
background of fresh and coastal waters. The acceptable pH range 
will be included in the letter granting permit coverage and on the 
DMR. The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or 
continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). 
In accordance with FAC  62-302.500(1)(a-c)(4-25-93), the discharge 
shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, 
turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on 
surface waters. 
Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements 
specified above shall be taken at the following location(s): 
Nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual 
discharge or mixing with the receiving waters. 



A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements: Existing Sources and New Dischargers 


2. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit 
and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is 
authorized to discharge treated groundwater and storm water 
that has been contaminated by Aviation Gasoline, Jet Fuel or 
Diesel. 
It is anticipated that these contaminated waters will be 
treated by air stripping, followed by activated carbon 
adsorption, if necessary, or equivalent treatment to meet the 
following effluent limitations. Such discharges shall be 
limited and monitored by the permittee as specified below: 






An LC

50

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less will 
constitute a violation of FAC (July 11, 1993)  62-4.244(3)(a) and 
the terms of this permit. The testing for this requirement must 
conform with Part V of this permit. 
The permittee shall comply with the same pH requirements for this 
Part I.A.2 as in Part I.A.1.

The pH shall be monitored once every month by grab sample, or 
continuously with a recorder. (See item I.B.4). 
In accordance with FAC  62-302.500(1)(a-c), the discharge shall at 
all times be free from floating solids, visible foam, turbidity, or 
visible oil in such amounts as to form nuisances on surface waters. 
Samples taken in compliance with the monitoring requirements 
specified above shall be taken at the following location(s): 
nearest accessible point after final treatment but prior to actual 
discharge or mixing with the receiving waters. 


A. Effluent Limitations and Monitoring Requirements


3. During the period beginning on the effective date of the permit 
and lasting through the term of this permit, the permittee is 
authorized to discharge produced groundwater from any noncontaminated site activity which discharges by a point
source 
to waters of the United States, only if the reported values for 
the parameters listed below do not exceed any of the screening 
values below. Before discharge of produced groundwater can 
occur from such sites, analytical tests on samples of the 
untreated proposed discharge water shall be performed to 
determine if contamination exists from other sources. 

The following are the minimum reporting requirements for all 
produced groundwater dischargers 

which have acceptable screening 
value results as described below: 
The effluent shall be sampled at the final effluent within 
thirty (30) days 

after commencement of discharge and once every 
six months for the life of the project to maintain continued 
coverage under this general permit. The effluent shall be 
sampled for the parameters listed below and the analytical 
results obtained shall be submitted to EPA at the address given 
in Part III.A. 


 

Reported analytical test results for the parameters listed 


above exceeding any of the screening values listed below

 
shall be considered an indication of contamination from 
sources other than petroleum fuels: 






If at any time during discharge, the effluent exceeds these 
screening values, EPA may require the facility to cease 
discharge. 

 

 

If any of the analytical test results, (except TOC, 
benzene or naphthalene), exceed the above 
screening values, discharge is not authorized by this 
permit. See paragraph I.A.(3)(b) for further guidance. 


For excessive benzene or naphthalene concentrations, see 
Part A.(3)(a) below. For initial excessive TOC values that 
may be caused by naturally-occurring, high molecular weight 
organic compounds, the permittee may request to be exempted 
from the TOC requirement by submitting additional 
information with the NOI which describes the method used to 
exclude these naturally ocurring compounds. 
In accordance with FAC 62-302.500(1)(a-c), the discharge 
shall at all times be free from floating solids, visible 
foam, turbidity, or visible oil in such amounts as to form 
nuisances on surface waters.

<TEXT>
 

All discharges must comply with the following permit requirements: 

(a) If analytical tests of Part I.A.3 reveal excessive benzene and naphthalene concentrations indicative of contamination
from petroleum fuels, and the discharge will occur for thirty (30) days or less, the permittee shall comply only with
the applicable effluent limitations and monitoring requirements in Part I.A.1 or I.A.2 for benzene, pH, and/or naphthalene
and total lead. The commencement of the Part V biomonitoring program and Part I.B.3 EPA method 624 and 625 (one time
analysis) is not required for this short-term activity. One (1) grab sample shall be analyzed per seven (7) days during
the discharge period, and the total volume discharged shall be recorded. For discharges contaminated by petroleum
fuels that last for less than a week, daily monitoring will be required for the applicable parameters. Upon receipt
of written EPA notification of coverage that the NOI request is complete, these short-term discharges may commence.
Discharge Monitoring Reports shall be submitted to EPA within thirty (30) days after termination of the discharge.


(b) If contamination from sources other than petroleum contamination does exist, as indicated by the results of the
analytical tests required by Part I. A.3 above, the discharge is not covered by this general permit. The operator shall
apply for an individual NPDES permit at least one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the date a discharge to waters
of the United States is expected. No discharge is permissible without an effective NPDES permit. 

(c) If analytical tests reveal no contamination exists from petroleum fuels or sources other than petroleum contamination
as a result of the required analytical screening tests required in Part I. A.3, the permittee can commence discharge
immediately and is covered by this permit without having to submit an NOI request for coverage to EPA, Region IV. A short
summary of the proposed activity and copy of these analytical tests shall be sent to the same address specified in Part
III.A one (1) week

 after discharge begins. These analytical tests shall be kept on site during discharge and made available to EPA, if
requested. Additionally, no Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) forms are required to be submitted to EPA, Region
IV. 



B. Other Requirements 



1. Any more frequent effluent discharge monitoring required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP) for the parameters limited in this permit, or different parameters, shall be reported to the Permit Issuing
Authority in accordance with the requirements of Part III of this permit. 

2. Effluent limitations for combining contaminated groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated
groundwater from the site's recovery wells: The permittee shall notify FDEP of any intent to combine contaminated
groundwater pumped to above-ground storage tanks with contaminated groundwater from the recovery well. Approval
of this combined effluent discharge by FDEP will constitute approval to apply for coverage under this permit.

3. Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this permit or startup of discharge the permittee shall also submit
the results of the following analyses. These analyses shall be performed on a representative sample of the groundwater
effluent discharge, taken after final treatment. 

Required analyses (one time only): 

 


a. EPA Method 625_Acid and base/neutral extractable organics 

b. EPA Method 624_Purgeable Organics 




If such analyses required in Part B.3 above reveal toxic pollutants other than those regulated in Part I.A. or subsequent
Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests reveal an LC

50

 of 100% or less in a test of 96 hours duration or less, coverage under this general permit will be reviewed for termination
by EPA Region IV Enforcement Section. 

4. If the pH is monitored continuously, the pH values shall not deviate outside the required range more than 1% of the
time in any calendar month; and no individual excursion shall exceed 60 minutes. An ``excursion'' is an unintentional
and temporary incident in which the pH value of discharge wastewater exceeds the range set forth in this permit. 



C. Test Procedures



1. In performing the analysis for the dissolved constituents in the surface water and groundwater, the permittee
shall use the guidelines recommended and described in FAC Sections 62-770.600(8)[a-d] of the Petroleum Contamination
Cleanup Criteria (PCCC), amended February 20, 1990, or the most current edition.

2. If the petroleum contamination is from a petroleum fuel in which the source of contamination has not been identified,
the groundwater shall be analyzed (using the recommended methods) for the following parameters as described in FAC
Section 62.770.600(8)(c)1, of the PCCC, amended February 20, 1990, or the most current edition: 

 


 


D. Schedule of Compliance 



1. The permittee shall achieve compliance with the effluent limitations specified for discharges in accordance
with the following schedule: 

Permittees with Revoked Individual Permits: 

 


Operational level attained_Upon Receipt of Notification of Coverage 





New Dischargers: 



Operational level attained_Upon Commencement of Discharge 

 


2. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days after any date identified in the above schedule of compliance the permittee
shall submit either a report of progress or, in the case of specific actions being required by identified dates, a written
notice of compliance or noncompliance. In the latter case, the notice shall include the cause of noncompliance, any
remedial actions taken, and the probability of meeting the next scheduled requirement. 



Part II 

Standard Conditions for NPDES Permits 



Section A. General Conditions 



1. Duty to Comply 



The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of
the Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or
modification; or for denial of a permit renewal application. 



2. Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions 



Any person who violates a permit condition is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day of such violation.
Any person who willfully or negligently violates permit conditions is subject to a fine of up to $50,000 per day of violation,
or by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. Any person who knowingly violates permit conditions is subject
to criminal penalties of $5,000 to 50,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both. Also,
any person who violates a permit condition may be assessed an administrative penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation
with the maximum not to exceed $125,000. [Ref: CFR 122.41(a)]. 



3. Duty to Mitigate 



The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge in violation of this permit which
has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment. 



4. Duty to Reapply 



Where EPA is the Permit Issuing Authority (PIA), the terms and conditions of this permit are automatically continued
in accordance with 40 CFR 122.6, only where the permittee has submitted a timely and complete Notice of Intent 180 days
prior to expiration of this permit, and the PIA is unable through no fault of the permittee to issue a new permit before
the expiration date. 



5. Permit Modification 



After notice and opportunity for a hearing, this permit may be modified, terminated, or revoked for cause (as described
in 40 CFR 122.62 et seq) including, but not limited to, the following: 

a. Violation of any terms or conditions of this permit; 

b. Obtaining this permit by misrepresentation or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts; 

c. A change in any conditions that requires either temporary interruption or elimination of the permitted discharge;
or 

d. Information newly acquired by the Agency indicating the discharge poses a threat to human health or welfare. 

If the permittee believes that any past or planned activity would be cause for modification or revocation and reissuance
under 40 CFR 122.62, the permittee must report such information to the Permit Issuing Authority. The submittal of
a new application may be required of the permittee. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification,
revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance,
does not stay any permit condition. 



6. Toxic Pollutants 



Notwithstanding Paragraph A-4, above, if a toxic effluent standard or prohibition (including any schedule
of compliance specified in such effluent standard or prohibition) is established under Section 307(a) of the Act
for a toxic pollutant which is present in the discharge and such standard or prohibition is more stringent than any
limitation for such pollutant in this permit, this permit shall be modified or revoked and reissued to conform to the
toxic effluent standard or prohibition and the permittee so notified. 



7. Civil and Criminal Liability 



Except as provided in permit conditions on ``Bypassing'' Section B, Paragraph B-3, nothing in this permit shall
be construed to relieve the permittee from civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance. 



8. Oil and Hazardous Substance Liability 



Nothing in this permit shall be construed to preclude the institution of any legal action or relieve the permittee
from any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties to which the permittee is or may be subject under Section 311
of the Act.

9. State Laws 



Nothing in this permit shall be construed to preclude the institution of any legal action or relieve the permittee
from any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties established pursuant to any applicable State law or regulation
under authority preserved by Section 510 of the Act. 



10. Property Rights 



The issuance of this permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privileges, nor does it
authorize any injury to private property or any invasion of personal rights, nor any infringement of Federal, State
or local laws or regulations. 



11. Severability 



The provisions of this permit are severable, and if any provision of this permit, or the application of any provision
of this permit to any circumstance, is held invalid, the application of such provision to other circumstances, and
the remainder of this permit, shall not be affected thereby. 




12. Duty to Provide Information 



The permittee shall furnish to the Permit Issuing Authority, within a reasonable time, any information which the
Permit Issuing Authority may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or
terminating this permit or to determine compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Permit
Issuing Authority upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit. 



 Section B. Operation and Maintenance of Pollution Controls 



1. Proper Operation and Maintenance 



The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control
(and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions
of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality
assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems
which are installed by a permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions
of the permit. 




2. Need to Halt or Reduce Not a Defense 



It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce
the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the condition of this permit. 



3. Bypass of Treatment Facilities 



a. Definitions 



(1) ``Bypass'' means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility, which is
not a designed or established operating mode for the facility. 

(2) ``Severe property damage'' means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities
which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably
be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays
in production. 




b. Bypass Not Exceeding Limitations 



The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions
of Paragraphs c. and d. of this section. 




c. Notice 



(1) Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if
possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass; including an evaluation of the anticipated quality and effect
of the bypass. 

(2) Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated bypass as required in Section D,
Paragraph D-4 (24-hour notice).

<DOCNO> FR941216-2-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-2-00043 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

d. Prohibition of Bypass



(1) Bypass is prohibited and the Permit Issuing Authority may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass,
unless: 

(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe and extensive property damage; 

(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as maintenance of sufficient reserve holding capacity,
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, waste hauling, or maintenance during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal
periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 

(c) The permittee submitted notices as required under Paragraph c. of this section. 

(2) The Permit Issuing Authority may, within its authority, approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Permit Issuing Authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in
Paragraph d.(1) of this section. 



4. Upsets 



``Upset'' means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology
based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the control of the permittee. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. An upset constitutes
an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit limitation if the
requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(n)(3) are met. (Note that this provision does not apply to water quality requirements.)




5. Removed Substances 



This permit does not authorize discharge of solids, sludge, filter backwash, or other pollutants removed in the course
of treatment or control of wastewaters to waters of the United States unless specifically limited in Part 1. 



Section C. Monitoring and Records 



1. Representative Sampling 



Samples and measurements taken as required herein shall be representative of the volume and nature of the monitored
discharge. All samples shall be taken at the monitoring points specified in this permit and, unless otherwise specified,
before the effluent joins or is diluted by any other wastestream, body of water, or substance. Monitoring points shall
not be changed without notification to and the approval of the Permit Issuing Authority. 



2. Flow Measurements 



Appropriate flow measurement devices and methods consistent with accepted scientific practices shall be selected
and used to insure the accuracy and reliability of measurements of the volume of monitored discharges. The devices
shall be installed, calibrated and maintained to insure that the accuracy of the measurements are consistent with
the accepted capability of that type of device. Devices selected shall be capable of measuring flows with a maximum
deviation of less than 

#

 10% from the true discharge rates throughout the range of expected discharge volumes. Guidance in selection, installation,
calibration and operation of acceptable flow measurement devices can be obtained from the following references:

device or method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more
than $10,000 per violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 2 
years per violation, or by both. 



5. Retention of Records 



The permittee shall retain records of all monitoring information, including all calibration and maintenance records
and all original strip chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports required
by this permit, and records of all data used to complete the application for this permit, for a period of at least 3 years
from the date of the sample, measurement, report or application. This period may be 
extended by the Permit Issuing Authority at any time. 



6. Record Contents 



Records of monitoring information shall include: 

a. The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements; 

b. The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements; 

c. The date(s) analyses were performed; 

d. The individual(s) who performed the analyses; 

e. The analytical techniques or methods used; and 

f. The results of such analyses. 



7. Inspection and Entry 



The permittee shall allow the Permit Issuing Authority, or an authorized representative, upon the presentation
of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, to: 

a. Enter upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records
must be kept under the conditions of this permit; 

b. Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of this permit; 

c. Inspect at reasonable time any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and control equipment), practices,
or operations regulated or required under this permit; and

Section D. Reporting Requirements 



1. Change in Discharge 



The permittee shall give notice to the Permit Issuing Authority as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations
or additions to the permitted facility. Notice is required only when: 

a. The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the criteria for determining whether a facility
is a new source; or 

b. The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or increase the quantity of pollutants discharged.
This notification applies to pollutants which are subject neither to effluent limitations in the permit, nor to notification
requirements under Section D, Paragraph D-10(a). 



2. Anticipated Noncompliance 



The permittee shall give advance notice to the Permit Issuing Authority of any planned change in the permitted facility
or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements. Any maintenance or facilities, which might
necessitate unavoidable interruption of operation and degradation of effluent quality, shall be scheduled during
noncritical water quality periods and carried out in a manner approved by the Permit Issuing Authority. 



3. Transfer of Ownership or Control 



A permit may be automatically transferred to another party if: 

a. The permittee notifies the Permit Issuing Authority of the proposed transfer at least 30 days in advance of the proposed

Section E. Definitions 



1. Permit Issuing Authority 



The Regional Administrator of EPA Region IV or his designee, unless at some time in the future the State receives the
authority to administer the NPDES program and assumes jurisdiction over the permit; at which time, the Director of
the State program receiving authorization becomes the issuing authority. 



2. Act 



``Act'' means the Clean Water Act (formerly referred to as the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act) Public Law 92-500, as amended by Public 
Laws 95-217, 95-576, 96-483, 97-117, and Public Law 100-4, 33 U.S.C. 
1251 et seq. 



3. Concentration Measurements 



a. The ``average monthly concentration'', is the sum of the concentrations of all daily discharges sampled and/or
measured during a calendar month on which daily discharges are sampled and measured, divided by the number of daily
discharges sampled and/or measured during such month (arithmetic mean of the daily concentration values). The daily
concentration value is equal to the concentration of a composite sample or in the case of grab samples is the arithmetic
mean (weighted by flow value) of all the samples collected during the calendar day. 

b. The ``maximum daily concentration'', is the concentration of a pollutant discharge during a calendar day. It is
identified as ``Daily Maximum'' under ``Other Limits'' in Part I of the permit and the highest such value recorded
during the reporting period is reported under the ``Maximum'' column under ``Quality'' on the DMR. 



4. Other Measurements 



a. The effluent flow expressed as MGD is the 24 hour average flow averaged monthly. It is the arithmetic mean of the total
daily flows recorded during the calendar month. Where monitoring requirements for flow are specified in 
Part I of the permit the flow rate values are reported in the ``Average'' column under ``Quantity'' on the DMR.

<PARENT> FR941216-2-00043 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. An ``instantaneous flow measurement'' is a measure of flow taken at the time of sampling, when both the sample and
flow will be representative of the total discharge. 
c. Where monitoring requirements for pH or dissolved oxygen are specified in Part I of the permit, the values are generally
reported in the ``Quality or Concentration'' column on the DMR. 


5. Types of Samples 


a. Grab Sample: A ``grab sample'' is a single influent or effluent portion which is not a composite sample. The sample(s)
shall be collected at the period(s) most representative of the total discharge. 


6. Calendar Day 


A calendar day is defined as the period from midnight of one day until midnight of the next day. However, for purposes
of this permit, any consecutive 24-hour period that reasonably represents the calendar day may be used for sampling.



7. Hazardous Substance 


A hazardous substance means any substance designated under 40 CFR Part 116 pursuant to Section 311 of the Clean Water
Act. 


8. Toxic Pollutant 


A toxic pollutant is any pollutant listed as toxic under Section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act.

permit are required to submit the appropriate application forms at least 180 days before expiration of their individual
permit. 
d. Dischargers who have not previously obtained an individual NPDES permit are required to submit to EPA the FDEP approval
order letter approving the site RAP. The RAP approval order shall be attached to an NOI to be covered by the general permit
and shall contain the same information specified in paragraph (a) above. The application for coverage under the general
permit must be made at least fourteen (14) days before the discharge is to commence. 
e. Dischargers seeking coverage under Part I A.3.a. will be required to submit to EPA the date the discharge is expected
to cease, results of analytical data and the same information in paragraph a above, except items (3), (4), (5) and (8).
Notification of coverage to discharge will be upon receipt of EPA's short-term coverage letter. 
f. Notification of coverage will be given by the Permit Issuing Authority by certified mail to the permittee (except
for short-term pump tests, 8-hours in duration or less), for dischargers seeking coverage under Part I Sections A.1
and A.2, with the issuance date for each facility being the effective date of coverage by the Permit Issuing Authority.

Short-term pump tests, shall be covered automatically once the permittee receives acceptable groundwater screening
values, and the permittee will be responsible meeting the requirements of Parts I.A.1 or A.2. The DMR's for these pump
tests shall be submitted to within thirty (30) days after discharge ceases. 
g. Dischargers meeting the conditions set forth in Part I A.3.c. are not required to submit an detailed NOI as outlined
above, but must submit a copy of the analytical tests and a summary of the proposed activity one (1) week after discharge
begins. These dischargers are covered upon receipt of the data, unless notified otherwise by EPA. 
h. The coverage of the permit shall expire on 

December 6, 1999. 
i. In accordance with 40 CFR 122.28(a)(2) permittees who are covered by this general permit who seek to be continued

pollution prevention activities. 


Part V 


Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Program, Acute Freshwater Language 


As required by Part I of the permit, within 30-days after commencement of discharge, permittees discharging to fresh
waters, which are surface waters in which the chloride concentration at the surface is less than 1500 milligrams per
liter, shall initiate the series of tests described below to evaluate whole effluent toxicity of the discharge from
the outfall. If more than one (1) outfall exists, separate tests will be performed on each outfall. All test species,
procedures and quality assurance criteria used shall be in accordance with 

Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms

, EPA/600/4-90/027F, or the most current edition. The dilution/control water used will be moderately hard
water as described in EPA/600/4-90/027F, Section 7, or the most current edition. A standard reference toxicant
quality assurance test shall be conducted concurrently with each species used in the toxicity tests and the results
submitted with the discharge monitoring report (DMR). Alternatively, if monthly QA/QC reference toxicant tests
are conducted, these results must be submitted with the DMR. 
1. a. The permittee shall conduct 96-hour acute static-renewal multi-concentration toxicity tests using the daphnid
(

Ceriodaphnia dubia

) and the fathead minnow (

Pimephales promelas

). All tests shall be conducted on one grab sample of 100% final effluent. All tests shall be conducted on a control (0%)
and the following dilution concentrations at a minimum: 100.0%, 50.0%, 25.0%, 12.5%, and 6.25%.

<TEXT>
 

b. If control mortality exceeds 10% for either species in any 
test, the test(s) for that species (including the control) 
shall be repeated. A test will be considered valid only if 
control mortality does not exceed 10% for either species. 
2. The toxicity tests specified above shall be conducted once every 
month until three (3) valid monthly tests have been completed, 
and once every year thereafter for the duration of the permit, 
unless notified otherwise by the permit issuing authority. 
These tests are referred to as ``routine'' tests. 
3. a. If unacceptable acute toxicity (an LC

50

 of 100% or less 
occurs in either test species in any of the above-described 
tests within the specified time) is found in a ``routine'' 
test, the permittee shall conduct two additional acute 
toxicity tests in the same manner as the ``routine'' test on 
the specie(s) indicating unacceptable acute toxicity. For 
each additional test, the sample collection requirements 
and test acceptability criteria specified in Section 1 
above must be met for the test to be considered valid. The 
first test shall begin within two weeks of the end of the 
``routine'' tests, and shall be conducted weekly thereafter 
until two additional, valid tests are completed. The 
additional tests will be used to determine if the toxicity 
found in the ``routine'' test is still present. 

 
b. Results from additional tests, required due to unacceptable 
acute toxicity in the ``routine'' test(s), must be 

reported 


on the Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) Form for the month 
in which the test was begun. Such test results must be 


submitted 

within 45 days of completion of the second 
additional, valid test. 



Part V 


Whole Effluent Toxicity Testing Program, Acute Saltwater Language 


As required by Part I of this permit, within 30-days after 
commencement of discharge, permittees discharging to marine 
waters, which are surface waters in which the chloride 
concentration at the surface is greater than or equal to 1500 
milligrams per liter, shall initiate the series of tests 
described below to evaluate whole effluent toxicity of the 
discharge from the outfall. If more than one (1) outfall exists, 
separate tests will be performed on each outfall. All test 
species, procedures and quality assurance criteria used shall be 
in accordance with 

Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity of 
Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms

, EPA/600/4-90/027F, 
or the most current edition. The dilution/control water and 
effluent used will be adjusted to a salinity of 20 parts per 
thousand using artificial sea salts as described in 
EPA/600/4-90/027F, Section 7 (or the most current edition). A 
standard reference toxicant quality assurance test shall be 
conducted concurrently with each species used in the toxicity 
tests and the results submitted with the discharge monitoring 
report (DMR). Alternatively, if monthly QA/QC reference toxicant 
tests are conducted, these results must be submitted with the 
DMR. 

 

1. a. The permittee shall conduct 96-hour acute static-renewal 
multi-concentration toxicity tests using the mysid 
shrimp (

Mysidopsis bahia

) and the inland silverside 
(

Menidia beryllina

). All tests shall be conducted on 
one grab sample of 100% final effluent. All tests shall 
be conducted on a control (0%) and the following 
dilution concentrations at a minimum: 100.0%, 50.0%, 
25.0%, 12.5%, and 6.25%. 
b. If control mortality exceeds 10% for either species in 
any test, the test(s) for that species (including the 
control) shall be repeated. A test will be considered 
valid only if control mortality does not exceed 10% for 
either species. 
2. The toxicity tests specified above shall be conducted once 
every month until three (3) valid monthly tests have been 
completed, and once every year thereafter for the duration of 
the permit, unless notified otherwise by the permit issuing 
authority. These tests are referred to as ``routine'' tests. 

3. a. If unacceptable acute toxicity (an LC

50

 of 100% or less 
occurs in either test species in any of the above- 
described tests within the specified time) is found in a 
``routine'' test, the permittee shall conduct two 
additional acute toxicity tests in the same manner as 
the ``routine'' test on the specie(s) indicating 
unacceptable toxicity. For each additional test, the 
sample collection requirements and test acceptability 
criteria specified in Section 1 above must be met for 
the test to be considered valid. The first test shall 
begin within two weeks of the end of the ``routine'' 
tests, and shall be conducted weekly thereafter until 
two additional, valid tests are completed. The 
additional tests will be used to determine if the 
toxicity found in the ``routine'' test is still present. 
b. Results from additional tests, required due to 
unacceptable acute toxicity in the ``routine'' 
test(s), must be 

reported 

on the Discharge 
Monitoring Report (DMR) Form for the month in which 
the test was begun. Such test results must be 


submitted

 within 45 days of completion of the 
second additional, valid test.

Federal Property Suitable as Facilities to Assist the Homeless


<AGENCY>

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilitized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless 

v. 

Veterans Administration

, No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).



Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.
Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).
For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.
For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.
Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to William
Molster at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.
For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e.

, acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: U.S. Army: Elaine Sims, CECPW-FP, U.S. Army Center for Public Works,
7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3862; (703) 355-3475; Dept. of Interior: Lola D. Knight, Property

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Conduct Public Scoping and Prepare Environmental Impact Statement for Fontenelle Natural Gas Infill Projects,
Wyoming</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to conduct public scoping and prepare an environmental impact statement. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The action proposed is to conduct scoping and to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the proposal of
DALEN Oil & Gas Co., Cabot Oil & Gas Co., and several other oil and gas companies (Companies) to drill up to approximately
1,322 infill wells in the existing Fontenelle and Lincoln Road natural gas fields over the next 10 years beginning
in 1995. The projects would occur within an area of existing oil and gas activity which is referred to as the ``cumulative
study area.'' The cumulative study area encompasses all or portions of 27 townships (T. 22-28 N., R. 108-113
W.) or approximately 900 square miles. The Green River forms the western edge of the cumulative study area. The area
is characterized by intermittent drainages, sagebrush-greasewood vegetation and an absence of residences. Lands
within the cumulative study area are primarily BLM and Bureau of Reclamation-administered but include minor amounts
of State and private land. Affected lands are primarily used for grazing, recreation, and oil and gas production.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The intent of the Fontenelle Natural Gas Infill Drilling Projects is to enhance natural gas recovery from the Fontenelle
and Lincoln Road lease areas, allowing the Companies to provide more natural gas to pipeline companies distributing
and supplying natural gas to consumers. This would benefit consumers by making additional supplies of clean-burning
natural gas available. The additional wells will maximize production in an area where approximately 447 wells are
already producing. The existing wells, plus the maximum potential development wells, could result in up to approximately
1,769 wells within the combined Fontenelle and Lincoln Road fields. However, the level and rate of additional drilling
and development will be contingent upon gas prices and energy tax credits. In addition to wellheads and production
units, associated facilities will include access roads, natural gas gathering pipeline systems, and individual
well tank facilities. 


An environmental assessment and supplement were prepared on natural gas development within the Fontenelle and Lincoln
Road areas in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The decisions for these environmental analyses concluded that a certain
level of development could be authorized without resulting in significant impact to the human environment. Development
concurrent with the preparation of the Fontenelle Natural Gas Infill Drilling Projects would be authorized so long
as it remains within the scope of the existing environmental analyses and decisions. Land and resource management
issues and concerns associated with the construction of roads, well pads, and pipelines; the drilling and completion
of wells; and the operation and maintenance of a producing well field that will be analyzed in the EIS include: 
 Potential impacts to big game crucial winter range and habitat. 
 Potential impacts to wildlife caused by poaching, harassment and increased vehicular access. 
 Potential impacts to sage grouse breeding and nesting habitat.

 Potential impacts to vegetation and reclamation problems associated with arid, saline or highly erosive
soils. 
 Potential impacts to air quality. 
 Potential impacts to petrified wood collecting areas. 
 Potential impacts to intermittent streams. 
 Potential impacts on steep slopes. 
 Potential impacts to cultural resources, including historic trails. 
 Potential impacts to wetlands and riparian areas. 
 Potential impacts to surface and groundwater quality. 
 Potential impacts associated with hazardous materials and spills. 
 Reclamation, revegetation and restoration of disturbed areas. 
 Potential impacts to federally-listed threatened and endangered species and Federal candidate species
(plant and animal), including the black-footed ferret, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, ferruginous hawk, and sensitive
fish species within the Green River. 
 Potential impacts to State Priority 1 bird and mammal species. 
 Potential impacts on the Green River and Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge. 
 Potential conflicts with livestock, wild horses and range improvements. 
 Potential impacts to visual resource qualities. 
 Potential impacts to recreation opportunities. 
 Potential impacts caused by increased traffic. 
 Potential royalty and tax revenues. 
 Potential impacts on housing. 
 Potential social and economic effects on local communities. 
 Potential impacts associated with increased public access and road density. 
 Compliance with Federal, State and local permit requirements. 
 Compatibility with BLM management plans and resource management objectives. 
 Monitoring and enforcement of mitigation measures. 
 Cumulative impacts. 

 Opportunities that may be derived from the proposed projects include: 
 Increased royalties and tax revenues to local, State, and Federal Governments. 
 Added employment and economic benefits to communities. 
 An increase in Wyoming's share of new and existing natural gas markets. 
 Development of additional supplies of natural gas that would assist in the attainment of clear air in conformance
with Federal air quality standards.

MT'' published in the 

Federal Register

, Volume 58, No. 96, page 29,432, on Thursday, May 20, 1993. This notice expands the amendment to include the following
land exchange. 


The Bureau of Land Management proposes exchanging 120.00 acres of Federal Surface estate to the Meissner Ranches

et al.,

 against several parties who are owners or operators of a facility at which hazardous substances are being released

500A Texas; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm.

The certification notice was issued on December 29, 1991 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 9, 1992 (57 FR 932). This notice was subsequently amended on March 6, 1992 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 16, 1992 (57 FR 9139). 

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The

Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to properly reflect this matter.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-26, 500 is hereby issued as follows:

<DOCTITLE>Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Kingstree, South Carolina; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application
for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>



On October 31, 1994, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of
Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject
firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on August 9, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 25, 1994 (59 FR 43867).

New findings from the company show that company imports of gloves from Malaysia and tray products from Mexico have
adversely impacted the company's workforce at Kingstree, South Carolina.



Conclusion



After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Cardinal Drilling, Billings, Montana, and Operating in the Following State</DOCTITLE>





Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance



In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on October 17, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm located at Billings, Montana. The notice was published in the Federal Register

 on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631).

At the request of the company, the Department again reviewed its certification for the workers of Cardinal Drilling
in Billings, Montana. New findings show that the firm operated in the state of North Dakota as well as in Montana.
The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending its certification to include worker separations in North Dakota.
The amended notice applicable to TA-W-30,355 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of Cardinal Drilling, Billings, Montana and operating in the state of North Dakota engaged in employment

<DOCTITLE>Coordinated Apparel Group, Inc.; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on November 9, 1994, applicable to all workers of Coordinated
Apparel Group, Inc., in Orwigsburg and Schuylkill, Pennsylvania and in Swainsboro, Georgia. The certification
notice will soon be published in the 

Federal Register

.

At the request of the company the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm.

New findings show that the workers at the distribution center in Jackson, South Carolina should be covered for trade
adjustment assistance since the distribution center only handled finished products from five manufacturing plants
of Coordinated Apparel where the workers are under current worker group certifications.

Sales and employment at Jackson, South Carolina decreased in 1993 compared to 1992 and in the first six months of 1994
compared to the same period in 1993.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include workers at Coordinated Apparel Group, Inc.,
in Jackson, South Carolina.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-30,364 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of Coordinated Apparel Group, Inc., Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania (TA-W-30,364); Sewing Facility
in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania (TA-W-30,364A); Swainsboro, Georgia (TA-W-30,364B)
and the Distribution Center in Jackson, South Carolina (TA-W-30,364C) engaged in employment related
to the production of knitted shirts who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after September
20, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Dresser Industries, Inc.; Guiberson-Ava Division, Dallas, TX; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration




On November 22, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The affirmative notice regarding application will soon be published
in the 

Federal Register

.

The workers provide drilling services to unaffiliated firms in the crude oil and natural gas industry.


Findings on reconsideration show that the subject firm had decreased sales in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY
1993. Substantial worker separations occurred in FY 1994.


U.S. imports of crude oil increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipment in 1993 compared to 1992 and increased
absolutely in the first six months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993.




Conclusion




After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers of Guiberson-AVA
Division of Dresser Industries, Inc., in Dallas, Texas were adversely affected by increased imports of articles
like or directly competitive with crude oil.





All workers of the Guiberson-AVA Division of Dresser Industries, Inc., in Dallas, Texas who became totally or partially
separated from employment on or after May 20, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223
of the Trade Act of 1974.

Eaton Corp.; Westinghouse & Cutler-Hammer Products; Kenosha, WI; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding
Application for Reconsideration





By an application dated November 2, 1994, Lodge 

#

34 of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject
petition for trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice was issued on October 17, 1994 and published in the


Federal Register

 on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631).



Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:



(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;



(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or



(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.



Investigation findings show that the workers produce two types of electrical drives_adjustable frequency and eddy
current.



The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the worker group eligibility
requirements of the Trade Act was not met. Production of the adjustable frequency drives was transferred to another
corporate site in Florida while the eddy current drives experienced increased sales and production at Kenosha in
the relevant periods.



The union states that 28 percent of the market for electric drives is manufactured offshore. A review of the investigation
findings, however, show that the subject firm has no major declining customers.



Foreign competition, in itself, would not form a basis for a worker group certification_only increased imports of
electric drives that are like or directly competitive with those produced at the workers' firm and which contributed
importantly to declines in employment, sales or production at the workers' firm would provide a basis for a worker
group certification.



Other findings show that there are no plans to transfer production of adjustable frequency drives overseas.




Conclusion





After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Harbour Casuals, Inc., Plains, PA, Roxanne of Pennsylvania; Wilkes-Barre, PA; Amended Certification Regarding
Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on June 8, 1994, applicable to all workers of Harbour Casuals,
Inc., in Plains, Pennsylvania. The certification notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 24, 1994 (59 FR 32716).

At the request of the Hazleton-Wyoming Valley District Council of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union
(ILGWU) the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm.

New findings show that the production at Harbour Casuals was integrated with that of Roxanne of Pennsylvania. Harbour
Casuals was the cutting firm and Roxanne of Pennsylvania is the sewing firm. Both firms were engaged in the production
of ladies' sportswear and swimwear.

Sales, production and employment at Roxanne of Pennsylvania decreased in 1993 compared to 1992.

U.S. imports of various ladies' sportswear and swimwear increased in 1993 compared to 1992.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports.
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include workers at Roxanne of Pennsylvania in Wilkes-Barre,
Pennsylvania.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,776 is hereby issued as follows:




All workers of Harbour Casuals, Inc., in Plains, Pennsylvania and Roxanne of Pennsylvania in Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania
engaged in employment related to the production of ladies' sportswear and swimwear who became totally or partially
separated from employment on or after April 11, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section
223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

Scab Rock Feeders, Incorporated, Othello, WA; Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration





On October 27, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's
Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA-Transitional Adjustment Assistance
for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued on October 6, 1994 and was published
in the Federal Register

 on October 21, 1994 (59 FR 53212).



The petitioner claims that the imported cattle from Canada has been a major factor in the decline of Scab Rock Feeders.
Also, the workers were certified earlier under petition TA-W-23,045.




Conclusion





After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claims are of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<DOCTITLE>Tunnelton Mining Co,; Uniontown, PA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>


By an application dated November 2, 1994, District 

#

5 of the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for
trade adjustment assistance, TAA. The denial notice was issued on October 13, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or 
(3) of the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
Investigation findings show that the workers produce steam coal for electric power customers.
Investigation findings show that imports of coal were negligible in 1993.
Other findings show that the Department's survey of the Tunnelton's sole customer shows that the customer did not
import steam coal or fuel oil in the relevant period.
Other investigation findings show that the mine closed because the contract with the sole customer expired.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<USBUREAU>Employment Standards Administration Wage and Hour Division</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>


General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






In the Matter of Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co. and Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. (Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone
Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3); Exemption 



I



The Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License
No. DPR-61 which authorizes operation of the Haddam Neck Plant, and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO
or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-21, DPR-65 and NPF-49 which
authorize operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, and 3 (Millstone) respectively. The
licenses provide, among other things, that the Haddam Neck Plant and the Millstone plants are subject to all rules,
regulations and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.

The Haddam Neck Plant is a single-unit pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site located in Middlesex
County, Connecticut. The Millstone plants consist of a boiling water reactor and two pressurized water reactors
located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut.



II



The Code of Federal of Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities
in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``the licensee shall
establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective
to provide high assurance that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense
and security and do not constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''

The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that, ``the
licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also requires that, ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals
who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' It further states that individuals not employed by
the licensee (e.g., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided that the individual,
``receives a picture badge upon entrance into a protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected
area. * * *''

The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access system which would eliminate the need to issue
and retrieve picture badges at the entrance/exit location to the protected area and would allow all individuals,
including contractors, to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the Haddam Neck Plant and
the Millstone plants.

By letter dated September 28, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5).
Specifically, the requested exemption would allow individual, including contractors, who have unescorted access
to retain possession of their picture badges instead of returning them as they exit the protected area.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may upon application of any interested person or
upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. The Code of Federal Regulations
at 10 CFR 73.55 allows the Commission to authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection against
radiological sabotage provided the licensee demonstrates that the proposed measures meet the general performance
requirements of the regulation, and that the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological
sabotage equivalent to that which would be provided by the regulation.
Currently, unescorted access into the protected area for both employee and contractor personnel into the Haddam
Neck Plant and the Millstone plants is controlled through the use of picture badges. Positive identification of personnel
which are authorized and request access into the protected area is established by security personnel making a visual
comparison of the individual requesting access and that individual's picture badge. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5),
contractor personnel are not allowed to take their picture badges offsite. In addition, in accordance with the plant's
physical security plan, the licensee's employees are also not allowed to take their picture badges offsite.
The proposed system will require that all individuals with authorized unescorted access have the physical characteristics
of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their picture badge number in a computerized access control system.
Therefore, all authorized individuals must not only have their picture badge to gain access to the protected area,
but must also have their hand geometry confirmed. All individuals, including contractors, who have authorized unescorted
access into the protected area will be allowed to keep their picture badges in their possession when departing the
Haddam Neck Plant and the Millstone plants.
All other access processes, including search function capability and access revocation, will remain the same. A
security officer responsible for access control will continue to be positioned within a bullet-resisting structure.
It should be noted that the proposed system is only for individuals with authorized unescorted access and will not
be used for those individuals requiring escorts.
Sandia National Laboratories conducted testing which demonstrated that the hand geometry equipment possesses
strong performance characteristics. Details of the testing performed are in the Sandia report, ``A Performance
Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices,'' SAND91_0276 UC_906 Unlimited Release, June 1991. Based on the
Sandia report, the false acceptance rate for the proposed hand geometry system would be at least equivalent to that
of a photo picture identification system. The site security plans will also be revised to allow implementation of
the hand geometry system and to allow employees and contractors with unescorted access to keep their badges in their
possession when leaving the Haddam Neck Plant and the Millstone plants.


IV


For the foregoing reasons, the Commission has determined that the proposed alternative measures for protection
against radiological sabotage meet the same high assurance objective and the general performance requirements
of 10 CFR 73.55. In addition, the staff has determined that the overall level of the proposed system's performance
will provide protection against radiological sabotage equivalent to that which is provided by the current system
in accordance with 10 CFR 73.55.
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, the exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest and hereby
grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning of picture badges upon
exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by the licensee, i.e., contractors, who are authorized
unescorted access into the protected area, can take their badges offsite.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuance of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of human environment (59 FR 63385).
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

Tennessee Valley Authority (Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 1); Exemption 




I




The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR-77, which authorizes
operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Unit 1 (the facility, Unit 1). The license provides, among other things,
that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect. 



The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor located on TVA's Sequoyah site in Soddy Daisy, Hamilton County,
Tennessee.




II





Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires that Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) be performed during
reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years. 



On March 2, 1993, SQN Unit 1 entered a forced outage and started the Cycle 6 refueling outage. All Type B and Type C LLRTs
were preformed during the outage, which ended in December 1993. The unit returned to 


 service on April 20, 1994. Due to the length of the outage, a number of LLRTs that were performed early in the outage were
reperformed prior to conducting the containment integrated leak rate test (CILRT) in December 1993. LLRTs of values
that were initially tested between April 3 and July 19, 1993, however, were not retested because of schedule restraints
associated with the CILRT. Since the 2-year time interval for the Type C value pentrations that were not retested will
expire starting in April 1995, Unit 1 would be forced to shut down at that time to perform the tests unless a schedular
exemption is granted. 



The next Unit 1 refueling outage is scheduled to start in September 1995. Therefore, the licensee has proposed an exemption
to allow a one-time deferment of the Appendix J interval requirement for the affected Type C valve penetration tests
from April 3, 1995, until October 1, 1995, a total of approximately 181 days for the first valve tested during the Cycle
6 outage. 



The extension would affect 126 isolation valves of 242 valves in the leak rate test program and are listed in the submittal.
They are considered by the licensee to be leak tight and in good condition, which was verified by the leak rate tests
performed during the Cycle 5 refueling outage. Based on the present total integrated containment leak rate that accounts
for less than 93 percent of the 0.75 La limit, the licensee believes that the remaining margin is sufficient to ensure
that any incremental increase in leakage because of the extension, will not result in unacceptable as-found test
results. Also, based on historical data, the licensee believes that any incremental increase in leakage from these
valves because of the extension would be small. In addition, the valves 


 were included in the boundary for the Last Type 
A test that was performed in December 1993, and have been subjected to improved maintenance practices that provide
increased assurance that they will be capable of performing their intended safety function. 




III




Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative,
grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special
circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application
of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary
to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. * * *''



The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not to exceed
2 years, is to ensure that any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified within
a time span that prevents significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow the tests
to be conducted during scheduled refueling outages. This interval was originally published in Appendix J when refueling
cycles were conducted at approximately annual intervals and has not been changed to reflect 18-month or 2-year operating
cycles. It is not the intent of the regulation to require a plant shutdown solely for the purpose of conducting the periodic
leak rate tests. Based on historical data at SQN, any incremental increase in leakage because of the extension would
be small. Improved maintenance 


 practices implemented during the Unit 1 Cycle 5 outage, and continued in the Unit 1 Cycle 6 outage, provide increased
assurance that these 
components will perform their safety function. Therefore, since the 
maximum extension is relatively short (approximately 181 days for the first valve tested during the Cycle 6 outage)
compared to the 2-year test 
interval requirement, it is unlikely that substantial degradation of the valves leading to the failure of the containment
to perform its safety function would occur. As a result, the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances
is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.

IV


For the foregoing reasons, the NRC staff has concluded that the licensee's proposed increase of the 2-year time interval
for performing the Type C Leak Rate Tests of the valves specified in the application until the Cycle 7 refueling outage
will not present an undue risk to public health and safety and is consistent with the common defense and security. The
NRC staff has determined that there are special circumstances present, as specified in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), such that
application of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.3 is not necessary in order to achieve the underlying purpose
of this regulation.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law,
will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is, otherwise, in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants the Tennessee Valley Authority exemption from the requirements of Section III.D.3
of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 for Unit I as requested in the submittal.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 63387).

This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License
and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-32 and DPR-37, issued to Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee), for operation
of the Surry Power Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Surry County, Virginia.

The proposed amendment would revise the Surry, Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications (TS) to increase the presently
rated core power level of 2441 Megawatts thermal (MW

t

) in accordance with the licensee's application for amendments dated August 30, 1994. The proposed changes correspond
to approximately a 4.3% increase from the currently licensed core power of 2441 MW

t

. In addition, revision would be made to the Surry operating licenses, the TS Bases, and administrative changes are
being made to the affected pages to eliminate the discussion of two-loop operation and to capitalize defined words
and system names. Moreover, the licensing basis assessment includes a review of the accident analyses, component
and system, emergency operating procedures, affected TS pages and appropriate sections of the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By January 17, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC and at the local public document room located at the Swem Library, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia
23185. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first pre-hearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 

Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross examine witnesses.

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 This notice announces a new application process for Federal jobs. Beginning on January 1, 1995, Federal agencies
may not require an SF 171, Application for Federal Employment. Instead, applicants may apply for most jobs with a resume,
the Optional Application for Federal Employment, or any other written format of their choice. For unique jobs with
specialized requirements or jobs filled through automated systems, agencies may have been authorized to require
special forms.



A new OPM flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, describes what applicants should include in their resumes or applications.
The flyer and the Optional Application for Federal Employment are being printed for distribution in December. Applicants
can get copies beginning in December from local OPM Employment Information Offices, by calling OPM's automated telephone
system at 912-757-3000 or by TDD at 912-744-2299. These items will also be available in December
in electronic format from OPM's bulletin board at 912-757-3100.

By February, OPM plans to make the flyer available in alternative media formats (Braille, large print, audio tape,
and computer disk) for persons with disabilities. In addition, beginning in December any applicant may use the electronic
Optional Application file and any word processing software to produce and print a completed application form. (See
question 6 below).

Before appointment, agencies will ask individuals to complete a Declaration for Federal Employment to determine
their suitability for Federal employment. The Declaration for Federal Employment replaces the SF 61-B, Declaration
of Appointee, and will also be available in December.

<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 In a June 22, 1994,

 Federal Register

 notice (59 FR 32290) OPM announced its request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction
Act for clearance of proposed job application procedures to replace the SF 171, Application for Federal Employment.
OMB has approved the new application procedures to take effect on January 1, 1995, the day after the OMB authorization
for the SF 171 expires on December 31, 1994.



After the SF 171 expires, Federal agencies may not require applicants to submit it. Applicants may file for most jobs
using a resume, the Optional Application for Federal Employment, or any other written format of their choice, including
an SF 171. Agencies are authorized to use this process for positions in the competitive service, the excepted service
and the Senior Executive Service.

The following Questions and Answers give more information on the new application procedures.

(1) Why did OPM develop the new procedures?

In its September 1993 report, Creating a Government that Works Better & Costs Less, the National Performance
Review recommended that OPM eliminate standard application forms because their length and complexity discourage
applicants from seeking Federal jobs. OPM agreed to eliminate the SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, and
associated forms, the SF 171-A, Continuation Sheet for SF 171, and the SF 172, Amendment to Application for Federal
Employment as of December 31, 1994. An interagency task force recommended new application procedures that let applicants
choose the format of their application. In addition to giving applicants more flexibility (but also give Federal
agencies the material needed for evaluation), another goal was to separate the qualifications and suitability information.
Suitability information will be collected on the Declaration for Federal Employment. (See question 22.)

(2) What groups were involved in developing the new procedures?

An interagency task force representing 16 Federal agencies recommended the new application procedures. OPM then
sought comments from the National Partnership Council, the Interagency Advisory Group (representing 90 agencies),
unions with national consultation rights with OPM, and organizations representing major constituent groups. The
new procedures were published in the June 22, 1994, 

Federal Register

. 

(3) Is the final application process basically the same as the June 22, 1994, 

Federal Register

 proposals?

Yes, although there are some editorial and stylistic changes in the flyer and forms. Samples of the final materials
are appended to this notice. One change, in response to comments received, was the deletion of birth date from information
applicants are required to submit with their job application or resume. Several commenters noted privacy issues,
the potential for age discrimination, and that for the vast majority of jobs, it is sufficient for agencies to obtain
the date of birth only from job finalists. For the few positions such as law enforcement where age is a factor, agency
vacancy announcements can ask applicants to give their age.

(4) What provisions have been made for applicants with disabilities?

The flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, will be available in Braille and large print and on audio tape and computer disk.
(The flyer tells applicants what to include in their resumes or applications for Federal jobs.) Beginning in February,
individuals who want these alternative formats may request them by calling 912-757-3000 or TDD 912-744-2299.

In addition, in December the flyer and the Optional Application for Federal Employment will be available through
OPM's electronic bulletin board. See question 6 below for specific instructions.

(5) How will the OPM publicize the new application process?

OPM has planned a major publicity campaign including news releases and mailings to Federal offices, State Employment
Service offices, State Vocational Rehabilitation Services offices, colleges and universities, and other major
constituency groups. The mailing will include the new application materials, as well as a poster and a flyer describing
OPM's automated employment information systems.

(6) How will the applicants get the new application materials?

Beginning in December, copies will be available from several sources. Applicants may call or visit local OPM Employment
Information Offices or they may call OPM's automated telephone system at 912-757-3000 and listen for
the message on how to request forms. Information is also available by TDD at 912-744-2299.

Applicants can also get the materials through OPM's electronic bulletin board.

(1) Call the Federal Job Opportunities Board (FJOB) at 912-757-3100, 

(2) At the main menu, select ``Opportunities for Federal Employment,''

(3) Select ``Application Information and Forms,'' and

(4) Read or download the files. Note: applicants may use the electronic ``Optional Application file'' and any word
processing software to produce and print a completed application form.

(7) May applicants use commercial PC software to prepare their resume, the Optional Application for Federal Employment,
or application in another format?

Yes. See question above. Also, applicants may use any PC software to help prepare their application, but they are responsible
for making sure that their application contains

 all

 the information requested in the flyer, Applying for a Federal Job,

 and

 in the vacancy announcement.

(8) In August 1994, OPM issued a bulletin giving agencies the opportunity to order the new application materials by
``riding'' OPM's printing request to GPO. If an agency did not order then, how may they obtain the new materials?

The General Services Administration (GSA) will stock the new forms some time in February. Agencies may order the forms
through the GSA Supply Center Catalog.

The stock numbers of the new materials are as follows:






Applying For a Federal Job (OF 510), NSN 7540-01-351-9177

Optional Application for Federal Employment (OF 612), NSN 7540-01-351-9178

Declaration for Federal Employment (OF 306), NSN 7540-01-368-7775






(9) OMB approved the new application procedures for a 3-year period. What will happen after the OMB authorization
expires?

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-2-00149 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

OMB approves information collections from the public under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Three years is the maximum
authorization period. At the appropriate time, OPM will seek renewal of the OMB authorization. The forms do not show
the expiration date so they will be usable in the future when the authorization is extended.
(10) Did OMB also approve OPM's use of computer-assisted systems to rate applicants?
Yes. OMB approved OPM's use of the revised optical scan forms (1203 series) that collect applicant information and
qualifications in a format suitable for automated processing. The revised forms no longer contain questions related
to suitability because agencies will obtain that information through the new Declaration for Federal Employment.
OMB also approved OPM's collection of applicant information through the Telephone Application Processing System
(TAPS) used to fill certain jobs.
(11) Can a Federal agency design its own form and seek OMB approval for its use?
A proliferation of Government application forms would be counter to the National Performance Review objective of
simplifying the job application process. OMB will consider requests for agency-specific forms only for unique jobs
with highly specialized requirements or for special forms needed for a computer-assisted application system.
(12) Can a Federal agency require all applicants to use the new Optional Application for Federal Employment?
No. But if an agency fills jobs through an automated system that uses a computer-compatible version of the form that
is otherwise identical, it may require the computer-compatible form. OMB and GSA approval is not required for an otherwise
identical, computer-compatible Optional Application for Federal Employment. Agency forms management officials
will find instructions in GSA's Federal Information Resources Management Regulation Bulletin B-3, Revision
1. Use of a non-identical, computer-compatible application 

would 

require OMB and GSA approval even if it asks for the same information as the Optional Application for Federal Employment.
(13) Can a Federal agency require 

its own employees 

to file for vacancies using a particular form?
Yes. When recruiting from only its own employees and not seeking candidates through outside-the-register or competitive
examining, an agency may require a particular form, for example, the Optional Application for Federal Employment.
Although it may make existing supplies of the SF 171 available to its employees, an agency may not require the SF 171
because after December 31, 1994, it is no longer an authorized form. OMB approval is not required for a form that seeks
job-related information only from an agency's own employees. An agency's ``own employees'' are its current employees,


not

 former employees with reinstatement eligibility, and not employees from other agencies. An agency for this purpose
is, for example, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Navy, and the Environmental Protection Agency.
(14) What is the status of agency-specific application forms approved by OMB 

prior 

to the implementation of these new application procedures?
Each agency should check with its forms management office. That office will probably consult with the agency's OMB
desk officer to determine how the new process impacts on existing OMB approvals.
(15) Given that the SF 171 is authorized only through the end of 1994, can an agency require the SF 171 in a vacancy announcement
issued in 1994 with a closing date in 1995?
If an agency issues a vacancy notice that opens in 1994 but closes 

on or before January 31, 1995, 

the agency may require applicants to submit an SF 171. Similarly, an agency must close by 

January 31, 1995, 

any open continuous announcement that requires an SF 171. Any announcement issued on or after January 1, 1995, may
not require the SF 171.
(16) How should agencies handle incomplete applications, i.e., applications that do not contain all the information
requested in the vacancy announcement?
Each agency needs to establish a policy on how it will handle incomplete applications. It may decide not to consider
incomplete applications, to ask applicants for the missing information, or to rate incomplete applications as is.
All applicants for a particular vacancy must be treated in the same way. It would be helpful and more fair to applicants
if agency vacancy announcements stated the policy on incomplete applications.
(17) The new procedures tell applicants to submit proof with their applications if they claim 5 point veterans' preference.
Should agencies reject applications that do not include proof of 5 point preference?
Currently, applicants for civil service examinations submit proof at the time of selection. However, the interagency
work group (see question 2) concluded that waiting until the end to verify 5 point preference slowed down the selection
process. To phase in this new requirement without harming preference eligibles, OPM strongly suggests that agencies


not 

reject applications that lack proof of 5 point preference but instead ask the veterans to submit it promptly.
(18) What part does the agency vacancy announcement play in the new application process?
The vacancy announcement is key; it tells applicants what information the agency needs. 

The vacancy announcement can request any job-related information necessary to evaluate candidates for the position(s)
and any information required by law, 

such as:



Identification, including name, address, Social Security Number, date of birth, phone numbers.
Job related qualifications, such as work experience, education, minimum college credits for professional positions,
training, licenses, accomplishments, evidence of specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-2-00150 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Personal information to satisfy general legal requirements, when applicable, such as citizenship, veterans' preference,
minimum and maximum age requirements, and proof of competitive status.
Applicant preferences, where applicable, such as work location, work schedule, type of employment (permanent or
temporary).



OPM's flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, tells applicants they must furnish the information requested in the flyer


and 

the information requested in the agency vacancy announcement. The flyer also tells applicants 

not 

to send certain information, for example, college transcripts, 

unless 

requested in the vacancy announcement.
(19) May an agency use the flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, in conjunction with its vacancy announcements to tell
applicants what to include in their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s or applications?
Yes. The flyer is intended to help agencies communicate with applicants about the types of information to include
in their applications. The vacancy announcement may repeat 

all 

the information requested in the flyer or a copy of the flyer may be attached to the vacancy announcement. If the vacancy
announcement merely references the flyer, applicants need to know where they can get a copy to assure their applications
are complete. Until the procedures become widely known, agencies may want to include full information in their announcements.
(20) Can vacancy announcements require applicants to describe all their work experience over a period of years, for
example, to show where they were employed over the past 5 years?
Since a goal of the new application process is reducing the burden on applicants, they should be asked to describe only
job-related qualifications rather than their entire work history over a period of years.
(21) Can agencies require applicants to certify on their r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that the information they have provided
is correct?
This certification is not needed at the beginning of the employment process. Before appointing an individual, the
agency will get the certification on the Declaration for Federal Employment. (See next question.) The optional application
also contains a certification and the flyer alerts applicants that they will be required to sign a certification.
(22) The SF 171 contained questions about an applicant's suitability for Federal employment. Under the new procedures
how will agencies obtain this information?
Suitability questions are now included on the new Declaration for Federal employment. Separating this sensitive
information from the job application makes it possible to restrict access to the information and thus to give greater
protection to an individual's privacy.
(23) Is the new Declaration for Federal Employment required for all Federal civilian service appointments or just
appointments in the competitive service?
Before anyone can be appointed or converted to a new appointment in the competitive service, the excepted service,
or the Senior Executive Service, he or she must execute a Declaration for Federal Employment. In addition, the form
may be needed in position changes, for example, for agency determinations concerning nepotism and for OPM background
investigations. OPM will publish specific requirements in The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions.
(24) At what point in the hiring process should agencies require individuals to complete the new Declaration for Federal
Employment?
An individual must complete the form before he or she is appointed, but agencies should not routinely ask applicants
to submit a Declaration along with their r&eacute;sum&eacute; or application. A major reason for creating the Declaration
was to separate qualifications information from suitability information so that agencies could better protect
the privacy of individuals by restricting access to more sensitive background data. Given the privacy concerns and
the intent to reduce the burden on applicants, OPM strongly encourages agencies to require the Declaration only from
the job finalists who have met all qualifications requirements except where to do otherwise would have a significantly
adverse impact on the hiring process.
(25) Can agencies use the SF 61-B, Declaration of Appointee, after December 31, 1994?
No, the OMB authorization for that form expires on December 31, 1994. After that date agencies must use the new Declaration
for Federal Employment before appointing an individual in the Federal civilian service.
(26) After December 31, 1994, if an applicant chooses to use the SF 171 as an application form, must he or she complete
the Background Information section (items 37-47 on conduct and suitability)? Must the individual sign the
application?
No. An applicant using the SF 171 by choice is required to provide only the information in OPM's flyer Applying for a
Federal Job and in the agency vacancy announcement. The hiring agency will obtain the suitability information and
signature through the new Declaration for Federal Employment.
(27) Did OMB approve the proposed collection of information relating to military spouse preference and child care
providers?
Yes. To determine eligibility for military spouse preference as required by section 806 of the Defense Authorization
Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-145), the Department of Defense may include the following question in its materials,
for example, in job announcements or in the Declaration for Federal Employment.





Are you applying to exercise Spouse Preference?


( ) Yes  ( ) No



If yes, attach a copy of your sponsor's active duty military orders of assignment to the geographic location of the
position vacancy or written evidence or documentation that verifies eligibility.
To assure compliance with section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-647), agencies may include
the following questions on the Declaration for Federal Employment signed by applicants for Federal child care positions:


Have you ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child? If ``Yes,'' provide the date, explanation
of the violation, disposition of the arrest or charge, place or occurrence, and the name and address of the police department
or court involved.





Note: 

A Federal agency is required by law to conduct a criminal check. In addition to the purposes explained in block 16, your
signature also certifies that (1) your response to this question is made under penalty of perjury, which is punishable
by (insert Federal punishment for perjury); and (2) you have received notice that a criminal check will be conducted,
of your right to obtain a copy of the criminal history report made available to the employing Federal agency, and of
your right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in the report.



To assure compliance with Pub. L. 101-647 and also with section 408 of the Miscellaneous Indian Legislation
(Pub. L. 101-630), the Departments of Interior and Health and Human Services may add the following question
to the Declaration for Federal Employment, for positions that involve regular contact with or control over Indian
children:

<DOCTITLE>Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee Open Committee Meeting</DOCTITLE>



According to the provisions of section 10 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), notice is hereby
given that meetings of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee will be held on_




Thursday, January 5, 1995
Thursday, January 19, 1995
Thursday, February 2, 1995
Thursday, February 16, 1995
Thursday, March 2, 1995
Thursday, March 30, 1995.




The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in Room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900
E Street, NW., Washington, DC.

The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, five representatives from labor unions
holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and five representatives from Federal
agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5347.

The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing
prevailing rates under subchapter IV, chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel
Management.

These scheduled meetings will start in open session with both labor and management representatives attending. During
the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise strategy
and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matter discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably impair
the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matter being considered and would disrupt substantially the
disposition of its business. Therefore, these caucuses will be closed to the public because of a determination made
by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463) and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). These caucuses may, depending on the issues involved,
constitute a substantial portion of the meeting.

Annually, the Committee publishes for the Office of Personnel Management, the President, and Congress a comprehensive
report of pay issues discussed, concluded recommendations, and related activities. These reports are available
to the public, upon written request to the Committee's Secretary.

The public is invited to submit material in writing to the Chairman on Federal Wage System pay matters felt to be deserving
of the Committee's attention. Additional information on these meetings may be obtained by contacting the Committee's
Secretary, Office of Personnel Management, Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, Room 1340, 1900 E Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20415 (202) 606-1500.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of
Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service and the ACAT-Fund/SERV Interface




December 9, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on November 8, 1994, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by MCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



MCC proposes to amend its procedures to comply with New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 412 which sets forth the
time for transferring customer accounts
 and with National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') Rule 50, Section 9
 regarding NSCC's Automated Customer Account Transfer (``ACAT'') Service.
 MCC also proposes to amend its procedures regarding the ACAT-Fund/SERV interface to comply with the NYSE requirement
that all mutual fund account transfers be accomplished by use of an automated system where the NYSE member organizations
are participants in a registered clearing agency which has such a facility. 








II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filng with the Commission, MCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MCC has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(

A

) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 



NSCC's ACAT Service is an input, comparison, and settlement service for customer account transfers from one brokerage
firm to another. MCC Article VI, Rule 3 authorizes MCC to establish procedures for its linkage to NSCC's ACAT Service
including the establishment of time periods. MCC's proposal is consistent with NSCC's recent amendments to NSCC
Rule 50, Section 9 shortening NSCC's recent amendments to NSCC Rule 50, Section 9 shortening the period in which a participant
that is to receive a transferred account has to review the transfer instructions and reply thereto. The completed
transfer cycle will be reduced from ten business days to seven business days for transferring cash or margin accounts
and from fifteen business days to seven business days for transferring retirement accounts. The portion of MCC's
filing containing these procedures is consistent with the NYSE and NSCC proposals; therefore, MCC's procedures
also will take effect on December 2, 1994. 

MCC's proposed rule change also proposes to make minor changes to the ACAT-Fund/SERV interface
 to comply with the NYSE requirement that generally all mutual fund account transfers must be accomplished by using
the automated systems of a registered clearing agency where both the receiving broker-dealer and the delivering
broker-dealer are participants in a registered clearing agency which has such a facility.
 In accordance with a NYSE Rule 412, this change will be effective March 3, 1995. In addition, under its proposal MCC
no longer will treat account transfers containing option positions differently from transfers of accounts without
option positions.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941216-2-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941216-2-00090 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

MCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. MCC's procedures setting forth the shortened time period
for transferring accounts are appropriate because they properly reflect the changes set forth by the NYSE and NSCC
in their efforts to enhance automation of the transfer process. In addition, the revised procedures are consistent
with the Commission's effort to reduce the settlement cycle as required by Rule 15c6-1
 which mandates a three business day settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions effective June 7, 1995.







(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 


MCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



MCC has not solicited or received comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii)
 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e)(4)
 promulgated thereunder because the proposal effects a change in an existing service of MCC that does not adversely
affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of MCC and does not significantly affect the
respective rights or obligations of MCC or persons using the service. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such
rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action
is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Security Application Fee for the PORTAL Market</DOCTITLE>



December 12, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 30, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the NASD is herewith filing a proposed rule change to the
PORTAL Market Rules, Schedule I to the NASD By-Laws (``PORTAL Rules'') to amend the security application fee in Article
I, Section 1 with respect to securities submitted for designation in The PORTAL Market. The NASD is proposing to delay
the implementation of the adoption of the security application fee in Article IX, Section 1, approved by the SEC in
Securities Exchange Release No. 34562 (August 19, 1994), 59 FR 44210, and the implementation of proposed rule change
filed herein to January 3, 1995. Below is the text of the proposed rule change. Proposed new language is italicized;
proposed deletions are in brackets.



The PORTAL Market

Schedule I to the NASD By-Laws



* * * * *



PART IX

PORTAL FEES

Sec. 1 Entry Fee



When a PORTAL participant submits an application for designation of any class of securities as a PORTAL security,
it shall pay to the Corporation a filing fee of $2,000 [per class of security covered by the security] 

for an 

application 

covering a security or group of identifiable securities issuable as part of a single private placement covered by
the same offering documents, 

[submitted] plus $200 per assigned security symbol that is in addition to the first symbol assigned.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) On August 19, 1994, the Commission approved an NASD amendment to its PORTAL Rules that added a security application
fee for PORTAL participants
 applying for designation of any class of securities as a PORTAL security.
 The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. operates the PORTAL Market for the quotation of securities that are restricted securities,
as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or securities that are treated
as if restricted.
 In order to qualify for inclusion in the PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must
be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act,
 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification
number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class. Designation of a security as a PORTAL security permits
the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard & Poor's Corporation and be cleared and settled through
the Depository Trust Company.








The security application fee required a fee of $2,000 per class of security covered by the security application and,
as well, a fee of $200 for each assigned security symbol that is in addition to the first symbol assigned. The application
fee rule language required that the NASD assess the $2,000 fee with respect to each separate class of security when
one or more classes of securities are covered by a single security application. This is not the manner in which the NASD
intended to implement the new fee. In the NASD's rule filing related to the new fee, SR-NASD-94-39,
the NASD stated that the ``NASD is proposing to adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus
$200 for each security identification symbol assigned after the first symbol.'' The foregoing description more
accurately described that the NASD intends to assess the new fee with respect to each security application submitted,
rather than with respect to each class of security covered by the application.

In order to clarify the rule language of the security application fee provision in Part IX, Section 1 of the PORTAL Rules,
the NASD is proposing to amend Section 1 to provide that the PORTAL participants shall pay a filing fee of $2,000 for
an application covering a security or group of identifiable securities issuable as part of a single private placement
covered by the same offering documents, plus $200 per assigned security symbol that is in addition to the first symbol
assigned. The NASD believes that the foregoing rule language makes clear that the $2,000 fee applies with respect
to each private placement offering, notwithstanding that the offering may involve multiple issuers and contain
multiple securities.

The security application fee was effective August 19, 1994. In light of concerns that arose regarding the clarity
of the rule language of the new provision in Article IX, Section 1, the NASD delayed implementation of the new fee in
order to develop revised rule language that would more clearly indicate the intended application of the fee. The NASD
is proposing to delay the implementation of the security application fee approved by the SEC in Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 34562 (August 19, 1994), 59 FR 44210 and the implementation of proposed rule change filed herein to
January 3, 1995.

(b) The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates
or controls in that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications submitted by PORTAL
dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities to the PORTAL Market.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of
Act Rule 19b-4 because the rule change constitutes an interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration,
or enforcement of an existing rule of the NASD. At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change, the Commission
may summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by January
6, 1995.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Relating to a Three Month Extension of the Interim SOES Rules </DOCTITLE>
 


December 9, 1994.
 


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on December 7, 1994,
 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons. 
 





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 
 


On December 23, 1993, the Commission approved on a one-year pilot basis changes to The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.'s
(``Nasdaq'') Small Order Executive System (``SOES'') that: (1) Reduced the maximum size order eligible for execution
through SOES from 1,000 shares to 500 shares; (2) reduced the minimum exposure limit for ``unpreferenced'' SOES orders
from five times the maximum order size to two times the maximum order size, and eliminated the exposure limits for ``preferenced
orders''; (3) implemented an automated function for updating market maker quotations when the market maker's exposure
limit has been exhausted; and (4) prohibited short sales through SOES (collectively referred to hereinafter as the
``Interim SOES Rules'').
 Except for the short sale prohibition, the NASD proposes to extend, until May 1, 1995, the effectiveness of the Interim
SOES Rules. 
 




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Propoed Rule Change

 


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
 


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

 


On December 23, 1993, the SEC issued an order that approved the Interim SOES Rules on a one-year pilot basis effective
January 7, 1994. In response to two applications requesting a stay of the Interim SOES Rules Approval Order, however,
the SEC granted a partial stay of the effective date of the order until January 25, 1995.
 Thus, since the Commission approved the Interim SOES Rules for a one-year period and this one-year period did not commence
until the Commission's order approving the rules became effective on January 25, 1994, it is the NASD's understanding
that the Interim SOES Rules will expire on January 25, 1995, absent further Commission action. 
 




As described in more detail below, because the NASD believes implementation of these rule changes has been associated
with positive developments in the markets for Nasdaq securities and clearly has not had any negative effect on market
quality, the NASD believes it is appropriate and consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the
protection of investors to extend the effectiveness of the interim SOES Rules (without the short sale prohibition)
until the rules governing the operation of The Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View and Execution System (``NPROVE'')
have been approved by the SEC and implemented.

NPROVE is a new Nasdaq system for the execution of small-sized customer orders that will provide individual investors
with enhanced limit order protection and important price improvement opportunities, while at the same time affording
market makers an enhanced means to manage the risks associated with market making. The NASD anticipates that NPROVE
will be ready for implementation by May 1, 1995 and is hopeful that the SEC will consider approval of NPROVE well prior
to that date. Accordingly, assuming the SEC approves NPROVE by May 1, 1995, the NASD believes it is necessary for the
protection of investors and the preservation of the quality of the markets for Nasdaq securities to extend the effectiveness
of the Interim SOES Rules for approximately three months until May 1, 1995, so that there will be no lapse between the
effective date of NPROVE and termination of the Interim SOES Rules. By preventing a lapse in the effectiveness of the
Interim SOES Rules, the NASD believes investors and the marketplace as a whole will continue to receive the substantial
benefits derived from the Interim SOES Rules.

The Interim SOES Rules reflect a reasoned approach by the NASD to address the adverse effects on market liquidity attributable
to active intra-day trading activity through SOES, while at the same time not compromising the ability of small, retail
investors to receive immediate executions through SOES. Specifically, the Interim SOES Rules are designed to address
concerns that concentrated, aggressive use of SOES by a growing number of order entry firms has resulted in increased
volatility in quotations and transaction prices, wider spreads, and the loss of liquidity for individual and institutional
investor orders. In light of the SEC's approval of the NASD's proposed short sale rule in June 1994,
 however, the NASD believes it is appropriate to permit short sales to be entered in SOES. Accordingly, the NASD proposes
to allow the effectiveness of this particular SOES rule to lapse on January 25, 1995.





The NASD believes that the same arguments and justifications made by the NASD in support of approval of the Interim
SOES Rules are just as compelling today as they were when the SEC relied on them to approve the rules. In sum, the NASD
continues to believe that concentrated bursts of SOES activity by active order-entry firms contribute to increased
short-term volatility, wider spreads, and less market liquidity on Nasdaq and that the Interim SOES Rules are an effective
means to minimize these adverse market impacts.

The NASD also notes that the SEC made specific findings in the Interim SOES Rules Approval Order that the interim rules
were consistent with the Act. In particular, the SEC stated in its approval order that:




a. Because the benefits for market quality of restricting SOES usage outweigh any potential decrease in pricing efficiency,
the Commission concludes that the net effect of the proposal is to remove impediments to the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system, and to protect investors and the public interest, and that the proposed rule
changes are designed to produce accurate quotations, consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act.
In addition, the Commission concludes that the benefits of the proposal in terms of preserving market quality and
preserving the operational efficiencies of SOES for the processing of small size retail orders outweigh any potential
burden on competition or costs to customers or broker-dealers affected adversely by the proposal. Thus, the Commission
concludes that the proposal is consistent with Section 15A(b)(9) of the Act in that it does not impose a burden on competition
which is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.






b. The Commission also concludes that the proposal advances the objectives of Section 11A of the Act. Section 11A provides
that it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly
markets to assure economically efficient execution of securities transactions, fair competition among market
participants, and the practicality of brokers executing orders in the best market. The Commission concludes that
the proposal furthers these objectives by preserving the operational efficiencies of SOES for the processing of
small orders from retail investors.






c. The Commission believes that it is appropriate to restrict trading practices through SOES that impose excessive
risks and costs on market makers and jeopardize market quality, and which do not provide significant contributions
to liquidity or pricing efficiency. * * * The Commission believes that it is more important to ensure
that investors seeking to establish or liquidate an inventory position have ready access to a liquid Nasdaq market
and SOES than to protect the ability of customers to use SOES for intra-day trading strategies.






d. The Commission believes that there are increased costs associated with active intra-day trading activity through
SOES that undermine Nasdaq market quality * * * . Active intra-day trading activity through
SOES can also contribute to instability in the market.






e. In addition, these waves of executions can make it difficult to maintain orderly markets. Given the increased volatility
associated with these waves of intra-day trading activity, market makers are subject to increased risks that concentrated
waves of orders will cause the market to move away. As a result, individual market makers may be unwilling to narrow
the current spread and commit additional capital to the market by raising the bid or lowering the offer. When market
makers commit less capital and quote less competitive markets, prices can be expected to deteriorate more rapidly.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the NASD to take measured steps to redress the economic
incentives for frequent intra-day trading inherent in SOES to prevent SOES activity from having a negative effect
on market prices and volatility.






f. The Commission does not believe that intra-day trading strategies through SOES contribute significantly to market
efficiency in the sense of causing prices to reflect information more accurately.






g. The Commission has evaluated each of the proposed modifications to SOES, and concludes that each of the modifications
reduces the adverse effects of active trading through SOES and better enables market makers to manage risk while maintaining
continuous participation in SOES. In addition, the Commission does not believe that any of the modifications will
have a significant negative effect on market quality. To the extent that any of the modifications may result in a potential
loss of liquidity for small investor orders, the Commission believes that these reductions are marginal and are outweighed
by the benefits of preserving market maker participation in SOES and increasing the quality of executions for public
and institutional orders as a result of the modifications.






h. The Commission * * * has determined that the instant modifications to SOES further the objectives
of investor protection and fair and orderly markets, and that these goals, on balance, outweigh any marginal effects
on liquidity for small retail orders, and any anticompetitive effects on order entry firms and their customers. The
Commission concludes that the ability of active traders to place trades through a system designed for retail investors
can impair market efficiency and jeopardize the level of market making capital devoted to Nasdaq issues. The Commission
believes that the rule change is an appropriate response to active trading through SOES, and that the modifications
will reduce the effects of concentrated intra-day DOES activity on the market.





The NASD believes these significant statutory findings by the SEC regarding the Interim SOES Rules and the SEC's assessment
of the likely benefits to the marketplace that would result from the rules have been confirmed and substantiated by
an econometric study conducted by the NASD's Economic Research Department on the effectiveness of the Interim SOES
Rules.
 When the SEC approved the Interim SOES Rules, it stated that ``[a]ny further action the NASD seeks with respect to SOES_extension
of these modifications upon expiration, or introduction of other changes_will require independent consideration
under Section 19 of the Act.''
 In addition, the SEC stated that, should the NASD desire to extend these SOES changes or modify SOES, the Commission
would expect ``the NASD to monitor the quality of its markets and assess the effects of these changes on market quality
for Nasdaq securities.'' Also, if feasible, the SEC instructed the NASD to provide a quantitative and statistical
assessment of the effects of the SOES changes on market quality; or, if an assessment is not feasible, the SEC stated
that the NASD should provide a reasoned explanation supporting that determination.






In sum, the NASD's study found that:




 Since the SOES changes went into effect in January 1994, the statistical evidence indicated that when average
daily volume, stock price, and stock price volatility are held constant through regression techniques, quoted percentage
spreads in Nasdaq securities experienced a decline in the immediate period following implementation of the changes
and have continued to decline since then. The statistical evidence also showed that the narrowing of quoted percentage
spreads became more pronounced and robust the longer the Interim SOES Rules were in effect. In particular, quoted
spreads in cents per share for the 500 largest Nasdaq National Market securities experienced a sharp decline from
April 28 to May 12 and from June 23 to July 18 (footnote omitted);

<TEXT>
 

 With the exception of a brief, market-wide period of volatility experienced by stocks traded on Nasdaq, the
New York Stock Exchange, and the American Stock Exchange during the Spring, the volatility of Nasdaq securities appears
to be unchanged in the period following implementation of the changes; and 

 A smaller percentage of Nasdaq stocks experienced extreme relative price volatility after implementation
of the rules and that these modifications, in turn, suggest a reduction in relative volatilities since the rules were
put into effect.




The NASD also believes that its study of the effectiveness of the Interim SOES Rules lends credence to another NASD
study that was submitted to the SEC in support of approval of the Interim SOES Rules.
 In the May 1993 SOES Study, the NASD found that concentrated waves of orders entered into SOES by active order-entry
firms resulted in discernible degradation to the quality of the Nasdaq market. Specifically, the study found, among
other things, that: (1) Bursts of orders entered into SOES by active order entry firms frequently result in a decline
in the bid price and a widening of the bid-ask spread; (2) that there is a significant positive relationship between
increases in spreads and volume attributable to active order-entry firms as it related to total SOES volume per security;
and (3) activity by active order-entry firms resulted in higher price volatility and less liquidity_higher price
changes are associated with high active trading firm volume, even after controlling for normal price fluctuations.
Given the positive market effects associated with the Interim SOES Rules, the NASD believes the findings of the May
1993 SOES Study as well as the economic assumptions, principles, and hypotheses underlying the study should not be
dismissed by the Commission as ``inconclusive'' and that more weight should be given to the study.






Therefore, in light of all the above-cited statutory findings made by the SEC when it approved the Interim SOES Rules,
coupled with the NASD's findings that the interim rules have been associated with positive market developments in
terms of lower spreads on Nasdaq and less stocks with extreme relative price volatility, the NASD believes it would
be consistent with the Act for the Commission to extend the Interim SOES Rules for a brief three month period so that
the interim rules can continue on an uninterrupted basis until May 1, 1995, the anticipated implementation date for
NPROVE. In sum, the NASD believes its study affirms the validity and correctness of the SEC's prior statutory findings
made in connection with the approval of the interim rules. Moreover, even if the Commission is unwilling to find positive
significance in the NASD's statistical analyses, at the very least, these studies indicate that the market has not
been harmed by implementation of the Interim SOES Rules. As a result, the Commission's rationale for the approval
of the Interim SOES Rules for one year is equally compelling, if not more compelling given the apparent positive effects
of the rules, to justify approval of the NASD's proposal to extend the rules for approximately three months. To do otherwise
would require the SEC to refute its prior findings that the Interim SOES Rules are consistent with the Act. Given the
absence of any evidence of unanticipated harm associated with implementation of the interim rules, the NASD believes
the Commission would have no factual basis to justify such a refutation.




Moreover, even if the Commission concludes that the Interim SOES Rules have had no impact on market quality, the NASD
believes the Commission's approval of New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') Rule 80A on a permanent basis illustrates
that the Commission would still have a sufficient basis to approve an extension of the Interim SOES Rules for a brief
three month period.
 When NYSE Rule 80A was proposed, the Commission received considerable adverse comment to the effect that there was
no causal relationship between index arbitrage and market volatility and that activation of the rule during turbulent
market conditions could have disastrous effects on related options and futures markets and actually exacerbate
market volatility. Despite these comments, the Commission approved the proposal on a one-year pilot basis noting
that ``the NYSE proposal represents a modest step, proposed on a pilot basis, to attempt to address the issue of market
volatility.''
 After the one-year pilot, the NYSE prepared a report that, in the SEC's words, found that ``the standard measures of
NYSE market quality appear largely unaffected by Rule 80A.'' Specifically, the NYSE Report indicated that: (1) Quotes
on the NYSE did not widen after the 50 DJIA point trigger was reached; and (2) the imposition of Rule 80A did not have any
negative effect on price continuity and depth in the market.
 In addition, in approving Rule 80A on a permanent basis, the SEC noted that the rule ``represents a modest but useful
step by the NYSE to attempt to address the issue of market volatility,''
 that the rule ``has not been disruptive to the marketplace,''
 and that there was a ``lack of evidence of any harmful effects of Rule 80A.''
 In sum, the SEC discussion of the statutory basis for approval of NYSE Rule 80A focused in large part on the fact that
Rule 80A did not have any adverse impacts on market quality on the NYSE and that, as a result, the NYSE should be given
the latitude to take reasonable steps to address excessive volatility in its marketplace. Accordingly, the NASD
believes the SEC should afford the NASD the same regulatory flexibility that it afforded the NYSE to implement rules
reasonably designed to enhance the quality of Nasdaq and minimize the effects of potentially disruptive trading
practices.










The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11) and
11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Among other things, Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing
information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public
interest. Specifically, the NASD is proposing to retain the Interim SOES Rules for three months because of concerns
that concentrated, aggressive use of SOES by a growing number of order entry firms has resulted in increased volatility
in quotations and transaction prices, wider spreads, and the loss of liquidity for individual and institutional
investor orders, all to the detriment of public investors and the public interest. The NASD believes the Interim SOES
Rules have operated to rectify this situation while continuing to provide an effective opportunity for the prompt,
reliable execution of small orders received from the investing public. With respect to the proposal to remove the
short sale prohibition from SOES, by expanding the spectrum of retail orders that will be eligible to receive automatic
executions through SOES, the NASD believes the proposal may enhance investor protection. Nonetheless, the NASD
is very concerned that re-allowing the entry of short sales into SOES may contribute to destabilizing short term trading
through SOES that could have adverse corollary effects throughout Nasdaq.
 Accordingly, in order to protect investors and the public interest, the NASD believes the Interim SOES Rules should
be extended until May 1, 1995, so that small investors' orders will continue to receive the fair and efficient executions
that SOES was designed to provide.







Section 15A(b)(9) provides that the rules of the Association may not impose any burden on competition not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Interim SOES Rules apply across the board and do not target
any particular user or participant. For instance, all SOES orders must be for 500 shares or less, according to the tier
size requirements, all dealers may set their exposure limits at two times the tier size, and all dealers may elect to
utilize the automated quote update feature. Accordingly, the NASD believes that these rule changes are not anti-competitive,
as they are uniform in application and they seek to preserve the ability of SOES to provide fair and efficient automated
executions for small investor orders, while preserving market maker participation in SOES and market liquidity.

Section 15A(b)(11) empowers the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations relating to securities
in the Nasdaq market. Such rules must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, prevent fictitious
and misleading quotations, and promote orderly procedures for collecting and distributing quotations. The NASD
is seeking to continue the effectiveness of the Interim SOES Rules so that SOES activity may not result in misleading
quotations in the Nasdaq market. Market makers place quotes in the Nasdaq system and these quotes comprise the inside
market and define the execution parameters of SOES. When volatility in the SOES environment causes market makers
to widen spreads or to change quotes in anticipation of waves of SOES orders, quotes in the Nasdaq market become more
volatile and may be misleading to the investing public. Accordingly, absent continuation of the Interm SOES Rules,
the quotations published by Nasdaq may not reflect the true market in a security and, as a result, there may be short-term
volatility and loss of liquidity in Nasdaq securities, to the detriment of the investing public. Further, the continuation
of the automated refresh feature will ensure that a market maker's quotation is updated after an exposure limit is
exhausted. Uninterrupted use of this function will maintain continuous quotations in Nasdaq as market makers exhausting
their exposure limits in SOES will not be subject to a ``closed quote'' condition or an unexcused withdrawal from the
market. Finally, the NASD notes that despite the reduction in the maximum order size for SOES, market makers are still
obligated to adhere to minimum display size requirements for quotations in Nasdaq National Market securities and
Nasdaq SmallCap securities.



Finally, the NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with significant national market system objectives
contained in Section 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. This provision states it is in the public interest and appropriate for
the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure, among other things, (i) economically
efficient execution of securities transactions; (ii) fair competition among brokers and dealers; and (iii) the
practicality of brokers executing investor orders in the best market. Specifically, the Interim SOES Rules advance
each of these objectives by preserving the operational efficiencies of SOES for the processing of small investors'
orders, by maintaining current levels of market maker participation through reduced financial exposure from unpreferenced
orders exceeding 500 shares, and by reducing price volatility and the widening of market makers' spreads in response
to the practices of order entry firms active in SOES. With respect to the proposal to remove the short sale prohibition
from SOES, by expanding the spectrum of retail orders that will be eligible to receive automatic executions through
SOES, the NASD believes the proposal may enhance investor protection. Nonetheless, the NASD is very concerned that
re-allowing the entry of short sales into SOES may contribute to destabilizing short term trading through SOES that
could have adverse corollary effects throughout Nasdaq.







In addition, for the same reasons provided by the SEC when it approved the Interim SOES Rules that are cited above in
the text accompanying footnotes four through eleven, the 


 NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), and 11A(a)(1)(C)
of the Act. 



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 





The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 




C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments of the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others





Comments were neither solicited nor received. 




III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 





Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consent, the Commission will:




A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or 



B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Amendment of Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Relating to the Small Order Execution System and the Proposed Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View and Execution
System</DOCTITLE>


December 9, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that in connection with File Nos. SR-NASD-94-13
 and SR-NASD-94-68,
 on October 24, 1994 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') an econometric analysis conducted by the NASD's Economic Research
Department. In addition, in connection with File No. SR-NASD-94-13
 on December 2, 1994 the NASD filed with the Commission an analysis of the potential for order queues to develop in its
proposed Nasdaq Primary Retail Order View and Execution System (``NPROVE''). The econometric analysis and the NPROVE
order queuing analysis are set forth in Items I and II below respectively, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.
Accompanying Nasdaq's analyses were certain graphs, charts and tables which are not included in this notice, but
are available for inspection in the Commission's Public Reference Room. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments from interested persons.







I. Impact of the SOES Interim Changes on the Quality of The Nasdaq Stock Market


In SEC Release No. 34-33377
 (the ``Release''), the SEC approved certain changes to the NASD's Small Order Execution System (``SOES'') on a pilot
basis. Specifically, the SEC approved the following changes to SOES: (1) A reduction in the maximum size order eligible
for SOES execution to 500 shares from 1,000 shares;
 (2) a reduction in the minimum exposure limit for ``unpreferenced'' SOES orders to two times the maximum exposure
limit from five times the maximum exposure; (3) the elimination of exposure limits for ``preferenced'' orders; (4)
the implementation of an automated function for updating market maker quotations when the market maker's exposure
limit has been exhausted; and (5) the prohibition of short sale transactions through SOES. These changes, collectively
referred to hereinafter as the ``SOES changes,'' went into effect on January 31, 1994.





Due to the pilot nature of these changes, the Commission stated that ``[a]ny further action the NASD seeks with respect
to SOES_extension of these modifications upon expiration, or introduction of other changes_will require independent
consideration under Section 19 of the Act.'' In addition, the SEC stated that, should the NASD desire to extend these
SOES changes or modify SOES, the Commission would expect, ``the NASD to monitor the quality of its markets and assess
the effects of the approved SOES changes on market quality for Nasdaq securities.'' Also, if feasible, the SEC instructed
the NASD to provide a quantitative and statistical assessment of the effects of the SOES changes on market quality;
or, if an assessment is not feasible, the SEC stated that the NASD should provide a reasoned explanation supporting
that determination.





Accordingly, in order to facilitate and support approval of the Nasdaq Stock Market's Nasdaq Primary Order View and
Execution (NPROVE) system, or an extension of the SOES changes, should the Commission not approve NPROVE before termination
of the SOES changes, the NASD is submitting this economic study conducted by the NASD's Economic Research Department
on the impacts of the SOES changes on the quality of the markets for Nasdaq securities.
In sum, the study found that:
 Since the SOES changes went into effect in January 1994, quoted spreads in Nasdaq securities experienced a
decline in the immediate period following implementation of the changes and have continued to decline since then.
In particular, quoted spreads for the 500 largest Nasdaq National Market securities experienced a sharp decline
from April 28 to May 12 and from June 23 to July 18.





 With the exception of a brief, market-wide period of volatility experienced by stocks traded on Nasdaq, the
New York Stock Exchange, and the America Stock Exchange during the Spring, the volatility of Nasdaq securities appears
to be unchanged in the period following implementation of the changes.
The SOES changes were designed to correct a major market quality problem caused by the establishment in mid-1988 of:
(1) a requirement that market makers in NNM securities must participate in SOES and (2) minimum market maker exposure
limits of 5000 shares for the most active group of NNM securities (1988 SOES changes). While the 1988 SOES changes were
intended to ensure that order entry firms could obtain executions for their customers in volatile markets, the changes
also had the unintended consequence of dramatically changing the dynamics and economics of intra-day trading by
investors in Nasdaq. Specifically, the assurance of automatic order execution afforded investors through SOES
spawned trading by SAT firms that resulted in market makers receiving multiple executions in brief periods of time
without the ability to update their quotes. This rapid-fire, intra-day trading by SAT firms increased the cost of
market making and, in turn, resulted in a dramatic widening of displayed quotation spreads as market makers avoided
the trading risks associated with the mandated 5,000-share exposure limit in SOES.
The SOES changes noted above were an attempt by the NASD to preserve the benefits of SOES for small retail investors
and eliminate the negative market impacts created by abuses of SOES. As detailed below, the NASD's analysis illustrates
that the SOES changes have been associated with substantive improvements in the quality of the markets for Nasdaq
securities and that these positive improvements have become more pronounced the longer the changes have been in effect,
as market makers have adjusted their trading practices to reflect the lower costs and risks associated with SOES trading.
As the SEC stated in the release, market factors other than SOES changes may be jointly or singly responsible for changes
in market quality. However, market quality measures are useful in indicating whether the SOES changes have been associated
with non-negative or positive changes in market quality. Even though cause and effect cannot be statistically proven,
as pointed out succinctly in the Release, the absence of negative market developments associated with the implementation
of the SOES changes, coupled with the apparent positive market improvements associated with the SOES changes, provides
useful support for the SEC's evaluation of its decision to approve the SOES changes.

Given the SEC's prior determination that it is virtually impossible to measure the impacts on market quality of changes
in SAT firm activity and given the applicability of the SOES changes to all NNM securities, NASD monitoring has focused
on a before-and-after analysis of commonly accepted measures of market quality, without trying to distinguish the
impacts of trading by SAT firms. The SOES changes are treated as a partial reversal of a microstructure change made
in mid-1988 (the 1988 SOES changes) and analyzed on a before-and-after basis.
The impacts of such structural changes do not occur completely on the immediate day after their introduction. For
example, spreads did not widen immediately after the mandatory SOES exposure limits were put in place in mid-1988.
Rather, adjustments to such changes and their impacts are gradual and distributed out over a period of time. Competitive
forces cannot be expected to reverse instantaneously the quality of market conditions that evolved from microstructure
restrictions and related arrangements that were in place for nearly six years.
Moreover, the SOES changes impact indirectly the measures of market quality. Each change, while important, can be
expected to have different adjustment time periods. While a change in the maximum size order permitted to be entered
into SOES is immediate, changes to market-maker exposure limits require adjustments by traders, as they reevaluate
their quotation and inventory management procedures and their use of order-driven systems (rather than displayed
quotations) to adjust inventories. Also the new automated quotation update, permitted after a transaction, cannot
be implemented without varying time lapses by the many different market makers.
Nonetheless some improvement in the quality of the market for Nasdaq stocks has occurred in the period following the
SOES changes. The analysis of the impact of the SOES changes on market quality focuses on the associated movements
in Nasdaq market spreads, stock-price volatility, volume of SOES trading, the average size of SOES trades, and other
indicators of market quality. The objective is to determine whether any apparent changes in market quality measures
followed the reduced SOES regulations on market makers.
To evaluate the impact of these changes, the NASD established a data set for the one-year pilot, beginning with November
11, 1993, and including complete audit trail information for a sample of days that includes approximately two days
each month during the pilot. Although the pilot period is not over, enough data is available to derive some findings
as to the changes in market quality that followed these SOES changes.


Impact of the SOES Change on the Level of SOES Activity


The average daily share volume of SOES transactions and the number of SOES trades declined sharply following the SOES
changes (see Chart 1). The immediate decline in average daily SOES volume approximated 52 percent from January to
February, and the decline in the number of SOES trades was 17 percent. Moreover, the average SOES trade size declined
43 percent from January to February. The average trade size, which had risen from 310 shares in mid-1988, when the mandatory
minimum exposure limits were instituted (see Chart 2) to 581 shares in January 1994, dropped sharply to 332 in February.
It is the average trade size in SOES that appears to best reflect SOES activist trader presence in the data. It is apparent
from Chart 2 that SOES activists entered the market as proprietary traders immediately after the imposition of the
mandatory SOES exposure limits in mid-1988. Because this activity violated SOES rules however, the NASD took action
to preclude such trading through SOES and they withdrew as proprietary traders. Later, in 1989, these SAT firms began
coaching individuals to trade through SOES in a similar fashion. As a result the average size of a SOES trade began its
long uptrend in 1989, ending in January 1994, with a resulting substantial widening of spreads of large, actively
traded stocks (See Chart 6).

Whether some SOES activist volume merely shifted to one of the many alternative execution systems following the January
1994 SOES changes or whether some trading activities ceased because they were only profitable in a regulatory environment
with higher market-maker exposure requirements has not been determined. Some traders apparently have resumed using
SOES at the 500 share level even with the lower exposure limits. This is suggested by the fact that the SOES average trade
size continues above the mid-1988 level and the decline in the number of SOES trades was much less than the decline in
SOES share volume. SOES activist traders generally trade in the maximum order size permitted in SOES.



Displayed Quotation Spreads



Displayed Quotation Spreads declined in the six months following the January 31 SOES changes. The improvement in
displayed spreads
 is evident in the pattern of average bid/ask spreads of the largest NNM stocks (see Chart 3). Average spreads of the
largest 500 NNM stocks, those most affected by SOES trading, appear flat immediately following the SOES changes;
but they then decline sharply (see Chart 4) as market makers became aware of the lower risks involved in moving their
displayed spreads closer to the actual trade-to-trade price changes that were occurring in the order-driven segments
of the market. The first sharp decline in spreads is evident between the April 28 and May 12 sample days (see Chart 4).
A second sharp break occurred between the June 23 and July 18 sample days. However spreads appear to be narrowing throughout
the post-SOES change period.





Confirmation of the improvement in displayed quotation is the proportion of share volume occurring in stocks with
closing displayed bid/ask spreads of one-quarter or less. The percentage of volume accounted for by such stocks fluctuated
around 61 percent until May 1994, when it rose to 62.5 percent, another clear indication that spreads were tightening
(see Table 1). It rose further to 65.6 percent in June, to 66.2 percent in July, and to 68.7 percent by September.

Additional supporting information, in Charts 5 and 6, shows SOES average trade size and the number and percentage
of NNM stocks with end-of-day quotation spreads less than 50 cents. SOES average trade size reflects the entry and
activity of SOES activist traders. Firms effecting proprietary trades through SOES caused the average to rise briefly
in 1988, but SOES volume attributable to individual traders active in SOES started in 1989 and expanded until January
1994. A major decline in the percentage of NNM stocks with end-of-month spreads less than 50 cents per share is apparent
as SOES traders took advantage of the mid-1988 institution of the 5,000-share minimum exposure limit for SOES active
stocks. An uptrend in that percentage has emerged following the January reduction in market-maker exposure minimums.

To examine further these quotation spread patterns, regressions were prepared using NNM stocks grouped by various
characteristics. The regressions controlled for market factor influences on spread including volume, stock price,
and intra-day price volatility. A dummy variable (0,1) was used to reflect the periods before (0) and after (1) the
SOES changes. Regressions were run using all NNM stocks, the largest 500 NNM stocks, 1,000- share tier, 500-share
tier and 200-share tier stocks and stocks with a proportionate decline in SOES activity after the January 1994 changes.
These regressions confirm that spreads narrowed in the six months following the SOES changes for all groups of stocks
except for those stocks in the 500- and 200-tier categories, even after controlling for volume, price and intra-day
price volatility. For the 500-and 200-tier groups the before and after changes overall were not statistically significant.

A negative beta coefficient for the dummy variable indicates a decrease in spreads from the period before the changes
to the periods after the SOES changes. For the first three months after the changes, the beta coefficient for the dummy
variable is generally negative but statistically insignificant. However, by the second three-month period the
coefficients were negative and statistically significant for all NNM stocks, the 1,000 share tier group and the largest
500 group, indicating that quotation spreads were indeed narrowing. Because SOES volume for the largest 500 NNM stocks
represents 65 percent to 75 percent of the total SOES volume, the significance of the statistical results is critical
for this group.

Successive regressions then were for the largest 500 group using for each stock the average of the pre-change days,
and separately the average for each of the post-change days to observe changes in the beta coefficient of the dummy
variable. The negative value of beta depicts a negative difference between the pre-change average spreads and the
post-change individual day observation sets for every day in the post-change period. Beta coefficients are negative
for each day and statistically significant for each day except for February 17, April 14, April 28, and May 26, 1994.

It is clear that the changes is SOES reduced uncontrollable or mandated market-maker risk exposure across all NNM
stocks and the changes appear to have resulted in significantly lower spreads for the largest 500 group.



Volatility



As the SEC pointed out in the release, differentiating between the effects on spreads and stock-price volatility
attributable to active SOES traders and the effects attributable to other factors may not be possible. Market volatility,
in particular, surges and recedes. This makes exceedingly difficult measurement of temporary impacts on price volatility
of unnecessary market-maker risk exposures that provide profitable trading situations to opportunistic traders.

It is apparent from the volatility of the various indexes (see Chart 7) that dramatic changes occurred in market volatility
during the six months following the SOES changes. The average absolute value of daily percent changes of the Nasdaq
Composite Index fluctuates from over 0.03 percent in January 1994 to practically no change in February and March.
Then it jumps to nearly 0.07 percent in April.

Substantial effort would be required to empirically sort out the effects on volatility of the SOES changes, if indeed
it is possible to sort them out. NASD attempts to isolate these effects statistically have not been successful. Nonetheless
an analysis was performed of stock volatility distributions on the sample days. Valatilty is calculated by taking
the standard deviation of the absolute percent changes in the bid price. A frequency distribution of each stock's
bid volatility was constructed for each day in the analysis, and the skewness of these distribution curves was computed.

Skewness is a measure that describes to what extent a curve deviates from a normally distributed bell shape. The distribution
of stock volatilities is found a contain a smaller right tail in the post-change period than in the pre-change period
as evidenced from the declining measure of skewness (see Chart 8). The smaller right tail reflects a smaller percentage
of stocks with extreme relative price volatility in the post-change period. Also the measures of dispersion of the
individual stock volatilities are smaller for the post-change days. These distributional differences suggest
a reduction in relative volatilities in the post-change period. 



Other Considerations



Major improvements, other than the SOES changes in January 1994, are being instituted in Nasdaq trading to enhance
market quality. New requirements affecting the handling of customer limit orders were adopted on July 9, 1994; a shore-sale
bid test took effect in early September; and the proposed NPROVE system to replace SOES is awaiting SEC action.

As a result, identifying the delayed impacts of the SOES changes may not be possible beyond the first few months included
here.



Conclusion



The reduction in the mandatory minimum exposure limits and SOES order sizes, which in turn decrease market-maker
risk exposure, clearly have been associated with positive changes in market quality. In particular, displayed spreads
have narrowed. More importantly, there is no evidence of negative impacts on market quality.

While the impacts of the SOES changes cannot be precisely segregated from the impacts of other factors with 100 percent
certainty, the absence of negative changes in measures of market quality and the presence of positive changes in such
measures following the introduction of the SOES changes in late January 1994 support a conclusion that the changes
resulted in improved market quality. The higher mandated exposure requirements and larger order sizes in place from
mid-1988 to January 31, 1994, in retrospect, were not necessary and appear to have caused wider spreads as market makers
adjusted their activities to avoid the transactions of active traders in SOES.



II. Analysis of Potential for Order Queues to Develop in NPROVE



In a letter dated August 16, 1994, Commission staff requested that Nasdaq provide an assessment of the potential for
queues to develop and the basis for this assessment.
 In a letter dated December 7, 1994, Nasdaq responded in writing to the request. The relevant portions of Nasdaq's letter
are as follows:







In sum, as the attached graphs and tables indicate, Nasdaq believes the potential for sustained, lengthy order queues
to develop in NPROVE for any given security is minimal.
 In fact, for the days analyzed by the staff, the data shows that over 98 percent of the orders transmitted by non-SOES
activist firms
 would have received an execution within 30 seconds. In addition, while our analysis illustrates that queues for a
given security will develop for brief periods of time, our analysis also indicates that these occasional queues appear
likely to abate in a matter of minutes. Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, our analysis demonstrates that, to
the extent that there would be noticeable queues in NPROVE, these queues would be directly attributable to a narrow
segment of orders originating from SOES activists that were transmitted in waves during discreet, short periods
of time. When these queues do develop, however, a small percentage of retail customer orders (2 percent) may be delayed
by the queue created by the SOES activists' orders. Aside from these episodic queues attributable to SOES activists,
the data indicates that lengthy queues in NPROVE would be rare. Accordingly, Nasdaq does not believe it is very likely
that significant, on-going order queues will develop in NPROVE during peak volume days.









In addition, Nasdaq notes that the recent proposed amendments to NPROVE will further help to ensure that significant,
on-going order queues will not develop in NPROVE.
 Specifically, under the proposed order processing methodology for NPROVE, unpreferenced market orders entered
into the system will be broadcast to all NPROVE market makers at the applicable inside market for acceptance within
15 seconds, with the market next in rotation for an NPROVE execution receiving an indicator that the system will execute
the order against him should he fail to reject the order or if no other market maker accepts the order (market orders
with such notifications appended to them are referred to as ``designated, unpreferenced orders'' and orders without
such a notification are referred to as ``undesignated, unpreferenced orders'').
 If a market maker rejects a designated, unpreferenced NPROVE order and no other market maker accepts the order within
the 15-second period, the system will automatically execute the order against the market maker next in rotation that
has not rejected the order upon expiration of the 15 second period. If all market makers decline the order consistent
with Rule 11Ac1-1 under the Act, the order will be automatically executed against the market maker next in rotation
at the new inside quotation. Thus, with this proposal, Rounds 1 and 2 are effectively collapsed into one round and Round
3 is eliminated because orders rejected by all market makers would be executed automatically at the new inside market.
Accordingly, with this one-round order processing format, the NASD believes even more strongly that significant
order queues will not occur in NPROVE, during normal trading days or peak volume days, and that investors will receive
timely executions at prices at or superior to the quotes displayed when they entered their orders into NPROVE.







It is important to note that our response is not intended to be a subjective commentary on the activities of SOES activists;
rather it is an objective reflection of the source of potential order queues in NPROVE. It is axiomatic that episodic
surges in order volume on one or the other side of the market will impact the timing and price of execution of these orders
by virtue of fundamental economic principles of supply and demand.

Following is a more detailed description of the attached graphs and tables and the analytical process Nasdaq used
to reach its conclusion that significant order queuing likely will not occur with NPROVE. 
 
To analyze potential order queuing in NPROVE, the staff examined SOES activity on two trading days_February 4, 1994
and July 13, 1994
 

Exhibit 1 

contains charts that provide aggregate data on the extent to which order queuing would have occurred in NPROVE on these
days. Specifically, the charts identify all NASD members that transmitted more than 50 orders into SOES on these days,
with a breakdown of how many of these orders would have been executed within 30 seconds, between 30 and 45 seconds, between
45 seconds and one minute, and longer than a minute if NPROVE were in operation. On February 4, 93 percent of these orders
would have been executed with 30 seconds, and on July 13, 77 percent of the orders would have been executed within 30
seconds. The staff also used these charts to identify firms that are considered to be SOES activists. Specifically,
if a firm's ``OLIM'' percentage was greater than 75 percent it was identified as a SOES activist.
 By differentiating between SOES activists and non-activists, the staff was able to produce the summary statistics
at the bottom of the charts in 

Exhibit 1

. These statistics demonstrate that orders entered by SOES activists would have experienced greater delays in execution
than orders entered by non-activists. Specifically, on February 4, 99.3 percent of all orders entered by non-activists
would have been executed within 30 seconds, while 80.7 percent of all orders entered by SOES activists would have been
executed within 30 seconds. Similarly, on July 13, 98.4 percent of all orders entered by non-activists would have
been executed with 30 seconds, and 63.7 percent of all SOES activists' orders would have been executed within 30 seconds.

 





Based on the finding illustrated in the charts in 

Exhibit 1 

that orders entered by SOES activists constitute the vast majority of orders that would experience queues, the staff
then identified those stocks that received the highest number of orders from SOES activists that would have been queued.
Specifically, the tables in 

Exhibit 2 

identify those stocks that received more than 20 orders from SOES activists that would have been queued. The staff
then conducted a more detailed, stock-by-stock analysis of the four ``top'' stocks on each of these days.
 This analysis, as reflected in the NPROVE Order Traffic & NPROVE Order Queues'' graphs contained in 

Exhibit 3

, reveals that the queues in these stocks would have occurred in discreet, short-term clusters throughout the day,
not in a random fashion. The multi-colored bars in these graphs also illustrate that orders entered by non-activists
would only experience queuing when they are tangled up in a queue created by a SOES activist. With the exception of these
isolated queues, the graphs also clearly illustrate that orders entered by non-activists and activists would not
have experienced queuing throughout the remainder of the day. In addition, as would be expected, the ``NPROVE Order
Traffic'' graphs in 

Exhibit 3 

illustrate that these queues would have coincided with spikes in transaction volume. 
 




Accordingly, Nasdaq believes this information, along with the NASD's proposed revisions to NPROVE to collapse the
three rounds of NPROVE order processing into one, illustrate that queuing in NPROVE will not occur for sustained periods
of time in any one security and that only a very small percentage of retail customer orders will be exposed to the risk
that the market could move against them while they are pending in NPROVE. In sum Nasdaq believes the benefits that will
be afforded small retail investors through the price improvement and limit order protection features of NPROVE,
as well as the improvements to the integrity, liquidity, and stability of Nasdaq that NPROVE likely will produce,
far outweight the potential costs to investors that may arise from sporadic, short-lived order queues in NPROVE.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company, et al. (70-7508)



Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG'') a registered holding company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary company,
CNG Financial Services, Inc. (``CNGF''), both located at CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
15222-3199, have filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 12(c) and 13 of
the act and Rules 42, 43, 45 and 87-90 thereunder. 

CNG and CNGF request authorization, through December 31, 1998, for CNGF to finance the purchase of certain gas utilizing
equipment (``Gas Equipment'')
 by creditworthy
 customers who purchase or may be expected to purchase gas directly or indirectly from the local distribution companies
(``LDCs''), gas marketing or gas pipeline subsidiaries of the CNG system. In addition, CNG seeks authorization to
provide CNGF with up to an aggregate of $25 million in funds, on a revolving basis, through December 31, 1998, to enable
CNGF to make Gas Equipment financing loans to such customers. CNGF may obtain funds from CNG through this day by (1)
selling CNGF common stock. $10,000 par value, to CNG, and/or (2) obtaining open account advances from CNG and/or (3)
obtaining long-term loans from CNG. 






Open account advances made to CNGF will be made by book entry only, not evidenced by short-term notes, and will bear
the same interest rate as open account advances made to participants in the CNG System Money Pool, which is equal to
the effective weighted average rate of interest on CNG's commercial paper and/or revolving credit borrowing. All
such advances will be payable on demand and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. Long-term loans to
CNGF will be evidenced by long-term non-negotiable notes (which may be book entry) of CNGF maturing over a period of
time to be determined by the officers of CNG, with the interest predicated on and substantially equal to CNG's cost
of funds for comparable borrowings by CNG. In the event that CNG has not had recent comparable borrowings, the rates
will be tied to the Solomon Brothers, Inc. Bond Market Roundup, or to a comparable rate index, on the date nearest to
the time of takedown. All such loans may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty.

CNG states that it will obtain the funds it loans to CNGF through internal cash generation, issuance of long-term debt
securities as authorized by Commission orders dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) and April 14, 1994 (HCAR No. 26026),
borrowings under a credit agreement, as authorized by Commission orders dated March 28, 1991 (HCAR No. 25283) and
September 9, 1992 (HCAR No. 25626), or through other authorizations approved or to be approved by the Commission.

Applicants also seek authorization for CNGF, from time to time through December 31, 1998, to purchase, at par from
CNG, shares of CNGF's $10,000 par value common stock previously sold to CNG to obtain funds, as described above, to
hold such required shares as treasury shares and to resell such shares to CNG at par.

Applicants state that customers receiving loans (``Financing Customers'') will come primarily from the commercial
and/or industrial sectors and will result mainly from contacts between CNG Systems LDCs and their end-use customers.
 CNGF proposes to conduct its Gas Equipment financing activities both within and outside of the four states of Virginia,
West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio where the CNG System LDC's are located (collectively, ``LDC States''). However,
applicants state that during the twelve-month period beginning on the first day of January in the year following the
date CNGF commences Gas Equipment financing activities pursuant to a Commission order issued in the matter, and for
each subsequent calendar year thereafter, the total dollar value of Gas Equipment financing loans made to Financing
Customers in the LDC States will exceed the total dollar value of Gas Equipment financing loans made to Financing Customers
in all other states. 





CNGF will provide Gas Equipment financing to Financing Customers by (1) making short-term loans to cover the period
of installation of the Gas Equipment until permanent financing can be obtained by the customer or (2) making long-term
loans for a period of time not to exceed the lesser of 10 years or the expected useful life of the equipment. The aggregate
amount of Gas Equipment financing loans by CNGF outstanding at any one time will not exceed $25,000,000, with an individual
customer financing limit of $5,000,000 at any one time.

Loans to Financing Customers may be secured or unsecured and will be made at a spread above the cost of funds from CNG
in order to cover CNGF's costs and earn a return on its capital. CNGF does not have any full-time employees, and Applicants
expect CNGF to obtain accounting, credit, financial, management, marketing, operating, technical and clerical
support, at cost, from CNG Service Company (``Service Company'') pursuant to a written service agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Noise Compatibility Program for Modesto City-County Airport, Modesto, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the City of Modesto, Modesto, California under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On February 26, 1993, the FAA
determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the County under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable
requirements. On November 22, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Modesto City-County
Airport noise compatibility program. Fourteen (14) of the proposed action elements were approved, one (1) element
was disapproved.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Modesto
City-County Airport, effective November 22, 1994.



Under Section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map, may submit to the FAA, a noise compatibility
program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

<DOCNO> FR941216-2-00174 </DOCNO>

a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;

b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

 c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
type or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the federal government; and


d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.


Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, request for project
grants must be submitted to the Airports District Office at the location identified in 

``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT'' 

clause above.

The City of Modesto submitted to the FAA on June 29, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other documentation
produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January 1991, through June 1992. The Modesto
City-County Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements
on February 26, 1993.

The Modesto City-County Airport Study contains proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to
(or beyond) the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility
program as described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 22, 1994, and was
required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180-days (other than the use of new flight
procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-days period shall be
deemed to be an approval of such a program.


The submitted program contained sixteen (16) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA
completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have
been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Associate Administrator for Airports effective
November 22, 1994.




Outright approval was granted for fourteen (14) of the specific program elements. One (1) element was approved in
part and disapproved in part. One element was a no action required at this time because it related to flight procedures.
The approved elements included existing flight track policies, existing runway use program, evaluating noise-monitoring
system, public information program, encouraging specific plans, consistent off airport improvement, zoning and
disclosure to buyers.





These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on November 22, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the
submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above at the administrative offices of Modesto.


Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the Noise Exposure Maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed Noise Compatibility Program
are available for examination at the following locations:

ACTION: 

Notice. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
the city of Palm Springs for Palm Springs Regional Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and
Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements.

 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Palm Springs Regional Airport
are in compliance with applicable requirements of Part 150, effective November 28, 1994. Under Section 103 of the
Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator may
submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible land uses
as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in which such
operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested and affected
parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport. 
 


An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. 
 
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the city of Palm Springs.
The specific maps under consideration are Exhibits 1 and 2 in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps
for Palm Springs Regional Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective
on November 28, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that
the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in Appendix A of FAR Part 150. Such determination
does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility
program or to fund the implementation of that program. 
 
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under Section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of Section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under Section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under Section 150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished. 
 
Copies of the noise exposure maps and of the FAA's evaluation of the maps are available for examination at the following
locations:

b. Program measures would create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal government and;
b. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of navigable airspace and air traffic
control responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law.
Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an Airport Notice Compatibility Program are delineated in
FAR Part 150, Section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
State or local law. Approval does not, by itself, constitute an FAA implementation action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific Noise Compatibility Measures may be required. An FAA decision on the request may
require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the FAA
to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the program
are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended.
Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports Division Office
in Hawthorne, California.
The city of Phoenix submitted on December 30, 1987, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions, and other documentation
produced during the Noise Compatibility Planning study conducted from August 1986 through June 1989. The Noise Exposure
Maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements on November 17, 1988. Notice of this
determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 29, 1988.
The study contained a proposed Noise Compatibility Program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation
by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to, or beyond, the year 1992. It
was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a Noise Compatibility Program as described in Section
104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on October 4, 1989 and was required by a provision of the Act
to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of flight procedures for noise control). The
Noise Compatibility Program was approved by the FAA on April 2, 1990. On May 27, 1994, the FAA began its review of Revision
No. 2 to the approved program and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180
days (other than the use of flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such a program within
the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program.
The submitted revision to the approved program contained one (1) proposed action for establishing a permanent noise
and flight track monitoring system. The FAA completed its review and determination that the procedural and substantive
requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. Revision No. 2 to the approved program, therefore, was
approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective November 21, 1994.
Outright approval was granted for the one (1) new Continuing Program Measure for provision for establishment of a
permanent noise and flight track monitoring system.
This determination is set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on November 21, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the
submittal, are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the city of
Phoenix, Aviation Department.

<DOCTITLE>Joint Environmental Impact Report/Environment Impact Statement; Airport Development Program, Metropolitan
Oakland International Airport, Oakland, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Supplement to Notice of Intent. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces it is issuing this notice to advise the public that it has revised
the scope of work for the joint Environmental Impact Report (EIR)/Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that is being
prepared for development proposed by the Port of Oakland, California, with a new buildout year of 2000 instead of 2002
for Metropolitan Oakland International Airport, Oakland, California.



The purpose of this supplemental notice is to provide agencies and the public an opportunity to comment on modifications
to the project description and various alternatives that have been added to, or deleted from, the EIR/EIS since the
original notice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in cooperation with the Port of Oakland, California has begun preparation
of a joint Environmental Impact Report (EIR)/Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for development proposed by
the Port of Oakland for Metropolitan Oakland International Airport. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is serving as
a cooperating agency, with responsibilities limited to participating in the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969 (NEPA) process; participating in the scoping process; and review and comment on the Draft and Final EIR/EIS.
The FAA is the lead Federal agency.



On December 29, 1992 the FAA issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS. The Port of Oakland, pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970 will also prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed
development. In an effort to eliminate unnecessary duplication and reduce delay, the document under preparation,
is a joint EIR/EIS in accordance with the President's Council on Environmental Quality Regulations described in
Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1506.2. The Joint Lead Agencies for the preparation of the EIR/EIS are
the Federal Aviation Administration and the Port of Oakland, California.

The previous notice referred to the proposed action as the ``2002 Airport Development Program.'' The current proposed
action is now revised to the 

Airport Development Program 

(ADP), with a new buildout year of 2000, as opposed to 2002. This change is due to the recent acceleration of aviation
activity (1993-1994) at Metropolitan Oakland International Airport. In addition, a new baseline year (1993)
will be used to establish existing conditions and long-term analysis will consider the year 2010.

The proposed extension of Runway 11/29 and the high-speed exit taxiway are programmatic projects in the ADP, because
the design of these improvements has not reached a sufficient level of detail to support an environmental finding.
These two airfield improvements will be identified in the EIR/EIS as projects that are scheduled for construction
after the year 2000, although feasibility and design studies may be undertaken before that date.

A wetland restoration project was previously proposed to mitigate impacts caused by the placement of 33 acres of fill
(of which approximately 25 acres consisted of wetlands) in 1986, that were previously permitted under U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers Permit Number 14003E78B. This permit was rescinded by Federal Court order in 1988. Since that time, the
parties in the litigation have negotiated a resolution of the wetland mitigation issues. Consent decrees setting
forth this resolution have been filed with the Federal District Court. Because the wetland restoration program will
be accomplished as provided in the consent decrees, and not as part of the ADP, it has been removed from the ADP.



Alternatives



The alternatives to be evaluated in the EIR/EIS have been augmented since the initial scoping meetings held on January
27, 1993. In addition to the no-action and reduced development alternatives previously identified, the EIR/EIS
will consider:

1. An air passenger terminal dominant alternative;

2. An air cargo dominant alternative and;

3. A modified airport roadway project alternative.

The previously identified ``regional alternative'' was reevaluated by the metropolitan planning organization
in their Regional Airport System Plan Update, and was found not to be practical or feasible to the proposed action.
Accordingly, the ``regional alternative'' was dropped from further consideration.

Comments and suggestions on the revised scope are invited from Federal, State and local agencies, and other interested
parties to ensure that the full range of issues related to these proposed projects are addressed and all significant
issues identified. Comments and suggestions may be mailed to the FAA informational contact listed above. Comments
on the revised scope of work should be submitted no later than January 15, 1995.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Title IX, The Aircraft Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), was enacted to enhance
the FAA's access to resources and research facilities available at colleges, universities, and other non-profit
research institutions. The Aviation Research Grant Program, Section 9205, permits the ``Administrator to make
grants to colleges, universities, and nonprofit research organizations to conduct aviation research into areas
deemed by the Administrator to be required for the long-term growth of civil aviation.'' The Catastrophic Failure
Prevention Research Grants Program, Section 9208, directs the FAA ``to conduct aviation research relating to development
of technologies and methods to assess the risk and prevent defects, failures, and malfunctions of products, parts,
processes, and articles manufactured for use in aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, and appliances that could
result in a catastrophic failure of an aircraft.'' The Act authorizes the FAA to establish a research grant program
that encompasses a broad spectrum of aviation research activities that are targeted at specific areas of long-term
aviation research.



The Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-604) authorized the creation of a grants program
``to accelerate and expand the research, development, and implementation of technologies and procedures to counteract
terrorist acts against civil aviation.'' There is a special emphasis on human factors projects that include ``research
and development of both technological improvements and ways to enhance human performance.''

The central purpose of the FAA Research Grant Program is to encourage and support innovative, advanced research of
potential benefit to the long-term growth of civil aviation.



Research Areas



The legislation cited earlier provides for aviation research grants programs in three general categories: (1) Areas
deemed by the FAA Administrator to be required for the long-term growth of civil aviation; (2) areas related to research
on the prevention of catastrophic failures; and (3) areas related to research, development, and implementation
of technologies and procedures to counteract terrorist acts against civil aviation. These three specific areas
are comprised of program areas identified in the FAA Research, Engineering, & Development (RE&D) Plan of
the agency's research and development initiatives. The areas, which contribute to the FAA's mission of improving
aviation safety, capacity, efficiency, and security, are as follows:


a. Capacity and Air Traffic Control Technology;

b. Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance;

c. Aviation Weather;

d. Airports;

e. Aircraft Safety Technology;

f. System Security Technology;

g. Human Factors and Aviation Medicine;

h. Environment and Energy;

i. Systems Science/Operations Research.

More detailed descriptions of these nine programs and a detailed description of the grants process is contained in
the Grants for Aviation Research Program Solicitation 95.1.



Eligibility


Applicant eligibility for the award of an aviation research grant or cooperative agreement depends on the nature
of the proposer's organization as well as the character of work proposed. In general, colleges, universities, and
other non-profit research institutions are eligible to qualify for grants to perform research in all specified areas.
Other appropriate research institutions, including for-profit research institutions, may qualify for grants
or cooperative agreements for research and development activities in aviation security under Section 107 of Public
Law 101-604.
The FAA seeks to ensure an equitable geographical distribution of grant funds and the inclusion of historically black
colleges and universities and other minority institutions for funding consideration.


Proposal Submission


Guidelines for the application format and content are contained in the Solicitation. Every effort will be made to
reach a decision and inform the applicant promptly. Unless and until an award is made, the FAA is not responsible for
any expenditures incurred by the proposing organization.


Funding



Appropriated discretionary funds are not currently available for grants. Awards will be made via program funding
sponsorship.



Award Date



Recipients of FAA research grants will be announced on a continuous basis.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Study: San Mateo County, California</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of Intent.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that a supplement to a final environmental impact statement will
be prepared for a proposed highway project in San Mateo County, California.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), will prepare a supplenent
to the final environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve State Route (SR) 1 in San Mateo County, California.
The original final EIS for the improvements (FHWA-CA-EIS-83-14-F) was approved on
April 16, 1986. The project study limits of alternatives considered in the final EIS extended from Half Moon Bay Airport,
between Moss Beach and El Granada, on the south to Linda Mar Boulevard in Pacifica on the north, a distance of approximately
11.3 km (7 milies).


The preferred alternative, identified in the final EIS and selected in the Record of Decision signed on May 30, 1986,
is known as the Martini Creek alignment alternative. From the southern end, this alternative begins north of the southern
project study limit on SR 1, 0.2 km (0.1 mile) north of Montara near the Chart House Restaurant. From there it swings
inland, crosses Martini Creek, curves seaward (west) and then northeasterly, proceeds over the San Pedro Mountain
saddle and down into the City of Pacifica where it rejoins SR 1 at Linda Mar Boulevard. The proposed project is a two-lane,
controlled access facilitly; however, since the entire project on both sides of the summit exceeds six percent, the
project design includes an uphill slow vehicle lane in each direction. The proposed project is approximately 7.2
km (4.5 miles) in length.
Litigation regarding the project was commenced in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California in June
1986 (

Sierra Club, et al. v. United States Department of Transportation, et al., 

Civ. No. 86-3384 DLJ). The project has been enjoined since September 1986, prior to the commencement of any construction.
The primary issues in the litigation were 1) whether the proposed project complied with Section 4(f) of the Department
of Transportation Act, and 2) whether the final EIS was adequate under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
The District Court has now fully resolved the Section 4(f) and NEPA issues. The proposed project has been determined
not to violate Section 4(f), and the final EIS has been found to comply with NEPA in all respects except one_it was found
inadequate in its discussion and analysis of noise impacts. Therefore, the District Court remanded the matter to
the FHWA. The District Court's specific findings regarding the deficiencies of the final EIS and the need to prepare
a supplemental EIS on noise impact are set forth in the Court's Orders of April 3, 1989, and April 2, 1990. The Orders
require a reanalysis of the anticipated impacts from future project-generated noise, as well as more accurate and
informative measurements of ambient noise levels. The sole purpose of this supplemental EIS is to comply with the
Orders and subsequent Judgment of the District Court. The supplement will be limited to addressing the deficiencies
in the final EIS determined in the litigation, and, therefore, will only address noise issues. In addition to this
supplemental EIS on noise, a reevaluation of the FEIS is being undertaken. The reevaluation is necessary since, due
to the on-going litigation, major steps to advance the project have not occurred within three years of the last major
FHWA approval. 23 C.F.R.  771.129(b). Therefore, a reevaluation of the FEIS will be undertaken to determine
whether or not new information or circumstances relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed project
or its impacts would result in significant environmental impacts not evaluated in the final EIS. 23 C.F.R.  771.130(a)(2).
In such an event, an additional supplemental EIS on those impacts will be required and will be processed pursuant to
applicable laws and regulations.
Letters describing this proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and
local agencies, and to private organizations and individuals that have previously expressed, or are known to have,
an interest in this proposal. In addition, a public hearing will be held on the draft supplemental EIS. Public notice
will be given of the time and place of the hearing. The draft supplemental EIS will be available for public and agency
review and comment prior to the public hearing. A formal scoping meeting is not necessary since this supplemental
document is only meant to comply with the Orders of the District Court to address the issue of noise impacts.
Comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the supplemental EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the
address provided above.

Decision That Nonconforming 1992 Ferrari 348TB Passenger Cars Are Eligible for Importation


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of decision by NHTSA that nonconforming 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars are eligible for importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the decision by NHTSA that 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars not originally manufactured to
comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United States
because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified version
of the 1992 Ferrari 348TB), and they are capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor vehicle
is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States,
certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor
vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register

.
Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R-90-009) petitioned NHTSA
to decide whether 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published
notice of the petition on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 37126) to afford an opportunity for public comment.
As stated in that notice, the vehicle which Champagne claimed to be substantially similar is the version of 1992 Ferrari
348TB that Ferrari S.p.A. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The petitioner alleged that it had carefully compared
the two vehicles, and found them to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
Specifically, the petitioner claimed that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102 Transmission Shift Lever Sequence . . . .,
103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems, 104 Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems, 105 Hydraulic Brake Systems, 106
Brake Hoses, 107 Reflecting Surfaces, 109 New Pneumatic Tires, 112 Headlamp Concealment Devices, 113 Hood Latch
Systems, 116 Brake Fluid, 124 Accelerator Control Systems, 201 Occupant Protection in Interior Impact, 202 Head
Restraints, 203 Impact Protection for the Driver Form the Steering Control System, 204 Steering Control Rearward
Displacement, 205 Glazing Materials, 206 Door Locks and Door Retention Components, 207 Seating Systems, 210 Seat
Belt Assembly Anchorages, 211 Wheel Nuts, Wheel Discs and Hubcaps, 212 Windshield Retention, 216 roof Crush Resistance,
219 Windshield Zone Intrusion, and 302 Flammability of Interior Materials.

Additionally, the petitioner stated that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB complies with the Bumper Standard
found in 49 CFR Part 581.

Petitioners also contended that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is capable of being readily modified to
meet the following standards, in the manner indicated:

Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: (a) substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on
the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation of a seat belt warning lamp; (c) recalibration of speedometer/odometer
from kilometers to miles per hour.


Standard No. 108 Lamps Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment: (a) installation of U.S.-model headlamp assemblies
which incorporate sealed beam headlamps; (b) installation of front and rear sidemarker/reflector assemblies;
(c) installation of a high mounted stop lamp.

Standard No. 110 Tire Selection and Rims: installation of a tire information placard.

Standard No. 111 Rearview Mirrors: replacement of the passenger side rearview mirror, which is convex but lacks the
required warning statement.

Standard No. 114 Theft Protection: installation of a buzzer microswitch and a warning buzzer in the steering lock
electrical assembly.

Standard No. 115 Vehicle Identification Number: Installation of a VIN plate that can be read from outside the left
windshield pillar, and a VIN reference label on the edge of the door or latch post nearest the driver.

Standard No. 118 Power-Operated Window System: rewiring of the power window system so that the window transport is
iniperative when the ignition is switched off.

Standard No. 208 Occupant Crash Protection: (a) installation of an ignition switch-actuated seat belt warning lamp
and buzzer; (b) installation of a passive restraint system consisting of driver and passenger side automatic seat
belt assemblies, tracks, and a control unit that have part numbers identical to those found on the U.S. certified 1992
Ferrari 348TB. The petitioner claimed that the lower dash panel on the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is identical
to that found on its U.S. certified counterpart, and that a knee bolster is not supplied on the U.S. certified vehicle.

Standard No. 209 Seat Belt Assemblies: installation of seat belts labeled in accordance with the standard.

Standard No. 214 Side Door Strength: installation of reinforcing beams.

Standard No. 301 Fuel System Integrity: installation of a rollover valve in the fuel tank vent line between the fuel
tank and the evaporative emissions collection canister. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description
of the petition.

One comment was received in response to the notice of the petition, from Fiat Auto U.S.A., Inc. (Fiat), the United States
representative of Ferrari. In its comment, Fiat stated that Ferrari, and other companies within the Fiat Group, have
invested considerable resources in the design and production of vehicles that comply with the Federal motor vehicle
safety standards. Although it stated that it has not determined what modifications are necessary to bring a vehicle
into compliance with the Federal safety standards, Fiat contended that it is not possible to achieve such compliance
by simply retrofitting a vehicle built for the European market, without conducting extensive development and testing.

NHTSA accorded Champagne an opportunity to respond to Fiat's comment. In its response, Champagne stated that the
entire passive restraint system that it proposes to install in the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB, including
the control unit and the wiring harness, is available from Ferrari in kit form. Champagne further stated that it is
simple to install this equipment because all mounting points are supplied on the non-U.S. certified vehicle.

As they have been performed with relative ease on thousands of vehicles imported over the years, none of the other modifications
described in the petition would preclude NHTSA from determining that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is
eligible for importation. NHTSA has accordingly decided to grant the petition.



Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles



The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final decision must indicate on the form HS-7 accompanying entry
the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 86 is the vehicle
eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this decision.



Final Determination



Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby decides that a 1992 Ferrari 348TB not originally manufactured
to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially similar to a 1992 Ferrari 348TB
originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115, and
is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register 

of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 

Federal Register.

reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response
to the notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has decided to grant the petition.
