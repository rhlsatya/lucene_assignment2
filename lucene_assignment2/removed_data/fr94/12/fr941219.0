 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its organization and functions statement to reflect the reorganization
of the Board's headquarters offices in accordance with the recommendations of the National Performance Review (NPR)
and the President's Memorandum of September 11, 1993, titled ``Streamlining the Bureaucracy.'' In addition, the
Board is amending the titles of sections 1200.1, 1200.2, and 1200.10 of this part.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its organization and functions statement to reflect
the realignment of its regional offices. Since that time, the Board completed its review of the organization and functions
of its headquarters offices and effected a reorganization of those offices in accordance with the recommendations
of the National Performance Review (NPR) and the President's Memorandum of September 11, 1993, titled ``Streamlining
the Bureaucracy.'' The reorganization eliminates excessive layers of management review and control, consolidates
functions, and improves the ratio of supervisors and managers to other employees.


The following organizational changes have been made in the Board's headquarters offices: (1) The office of the Executive
Director has been abolished; (2) the offices of Inspector General and Management Analysis have been abolished and
their functions distributed to other offices; (3) the offices of Administrative Law Judge and Regional Operations
have been combined; and (4) the office of Administration has been assigned additional functions and retitled the
office of Planning and Resource Management Services. 
The Board is amending the titles of   1200.1, 1200.2, and 1200.10 of this part to conform them to the format
of the new  1200.3 of this part added effective August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39937) and the other parts of the Board's regulations
(5 CFR parts 1201 through 1210). 
The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  1204(h).

<DOCTITLE>Practices and Procedures</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Merit Systems Protection Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is amending its rules to update and clarify various provisions and to ensure that the rules in this part, as
a whole, are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable, in accordance with Executive Order 12866 of September
30, 1993. By making this amendment, the Board is providing current and consistent information to its customers regarding
its adjudicatory practices and procedures.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its rules at 5 CFR part 1201 to add a new appealable action and to correct
the citations for two others in  1201.3(a); to delete  1201.3(d); to clarify the place of filing requirements
in   1201.4(d), 1201.22(a), and 1201.182 following the realignment of the Board's regional and field
offices; to correct a cross-reference in  1201.37(a); to conform the method of filing requirements for original
jurisdiction cases in  1201.122(c) to those for appellate jurisdiction cases; to replace the July 1991 edition
of the MSPB Appeal Form in Appendix I with the revised October 1994 edition; to add information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications
Device for the Deaf) capability of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, add the suite number of the
Atlanta Regional Office, and change the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office in Appendix II; and
to add and delete approved hearing locations in Appendix III.



(a) Section 1201.3(a)(6) is amended by adding 5 CFR part 844 to the citation so that the citation refers to the part of
the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management governing disability retirement determinations under the
Federal Employees' Retirement System, as well as to 5 CFR parts 831 and 842.

(b) Section 1201.3(a)(7) is amended by correcting the citation to read ``5 CFR 731.103(d) and 731.508.'' The corrected
citation refers to the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management providing for appeals to the Board of suitability
determinations made by an agency acting under authority delegated by OPM (5 CFR 731.103(d)) and such determinations
made by OPM (5 CFR 731.508).

(c) Section 1201.3(a) is amended by adding a new subparagraph (21) to include as an action appealable to the Board a
reduction-in-force action affecting a career or career candidate appointee in the Foreign Service. Public Law 103-326,
effective April 30, 1994, amended the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) by, 

inter alia,

 providing authority to the Secretary of State to conduct reductions in force affecting career or career candidate
appointees in the Foreign Service and by granting those appointees the right to appeal such reduction-in-force actions
to the Board.

(d) Section 1201.3 is amended by deleting paragraph (d). This paragraph was added to the Board's rules in this part
to implement 5 U.S.C. 1221(j), as added by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-12). Subsequently,
the Board ruled in 

McCann

 v. 

Navy,

 57 M.S.P.R. 288 (1993) that 5 U.S.C. 1221(j) and the Board's regulation at 5 CFR 1201.3(d) should be construed to apply
only to individual right of action appeals and other actions established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12. Because the provisions
of part 1201 are applicable to appeals that arise from actions other than those established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12,
the Board has determined that the continued inclusion of  1201.3(d) in this part is likely to prove confusing
to parties and that it should, therefore, be deleted.

(e) Section 1201.4(d) is amended to clarify the definition of ``appropriate'' office for purposes of filings with
the Board. On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its rules in appendix II and appendix III
of this part to reflect the realignment of its regional office structure into six regional and five field offices.
In the 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 explaining that revision, the Board stated in part: ``Appeals and related matters will continue to be filed with either
the regional or field office having geographic jurisdiction.'' The Board is now amending  1201.4(d) to specifically
include field offices, as well as regional offices, in the definition.

(f) Section 1201.22(a) is amended to clarify that appeals and responses to appeals are to be filed with the appropriate
Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above.

(g) Section 1201.37(a) is amended by deleting the reference to `` 1201.116'' and replacing it with `` 1201.117.''
On June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30863), the Board published an amendment to its rules in this part that revised  1201.115,
redesignated   1201.116 through 1201.119 as   1201.117 through 1201.120, respectively,
and added a new  1201.116. Because the former  1201.116 was redesignated as  1201.117, the Board
is now making a conforming amendment to the cross-reference to that section in  1201.37(a).

(h) Section 1201.122(c) is amended by adding ``commercial overnight delivery'' as a method of filing and service.
On July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36345), the Board amended its rules in subparts B and C of this part to permit filing and service
of appeals and petitions for review by commercial overnight delivery. The Board is now amending  1201.122(c)
to conform the method of filing and service requirements for Special Counsel complaints and proposed agency actions
against administrative law judges in subpart D of this part to those for appeals and petitions for review.

(i) Section 1201.163(c)(1) is amended to clarify that mixed case appeals governed by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
1978 are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above.

(j) Section 1201.182(a) and  1201.182(c) are amended to clarify that petitions for enforcement of orders issued
under the Board's appellate jurisdiction are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See
explanation in paragraph (e) above.

(k) Appendix I is amended by substituting the revised October 1994 edition of the MSPB Appeal Form, Optional Form 283
(Rev. 10/94), for the July 1991 edition. The form has been revised as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR941219-0-00006 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-0-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) On page 1, ``WHERE TO FILE AN APPEAL'' has been revised to state that the appeal is to be filed with the Board's regional
or field office having geographic jurisdiction.

(2) On page 1, ``WHEN TO FILE AN APPEAL'' has been revised to reflect the 10-day extension of the time limit for filing
appeals made by the Board's amendment to its rules in this part on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31109).

(3) On page 1, both ``WHEN TO FILE AN APPEAL'' and ``HOW TO FILE AN APPEAL'' have been revised to include ``commercial
overnight delivery'' as a method of filing an appeal, in accordance with the Board's amendment to its rules in this
part on July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36345).

(4) On page 1, the final sentence under ``Public Reporting Burden'' has been revised to replace ``Office of Management
Analysis'' with ``Office of Planning and Resource Management Services'' to reflect the reorganization of the Board's
headquarters offices and, at the request of the Office of Management and Budget, to delete the requirement that comments
and suggestions be sent to OMB's Paperwork Reduction Project.

(5) On page 2, a sentence has been added in block 7 to put the appellant on notice that designating a representative in
the appeal specifically includes authority for the representative to settle the appeal on the appellant's behalf.

(6) On page 2, block 7 has been revised to clarify what documents should be attached to the appeal and to advise the appellant
that filing should not be delayed if the relevant SF-50 or its equivalent is not available.

(7) On page 2, a check-off box for ``Foreign Service'' has been added in block 20 because career and career candidate
appointees in the Foreign Service now have the right to appeal reduction-in-force actions to the Board. See explanation
in paragraph (c) above.

(8) On page 3, in block 32.a, the phrase ``handicapping condition'' has been replaced with ``disability'' to reflect
the new preferred terminology under The Americans with Disabilities Act.

(9) On page 4, in block 38, the phrase ``full 30-day notice'' has been replaced with ``the required number of days notice''
to reflect changes in statute and Office of Personnel Management regulations that now require at least 60 days advance
notice for most reduction-in-force actions, with provision for a longer notice period_at least 120 days_for some
Department of Defense actions, and shorter notice_less than 60 days but at least 30 days_under certain circumstances.

(10) On page 6, in block 41.a, the material after ``Yes'' has been revised to clarify that the attachment requested
is a copy of the appellant's request to the Office of Special Counsel for corrective action.

(11) Throughout the form, additional text has been highlighted for emphasis.

The Office of Management and Budget has renewed its approval of the MSPB Appeal Form through July 31, 1997. The form
is no longer stocked by the General Services Administration, but may be obtained from the Board's Financial and Administrative
Management Division; see notice published September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47363), corrected October 18, 1994 (59 FR 52558).

(l) Appendix II is amended by adding information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) capability
of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, by substituting the suite number for ``10th Floor'' in the
address of the Atlanta Regional Office, and by changing the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office
to reflect the relocation of that office effective December 1, 1994.

(m) Appendix III is amended by adding two approved hearing locations and deleting one under the Atlanta Regional Office,
by adding two under the Denver Field Office, by adding one under the New York Field Office, and by adding one under the
San Francisco Regional Office.

The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(h).

Method of serving documents. 

Pleadings may be served on parties by mail, by personal delivery, by facsimile, or by commercial overnight delivery.
Service by mail is accomplished by mailing the pleading to each party or representative, at the party's or representative's
last known address. Service by facsimile is accomplished by transmitting the pleading by facsimile to each party
or representative. Service by personal delivery or by commercial overnight delivery is accomplished by delivering
the pleading to the business office or home of each party or representative and leaving it with the party or representative,
or with a responsible person at that address. Regardless of the method of service, the party serving the document must
submit to the Board, along with the pleading, a certificate of service as proof that the document was served on the other
parties or their representatives. The certificate of service must list the names and addresses of the persons on whom
the pleading was served, must state the date on which the pleading was served, must state the method (i.e., mail, personal
delivery, facsimile, or commercial overnight delivery) by which service was accomplished, and must be signed by
the person responsible for accomplishing service.

Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors) is amending a provision of the Uniform Rules
of Practice and Procedure adopted by the Board. The final rule is intended to clarify that the rules' provisions relating
to 

ex parte

 communications conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In particular, the amendment
would clarify that the 

ex parte

 provisions do not apply to intra-agency communications, which are governed by a separate provision of the Administrative
Procedure Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


In August 1991, the Board of Governors adopted the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rules) (56 FR 38048, Aug.
9, 1991). The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) have also adopted the Rules (OCC, 56 FR 38024,
Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The
Board of Governors is amending one aspect of the Rules relating to 

ex parte

 communications to clarify that the Rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The other
agencies have proposed or are considering proposing a similar amendment (FDIC, 59 FR 60921, Nov. 29, 1994; OTS, 59
FR 62354, Dec. 5, 1994). The Board of Governors issued this amendment as a proposed rule on November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60094,
Nov. 22, 1994). It is now adopting the rule in the form proposed. 
Currently,  263.9 of the Rules prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from
making an 

ex parte 

communication to the Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When
the Rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991)
explained that the proposed rule regarding 

ex parte

 communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding 

ex parte

 communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA
itself. 
The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's 

ex parte

 communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 

outside the agency

'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 

Intra-agency

 communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended
decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel.
The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party
on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation
of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial staff from seeking the amendment
of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. 
The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, did not mention the separation of functions concept explicitly,
and appeared to apply the 

ex parte

 communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the
agency head, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested
in the proceeding'' on the other. The Board of Governors does not interpret this provision as limiting agency enforcement
staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however,
the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the 

ex parte

 communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The Board of Governors did not intend this result.

The amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting the prohibition
on 

ex parte

 communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States. 

The Board of Governors received two comments on the proposed rule, both of which supported it. One of the commenters
suggested that the Board explain the so-called ``Chinese wall'' that prevents those staff members involved in the
prosecutorial function from communicating with those who advise the Board on a particular matter. The amended rule
specifically sets out the APA's separation of function provision, which prohibits agency prosecutorial personnel
in one case from participating in the Board's decision on that or a factually related case. This provision clearly
prevents prosecutorial staff from communicating about the merits of a case with those staff members who advise the
Board regarding a final decision in the case. It is unnecessary to set out internal procedures implementing this statutory
prohibition in a formal rulemaking, and to do so could limit the Board's flexibility with respect to internal organization.




II. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board of Governors hereby certifies that the final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required. 

The final rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively.
Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised regulation
is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

. Except to the extent required for the disposition of 

ex parte

 matters as authorized by law, the administrative law judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant
to the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate. An employee or
agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for the Board in a case may not, in that
or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the

Airworthiness Directives; Rolls-Royce, plc Spey Series Turbofan Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc Spey series turbofan engines,
that requires a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT)
disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This amendment is prompted by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor
disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT disk burst
due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey series turbofan engines was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure
turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed
at least 40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These
disks must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit where
either the HPT or LPT disks are removed after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will
allow stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with R-R Service Bulletin No. Sp72-1044, dated
September 1992. 


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
The commenter concurs with the AD as proposed. 
In addition, the definition of shop visit has been clarified to eliminate the reference to next scheduled disk inspection
and include next disk removal. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it will take no additional work hours per engine to accomplish
the required actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during regular turbine overhauls. Approximately
80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform
the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $189,750. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is adopting a change to exempt a new system
of records, HDNA 011, entitled Inspector General Investigation Files, from certain provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
The exemption is intended to increase the value of the system of records for law enforcement purposes, to comply with
prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information, and to protect the privacy of individuals identified
in the system of records. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Executive Order 12866. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action.' Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations of recipients thereof; does
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993). 






Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.






Paperwork Reduction Act. 

The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense, certifies that this Privacy Act
rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that
the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known
as the Privacy Act of 1974.




The DNA Inspector General's Office performs as one of its principal functions under the Inspector General Act of 1978,
as amended by the Inspector General Act Amendment of 1988 (Pub. L. 95-452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.3) (IG Act),
investigations into and enforcement actions concerned with suspected violations. The DNA OIG is responsible for
promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of DNA programs and operations and to detect
and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in such programs and operations.




The (k)(2) exemption reflects recognition that certain records in the system may be deemed to require protection
from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned in the files and avoid compromising, impeding,
or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings. The system would thus be exempt from sections 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (d)(4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f). The proposed rule was published on August
15, 1994, at 59 FR 41739. No comments were received, therefore, the DNA is adopting the changes.

2.Section 318.5 is revised as follows:


 318.5 

Exemptions.




(a) 

Exemption for classified material. 

All systems of records maintained by the Defense Nuclear Agency shall be exempt under section (k)(1) of 5 U.S.C. 552a,
to the extent that the systems contain any information properly classified under E.O. 12356 and that is required by
that E.O. to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. This exemption is applicable to parts
of all systems of records including those not otherwise specifically designated for exemptions herein which contain
isolated items of properly classified information.




(b) 

System identifier and name. 

HDNA 007, Security Operations.
(1) 

Exemption. 

Portions of this system of records may be exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d); (e)(4)(G), (H), (I);
and (f). 
(2) 

Authority. 

5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
(3) 

Reasons. 

To protect the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity
of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that identity of
the source would be held in confidence.


 

(c) 

System identifier and name: 

HDNA 011, entitled Inspector General Investigation Files.
(1) 

Exemption. 

Portions of this system of records maybe exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (4); (e)(1);
(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f).
(2) 

Authority: 

5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(2).




(3) 

Reasons. 

From subsection (c)(3) because it will enable DNA to conduct certain investigations and relay law enforcement information
without compromise of the information, protection of investigative techniques and efforts employed, and identities
of confidential sources who might not otherwise come forward and who furnished information under an express promise
that the sources' identity would be held in confidence (or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied promise.)
From subsection (d)(1) through (d)(4) and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and the
right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein would
seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. From subsection (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because it will provide protection against notification
of investigatory material including certain reciprocal investigations and counterintelligence information,
which might alert a subject to the fact that an investigation of that individual is taking place, and the disclosure
of which would weaken the on-going investigation, reveal investigatory techniques, and place confidential informants
in jeopardy who furnished information under an express promise that the sources' identity would be held in confidence
(or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied promise).

<USDEPT>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION</USDEPT>





Governing Bodies 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Legal Services Corporation.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule amends part 1607 of the Legal Services Corporation's (``LSC'' or ``Corporation'') regulations relating
to governing bodies of recipients of LSC funds. Many of the revisions are simply intended to clarify current Corporation
policy or to interrelate this part to other LSC regulations. However, a number of the revisions represent changes
in Corporation policy or interpretations with respect to issues that arise under the regulation. The final rule also
includes a number of technical revisions to make the rule easier to understand and apply. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Operations and Regulations Committee (``Committee'') of the LSC Board of Directors (``Board'') held public
hearings on April 15, 1994, in Washington, DC, and on May 13, 1994, in Atlanta, Georgia, to consider drafts of proposed
revisions to 45 CFR part 1607, LSC's regulation on recipient governing bodies. At the meeting in Atlanta, the Committee
approved a draft, which was published as a proposed rule for public comment at 59 FR 30885 (June 16, 1994). 


Twenty-two written comments were received and reviewed by the Corporation. The comments generally applauded the
proposed revisions, but there were some areas of disagreement and several suggestions for changes. On September
16 and 30, 1994, the Committee held public meetings to consider the written and oral comments on the proposed rule.
Based on those comments, the Committee made several revisions. The Committee met again on October 27, 1994, and voted
to recommend a final rule for adoption by the full Board. On November 5, 1994, the Board voted to adopt the rule as recommended
by the Committee for publication as a final rule in the 

Federal Register

. 
The Corporation recognizes that legislation to amend the Legal Services Corporation Act and reauthorize appropriations
for the Corporation may be considered by Congress. If such legislation does become law, the Corporation's regulations
will be revisited and revised accordingly. 
In addition to amending 45 CFR part 1607, this rule is also intended to supersede part 1607's interpretive guideline
published at 48 FR 36820 (August 15, 1983). 
The entire rule, as revised, is published for clarity and ease of use. 


Section Analysis 


Section 1607.2 Definitions


Most of the changes in this section are technical and clarifying in nature. The section has been reordered to put the
definitions in alphabetical order. Also, definitions found in other parts of the regulations but applicable to this
part are included here for easier reference. In addition, language found in other sections of this part that, in fact,
constitute definitions of terms are included here both for easier reference and to treat similar terms similarly.
A new definition was added and some of the language has been clarified to make it consistent with past and current LSC
interpretations. 


Section 1607.2(a)


Although the definition of ``attorney member'' applies to attorneys who serve on any recipient board subject to this
part, it was added primarily to make it clear that board members of a national support center do not have to be admitted
to practice in a state where the center actually provides legal assistance. Because the ``service area'' of national
support centers is the entire nation, an attorney board member need be admitted to practice in only one of the 50 states.

One comment suggested that law professors who teach within a recipient's service area, but who are not members of the
bar in the recipient's service area, should be allowed to serve as an ``attorney member'' on the recipient's board.
Statutory requirements for recipient boards do not allow this option. However, such law professors may serve pursuant
to  1607.3(d). 


Section 1607.2(c)


The definition of ``eligible client member'' has been revised from the current definition. First, the language has
been changed to make it clear that client board members must be eligible at the time of their appointment to each term
of office. Thus, a client member who is financially eligible for services when first appointed to a recipient's board
may not be reappointed to a second or subsequent term if, at the time of reappointment, the client board member is no
longer financially eligible for LSC-funded services. However, nothing in the rule would require a client board member
to resign during the course of a term if the client became ineligible subsequent to appointment. 
Some comments suggested a further change to the definition to clarify that eligibility is based on financial eligibility,
so that individuals who would be financially eligible to receive legal assistance, but who could not be served by the
recipient because of some other restriction on types of legal assistance or program priorities, could serve on recipient
boards. The Board agreed and revised the language to clarify that a member need only be financially eligible pursuant
to the requirements of LSC's financial eligibility guidelines, set out in 45 CFR part 1611, to qualify for board membership.

Language has also been adopted for this definition to clarify, in response to concerns raised in comments, that it
is the national rather than the local financial eligibility standard that is applicable. As long as a person would
qualify for services under Part 1611, the person would qualify for board membership, regardless of whether the recipient
has a lower financial eligibility threshold or regardless of whether the person would also qualify for other services
provided by the recipient. 
Some comments suggested that the definition should be expanded to include individuals who are eligible for non-LSC-funded
but not LSC-funded services provided by the recipient. One such comment suggested the adoption of a proportionality
requirement, so that clients who are eligible for non-LSC-funded services, but not LSC-funded services, could serve
in proportion to the amount of overall funding from the non-LSC source. Several comments argued that it is more important
that client representatives be effective advocates for clients than that they be financially eligible for LSC-funded
services. Two comments suggested substantially different and more expansive definitions of eligibility for client
board membership. After consideration of these proposals, the Board decided not to expand the definition because
it wished to insure that the focus of the legal services program remains on the indigent population. The Board believes
that eligible client members are supposed to bring to the recipient a perspective of the community's needs, and that
can best be done by someone who is financially eligible for the recipient's LSC-funded services. 
The last major change to the definition is intended to clarify that it is the recipient that should decide how client
board member eligibility is determined, i.e., the recipient should decide whether it or a particular group should
make the determination. Thus, the recipient could decide that, for some groups, the recipient will make the determination
and for others it will leave the determination up to the appointing group. Two comments opposed the language that permits
client eligibility determinations to be made by the appointing groups, rather than the recipient, arguing that the
determination should not be delegated. No changes were made to the proposal, however, because it does not require
that the recipient delegate the decision; it merely gives the recipient the choice. 


Section 1607.2(d)


The proposed rule defined ``governing body'' so that it would have applied both to the governing bodies of recipients
who have as a primary purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients and to the policy boards or bodies
established pursuant to the waiver provision in  1607.6(d). However, in response to comments on the proposed
definition, the Board narrowed the definition so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies referred to in
 1607.6(d). 
There was a concern expressed in a comment as to whether a body that does not have full authority to make all ``governing''
policy and administrative decisions for the LSC-funded project would fall within the rule's definition of ``governing
body.'' For example, one LSC recipient that receives very little of its funding from LSC has set up a ``policy board''
to oversee the LSC grant separate from its Board of Directors, which oversees all of its other activities. However,
the policy board does not have all the authority envisioned by this rule in the definition of ``governing body'' and
in  1607.4, which deals with the functions of governing bodies. 
In response, the Board decided to define ``governing body'' so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies
referred to in  1607.6(d) and to make it clear that a governing body should have full authority over LSC grants
as envisioned in this rule. However, in certain special circumstances that are discussed at length in this commentary
on  1607.6 on waivers, the President has the authority to grant waivers on board composition requirements.
As a condition of granting such a waiver, a recipient would be required to establish a special policy board or body,
rather than a governing board or body, to oversee the grant. 


Section 1607.2(e)


A definition of ``policy body'' is added to this section to distinguish such a body from a governing body. As discussed
above under the definition of ``governing body,'' a policy body would be established pursuant to the waiver provision
in  1607.6(d) for grantees seeking a waiver of any of the requirements imposed upon governing bodies by  1607.3.
However, a policy body would be required to conform to the membership and appointment requirements of  1607.3,
as well as the meeting requirements and compensation restriction in   1607.4 and 1607.5, respectively,
and would be required to have full authority to set policy for the services and activities funded under the LSC grant.


Section 1607.2(f)


This definition of ``recipient'' appears in 45 CFR part 1600, but is repeated here as an aid in interpreting this part.



Section 1607.3 Composition 


Section 1607.3(a)


This section is revised to require in paragraph (a) that all board members must be supportive of the purposes of the
LSC Act, and must be interested in and knowledgeable about the delivery of quality legal services to the poor. The current
regulation does not include any similar requirement for client board members, but does include similar, although
not identical, requirements for attorney and other board members. The rule removes the reference to the board's reflecting
``the characteristics'' of the client community, in part because it is not clear what that language means and in part
because it could be construed to be inconsistent with diversity requirements that are included in this section for
each category of board membership.

Three diversity provisions are added to the regulation in   1607.3(b)(3), (c) and (d) to require that
board members reflect the diversity of the legal and client communities, including such factors as race, ethnicity,
gender, and other similar factors. In so doing, the regulation relocates the current section of the rule that relates
to diversity among attorney board members, revises the language to incorporate a more up-to-date statement of the
concerns addressed by the current subsection, and applies the requirement to all categories of board members. While
the language of this final rule specifically mentions race, ethnicity, and gender, it also includes a reference to
``other similar factors'' that may be relevant in a particular legal community and population of the area served by
the recipient, which may include, for example, age, physical abilities, and religious belief. 
The proposed rule did not have the word ``similar'' as a modifier in the phrase ``other factors.'' Some comments stated
that the diversity requirement was too broad and compliance would be difficult if, at the same time, a recipient did
not have the authority to select client board members. However, other comments suggested broader areas of diversity,
such as experience or expertise in poverty areas, such as housing, education, benefits, homelessness, etc. The Board
decided to revise the language to ``other similar factors'' instead of ``other factors.'' This revision is intended
to provide sufficient leeway for local programs to determine the appropriate types of diversity in their service
areas and to insure that their local boards ``reasonably'' reflect those types of diversity that are relevant to the
mission of legal services programs. 
The provision does not require mathematical precision, but sets out goals that recipients should strive to achieve.
In this regard,  1607.3(h) will allow programs to consult with the appointing organizations to insure that
the appointments are made consistent with LSC guidelines. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between allowing
no recipient input and giving the recipient the authority to make all appointments. Finally, if necessary and appropriate,
the waiver provision in  1607.6 could be utilized. 


Section 1607.3(b)


With respect to attorney board members, the rule revises the language of the current rule that is based on the requirements
of the McCollum Amendment in the act appropriating funds for the Corporation. The McCollum Amendment requires a majority
of the board members to be appointed by appropriate state, county and municipal bar associations. The revision clarifies
that the appointments can be made by one or more such bar associations, as long as those bar associations collectively
represent a majority of attorneys practicing law in the recipient's service area. If there are minority or gender-based
bar associations that represent attorneys practicing in a particular locality, those bar associations may be included
in the mix of bar associations that make appointments of attorneys to a recipient's board, especially if their inclusion
would help to insure that there is appropriate diversity among the attorney members of the board. In addition, although
the rule, consistent with the language of the McCollum Amendment, states that the appointments are to be made by the
``governing bodies'' of the bar associations, the Board recognizes that different bar associations should be free
to exercise their appointment responsibility in a manner consistent with their own policies, procedures and practices.
The McCollum Amendment does not direct LSC to impose any particular method of appointment on a bar association. 
One comment objected to term limitations on attorney appointments imposed by a state bar and suggested that the rule
state specifically that any decisions on term limitations should be made by the recipient as part of its bylaws, rather
than by the appointing bar or other organization. The Board did not incorporate the suggested change, because it feels
that recipients should be allowed to work out those differences on a local level with the appointing organizations.

The rule also adds language which is based on part of the McCollum Amendment to make it clear that national support centers
are not required to use the American Bar Association (``ABA'') or a collection of all state bars to appoint their attorney
members, simply because they provide service nationally. The rule also recognizes that some recipients, especially
Native American or migrant programs, may have offices in one state, but also provide services in one or more adjacent
or nearby states. The language is intended to permit those programs, if they so decide, to have the bar associations
of the other states in which they provide service make appointments as well as the bar of the state in which their principal
office is located. 
For the additional ten percent of the board members who must be attorneys, but who are not covered by the McCollum Amendment,
the final rule now explicitly states what is implicit in the language of the current regulation, i.e., that they may
be selected by the recipient's governing body, if it so chooses. The rule does change the current regulation with respect
to the additional ten percent of attorney board members in one respect, however. Under the current regulation, the
additional attorneys must be representatives of bar associations or other legal organizations, e.g., law schools.
This requirement is not contained in the LSC Act. Under this revised regulation, the recipient may select attorneys
who are not representatives of any particular bar or legal organization, or may select attorneys who are affiliated
with non-legal organizations, as long as they are admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area,
and as long as the organization has an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor. Thus, the recipient may
select lawyers who represent the business community or the United Way and who could be helpful in fundraising, or lawyers
who provide substantial pro bono services to the client community and could be helpful in designing a recipient's
private attorney involvement program.

Section 1607.3(c)


The rule includes a number of changes in the language that relates to client board members. The principal revision
addresses the ambiguity of the language of the current regulation that has caused problems for some LSC recipients.
This revision codifies the current LSC interpretation of the language to require that client board members be selected
by client groups that have been designated by the recipient. The revision also adds language that more accurately
reflects the kind of groups or organizations that would be appropriate client groups for purposes of selecting eligible
client members. 
Most comments applauded the language broadening the types of client organizations that may make appointments. Comments
were not uniform, however, on whether recipients or client groups should have authority to appoint client board members.
Numerous comments supported the clarification and the policy choice that it represented, while other comments stated
that it is very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to comply with the requirement that client members be appointed
by client organizations. According to these comments, often there are no organized client groups within the service
area and, even when there are, it is not necessarily true that client groups speak for the client community. Other comments
noted that recipients often come into contact with program clients or other financially eligible individuals who
would make good client board members but who, for one reason or another, are not involved with any client group. 
No change was made by the Board in response to comments on the proposed language. With the addition of  1607.3(h),
permitting consultation with the appointing organizations, and the waiver provisions in  1607.6, the rule
attempts to strike a reasonable balance among these concerns by (1) giving local programs as much input as possible
into the selection of board members and (2) providing for waivers for special conditions. 


Section 1607.3(d)


With respect to the other board members, i.e., those that are neither attorney members nor eligible client members,
the rule makes it clear that recipient boards are permitted to fill these slots. This gives recipients flexibility
to include board members who can help them with fundraising, community relations, coordination with other social
service providers, or any other locally identified need. Law school professors who cannot count as ``attorney members''
because they are not admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, could be selected for this
category of membership. Although there is no comparable language in the current regulation, this provision is consistent
with longstanding LSC interpretations. 


Section 1607.3(e)


This provision is revised by adding language to the ``domination'' provision in the current regulation to make it
clear that the provision is not intended to prevent recipients from designating a single regional or statewide client
council as the appointing organization for client board members, as long as that client council represents numerous
smaller client groups. One comment suggested that coalitions may not always be broad-based and that there might be
competing coalitions of client groups within a service area. The regulation, however, does not require that recipients
use coalitions as the appointing organizations; it merely gives recipients the choice. 


Section 1607.3(f)


This paragraph and paragraph (h) have been amended from the proposed rule. This section now deals only with the method
of selection and is intended to revise the current rule by deleting language which could be incorrectly interpreted
to give LSC authority to veto particular methods of selecting local board members. The rest of the proposed paragraph
(f) has been amended and merged with paragraph (h). 


Section 1607.3(g)


This section establishes a standard for dealing with recipient board vacancies by requiring recipients to make reasonable
and good faith efforts to insure that governing body vacancies are filled promptly. Implicit in this standard is a
recognition that recipients often have no control over the appointment process other than to change the groups that
they have designated to make the appointments if a particular group fails to make an appointment in a timely manner.

Comments generally favored this provision. One comment noted that the existence of a few vacancies on a large board
would have no influence on the ability of a recipient to conduct its business. Several cautioned, however, that recipients
``should be expected to exercise due diligence in the filling of board vacancies'' and others proposed specific timeframes
for compliance. 
The Corporation retained the proposed language as a reasonable and realistic approach to problems with vacancies;
but the Corporation also recognizes that there are alternative approaches to deal with vacancies. For example, through
their own bylaws or board policies, recipients could take a number of actions when appointing organizations are slow
in making appointments, refuse to make them, or are unable to make them for whatever reason. Thus, a recipient board
could adopt bylaws that would permit its members to hold over until replacements are appointed, or could allow for
short-term interim appointments, if necessary, until regular appointments could be made. 


Section 1607.3(h)


This section has been revised from the proposed rule. It incorporates and amends the consultation provisions in the
proposed  1607.3(f) and the provisions in the proposed  1607.3(h) that would have explicitly permitted
a recipient to veto an appointee to its board. As adopted by the Board, this paragraph now states affirmatively that
recipients may recommend names to bar associations and other appointing groups and should consult with those groups
to insure that appropriate appointments are made. The Board adopted this consultation provision because it recognizes
that bar associations or other groups may wish to request information from recipients on who would make a good legal
services program board member and that appointing groups would benefit from recipient input in making their appointments.
Most comments, including those from several bar associations, approved of this proposal, as long as it is clear that
appointing bodies are to make independent judgments about whom to appoint to recipient boards. It is the intent of
the Board that appointing organizations are to make independent judgments and retain their status as the decision
makers for recipient board members. The consultation provision is meant to be an aid, not an impediment, to the appointing
organization's decision making process.

In light of comments from the Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (``SCLAID'') of the American
Bar Association, the Board chose not to adopt the provision authorizing a recipient to veto an appointee. SCLAID opposed
the provision because it could cause unnecessary controversy and has the potential to be misread or misunderstood.
SCLAID suggested that the consultation provision would obviate most problems at the outset and that local recipient
bylaw provisions or state laws would adequately resolve any problems that might arise. Although other bar associations
approved the concept of the veto provision, they advised building more specific checks and balances into the provision,
for safeguards. The Board agreed that there were problems with the veto provision and decided to incorporate the consideration
of individual or institutional conflict into the consultation provision. In addition, the Board noted that applicable
state law that deals with conflict issues of nonprofit boards and recipient bylaws should be consulted to determine
what mechanisms are available to deal with situations that cannot be resolved through the consultation process.
Accordingly, recipients could amend their bylaws to add provisions that deal with board membership conflicts as
long as the bylaws do not conflict with any requirements of the LSC Act or regulations. Then, when making recommendations
to appointing organizations, recipients may refer to their bylaws as part of the standards by which board members
should be appointed. It is recommended that such bylaws deal with situations where conflict issues are not resolved
by the consultation process and also make it clear that it should be the governing body rather than the recipient's
staff that determines whether there is a conflict. 


Section 1607.4 Functions of a Governing Body


Section 1607.4(a)


This rule deletes the requirement for ``effective'' prior public notice, which has proven to be a difficult concept
to enforce and may be very fact-specific. The Board felt that truly effective public notice is virtually impossible
to achieve, even if a recipient spent huge amounts of money on advertising. The Corporation does not wish to promote
such wasteful expenditures or assume that the efforts were not ``effective'' simply because few members of the public
showed up at a board meeting. Instead, the standard should be that of ``reasonable'' prior public notice, so that recipients
would be required to do only what is reasonable under the specific local circumstances. 
The Board also considered whether it should include within the regulation specific guidance as to what kinds of matters
were properly discussed in executive session. In response to comments that some boards do not give appropriate notice
of meetings, the Board revised the proposed language of  1607.4(a) to require recipients to have written policies
that are adopted by their governing bodies, so that arbitrary or ad hoc decisions would not be made regarding these
matters. It also decided to recommend that recipients look to the kinds of matters described in the LSC bylaws and Sunshine
Act regulation (45 CFR part 1622), state Sunshine Act provisions, or other provisions in state nonprofit corporation
law for guidance as to the kinds of matters that might appropriately be discussed out of the public eye. 


Section 1607.4(b)


New language is added to the rule to clarify that recipient governing bodies have, in addition to the specific functions
described in the regulation, the authority and responsibility inherent in their status as boards of nonprofit corporations.
The Board felt that the current regulatory language does not recognize that general authority, and the Board determined
that it should do so. 
In addition, the Board added language to make the section consistent with ABA opinions on the role of governing bodies
of legal assistance programs under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, especially
with respect to the governing bodies' interference with an attorney's representation of a client or with the conduct
of any ongoing representation. The Board wished to make clear that while recipient board members were prohibited
from such interference, the board as a whole should be encouraged to adopt policies to guide the executive director's
actions when he or she discovers that the recipient has undertaken representation in a case that is inappropriate
under the restrictions of the LSC Act or regulations. 


Section 1607.4(c)


This new provision is intended to make it clear that it is up to recipients to design their own bylaws and that LSC approval
is no longer required. The Corporation would, of course, have authority to review a program's bylaws, as well as any
revisions that are made to them, to insure that they comply with the LSC Act and regulations. Several comments suggested
that the proposed language did not make it clear whether a recipient must submit its bylaws to the Corporation for approval.
Thus, paragraph (c) of the proposed rule was revised to clarify that LSC approval of original or amended bylaws is no
longer required. Recipients need only send the Corporation a copy of any changes to their bylaws within a reasonable
time after the bylaws are revised. Although the Board did not adopt a specific deadline, it noted that a reasonable
time would be approximately 30 days. 


Section 1607.5 Compensation


Section 1607.5(a)


The revisions to this section clarify an interpretation of the current rule and make two significant changes dealing
with recipient board member compensation. First, this section has been revised so that the compensation restriction
applies only to attorney board members. Since the provision of the LSC Act that prohibits compensation applies only
to attorney board members, it is consistent with the Act to permit a recipient to pay compensation to a client or other
non-attorney board member for board service or other service to the recipient. Comments were mixed on this provision.
Some wanted to preserve the current rule because it relieves individual programs of the necessity to engage in debate
on the subject. Several comments, on the other hand, suggested that client board members should always be compensated,
and another stated that small stipends for client board members should be made in recognition of the effort that they
make in fulfilling their board responsibilities. The Board adopted the proposed revision, since the statutory language
is limited to the compensation of attorneys. The decision of whether to apply it to client members is purely a local
policy decision to be made by recipients.

The second change made in this provision reverses the decision made by the LSC Board in 1988, which interpreted the
language of the LSC Act to prohibit a recipient board member from receiving compensation from any recipient, not just
the one on whose board the member sat. The effect of the 1988 revision was to prohibit field program staff from sitting
on state and national support center boards, and vice versa, and thus prevented support centers from being accountable
through their boards to the programs that they were intended to serve. This revision restores and clarifies the prior
LSC policy that was in existence from 1975 to 1988 and which reflects the intent of Congress. Both the Legal Services
Corporation reauthorization bill that passed the House in 1992 (H.R. 2039) and the bill that was approved by the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources the same year (S. 2870) would have amended the LSC Act in a manner consistent
with this revision. All but one comment favored this revision.
Finally, this section clarifies that all board members may receive a per diem payment for expenses in lieu of actual
expense reimbursements, so long as such a payment is reasonable in light of actual average costs. Recipients are required
to have written procedures for such payments. Per diem payments may be easier for programs to administer and may encourage
board members to save money on items such as meals and lodging by setting the per diem at a relatively low rate. Language
in the current rule was deleted to make it clear that reimbursement could be made for expenses incurred by recipient
board members on the same terms and conditions that are applicable to non-board members, when such board members are
involved in other program activities not directly related to their board membership or service; e.g., attorney board
members who volunteered to drive a program client to a meeting or a hearing could receive reimbursement for automobile
expenses, or attorney board members who did pro bono work on behalf of the program could receive reimbursement for
travel expenses for attending an out-of-town settlement conference.


Sections 1607.5 (b) and (c)


This section includes two new provisions that clarify how the compensation prohibition relates to a recipient's
private attorney involvement program. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that, for those rural programs that operate in
areas where there are so few attorneys that it is difficult or impossible to find attorneys willing to serve on program
boards, the Corporation could partially waive the compensation prohibition to allow partners and associates of
board members to participate in judicare or other compensated PAI activities. Comments generally favored this provision.
However, one comment cautioned that the waiver should be limited to those rural situations in which, essentially,
it would be otherwise impossible to recruit attorney board members. According to the comment, ``[t]here is a danger
that the delivery system could be skewed to direct resources towards associates or partners of board members and away
from the employees of the program.'' Most comments spoke of the problems of finding sufficient attorneys in rural
areas to participate in PAI programs. No changes were made to the proposed language in response to comments. However,
it is the intent of the Corporation that the waivers be used sparingly.
Paragraph (c) was added to clarify that attorney board members can receive referrals of fee-generating cases and
participate freely in the recipient's pro bono PAI programs on the same terms as any other attorney. This is particularly
important for rural areas where there are few private attorneys.


Section 1607.6 Waiver


Section 1607.6(a)


There is no change in this waiver provision which was designed to cover those programs, primarily reservation-based
Native-American programs, that existed prior to the creation of the Corporation and had nonattorney majorities
on their boards. In lieu of attorneys, most of those programs include tribal advocates who practice in tribal courts.


Section 1607.6(b)


This provision is added to permit the Corporation president to waive any of the provisions of this rule that are not
mandated by law, if the recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of the nature of the population,
legal community or area served or because of special circumstances, such as conflicting requirements of the recipient's
other major funding sources.
The proposed rule had a separate waiver provision for client board membership, but the LSC Board rejected the language.
The proposed waiver for client board membership was intended for recipients that are not statutorily required to
have clients on their boards to seek a waiver from the requirements of this rule. The rule applies to any recipient that
receives financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to  1006(a)(1)(A) of the LSC Act. The statutory
requirement for client membership, however, applies only to recipients organized solely for the provision of legal
assistance. Comments from client representatives persuaded the Board to continue the client board membership requirement
for any recipients that are subject to this rule. The Board agreed with the comments that any recipient funded by LSC
funds would benefit from the client input and that clients would be better served as a result of their ability to have
input into board policy decisions.
The language of (b)(1) has been amended to include a reference to ``legal community'' to make it clear that the nature
of the legal community, as well as requirements of state law, could be considered as a basis for a waiver. The Board recognized
that there may be programs, especially in rural areas, where there are peculiar problems or situations within the
legal community that may make it necessary or desirable to permit the recipient to have a governing board that varies
from the normal. An example would be for those programs that serve Native American populations and practice in tribal
courts. The president, through the waiver authority, could permit the recipient to substitute one or more tribal
advocates for attorney board members. In addition, this provision could be used as authority for partial waiver of
the compensation prohibition, to permit a recipient to adopt policies that would allow partners or associates of
a board member to participate in compensated PAI activities supported by the recipient.

Section 1607.6(c)


The only change made in this subsection was a reference to the previous subsection. It provides that a recipient seeking
a waiver under  1607.6(b)(1) must demonstrate that it has made diligent efforts to comply with the client board
membership requirements.


Section 1607.6(d)


This new provision was added to require that as a condition of granting a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) of this section
from the requirements of  1607.3, the president shall require that the recipient receiving the waiver have
a policy body to establish and enforce policy with respect to the LSC grant. This waiver provision might apply, for
example, to an organization that is not principally a legal assistance organization but gets an LSC grant for legal
assistance activities. The organization would be able to set up a policy board similar to those established for several
of the Delivery Systems Study programs during the late 1970's, to govern the activities covered by the LSC grant. The
Board intends that such a waiver would be given only in very unusual circumstances. Such a policy body would need to
comply with the appointment and membership requirements of  1607.3 and the meeting requirements of  1607.4(a),
and its members would be subject to the compensation prohibitions of  1607.5. The Corporation wanted to make
clear that a policy board is not merely an advisory committee with limited authority to recommend policy to the recipient's
governing body. By definition, such a policy board would be required to have full authority to formulate and enforce
policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or contract, although it may not necessarily
have any policy-making authority with respect to the recipient's non-LSC funded activities. This provision requires
the president to determine the powers and responsibilities of the policy body that are necessary to carry out its responsibilities
with respect to setting policy for the LSC-funded activities. Because the scope of the powers and responsibilities
of such policy bodies might be different than those of grantees not covered by the waiver, the reference in the proposed
rule to  1607.4 has not been retained in this final rule.


Deletion of Section 1607.7 Compliance


The compliance section of the current regulation is no longer applicable, because it refers to the changes that were
made in the regulation in 1983. None of the revisions would require programs to change anything about their board structures
in order to come into compliance, although they would permit programs to make numerous changes and still remain in
compliance with the regulation. Therefore, the Corporation deletes the provisions on compliance. The Corporation
will insure compliance with the new regulation in the same manner that it insures compliance with the other regulations.

law if a recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of: (1) The nature of the population, legal
community or area served; or (2) Special circumstances, including but not limited to, conflicting requirements
of the recipient's other major funding source(s) or State law. 

(c) A recipient seeking a waiver under  1607.6(b)(1) shall demonstrate that it has made diligent efforts to
comply with the requirements of this part. 

(d) As a condition of granting a waiver under  1607.6(b)(2) of any of the requirements imposed upon governing
bodies by  1607.3, the president shall require that a recipient have a policy body with a membership composed
and appointed in the manner prescribed by  1607.3. Such policy body shall be subject to the meeting requirements
of  1607.4(a) and its attorney members shall be subject to the restrictions on compensation contained in  1607.5.
The policy body shall have such specific powers and responsibilities as the President determines are necessary to
enable it to formulate and enforce policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or
contract.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Critical Habitat Determination for the Delta Smelt


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates critical habitat for the threatened delta smelt (

Hypomesus transpacificus

) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

). This final rule designates critical habitat for the delta smelt in the following geographic areas_areas of all
water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun
Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring
Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta, as defined in section
12220 of the California Water Code. Critical habitat designation for the delta smelt will provide additional protection
under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the City of Sacramento on the
Sacramento River and the City of Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle 

et al. 

1992). The delta smelt is a euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in fresh water and has
been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (equivalent to ppt) salinity (Moyle 

et al. 

1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone
(zone of mixing or entrapment at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt
(Ganssle 1966, Moyle 

et al. 

1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993).

Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly productive brackish-water habitat
associated with the mixing zone to disperse widely into river channels and tidally-influenced backwater sloughs
(Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991).

Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the mixing zone (Wang 1991), mostly in tidally-influenced
backwater sloughs and channel edgewaters (Moyle 1976; Wang 1986, 1991; Moyle 

et al. 

1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed in the wild (Moyle 

et al. 

1992), the adhesive eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and submerged
branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in Barker, Lindsey,
Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). Delta
smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun sloughs and their tributaries (Lesa Meng, pers. comm.,
1993; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993).

The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July and August).
Moyle (1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February
and March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early
July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. In 1993, a wet year, spawning may have occurred
as early as January and extended into June (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994). Peak spawning occurred in April of that
year. In 1994, a critically dry year, peak spawning occurred at the end of April, and may have begun as early as late February
or early March (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994).

In the laboratory, delta smelt eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days (Randy 
Mager, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Laboratory 
observations indicate that delta smelt are broadcast spawners that spawn 
in a current, usually at night, distributing their eggs over a local 
area (Lindberg 1992, Mager 1993). Eggs attach singly to the substrate, 
and few eggs were found on vertical plants (Lindberg 1993). Lindberg 
(1993) found that yolk-sac fry were positively phototactic and 
negatively buoyant. After hatching, larvae are transported downstream 
toward the mixing zone where they are retained by the vertical 
circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens 

et al.

 1990). The pelagic 
larvae feed on phytoplankton until day 4, begin to feed on rotifers on 
day 6 and 

Artemis nauplii

 on day 14 (Mager 1992). Juveniles feed 
exclusively on zooplankton. When the mixing zone is located in a broad 
geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic 
zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of phytoplankton and 
zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval 
and juvenile fish, including delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle 

et al.

 
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When given the opportunity, delta 
smelt remain in Suisun Bay even after the 2 ppt isohaline has retreated 
upstream (Herbold 1994). In general, estuaries are among the most 
productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman and Horne 1983). Estuarine 
environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food 
and shallow, protective habitat for young. 

When the mixing zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta 
smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water 
and marsh habitat. Dispersal in areas downstream from the State and 
Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young 
delta smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive, 
protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In 
contrast, when located upstream, the mixing zone becomes confined in the 
deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain 
fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack 
high zooplankton productivity. Vulnerability to entrainment in the 
State and Federal pumping facilities and in-Delta diversions increases. 

Erkkila 

et al.

 (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman 
Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in 
July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of 
Fish and Game, California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the 
Bureau, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island 
in Suisun Bay north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather 
Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang 1991). 
These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July 
in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution surveys, Wang (1991) was 
able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to 
Suisun Bay in late June and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were 
taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991). 

The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive 
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where salinity varies 
spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of 
freshwater inflow. Despite this tremendously variable environment, the 
historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable habitat 
conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with 
the mixing zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 
1993). Since the 1850's, however, the amount and extent of suitable 
habitat for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 
1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers led to 
increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the 
Estuary (Nichols 

et al.

 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation 
of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked the 
beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the 
Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols 

et al.

 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). 

In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the 
delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment, upstream or 
reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and 
constriction of habitat in the less productive, deep-water river 
channels of the Delta (Moyle 

et al.

 1992). These adverse conditions are 
primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water 
diverted from the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe 
and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central Valley 
Project (CVP) began in water year 1940. The State Water Project (SWP) 
began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion of fresh water 
being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels 
(Moyle 

et al.

 1992). A relationship has been found between the number 
of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both 
the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (California 
Department of Water Resources and Bureau of Reclamation 1994). The high 
proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh 
environmental conditions experienced by the delta smelt during the 
recent 6-year drought (1987-1992). The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), 
final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species describes in 
detail the factors that have led to this species' decline. 


Previous Service Action 



In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the 
Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate species. 
Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession 
are sufficient to support proposals for listing. On June 29, 1990, the 
Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, 
President-Elect of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American 
Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species and 
designate its critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that 
substantial information had been presented indicating that the 
petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the 


Federal Register

 on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 
(56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta smelt 
as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This 
proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition finding in accordance 
with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. 

Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all 
submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column 
bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous 
Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length of Montezuma Slough, portions of 
the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
portions of the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in 
between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically less 
than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), contained in the State of 
California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication 
of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992. 

On December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877), the Service published a notice 
of public hearing on the proposed rule to be held in three locations in 
California. Public hearings were conducted on January 9, 1992, in 
Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January 16, 
1992, in Visalia.

The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was 
published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final rule, the 
Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation. At that 
time, the economic analysis necessary to determine critical habitat was 
still in progress. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service 
reopened the public comment period until April 30, 1993, to allow the 
Service to consider any economic or biological information that 
previously had not been submitted. 



Revisions to the October 3, 1991, Critical Habitat Proposal 



The Service published a revision to the October 3, 1991, proposed 
rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt on January 6, 
1994 (59 FR 852). The revision was based primarily on information 
gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam, 
California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and the 
University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service pers. comm., 1993). This information showed that in 1993, delta 
smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at least as far upstream as the 
City of Sacramento and in tidally-influenced shallow freshwater sloughs 
(Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all 
but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively large numbers of delta 
smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa 
Meng, pers. comm., 1993). The revised rule proposed to expand the 
geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional areas now 
known to constitute important spawning habitat. 

In addition, in an April 23, 1993, letter received during the public 
comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested that 
new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta 
water quality standards be considered in the Service's designation of 
critical habitat. The water quality standards were to apply to the 
surface waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San 
Francisco Bay and Delta of the State of California (Bay/Delta) pursuant 
to section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As a result of EPA's 
analysis respecting the number of days that low-salinity water was 
historically located at three locations in the Estuary, the Service 
refined the description of the constituent elements for the delta smelt. 
The proposed critical habitat was revised therefore to encompass 
upstream spawning habitats and to better define constituent elements 
necessary to protect those areas essential to the recovery of the 
species. Comment on the revised proposal and its draft economic 
analysis was solicited. 

On the same date that the Service published its revised critical 
habitat rule, the Service proposed the Sacramento splittail 
(

Pogonichthys macrolepidotus

) as a threatened species and EPA published 
its proposed rule to establish water quality standards for surface 
waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay 
and Delta pursuant to section 303 of the CWA. Those water quality 
standards are meant to protect the estuary as a whole, and therefore 
contain more than the salinity criterion. EPA's water quality proposal 
also includes salmon smolt survival criteria to protect fish migration 
and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary in its 
January 6, 1994, rule, along with proposed striped bass spawning 
criteria. 

Designation of critical habitat at this time is part of a 
coordinated effort between the Service, EPA, National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS), and the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) (collectively, 
``Club Fed'') to protect and recover the delta smelt and the Estuary 
ecosystem. 



Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions 



The Service and EPA recognized that their proposed regulatory 
actions (e.g., delta smelt critical habitat and EPA's water quality 
standards) overlapped biologically and economically. As such, both 
agencies worked closely to provide a comprehensive, ecosystem-based 
approach for the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the 
Estuary. This coordination has resulted in regulatory actions that are 
integrated in both substance and timing. 

Biologically, the critical habitat designation for the delta smelt 
and the salinity criteria within EPA's water quality standards are 
directly related. Specifically, salinities of 2 ppt in Suisun Bay were 
identified as a primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991, 
critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate 
that salinities associated with the distribution of delta smelt may 
provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are 
affected by freshwater discharge from the Estuary (Moyle 

et al. 

1992; 
San Francisco Estuary Project 1993). Favorable conditions from February 
through June are important to the abundance and reproductive success of 
almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Estuary. 
Because EPA's water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt 
salinities from February to June, its standards will address certain 
critical habitat (water quality) requirements for delta smelt. 

In the text of the January, 6, 1994, proposed rule to designate 
critical habitat for the delta smelt, the Service identified specific 
salinity criteria required to maintain habitat for delta smelt through 
its entire life cycle. These criteria had been determined in 
coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality 
standards. Subsequent to publication of the critical habitat proposed 
rule, the Service received many comments objecting to the specificity of 
the salinity criteria. During numerous discussions with interested 
parties (and in the following response to comments), Service staff have 
explained that the detailed discussion within the text of the proposed 
rule was meant to clearly describe the need for including a water 
quality criterion specific to salinity as one primary constituent 
element. The actual regulation that was proposed for publication in the 
Code of Federal Regulations, however, was much less specific as to allow 
broad flexibility in implementation of the provisions of the Act. 
Therefore, to clarify the Service's intent to preserve the flexibility 
inherent in implementation of the section 7 regulations, the following 
discussion of the primary constituent elements necessary to define delta 
smelt critical habitat, is general in scope. However, the Service has 
coordinated carefully and extensively with EPA to ensure that EPA's 
final rule promulgating Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of 
the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta 
of the State of California affords sufficient protection to further the 
recovery of the delta smelt. EPA's final rule is published in this same 


Federal Register

, in a separate part. In its proposed rule, EPA 
requested that specific comments be submitted on several issues, 
including the possibility of modifying the Sacramento River Index for 
the purposes of developing the salinity criteria, alternative approaches 
to the averaging period used in its proposed salinity criteria, and 
evaluation of the merits of the use of different forms of confidence 
intervals with the proposed criteria. In developing this final rule, 
the Service has considered all such comments. These issues also were 
discussed with EPA in regard to the development of its water quality 
standards and the Service's section 7 consultation with EPA on 
promulgation of these standards. 

Section 7 of the Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that 
their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed 
species or adversely modify designated critical habitat. EPA's action 
in promulgating water quality standards must comply with the section 7 
consultation requirement. 



Definition of Critical Habitat

Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species at the time it is listed * * * on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed
* * * upon a determination * * * that such areas are essential for the conservation of
the species.'' The term ``conservation'', as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``* * * to use
and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species
to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.'' With recovery, no protection
from the Act is necessary. Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical or biological
features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the Act and can be removed
from the list of 
endangered and threatened species. Section 3(c) further states that in 
most cases the entire range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat. Areas outside the present
geographic range may be included as critical habitat if a species' present range would be inadequate to ensure conservation
of the species. 



Role in Species Conservation 



Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat 
indicates that its designation should identify areas that may be needed 
for a species' recovery and delisting. 

The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to 
recovery, but is one of several measures available to contribute to a 
species' recovery. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities 
by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary 
constituent elements) regardless of whether or not they are currently 
occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the public to the 
importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical 
habitat also identifies areas that may require special management or 
protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the 
Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal 
agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions 
that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not 
likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This additional 
protection to a species' habitat may actually shorten the time needed to 
achieve recovery. Aside from this added protection provided by section 
7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands 
designated as critical habitat. 

Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan, 
establish numerical population goals, prescribe specific management 
actions (inside or out of critical habitat), nor does it have a direct 
effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management 
recommendations for critical habitat are more appropriately addressed in 
recovery plans, management plans, and section 7 consultations. 

Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the 
conservation of a species. Areas with one or more essential features 
but not currently containing all of the features and areas having the 
capability to provide essential features in the future, may be required 
for the long-term recovery of the species. This may be so particularly 
in certain portions of its range. However, not all areas containing all 
features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to the 
species' recovery. Areas not included in critical habitat that contain 
one or more of the essential elements are still important to a species' 
conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act and 
other conservation laws and regulations. All designated areas also may 
be of considerable value in maintaining ecosystem integrity and 
supporting other species. 

Designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised, at 
any time, when new information indicates that changes are warranted. 
The Service may revise critical habitat if management plans, recovery 
plans, or other conservation strategies are developed and fully 
implemented, reducing the need for the additional protection provided by 
critical habitat designation. For example, after the draft Delta Native 
Fishes Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan) is finalized or the State 
promulgates more protective water quality standards for the Estuary than 
are currently in place, land and water management agencies may provide 
increased protection for the delta smelt. If these protection measures 
are implemented, the Service may revise its critical habitat 
designation.

Primary Constituent Elements



In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological
features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12(b)). The Service is required to list the known
primary constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical
and biological features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;

(2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;

(3) Cover or shelter;

(4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination, or seed dispersal; and

(5) Generally, habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical
and ecological distributions of a species.

The primary constituent elements essential to the conservation of the delta smelt are physical habitat, water, river
flow, and salinity concentrations required to maintain delta smelt habitat for spawning, larval and juvenile transport,
rearing, and adult migration.

The primary constituent elements are organized by habitat conditions required for each life stage. The specific
geographic areas and seasons identified for each habitat condition represent the maximum possible range of each
of these conditions. Depending on the water-year type (i.e., wet, above normal, normal, below normal, dry, critically
dry), each of the habitat conditions specified below requires fluctuation (within-year and between-year) in the
placement of the 2 ppt isohaline (a line drawn to connect all points of equal salinity) around three historical reference
points. These three historical reference points are the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, the upstream
limit of Suisun Bay at Chipps Island, and in the middle of Suisun Bay at Roe Island. The actual number of days that the
2 ppt isohaline is maintained at the three points varies according to water-year type.

In addition, to maintain habitat conditions necessary to achieve recovery of the delta smelt, the number of days at
each reference point must simulate a level of water project development equivalent to that which historically existed
in 1968. A 1968 level of development represents a period of time before Delta outflow was affected by the SWP and the
delta smelt was abundant. This year (1968) falls within the time period identified by the Delta Native Fishes Recovery
Team as having had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would allow recovery of the delta smelt. Additionally,
on June 15, 1994, the Regional Director signed an Interagency Statement of Principles among the Service, NMFS, and
EPA (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian, 

in litt.

 1994) stating, in part, despite the effects of the water projects that were operating at that time, the Estuary ecosystem
and its anadromous and resident fisheries were relatively healthy during the years between 1960 and 1970.

Further, to maintain suitable habitat conditions for recovery of the delta smelt, the naturally-occurring variability
found in healthy estuarine ecosystems must be preserved for the following reasons_(1) temporal and spatial variability
of the 2 ppt isohaline will be the most effective deterrent to further invasion of newly introduced species and continued
competition by those that are already established, (2) placement of the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay will produce
the high phytoplankton and zooplankton densities that characterize most healthy estuarine ecosystems, and (3)
variability is needed to simulate natural processes and historical conditions.

The primary constituent elements for the delta smelt are:



Spawning Habitat

_Delta smelt adults seek shallow, fresh or slightly brackish backwater sloughs and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure
egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable water quality (i.e., low concentrations
of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree roots and branches and emergent vegetation).
Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache,
Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs and the Sacramento River in the Delta, and tributaries of
northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start as early as December and extend until
July.

<TEXT>
 



Larval and Juvenile Transport

_To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing
or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical
disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow
disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate
river flow is necessary to transport larvae from upstream spawning areas to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. Additionally,
river flow must be adequate to prevent interception of larval transport by the State and Federal water projects and
smaller agricultural diversions in the Delta. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat is available in Suisun Bay,
the 2 ppt isohaline must be located westward of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence during the period when
larvae or juveniles are being transported, according to the historical salinity conditions which vary according
to water-year type. Reverse flows that maintain larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and
expose them to entrainment interfere with these transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided
so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval
transport is confined to waters contained within the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough
and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat conditions identified above are important for successful
larval transport varies from year to year, depending on when peak spawning occurs and on the water-year type. The Service
identified situations in the biological opinion for the delta smelt (1994) where additional flows might be required
in the July-August period to protect delta smelt that were present in the south and central Delta from being entrained
in the State and Federal project pumps, and to avoid jeopardy to the species. The long-term biological opinion on CVP-SWP
operations will identify situations where additional flows may be required after the February through June period
identified by EPA for its water quality standards to protect delta smelt in the south and central Delta.



Rearing Habitat

_Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline according to the historical salinity conditions described above and suitable
water quality (low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and
juveniles a shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt
isohaline also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal
water projects. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Strait, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay, Honker Bay,
Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile Slough, and
south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical to the maintenance
of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most upstream extent of
tidal excursion when the historical salinity conditions described above are implemented. Protection of rearing
habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February through the summer.



Adult Migration

_Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestricted access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from
December to July. Adequate flow and suitable water quality may need to be maintained to attract migrating adults in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma sloughs
and their tributaries. These areas also should be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption during
migratory periods.

To conserve the delta smelt, this final rule designates critical habitat in an area encompassing the specific habitat
conditions required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is designated in the following
geographic area_areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded
by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun,
Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within
the Delta. Thus, critical habitat for the delta smelt is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin,
Solano, and Yolo Counties, California. The ``Regulation Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds
description of critical habitat designated for the delta smelt.

Effects of Critical Habitat Designation 



Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires for any proposed or final 
regulation that designates critical habitat a brief description and 
evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely 
modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation. At the time 
of preparation of the revised proposed rule, the Service identified the 
following list of proposed or ongoing actions whose effects likely would 
jeopardize the delta smelt and adversely modify or destroy its critical 
habitat_Central Valley Project operations, State Water Project 
operations, deep water navigation channel dredging, reoperation of 
Folsom Dam, Oroville Dam, and Auburn Dam, Central Valley and State Water 
Project Wheeling Purchase Agreement, San Joaquin Valley Drainage 
Program, Central Valley Project water contract renewals, petition by the 
Bureau for a change in diversion point, South Delta Water Management, 
South Delta Temporary Barriers Project, Stanislaus-Calaveras River Basin 
Water Use Program, Phases 3 and 4 of the Suisun Marsh Project, North 
Delta Water Management Project, West Delta Water Management Project, 
Delta Wetlands Water Storage Project, Los Banos Grandes Reservoir, Los 
Vaqueros Reservoir, Kern Water Bank, full operation of four State Water 
Project pumps, entrainment of fish and thermal pollution by industry 
(e.g., power generation facilities), urban or agricultural nonpoint 
contaminant discharges, in-Delta and Suisun Marsh water diversion, Phase 
2 of the Coastal Aqueduct, and the Delta Levee Subvention Program. 
Since publication of the revised proposed rule, the Service has 
determined through section 7 consultations that the South Delta 
Temporary Barriers Project, deep water navigation channel dredging, Los 
Vaqueros Reservoir Project, and Phase 2 of the Coastal Aqueduct Project 
will not jeopardize the delta smelt. 

The proposed rule to revise the critical habitat designation did not 
identify any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt 
without adversely affecting critical habitat. In the revised proposed 
rule, the Service did identify (based on section 7 consultation 
experiences) five activities that, depending on the season of 
construction and scale of the project, might result in the destruction 
or adverse modification of critical habitat without necessarily 
jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt. These 
activities were:

(1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes; 

(2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; 

(3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement
of dredged materials on levees of banks; 

(4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and 

(5) Bridge and marina construction. 

Construction and implementation of each of these five actions requires 
authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) pursuant to section 
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the CWA and 
therefore are considered Federal actions. In a section 7 consultation 
with the Bureau and the California Department of Fish and Game, 
California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the Service reviewed the 
operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure for effects on delta 
smelt. As a result, DWR and the Bureau sponsored an investigation of 
the effects of the operation of the Structure on delta smelt, and DWR 
committed to operate the gates only as required to meet existing Suisun 
Marsh salinity standards. When not operating, the gates on the 
Structure will remain in the raised position. The effect of gate 
operation on delta smelt is currently being studied, and the Service 
will make a determination on the Structure's operations in the near 
future. As to the other actions, the Service will consult with the 
Corps as these actions arise. 

On February 4, 1994, subsequent to the publication of the January 6, 
1994, revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat, the Service 
transmitted to the Bureau a jeopardy biological opinion on the combined 
operation of the Federal and State Water Projects on the delta smelt 
through February 1995. In the 1994 biological opinion, the Service 
determined that the proposed operation of the Federal and State Water 
Projects likely would jeopardize the continued existence of the delta 
smelt and would destroy or adversely modify proposed critical habitat. 
This one-year opinion did not recommend a reasonable and prudent 
alternative that distinguished between the number of days of compliance 
with the 2 ppt criteria to avoid jeopardy and the number of days of 
compliance that would have been required to avoid destruction or adverse 
modification of proposed critical habitat. The Service acknowledges 
that such a distinction may be appropriate in future biological 
opinions. 

Any possible revisions to the biological opinion will recognize 
three major initiatives that will shape the dynamics of future estuarine 
conditions for delta smelt. First, in accordance with a Framework 
Agreement (1994) between the Governor's Water Policy Council of the 
State of California (Council) and Club Fed, the State Board will seek 
agreement with DWR and the U.S. Department of the Interior to operate 
the SWP and CVP to make an equitable contribution to meeting the revised 
water quality standards beginning calendar year 1995. The Board will 
seek this agreement while they are working on a water rights decision to 
allocate responsibility among water rights holders in the Bay-Delta 
watershed. Second, section 7(a)(1) of the Act imposes an affirmative 
obligation on Federal agencies to carry out programs for the 
conservation (recovery) of listed species. With the forthcoming 
issuance of a Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan, currently in 
preparation, the Service expects that local, State, and Federal agencies 
will fulfill their responsibilities by assisting in the completion of 
tasks and objectives in the plan. Third, and related to number two, the 
scheduled renewal of water contracts (i.e., reopened or expired Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses, expired CVP water 
contracts) will provide an additional opportunity under sections 7(a)(1) 
and 7(a)(2) of the Act to implement Recovery Plan objectives and meet 
EPA's water quality standards. Collectively, these initiatives likely 
will result in a phased improvement to water quality based habitat 
requirements for the delta smelt. Accordingly, the Service anticipates 
that adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat will be 
avoided by operation of the CVP, SWP, and other water management 
facilities with implementation of the above described initiatives. 



Consideration of Economic and Other Factors 



Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any
particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. EPA, in coordination with the Service, included
an analysis of the effects of designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in its draft Regulatory Impact Assessment
(RIA) for its proposed water quality standards. A summary of that analysis was provided in the revised proposed rule
designating critical habitat for the delta smelt (59 FR 852). 

The Service stated in the revised proposed rule that if the final economic analysis substantially differed from the
draft analysis summarized in the revised proposed rule, a revised analysis would be made available for public comment.
No opportunity for public comment was afforded because the results of the final economic analysis do not substantially
differ from the results of the draft analysis. 

EPA's economic analysis assumes that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with construction
and implementation of major water projects would be attributable to the jeopardy standard imposed by listing the
delta smelt as a threatened species, as opposed to designation of critical habitat. Specifically, the impacts of
designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to (1) listing of the
species, (2) economic effects resulting from conservation actions taken by other Federal agencies under section
7(a)(1) of the Act, and (3) regulatory actions required by other laws.

Section 9 of the Act and Service regulations prohibit the taking of delta smelt without express authorization from
the Service. Under Service regulations, ``take'' may include significant habitat modification or degradation
that actually kills or injures protected species. In addition, Federal agencies must consult with the Service to
ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species. An action could
jeopardize the existence of a listed species if it destroys or modifies its habitat. This is so regardless of whether
that habitat has been designated as critical habitat. Therefore, the direct economic and other impacts resulting
from designation of critical habitat are relatively small because the Act provides substantial protection to habitat
through listing of the species itself. In general, designation of critical habitat supplements 
the protection afforded a listed species. 

The RIA concluded that economic costs attributable to the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt would
be relatively small. In the revised proposed rule, the Service determined that economic costs would be attributable
to five actions (i.e., sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank protection activities,
operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure, and bridge and marine construction). In the final RIA prepared
by EPA (EPA 1994), the economic costs attributable to 
designation were from the same five actions. 



Economic Impacts Attributable Directly to Critical Habitat Designation 



A synopsis of the economic impacts associated with the five activities identified by the Service includes: 



Sand and Gravel Operations

_Four aggregate operators in the delta may 
be affected by the designation of critical habitat. Two of the aggregate operations in the Delta are located in San
Joaquin County, which has a total of eleven aggregate sites. The estimated value of aggregate production for San Joaquin
County in 1986 was $13 million. The four aggregate operations in the Delta that could be affected by the regulation
produced a small percentage of California's aggregate in 1992, which had a total value of $473 million. The economic
impacts on the aggregate production industry resulting from the designation of critical habitat likely will be minor,
given the relatively small amount of sand and gravel production occurring in the Delta. 

In many cases, minor changes to the timing of extraction to avoid 
sensitive biological periods will minimize the economic effects on mining activities. Mitigation in the form of
habitat replacement might be required for operations that may result in the destruction or adverse modification
of critical habitat. Costs to restore 1 acre of wetlands range between $10,000 to $50,000. Mitigation costs could
be reduced if low-cost lands were acquired, and levees were breached to flood areas. For some tracts of land, the costs
associated with restoring wetlands may exceed the value derived from the agricultural activity, in which case the
cost attributable to critical habitat would be the loss in agricultural income. 



Diking and Dredging for Agricultural Operations

_Though designation 
of critical habitat for the delta smelt may require implementation of best management practices and a 3:1 ratio of
permanently destroyed habitat in proposed project areas, the economic impacts of restricting diking and dredging
operations are expected to be minimal. For example, the regulatory costs (i.e., with critical habitat designated)
associated with converting the Little Holland Tract in the Delta to agricultural uses with critical habitat designated
would be the cost to replace 440 acres of habitat at a 3:1 ratio (EPA 1994). The expense of replacing habitat would likely
exceed the economic returns from agricultural production on this tract, which was historically planted for corn.
Foregone income from future agricultural production on the 1,300 arable acre tract would amount to $65,000 per year.




Levee Maintenance

_Between 1981-1991, local agencies maintained 
536.6 miles of levee in the Delta, spending an average of $1.24 million 
per mile (EPA 1994). Approximately 41% of the costs were financed 
through State subventions. The costs of levee maintenance are not 
expected to increase significantly due to this critical habitat 
designation because Federal regulatory agencies currently have timing 
and construction restrictions that generally avoid adverse effects to 
the delta smelt. 



Montezuma Slough Control Structure Operations

_The economic impacts 
associated with the operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure could not be estimated by the time this final
rule was published. In response to a biological opinion issued by the USFWS to DWR and the Bureau on the Structure's
operation, an investigation of the effects of the Structure on delta smelt is being conducted, and will be completed
in the near future. The Structure's operations may be modified once the study is completed. The gates at this structure
are currently operated from November to March in accordance with current State salinity standards to maintain low-salinity
water in Suisun Marsh, but remain open the remainder of the year. 



Bridge and Marina Construction

_The use of best management practices, time restrictions, and other construction restrictions similar to those
for levee maintenance and sand and gravel operations should preclude any substantial impact from designation of
delta smelt critical habitat on bridge and marina construction. 



Water Costs Attributed to EPA's Salinity Standards

EPA's economic analysis evaluated the costs associated with 
implementing its water quality standards for the Bay/Delta. Since the 
Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent 
element essential to conserve the delta smelt, an analysis of the water 
costs associated with implementing the salinity standards is included in 
this final rule. Though the water costs associated with the water 
quality standards are attributable to EPA, the Service includes this 
discussion to make clear the approximate cost of implementing the 
salinity standards alone. 


The water costs associated with the salinity standards and fish 
migration standards are reported in EPA's final RIA (EPA 1994). EPA 
reports the water costs as the sum of costs associated with the salinity 
standards and fish migration standards. However, depending on 
hydrologic conditions, approximately 35% to 73% of the water costs in 
the EPA economic analysis can be attributed to the salinity criteria 
alone, apart from the fish migration criteria (EPA 1994). 


The overall estimated water supply impacts of both the salinity and 
fish migration water quality standards (change in total exports) over 
those associated with existing D-1485 State salinity standards and water 
quality requirements for winter-run chinook salmon under a NMFS 
biological opinion are 376 thousand acre-feet (taf) per year on average, 
and 577 taf during critically dry periods. However, the State's 
implementation plan for EPA's water quality standards will substantially 
affect the magnitude and distribution of the costs associated with 
implementing the water quality standards. A more detailed discussion of 
the water costs associated with different implementation scenarios 
appears in the final RIA (EPA 1994). 




National Economic Costs 




Actions taken to preserve and recover threatened and endangered 
species may result in the re-allocation of resources within the regional 
and national economy. National economic costs, best described as 
efficiency costs, include changes in the consumer and producer surplus, 
and related employment impacts. These measures capture the net social 
gains and losses resulting from the resource allocation. 


The national economic cost of the five activities evaluated above 
(sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank 
protection activities, operation of the Montezuma Slough Control 
Structure, and bridge and marina construction) is minimal since the 
overall economic cost of those activities in the region is minimal. 


EPA's economic analysis used the above described measures to 
estimate the costs and benefits of the water quality standards. 
Therefore, the results of EPA's economic analysis is identical to an 
analysis done for national economic costs. 




Benefits of Critical Habitat Designation 




Conservation of the delta smelt with designation of its critical 
habitat will result in a wide range of benefits. Section 2(a)(3) of the 
Act recognizes that fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, 
ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value 
to the Nation and its people. EPA (1994) categorizes the benefits of 
promulgating water quality standards and designating critical habitat as 
use, nonuse, and other benefits. A more detailed description of these 
uses are contained in the final RIA (EPA 1994). 


Several use and nonuse benefits can be attributed to designating 
critical habitat for the delta smelt, apart from benefits attributable 
to EPA's water quality standards. Generally, the designation of 
critical habitat will prevent the further decline of estuarine health. 
Benefits include: 


(1) Reduced need in the future to list fish and wildlife species 
currently in decline; 


(2) Increased biological production of commercially important 
species, such as waterfowl and salmon; 


(3) Increased protection to a wide variety of estuarine species, 
several of which are unique to the Estuary (e.g., winter-run chinook 
salmon, Estuary population of longfin smelt, and Sacramento 
splittail); 


(4) Curtailed establishment of newly introduced exotic species and 
deterred explosion of the current population of already established 
exotic species; 


(5) Increased recreational fishing and hunting opportunities;

<TEXT>
 

(6) Increased opportunities for wildlife observation resulting from 
restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem 
health; and 


(7) Improved commercial fishery harvest as a result of increased 
populations of fish. 


EPA (1994) assigned a monetary value to several of the use benefits. 
The economic benefits of EPA's standards are broader than protection of 
the delta smelt, since EPA's standards are expected to positively affect 
all components of the food web. The total economic benefit of EPA's 
water quality standards and the designation of critical habitat for the 
delta smelt are reported as follows. The ecological benefits of 
improved estuarine conditions are expected to generate at least $2.1 
million or more in net economic benefits to commercial and recreational 
fisheries (particular salmon fisheries), and will have an associated 
employment gain of approximately 145 full-time equivalent jobs (EPA 
1994). Benefits to the ocean sport fishery for salmon is estimated at 
about $708,000 annually (EPA 1994). This increase would result in 
positive employment effects on sport fishing-related industry, adding 
approximately 70 jobs in this area. Annual benefits to the striped bass 
sport fishing industry is estimated to be $57,500 annually (EPA 1994). 


An important avoided cost is associated with further declines in 
the recreational and commercial fisheries industry of the Bay/Delta, 
which is valued at $200 million annually (EPA 1994). Other avoided 
costs include government costs associated with crop deficiency payments, 
agricultural drainage costs, and costs associated with the potential 
reduction in property value. 




Summary of the Exclusion Process 




In order to determine the specific extent of designation of critical 
habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act, the Service must 
analyze: 


(1) The benefits of excluding an area as critical habitat, 


(2) The benefits of including an area, and 


(3) The effects of exclusions on the probability of species 
extinction. 


This process consists of (1) estimating the benefits of retaining or 
excluding land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay or river 
reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, and 
First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs; (2) weighing those benefits; and 
(3) determining if exclusion of an area or areas from critical habitat 
will lead to the extinction of the species. If the exclusion of an area 
or areas from critical habitat will result in eventual species 
extinction, then the exclusion would be prohibited under the Act. 




Extinction 




Critical habitat consists of areas with habitat characteristics that 
are essential to the conservation of a listed species. However, the 
exclusion process focuses upon a threshold for species extinction. 
Conservation (recovery) and extinction are separate standards. Recovery 
and extinction are at opposite ends of a continuum, with the likelihood 
of a species' continued survival increasing the closer the species is to 
the recovery end of the continuum. It may be more difficult to predict 
the point at which extinction would be inevitable than to determine 
where recovery may occur. 


The analysis to determine whether extinction will occur will be 
different for each species, depending on many variables, including a 
species' geographic range. The exclusion analysis also may be related 
to a number of factors, such as the number of individuals, amount of 
habitat, condition of the habitat, and reproductive success. Extinction 
of an annual species, like the delta smelt, most likely would occur when 
rearing habitat conditions are poor enough for two consecutive years 
that some minimum number of fish fail to survive to reproduce. Habitat 
conditions could become poor enough if pumping at Federal and State 
water project facilities and private diversions significantly reduce 
outflow from the Delta. If a sufficient number of delta smelt were 
entrained in Federal and State water project facilities and private 
diversions so that a minimal number survived to reproduce, the 
population could decline. Extinction could result. The focus of the 
exclusionary analysis was on those factors that pertain to these issues 
and included consideration of habitat condition, functioning of the 
Estuary ecosystem, and proximity of the delta smelt population to the 
Federal and State pumps during various life stages.

Criteria and Decision 



In evaluating the designation of critical habitat to determine 
whether or not to exclude areas because of concerns over economic 
effects, the Service used the following process: 

(1) Based upon the criteria described in this document, the 
geographical area essential to the conservation of the species was 
identified; and 

(2) An economic analysis was conducted to ascertain the anticipated 
economic consequences of designating areas as critical habitat, using 
agricultural and urban sectors as the primary level of economic 
analysis. 

(3) The Service balanced the costs and other impacts of designation 
with the benefits of designation. 



Exclusion 



Using the above described process, the Service has determined that 
no exclusions to critical habitat are appropriate. The entire 
geographic area designated as critical habitat is essential to conserve 
the delta smelt. Delta smelt are restricted to a limited geographic 
area, and retaining land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay and 
river reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, 
and First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs is necessary to recover this 
annual species. These areas provide habitat necessary for each life 
stage of the species. 

The economic consequences of designating the entire area as critical 
habitat are relatively small. Most economic costs can be avoided by 
project proponents by using timing and construction restrictions, and by 
using best management practices. Designation of critical habitat will 
reduce the need in the future to list fish and wildlife species 
currently in decline, and will improve the overall health of the 
Estuary. The benefits of designating the entire area outweigh the 
benefits of excluding any of the area from the designation. 



Available Conservation Measures 



The purpose of the Act, as stated in section 2(b), is to provide a 
means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened 
species depend and to provide a program for the conservation of listed 
species. Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that ''* * * all Federal 
departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and 
threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of 
the purposes of this Act. 

The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through 
different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to 
further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs 
and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the 
continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction 
or adverse modification of critical habitat); section 9 (wildlife 
research permits and habitat conservation planning on non-Federal 
lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants), land 
acquisition, and research. Other Federal laws also require conservation 
of endangered and threatened species, such as the National Forest 
Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and various 
other State and Federal laws and regulations. 

Critical habitat is not intended as a management or conservation 
plan. Critical habitat is primarily intended to identify the habitat 
that meets the criteria for the primary constituent elements. However, 
there are benefits that result from the designation. Designation will 
help retain recovery options and reduce the near-term risk until a long-term conservation plan is implemented. 

Designation of critical habitat does not offer specific direction 
for managing delta smelt habitat. That type of direction, as well as 
any change in direction, will come through the administration of other 
facets of the Act (e.g., section 7, section 10 HCP process, and recovery 
planning). 



Recovery Planning 



Recovery planning under section 4(f) of the Act is the ``umbrella''
that eventually guides all the Act's activities and promotes a species' 
conservation and eventual delisting. Recovery plans provide guidance, 
which may include population goals and identification of areas in need 
of protection or special management. Recovery plans usually include 
management recommendations for areas proposed or designated as critical 
habitat. 

The delta smelt and six other fish species that depend on the 
Estuary for a significant segment of their life history are included in 
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan. The 
recovery plan is currently in draft form. The recovery plan will 
include recovery criteria based on population abundance and geographic 
distribution. Designation of critical habitat, along with the 
biological opinion evaluating the effects of the Federal and State water 
projects on the delta smelt, is consistent with the plan's objective to 
recover these fish species. 



Section 7 Consultation 



Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that 
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy 
or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility 
accompanies, and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) 
of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not 
jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. 

Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be 
expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and 
recovery of a species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical 
habitat defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that 
appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the 
survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly 
state that such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations 
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that 
were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 

Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse 
modification and jeopardy, are directly related. Survival may be viewed 
as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. 
The closer one is to recovery, the greater the certainty in the species 
continued survival. The terms ``survival and recovery'' are, thus, 
related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a 
given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that 
influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution 
throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive 
success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high 
degree of certainty for the species' continued viability. 

The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose 
of critical habitat is to contribute to a species' conservation, which 
by definition equates to recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the 
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply to actions 
that would impair survival and recovery of a listed species, thus 
providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within 
critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and 
recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between 
critical habitat and recovery, the prohibition against destruction or 
adverse modification of the critical habitat should provide for the 
protection of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to a species' 
recovery.

Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical 
habitat include those authorized, carried out, or funded by the Corps, 
Department of the Navy, the Bureau, NMFS, FERC, the Service, and EPA. 
The Corps funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and 
diversion facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection 
activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil 
disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge 
construction, diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal 
gate or barrier installation. The Corps also develops permits pursuant 
to section 404 of the CWA to the Department of the Navy so the Navy may 
dredge deep-water ship channels and dispose of dredge materials in 
Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay. The Corps also 
conducts such activities for the Navy. 

The Bureau and DWR construct, operate, and manage water export 
facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates 
replacement standards, pursuant to the CWA, if the State standards are 
found to be inadequate. FERC licenses water storage facilities on 
tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In 1991, EPA 
disapproved portions of the State Board's Water Quality Control Plan for 
Salinity for the Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared proposed and 
finalized replacement standards for those portions of the State's 
salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures to protect the 
federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which NMFS has 
jurisdiction under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may 
require consultation with the Service. 


The Service and the Bureau are jointly responsible for implementing 
the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Activities under 
the CVPIA include, but are not limited to, management of a portion of 
the CVP water supply dedicated for fish and wildlife protection, 
restoration, and enhancement, acquisition of additional water supplies 
for the same purposes, and screening unscreened diversions in the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed. Both the Bureau and Service 
activities under the CVPIA may affect delta smelt or its critical 
habitat, requiring consultation with the Service. 

Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a 
requirement for the development of a recovery plan. The Service 
convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a Recovery 
Plan for declining native fishes in the Estuary. The Recovery Plan, 
currently in draft form, will develop a framework for Federal, State, 
and private entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each 
other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities 
and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery 
goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival 
and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary 
ecosystem also will be described in this plan. 



Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



Designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was first 
proposed on October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), as part of the proposed rule 
to list the species. During the 4-month comment period following 
publication of the proposal, the Service received 360 written and oral 
comments from 348 individuals. Of the forty-four people who commented 
specifically on critical habitat, thirty-four opposed and ten supported 
the designation. 

On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that 
the public comment period on the original proposed critical habitat 
designation for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to 
allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not 
been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters_two in 
support of critical habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition, 
and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the 
biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft 
proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality standards. 

On January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852), the Service revised the geographical 
area and refined the primary constituent elements described in the 
original critical habitat proposal. The public comment period for the 
revised proposed critical habitat designation was open from January 6, 
1994, to March 7, 1994, and later extended to March 11, 1994 (59 FR 
3829). During the 65-day comment period, the Service received written 
comments from forty-three parties on both the critical habitat 
designation and EPA's proposed water quality standards for the 
Bay/Delta. Thirty-two commenters were opposed to critical habitat 
designation, nine supported the decision, and two expressed no 
preference. Several commenters either referenced or supported the 
comments of the California Urban Water Agencies (CUWA). 

Four joint public hearings were held to solicit comments on the 
revised proposed critical habitat designation, the proposed threatened 
status for the Sacramento splittail, and the proposed water quality 
standards developed by EPA. A total of 125 people presented oral 
testimony and submitted written comments at the hearings, primarily on 
delta smelt critical habitat and Bay/Delta water quality standard 
issues. The Service received comments from elected officials, 
interested persons, municipal and agricultural water districts and 
associations, environmental organizations, business and industry owners 
and managers, fishing enthusiasts, farmers, agricultural commissions and 
dairy interests, biologists, county and municipal officials, power 
agency representatives, hospital and school district representatives, 
and building industry spokespeople. 

At the February 23, 1994, hearing in Fresno, thirty-eight people 
presented oral testimony_thirty-six people opposed and two supported 
critical habitat designation. Nineteen people testified at the February 
24, 1994, Sacramento meeting_fifteen people were opposed to the 
designation, three were in support, and one person was neutral. 

Twelve people testified at the February 25, 1994, hearing in San 
Francisco_nine people supported and three opposed the critical habitat 
designation. At the February 28, 1994, hearing in Irvine, fifty-six 
people presented oral and written comments (fifty-one people testified 
and five submitted only written comments)_fifty of the fifty-six 
commenters opposed critical habitat, five were neutral, and one 
supported the designation. 

Comments addressing the issue of available scientific information 
used to revise the proposed rule were addressed in the revised proposed 
rule of January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852). The Service addressed EPA's 
comments, as well as comments provided by the State. All other 
comments are addressed below in this final rule. Because EPA can better 
respond to comments regarding the economic analysis and the assumptions 
used to develop its Bay/Delta water quality standards, the Service 
refers to EPA's ``Response to Comments'' document for responses to 
comments specific to those issues. However, the Service will respond to 
any comments regarding the relationship between EPA's water quality 
standards and the biological requirements of the delta smelt in this 
section, and to comments regarding the economic analysis as it is 
associated with the critical habitat designation. 

Comments are part of the administrative record and are available for 
public review. Written comments and oral statements presented at the 
public hearings and received during the comment periods are covered in 
the following summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are 
grouped into a number of general issues. These issues, and the 
Service's response to each, are discussed below.

Estuarine Standard Issues





Comment 1: 

One commenter thought the Service should not adopt EPA's 
Bay/Delta water quality standards as part of the designation of critical 
habitat for the delta smelt. The commenter asserted that because the 
Service had not described the biological relevance of the standards, 
adopting the standards would be ``throwing water at the problem''. 
Another commenter thought EPA's criteria were developed to serve non-habitat purposes, reasoning that their purpose
was to remove organisms 
from risk of mortality at the pumps. Another commenter thought flow, 
rather than salinity or the location of the entrapment zone, was a more 
appropriate parameter to protect the western Delta and Suisun Marsh. A 
commenter at the public hearings believed the Service should not have 
selected such a strict standard of salinity (2 ppt) for the delta 
smelt's critical habitat.



Service Response: 

The Service does not adopt EPA's water quality 
standards in the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt. 
The Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent 
element to protect and recover the delta smelt. This point is described 
in detail in comment 27, below, and is clarified in the section entitled 
``Primary Constituent Elements'' in this final rule.

The Service has considered and discussed the biological relevance of 
EPA's water quality standards. The biological relevance of providing 
ample estuarine habitat for the delta smelt was first discussed in the 
original proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in 
1991. The biological significance of salinity in the Estuary was again 
discussed in the sections entitled ``Revisions to the October 3, 1991, 
Critical Habitat Proposal'', ``Habitat Requirements'', and ``Primary 
Constituent Elements'' in the January 6, 1994, revised proposed 
designation of critical habitat. These sections discuss the habitat 
requirements of the delta smelt, the need for temporal and spatial 
variability of low-salinity waters in the Estuary, and the 
identification of primary constituent elements essential for the 
recovery of the smelt.

As the above cited discussions illustrate, EPA's water quality 
standards were developed to mimic historical habitat conditions and were 
not developed to simply serve non-habitat purposes. The standards may 
incidentally serve ``non-habitat'' purposes by removing organisms from 
risk of mortality at the pumps. This topic is discussed in this final 
rule in the ``Primary Constituent Element'' section for larval and 
juvenile transport.

Requiring flows to maintain salinity at critical locations in the 
Delta will not be ``throwing water at the problem.'' The Service has used 
the best scientific data available to prescribe conditions that will 
facilitate the recovery of the delta smelt, relying on scientific 
evidence and testimony presented during the State Board's 1992 hearing 
process, as well as information from the Service and the panel of 
scientists who participated in the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP).

In accordance with the Act and its regulations, the Service may 
refer to either flow or salinity as water quality criteria when critical 
habitat is designated for the delta smelt. Because the Act is flexible, 
the Service may accomplish recovery in a variety of ways, so long as 
listed species are recovered. With critical habitat defined, the 
Service must identify the physical and biological features essential to 
the conservation of the species, and which may require special 
management considerations or protection. A primary constituent element 
may include either water quality or water quantity. Special management 
considerations include ``any methods or procedures useful in protecting 
physical and biological features of the environment for the conservation 
of a listed species.'' (50 CFR 424.12(b); 424.02(j)).

Based on the best available information, the Service concludes that 
the criteria are necessary to protect and recover the delta smelt. 
Delta smelt are associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone, 
where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966, Moyle 

et al. 


1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In most years, the majority of the 
delta smelt population lives at salinities of less than 2 ppt for most 
of the year (Moyle 1976, Ganssle 1966).



Comment 2: 

Although several water purveyors agreed with EPA that 
there is a relationship between the average position of the 2 ppt 
isohaline and the health of the Estuary, they believed that the Roe 
Island criterion was too protective and should be abolished. However, 
another commenter thought the water quality standards as proposed by EPA 
were not protective enough of the delta smelt (addressed in comment 7). 
Several commenters thought that requiring compliance at Roe Island may 
(1) reduce the within-year variability in hydrology in Suisun Bay, thus 
having an adverse impact on the biology of the Estuary; (2) place the 
entrapment zone too far downstream of Suisun Bay, thereby pushing 
phytoplankton and delta smelt out past Carquinez Strait into San Pablo 
Bay; and (3) either greatly benefit or adversely affect native and 
introduced estuarine species by enhancing or adversely affecting habitat 
quantity and quality.



Service Response: 

To the extent feasible, maintenance of 
near-historical water quality conditions at Roe Island is essential to 
recovery of the delta smelt. Not only is it important to maintain 
low-salinity conditions at critical locations in the Estuary depending 
on the life-stage of the delta smelt, but also to simulate year-to-year 
natural spring storm cycles so that natural processes and historical 
conditions can be mimicked in the Estuary. The water quality standards 
developed by EPA, including criteria at Roe Island, Chipps Island, and 
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, were developed to provide 
both within-year and between-year variability in salinity levels, 
characteristic of the Estuary in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This 
variability does not currently occur frequently enough in the Estuary to 
maintain estuarine processes, because the construction of water 
conveyance facilities in the Central Valley and Delta, as well as the 
operation of diversions and upstream dams, have reduced and dampened 
annual fluctuations in Delta outflow.

A low-salinity reference point at Roe Island will provide within-year and year-to-year variability essential to
maintenance of a healthy 
Estuary. Requiring salinity be maintained intermittently at Roe Island 
also will provide flows to carry juvenile fish from the Delta downstream 
to Suisun Bay, and will maximize nutrient inputs from Suisun Marsh and 
the shallows of Suisun Bay into the mixing zone. Providing periodic 
low-salinity water at Roe Island will significantly increase the total 
area of medium to low-salinity nursery habitat available for delta 
smelt. Spring storm events are also beneficial to aquatic resources of 
the Estuary, providing areas of flooded vegetation for the spawning of 
some estuarine species.

Moreover, the 2 ppt isohaline is needed sporadically at Roe Island 
to mimic seasonal variability of Delta flow to deter the invasion of 
introduced species. The lack of seasonal and yearly variability of 
Delta outflows has contributed to the invasions of introduced species. 
Because variable salinity is one of the dominant features of an estuary, 
ensuring natural variability in the Estuary can only benefit native 
estuarine species.

Providing low-salinity water at the Roe Island historical reference point will not put the mixing zone too far downstream
into the Carquinez Strait. Conversely, completely abolishing the Roe Island reference point and relying exclusively
on the Chipps Island and Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence locations may leave an important area in the western-most
portion of Suisun Bay (which is included in critical habitat) outside the mixing zone (CCCWA/EDF 1987). The western
portion of Suisun Bay is important habitat for the delta smelt. Delta smelt were most abundant at the Western Suisun
Bay and Carquinez Strait sampling sites in the San Francisco Bay-Outflow Study in the years 1980-1988 (Stevens


et al. 

1990). Apart from the ship channel, the southwestern portion of Suisun Bay contains expansive shoal areas that are
less than 2 meters deep (Mortensen 1987). The best survival and growth of delta smelt larvae occur when optimum conditions
in the mixing zone occupy a large area that includes extensive shoal regions containing suitable rearing substrates
within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters).
Moreover, because the Roe Island historic reference point was developed to mimic historical conditions in the Estuary,
requiring periodic low-saline waters at that location will not be an abnormal occurrence. Historically, delta smelt
have been flushed out into the Carquinez Strait and into Suisun Bay in high flow years, similar to what occurred in 1983
and 1993. The delta smelt is adapted to living in the Estuary, where salinity varies spatially and temporally according
to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. Nonetheless, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively
constant suitable habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the entrapment
zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 1993).
The Service does not believe EPA's Roe Island salinity criteria would be detrimental to native estuarine species.
A qualitative and graphic analysis of habitat preferences for Estuary species (including eggs and larvae, juveniles,
adults and spawning adults life stages) presented by a commenter which predicted that EPA's salinity criteria at
Roe Island would put some species at risk or greatly benefit others was overly broad and too simplistic. The commenter
included introduced species (e.g., inland silverside 

Menidia beryllina, 

threadfin shad 

Dorosoma petenese

) and marine species (e.g., several surfperches, English sole 

Parophrys vetulis

) in the analysis. Its analysis did not give any preference to species having protected status, or to species that rely
solely on estuarine habitat. Freshwater, marine and estuarine-dependent species were treated equally. The analysis
described habitat in terms of salinity alone, when other measures of habitat, such as temperature, turbidity, and
depth, are important for some estuarine-dependent species. Since the quantity of habitat available for a species
was described only by river kilometer, complex bathymetry was ignored in the investigation. The Service does not
intend to benefit or recover species outside the Estuary, nor does it intend to protect introduced estuarine species.
To comply with the Act, the Service must promote the recovery of the delta smelt. Impeding the establishment and success
of introduced species, and providing suitable habitat for delta smelt, are significant and complementary components
to recovering the species. The Service does not foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due
to critical habitat designation for the delta smelt. The Service expects the opposite to occur and has evaluated the
impacts of EPA's water quality standards through section 7 consultations.


Comment 3: 

One commenter thought the Roe Island criteria would not benefit the delta smelt because the relationship between
the 2 ppt isohaline location and the abundance indices of delta smelt become uncertain as the entrapment zone moves
downstream from Chipps Island.


Service Response: 

The Service need not show statistical significance between the location of the mixing zone and fishery abundance
to include variable, low-salinity habitat as a primary constituent element. Under the Act, the Service must base
a critical habitat designation on the best scientific information available. A statistical correlation between
a primary constituent element and its effect on species recovery is not required. The complexity of the Delta ecosystem
and the numerous factors contributing in time and space to the species' decline make it highly unlikely that any one
factor would show a direct correlation with its potential recovery.

Comment 4:

 One commenter thought the Roe Island salinity criteria would have significant impacts on carryover storage in the
Sacramento River Basin since meeting those criteria would account for a large portion of carryover storage, and consequently,
affect winter-run salmon temperature requirements.



Service Response:

 The Service is addressing, in recovery planning efforts and in section 7 consultations, the concern that compliance
with Roe Island criteria will cause reductions in carryover storage in upstream reservoirs. Recovery planning recommendations
for winter-run chinook salmon will be included in the delta smelt recovery plan process through coordination of the
respective recovery teams for these species. Section 7 consultations will address any competing needs for winter-run
storage in Shasta Reservoir.



Comment 5:

 One commenter thought that the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project reservoirs located upstream of
the Delta lacked the capacity to release enough controlled outflow to regulate salinity at Roe Island on a continuous
basis, when recreational safety, flooding, travel time and upstream riparian right constraints are taken into account.



Service Response:

 The Service notes the isohaline need not be located at Roe Island on a continuous basis, since EPA's Roe Island standard
is triggered only when uncontrolled runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. The SWP and CVP reservoirs
have the capacity to release outflow to meet the Roe Island criteria once the criteria are triggered.



Comment 6:

 One commenter believed sampling biases and temporal and spatial variability in the data can be factors that distort
or confound the abundance indices used to support the EPA's water quality standards.



Service Response:

 The Service addressed the concerns regarding data bias in the final rule to list the delta smelt as a threatened species
(58 FR 12856), noting that the Service is obliged under the Act to use the best available scientific and commercial
information in making a listing determination. The Service also must use the best available information in designating
critical habitat, and must take into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying
any particular area as critical habitat (section 4(b)(2)).



Comment 7:

 One commenter thought the salinity standards as proposed by the EPA were not protective enough of the delta smelt,
and recommended that_(1) additional days be added to the Roe Island standard in below normal to critically dry years
to buffer against years when storm flows or reservoir releases place the 2 ppt isohaline at Roe Island for the first
time late in the year, (2) a stipulation be added for an eleventh-hour invocation'' of the 2 ppt standard if it appears
that the 2 ppt requirement will fail to be invoked at all, and (3) the Service include a Middle Ground standard in addition
to the Roe Island standard, having the Middle Ground standard implemented independently of any type of trigger or
stipulation. The commenter thought water quality criteria at Middle Ground were necessary not only to provide rearing
habitat immediately west of Chipps Island (since habitat in that area is positively correlated with delta smelt abundance),
but also would allow delta smelt to access the expansive shoals of Grizzly Bay through Honker Bay. Another commenter
worried that simply reproducing historic habitat conditions would not be sufficient to recover the delta smelt.



Service Response:

 The Service believes that EPA's water quality standards, as proposed, will afford protection and promote recovery
of the delta smelt. Adding additional independent (i.e., no trigger) criteria at Middle Ground location (between
Roe Island and Chipps Island) would defeat the purpose of the Roe Island standard by dampening any variability in the
yearly pattern of outflow as discussed in the preceding response.

Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should identify
areas that may be needed for a species' recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat is designated at the
time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know exactly what may be needed for recovery. In this regard,
critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. The Service will address the cause(s)
and remedies for delta smelt decline in the recovery planning process and in future section 7 consultations as new
information develops.

Comment 8:

 One commenter suggested a mechanism for phased compliance be developed for EPA's water quality standards. Another
commenter suggested that the standards be set aside in critically dry years until their exact utility in recovering
the delta smelt and the estuary is quantified.



Service Response:

 One of the purposes of designating critical habitat is to identify areas that may be needed for a species' recovery
and delisting so that options can be retained for the realization of this goal. The Service recognizes that the degradation
of delta smelt critical habitat has occurred over more than a century and that, as a result, it is unreasonable to expect
that recovery will be achieved in a relatively short timeframe. Please refer to ``The Effects of Critical Habitat''
section above for a detailed discussion on how the Framework Agreement (1994), the section 7(a)(1) mandate, and CVP
water contract renewals will, in essence, allow compliance with EPA's water quality standards to be phased in.

However, the Act does not permit the protections provided by critical habitat to be delayed in ways that may result
in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat, such as what may occur in drier water years. Having
threatened status under the Act means that the delta smelt is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future
throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Designating critical habitat will facilitate the recovery
(i.e., delisting) of the delta smelt, rather than allowing the species to continue declining into endangered status.

Water quality (salinity) in the Estuary has been identified by the Service as a primary constituent element essential
to the conservation of the delta smelt. A significant modification to EPA's water quality standards, or a substantial
delay or break in designating critical habitat for the delta smelt, would not only postpone recovery of the species
but could adversely impact the species. The delta smelt's pelagic life history, dependence on pelagic microzooplankton,
1-year life span, limited geographic range, and low fecundity make it susceptible to decimation if its reproductive
or larval nursery areas are disturbed for more than two years.

In formulating the basis for the economic impact analysis, the Service assumed that destruction or adverse modification
of critical habitat would not occur in any given water year, provided that Federal and State agencies and other parties
comply with flows required in biological opinions interim to the State Board's implementation of water quality standards,
and that Federal and State agencies are making satisfactory progress towards implementing recovery plan objectives.



Comment 9:

 Agricultural interests and municipal representatives making comments in the public hearings felt the designation
of critical habitat for the delta smelt and EPA's estuarine standards would cause water allocation in California
to be inflexible, especially in light of expanding municipal water needs for population growth, natural disasters
(e.g., earthquakes and fires) and expanding industry. One commenter was concerned that by designating critical
habitat for the delta smelt, construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities would be prevented.



Service Response:

 Designating critical habitat for the delta smelt will not cause water allocation in California to be inflexible.
Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to consult on actions that may affect delta smelt to ensure that their
actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. The Service provides advisory recommendations
under section 7 by consulting with other Federal agencies to identify and help resolve conflicts between listed species,
their critical habitat, and proposed actions. Management actions designed to provide protection for delta smelt
through formal consultation or the section 10 incidental take permit process can be achieved in a variety of ways by
considering a range of project alternatives or measures. The consultation and permitting processes are flexible,
designed to identify solutions on either a project-by-project or regional basis.

A critical habitat designation will not necessarily preclude the construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities.
The Service's economic analysis for designating critical habitat assumed that construction of water facilities
for future economic growth is more affected by application of the jeopardy standard, rather than critical habitat
designation. Nonetheless, these economic assumptions do not constrain the Service's review of future water project
proposals. The construction of a new Delta water conveyance facility may or may not jeopardize the continued existence
of the delta smelt, and may or may not result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat, depending
on numerous elements, including the facilities' design, location and operations criteria.



Comment 10:

 Several commenters believed that implementation of EPA's water quality standards will only remedy one factor contributing
to the delta smelt's decline. Commenters suggested that over-fishing, habitat modification, and the introduction
of toxics and heavy metals to the Estuary have contributed to the decline of the delta smelt. Numerous respondents
stated that introduced species in the Delta, such as the yellowfin goby (

Acanthogobius flavimanus

), striped bass and inland silversides are the real cause of the delta smelt's decline. Special concern was expressed
over the effects that two species of exotic zooplankton and a species of the exotic Asian clam, (

Potamocorbula amurensis

) had on the Estuary ecosystem.



Service Response:

 Regardless of other related effects, the best available information indicates that diminished water quality and
quantity are major factors contributing to the decline of the delta smelt. EPA's water quality (salinity) standards
will contribute to the recovery of the delta smelt.

Under the Act, the Service may list species and designate critical habitat even though the interaction of many causes
of the species' decline masks the relative contribution of any single factor. Critical habitat preserves options
for a species' recovery. As such, designation of critical habitat preserves habitat conditions within which implementation
of recovery actions can occur. As stated in the final rule to list the delta smelt, continuing studies may shed light
on the causes of decline, and lead to recovery or management actions that may be of benefit to the species.



Comment 11:

 One commenter was concerned that water users could comply with EPA's water quality standards early in the February-June
compliance period, hence adequate salinity would not be provided in later months if the delta smelt were to spawn late
in June or early July. The same commenter suggested that a year-round standard might be a better and more reasonable
approach.



Service Response:

 The Service generally agrees with this comment and recognized in the revised proposed rule that delta smelt may spawn
as late as July. Providing water quality (salinity) to conserve the delta smelt and its critical habitat is not limited
to a defined time period as EPA's standards are to the February through June period. As the ``Primary Constituent Elements''
section outlines, critical habitat for the delta smelt will be focused on the habitat needs of a particular life stage
that may be affected by a project. Additional flows may be required after the February through June period to protect
delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid
jeopardy to the species.



Biological Issues





Comment 12:

 One commenter suggested that the importance of habitat in Grizzly Bay and lower Suisun Bay should be weighted since
the bays are a relatively large area of high quality habitat upon which some species rely heavily.

<DOCNO> FR941219-0-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR941219-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Service Response: 

Though Grizzly Bay and lower Suisun Bay are 
important areas of delta smelt habitat, habitat conditions elsewhere in 
Suisun Bay and upstream in the Estuary are just as important for 
spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration. 
Habitat for each life stage is essential for the recovery of the species 
and is contained in this designation. 


Comment 13: 

One commenter thought additional flow requirements 
would not be needed in July or August to protect larval and juvenile 
delta smelt from being entrained in the State and Federal water projects 
since delta smelt remain in particular locations despite flow 
conditions. 


Service Response: 

The Service recognizes that juvenile and adult 
delta smelt, when given the opportunity, may remain in especially 
productive areas such as Suisun Bay, after the mixing zone has moved 
upstream. However, flows may be required in the July-August period to 
protect delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being 
entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid jeopardy to 
the species. 


Comment 14: 

One respondent noted that the distribution of delta 
smelt is not determined by flow alone. The commenter cited 1993 tow-net 
and fall midwater trawl collections that found delta smelt upstream of 
the mixing zone near Decker Island, and found delta smelt considerably 
downstream of the mixing zone in Suisun Bay. 


Service Response: 

The Service agrees that the distribution of delta 
smelt is not based exclusively on flow. When delta smelt are located in 
suitable, productive habitat, they may not travel with the mixing zone 
as it moves upstream, or downstream. After being transported to 
productive rearing habitat, delta smelt may remain and take advantage of 
safe and productive nursery areas. 
Delta smelt do not become ``trapped'' in the mixing zone, but may 
remain in particular areas. In the text of the final rule, the Service 
clarifies this point by referring to the salt and freshwater mixing area 
as the ``mixing zone,'' rather than the ``entrapment zone,'' to clear any 
misconception that delta smelt and other estuarine species are 
associated exclusively or somehow become trapped within the vertical 
circulation currents created by the saltwater-freshwater interface. 
This type of circulation pattern is important because it mixes nutrients 
from the ocean and inland areas, resulting in a productive estuarine 
ecosystem. 
The pattern of delta smelt distribution described by the commenter 
is consistent with distribution patterns in earlier years when dispersal 
of delta smelt was greater following wetter springs (Sweetnam and 
Stevens 1993). In 1993, about half the delta smelt population remained 
in Suisun Bay throughout the summer, even though the 2 ppt isohaline 
retreated upstream (Herbold 1994). 


Comment 15: 

One commenter objected to the Service's use of EPA's 
proposed water quality standards as the factual and scientific basis for 
the delta smelt's critical habitat. 


Service Response: 

The Service has not based critical habitat for 
the delta smelt on EPA's water quality standards. Space requirements 
for delta smelt population growth, cover, and shelter, as well as 
salinity, were described in detail and were included as primary 
constituent elements in the proposed rule to designate critical habitat 
for the delta smelt in 1991, well before EPA promulgated its proposed 
standards. Since 1991, the EPA and the Service have been working 
together to coordinate each agencies' actions. 


Comment 16: 

Another commenter thought the Service simply identified 
the delta smelt's entire geographic range as critical habitat without 
considering whether the designation was essential to the conservation of 
the species. Other respondents believed the Service did not distinguish 
between areas of critical habitat that are essential and nonessential 
for the conservation of the delta smelt, thereby including marginal 
areas not necessary for delta smelt recovery. 


Service Response: 

The Service agrees that critical habitat is 
limited to the specific areas within the geographic area that contain 
the physical and biological features needed by the species. As 
discussed in more detail at comment 37, below, the Service has described 
river, channel, slough and bay water habitats essential for the recovery 
of the smelt. Without these areas of habitat, the delta smelt cannot 
survive or reproduce, rear, or be transported between other suitable 
habitat areas. 
Neither the Act or its regulations requires the Service to rank or 
identify areas of habitat that are more ``essential'' than others when 
critical habitat is designated. In the ``Primary Constituent Elements''
section of this rule, the Service has specifically described the 
importance of habitat for each life stage of this annual species. 
Without adequate habitat for each of these life stages, the delta smelt 
would not survive or recover. The Service may highlight and propose 
specific management actions to protect and rehabilitate certain areas in 
the recovery planning process, such as areas in Cache Slough and the 
lower Sacramento River complex identified by one commenter. 
Finally, the Service did not simply designate critical habitat based 
on the entire geographic range of the delta smelt. At the time the 
Service expanded the critical habitat boundary in 1994, larval delta 
smelt had been located as far north as the confluence of the Sacramento 
River with the Feather River. This area was not included in the revised 
proposed critical habitat boundary. Based on recent unpublished data 
(and brought to our attention in a comment), delta smelt in these most 
upstream observations may have been misidentified as pond smelt 
(

Hypomesus nipponensis, 

or wakasagi). Portions of San Pablo Bay, the 
Napa River, and western Suisun Marsh known to support the species are 
not included in the critical habitat designation. 
In addition, California Department of Fish and Game biologists 
contacted the Service with new information that in 1993, delta smelt 
were found spawning as far upstream as Sacramento. Based on this new 
information and the importance of this spawning habitat in some years, 
the Service expanded critical habitat in the 1994 proposal to extend to 
these important areas. 


Comment 17: 

One commenter thought the Service did not identify 
areas currently occupied by the smelt. 


Service Response: 

Delta smelt presently occur throughout the range 
designated as critical habitat. Delta smelt also occur outside the 
legal boundary of the Delta, in the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and 
Mokelumne rivers. 


Comment 18: 

One respondent questioned the need for critical 
habitat, since delta smelt populations had increased seven-fold in 1993.

Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat for the delta 
smelt is justified even though the 1992 and 1993 summer tow-net and fall 
midwater trawl abundance indices show increased abundance levels. Based 
on the best available information, the delta smelt has not recovered, 
and remains vulnerable to a variety of threats. Delta smelt were listed 
as threatened because the species was likely to become an endangered 
species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant 
portion of its range. A species has recovered if the status of the 
species, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, 
indicates listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria of the Act 
(50 CFR 402.02, 424.11(d)(2)). Listing remains appropriate under the 
Act until long-term population abundance indices remain at high levels 
and the population is widespread throughout the Estuary for a number of 
years. One or two years of high abundance levels is not sufficient to 
ensure recovery of an annual species such as the delta smelt. Specific 
recovery criteria are being developed in the recovery planning process. 


Comment 19: 

Several commenters were concerned with the Service's 
``single species approach'', whereas other individuals were worried that 
EPA's water quality standards, having been based on eight estuarine 
indicator species, were too broad because species other than the delta 
smelt would benefit from the standards. There was concern how delta 
smelt recovery would be coordinated with the recovery of other 
threatened and endangered estuarine fish species (e.g., winter-run 
chinook and Sacramento splittail), the salt marsh harvest mouse 
(

Reithrodontomys raviventris

), California clapper rail (

Rallus 
longirostris obsoletus

), Suisun Marsh management in general, and with 
other species outside the Estuary area. 


Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat and identifying 
water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent element for protection 
of the delta smelt may incidentally benefit other native estuarine 
species. Providing variable salinity regimes will facilitate the 
recovery of the Estuary to its natural state. The Service does not 
foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due to 
this critical habitat designation, or due to the implementation of EPA's 
water quality standards. 
Delta smelt recovery will be coordinated with the habitat and water 
quality needs of other fish and other marsh and wetland species in the 
Estuary. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team was formed in 1993 to 
address the Estuary native fishes in general. The recovery team will 
consider the population decline of delta smelt and other native Estuary 
fishes that ultimately may require active management to restore 
sustainable populations. The recovery team has developed a draft 
Recovery Plan that has analyzed the needs and recommended management 
actions for the delta smelt, longfin smelt, Sacramento splittail, green 
sturgeon, spring-run chinook salmon, late fall-run chinook salmon and 
San Joaquin fall-run chinook salmon. Winter-run chinook salmon also was 
included in recovery planning for the delta smelt, using recommendations 
developed by the Winter-run Recovery Team. 
Federal agencies that propose projects that may affect the salt 
marsh harvest mouse and the California clapper rail, both listed as 
endangered under the State and Federal Endangered Species Acts, must 
consult with the Service under section 7 of the Federal Act. All listed 
species have equal protection under the State and Federal Acts and the 
Service cannot develop solutions for one species that may jeopardize 
other listed species. 


Comment 20: 

One commenter claimed that the Service misrepresented 
Moyle 

et al. 

(1992) by stating that delta smelt grow faster in the 
mixing zone. 


Service Response: 

The Service is puzzled by the assertion that 
Moyle 

et al. 

(1992) was misrepresented in the revised proposed rule for 
delta smelt critical habitat. The Service stated: ``[w]hen the 
entrapment zone is located in a broad geographic area with extensive 
shallow-water habitat within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 
meters), high densities of phytoplankton and zooplankton are produced 
(Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval and juvenile fish, 
including delta smelt, grow rapidly.'' (Moyle 

et al. 

1992, Sweetnam and 
Stevens 1993). 
Moyle 

et al. 

(1992) stated ``[T]he mixing currents keep the larvae 
circulating with the abundant zooplankton also found here [in the mixing 
zone] (Orsi and Knutson 1979; Siegfried 

et al

. 1979; Stevens 

et al

. 
1985). Growth is rapid, and the juvenile fish are 40-50 mm fork length 
(FL) by early August [citations omitted].''

Sweetnam and Stevens (1993) stated ``[D]elta smelt are fast growing 
and short lived (Moyle 1976) * * * The majority of growth is within the 
first 7 to 9 months of life * * *.'' 
The purpose of the paragraph written by the Service and pointed out 
by the commenter was to illustrate estuarine productivity, while 
explaining the dynamics of the Estuary's mixing zone and the delta 
smelt's association with the mixing zone. The Service has not knowingly 
misrepresented information, and does not believe any misrepresentation 
occurred in this instance. 


Comment 21: 

One respondent commented that delta smelt spawn north 
of Suisun Bay in Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough and their tributaries, 
and believed this fact contradicted the Service's assertion that delta 
smelt spawn upstream of the mixing zone. 


Service Response: 

Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough, and their 
tributaries are upstream of the area where mixing between freshwater and 
salt water occurs in wetter water years. In dryer water years, the 
entrapment zone may move upstream as far upstream as the City of 
Sacramento in late summer, and these sloughs may become saline. If 
delta smelt were to spawn late (i.e., July or August), they would 
probably seek areas other than the sloughs to spawn in freshwater. 


Comment 22: 

Several commenters at the public hearings suggested 
that the Service use hatcheries to produce enough delta smelt to make 
the population stable. 


Service Response: 

The Service believes using hatcheries to 
propagate fish, including delta smelt, should not be a substitute for 
habitat protection and restoration. Dr. Moyle presented testimony in 
1992 (Natural Heritage Institute 1992) summarizing the work of Hilborn 
(1992), which explained several reasons why hatcheries are not 
beneficial to the long-term maintenance of fisheries. His points 
included (1) though initially successful, hatchery effectiveness 
decreases after a few years; (2) hatchery fish often do poorly in the 
wild; (3) artificial production poses a threat to the maintenance of 
wild fish; (4) hatchery fish dilute the naturally adapted genes of wild 
fish; and (5) hatcheries provide an excuse for habitat loss. Assuming 
hatcheries could be used to stabilize delta smelt populations, 
propagated fish would require an environment that provides ample food, 
low levels of toxic compounds, and low entrainment losses (Moyle and 
Herbold 1989). Reliance on hatcheries would not adhere to one of the 
primary purposes of the Act, which is to conserve the ecosystem(s) upon 
which listed species depend (16 USC 1531(b)). 


Comment 23: 

One commenter asked why the Service stated that delta 
smelt are more likely to be entrained in river channels than when 
downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, when there is 
no relationship between salvage and subsequent delta smelt abundance. 
The commenter noted that entrainment also occurs in Pacific Gas and 
Electric (PG & E) cooling water diversions downstream from the 
confluence of the two rivers.

Service Response: 

DWR (1994) states that Federal and State pumps 
entrain delta smelt. A relationship has been found between the number 
of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both 
the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (DWR 1994). 
Whether or not there is a statistical relationship between the number of 
delta smelt entrained at the State and Federal water project pumps and 
subsequent delta smelt abundance, water quality (salinity) is essential 
to the conservation of the delta smelt. Adequate salinity and flow 
provide the delta smelt with suitable habitat for all life stages, and 
will transport delta smelt away from major points of entrainment. The 
Service recognizes and has stated in previous rules that delta smelt are 
taken downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence in 
numerous agricultural, municipal and industrial diversions. Delta smelt 
are also taken upstream from the confluence in numerous (over one-thousand) agricultural diversions. 


Comment 24: 

One commenter thought the Montezuma Slough Control 
Structure might aid, rather than interfere, with the distribution of 
delta smelt within Suisun Marsh. 


Service Response: 

Based on the best available evidence, the Service 
maintains that operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure may 
result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. 
The Service is required by section 4(b)(8) of the Act to identify public 
or private activities that 

may

 result in destruction or adverse 
modification of critical habitat, and does so in the context of this 
rulemaking. Even though optimal operation of the Montezuma Slough 
Control Structure may provide valuable habitat to delta smelt, its 
operation for other purposes may interfere with the distribution of 
delta smelt to spawning and rearing habitat within Suisun Marsh. The 
effects of the salinity control structure on delta smelt are currently 
being investigated by the DWR, in coordination with the Bureau. 



Social Issues 





Comment 25: 

Some respondents believe humans are the real endangered 
species, and that neither delta smelt nor any other animal species 
should be considered more important than humans. Similarly, one 
commenter thought humans could survive just fine without delta smelt, 
but could not survive without farmers. 


Service Response: 

The Act recognizes that species of fish, 
wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, 
historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its 
people (section 2(a)(3)). Delta smelt possess these attributes. The 
delta smelt is the only smelt endemic to California and one of only two 
native estuarine smelt species (the other being longfin smelt) found in 
the Estuary. 
The purpose of the Act is to protect species in danger of becoming 
extinct in the immediate or foreseeable future. Humans are not in such 
danger. The number of humans has increased in the last century at a 
rapid rate. As pointed out in a report submitted by one commenter, 
total farm-related employment (agricultural services, food 
manufacturers, and agricultural chemicals) increased between 1977 and 
1989 (Carter and Goldman 1992). Agricultural services provided 89,908 
jobs in California in 1989, adding some 45,000 jobs and more than 4,000 
agricultural firms in 12 years. 


Comment 26: 

Congressman Gary Condit and several other commenters 
thought the critical habitat proposal failed to account for the human 
element involved, especially the ``[E]ffect and toil of thousands of 
human hands and hearts to provide healthy and wholesome food for the 
United States and throughout the world''. 


Service Response: 

As required by the Act, the Service has 
adequately accounted for the ``human element'' by analyzing the economic 
impacts of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt. The draft 
economic analysis has been revised in response to public comments, in 
response to discussions held at five workshops sponsored by the EPA, and 
in light of additional research to better portray the economic reality 
of the critical habitat designation.

Procedural and Legal Issues 




Comment 27: 

One commenter was concerned that efforts by the Federal 
agencies to manage the Bay/Delta were uncoordinated. On the other hand, 
one commenter presumed that the Service adopted EPA's water quality 
standards wholesale, and thought the Service had no authority to do so 
because the Service designates critical habitat under the narrow 
purposes of the Act, while the EPA promulgates water quality standards 
under the framework of the Clean Water Act. Similarly, another 
commenter thought the Service would, in effect, be interposing or 
substituting EPA's regulatory judgment for its own if the Service 
incorporated EPA's water quality standards in its designation of 
critical habitat. 


Service Response: 

This final rule does not incorporate EPA's water 
quality standards 

per se

, although implementation of these standards may 
be a means to promote recovery of the delta smelt. The January 6, 1994, 
revised critical habitat proposal for the delta smelt included a list of 
habitat conditions and a description of water quality primary 
constituent elements. These elements were developed in accordance with 
the requirements of the Act and its regulations. The Service's proposal 
also reflects the coordinated approach provided by the Club Fed process. 
The Service participated with the Bureau, NMFS, and EPA in guaranteeing 
that the January 6, 1994, critical habitat and water quality proposals 
were based on the best available scientific and technical information. 
Another priority was for the proposals to take into account the goals 
and concerns of the agencies and public and private interests affected 
by the agencies' programs and activities. 
The preservation of rare and endangered species is a substantive 
link between the proposals of the Service and the EPA. The EPA 
promulgated the Bay/Delta standards because they disapproved provisions 
of the 1991 Bay/Delta plan developed by the State Board. The EPA 
determined that the State had not adopted criteria sufficient to protect 
designated uses of the Estuary, including the ``Preserv[ing] Rare and 
Endangered Species'' designated use. Similarly, in discussing the 
``Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions,'' the 
Service wrote_``* * * [T]he Clean Water Act requires protection of the 
most sensitive use within each category of designated uses. `Protection 
of Endangered and Threatened Species' is considered a designated use 
within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing 
under the Endangered Species Act provides one method to identify the 
most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body.'' (59 FR 
854). 
Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and 
the salinity criteria that constituted EPA's proposed water quality 
standards are directly related. ``* * * EPA's proposed water quality 
standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June 
and, therefore, address both critical habitat requirements for delta 
smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species 
that rely on estuarine habitat.'' (59 FR 854) Based on the common legal 
and biological underpinnings of the critical habitat designation and the 
proposed water quality standards, the Service's treatment of salinity as 
a primary constituent element and the textual references to the proposed 
salinity standards were appropriate and fully consistent with the goal 
of assuring substantive consistency between the two proposals.

Because the designation of critical habitat and EPA's proposed 
Bay/Delta standards have common elements, the critical habitat 
designation must address the standards, and, at a minimum, must not be 
inconsistent with them, and vice versa. The January 6, 1994, critical 
habitat proposal did not incorporate specific salinity standards into 
the regulatory designation of habitat, as was the case with the initial 
critical habitat proposal published in 1991. Rather, the 1994 proposal 
designated water quality as a primary constituent element, stating_``salinity concentrations [as] required to
maintain delta smelt habitat 
for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult 
migration.''
The coordinated Federal effort and the substantive consistency of 
the EPA and Service proposals are a direct reflection of the agencies' 
intent to address Bay/Delta issues in an effective and responsible 
manner. The coordinated Club Fed process is intended to address 
concerns expressed by the State of California of a perceived lack of 
coordination among the Federal agencies.

Comment 28: 

One commenter thought designation of critical habitat was not prudent at this time, since critical habitat would
not provide the delta smelt any more protection than the listing of the species had already provided. Another commenter
thought designating critical habitat at the present time would interfere with the delta smelt recovery planning
process.



Service Response: 

Designation of critical habitat is prudent at this time because the designation will provide substantive benefits
to the delta smelt beyond those already resulting from its status as a threatened species. Critical habitat serves
to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. A critical habitat designation contributes to species conservation
primarily by identifying important geographic areas, and by describing the features within the areas that are essential
to the species. The designation puts public and private entities on notice that the area is important habitat. Section
7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy
or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This section requires parties to consult with the Service to avoid
jeopardy and destruction or adverse modification to important habitat areas.

A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to Federal agencies as to when consultation under
section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals
of the listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present).
The critical habitat designation, describing the essential physical or biological features of the habitat, also
assists parties in determining which activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 consultation
(i.e., activities that may affect primary constituent elements of the designated area).

Designating critical habitat also assists private, State, and Federal agencies in planning future actions, since
the designation establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations
and section 10 incidental take activities. With the designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between
projects and endangered or threatened species can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning
process.

Designating critical habitat will not interfere with recovery planning efforts now in progress. A recovery plan
would be prepared for the delta smelt pursuant to the Act whether or not critical habitat was designated for the species.



Comment 29: 

One commenter thought Club Fed could not restore natural resources to levels existing during times of significantly
fewer people under current California law. Another respondent believed the Service may not refer to EPA's water quality
standards because the estuarine standards are based on historical conditions, rather than on ``existing conditions''
now occurring in the Estuary. The respondent claims there is a temporal element in the definition of critical habitat,
stating that critical habitat is defined in the Act in terms of existing conditions, and the Service must look to specific
areas which contain physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the species at the time it is
listed. The commenter went on to say that critical habitat may only consist of those areas that currently contain essential
physical and biological features.



Service Response: 

The definition of critical habitat does not require that all primary constituent elements necessarily be conditions
existing at the time critical habitat is designated. Conditions existing historically in the Estuary are required
to recover the delta smelt. Conditions now occurring in the Estuary have resulted in the decline of the delta smelt
population, because the Estuary currently does not contain all of the physical and biological features (e.g., habitat
requirements and salinity) necessary for each of the species' life stages. Critical habitat for the delta smelt identifies
areas needed to conserve the species, so it may recover and, ultimately, be delisted. In order to accomplish recovery,
it is necessary that critical habitat encompass conditions that are superior to existing conditions, so that all
of the physical and biological features necessary for the delta smelt are present in the Estuary. The Delta Native
Fishes Recovery Team has identified 1968 as a time when the Estuary had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would
allow recovery of the delta smelt. An interagency Statement of Principles (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian,


in litt.

 1992) among the Service, NMFS and EPA have found that the Estuary ecosystem and its anadromous and resident fisheries
were relatively healthy during the years between 1960-1970. The Service recognizes no significant conflict
with managing toward historic conditions for all primary constituent elements as a conservation strategy for the
delta smelt.

The Service notes that the 1994 revised proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt contains the physical and biological
features essential for the conservation of the delta smelt. Using equations developed by Kimmerer and Monismith
(1992) to calculate salinity, DWR (1993) determined that the isohaline was located downstream of the Roe Island historic
reference point 124 days, and was between Roe Island and Chipps Island habitat 14 days between February 1 and June 31
in 1993 (DWR 1993). Therefore, conditions for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration
was, in fact, available for all life stages as recently as 1993. However, these physical and biological features do
not occur frequently enough, and are not protected during critical periods in February through June, especially
in drier water years. The mixing zone was pushed out beyond Roe Island during this period because 1993 was a wet year.
Water quality criteria are necessary to ensure habitat suitable for the delta smelt are available at critical times
in all water-year types.



Comment 30: 

The Service did not identify a plan, any directives, or a goal to ensure that delta smelt are protected, or to indicate
when the species is recovered.

Service Response: 

A critical habitat designation need not, and should not, include specific management plans or recovery goals. Designating
critical habitat for a species does not result in a management or recovery plan. Critical habitat simply identifies
areas where conservation efforts should be concentrated. Designating critical habitat alone will not dictate how
the delta smelt should be protected, nor will it require identification of goals to measure the success of the designation.
Plans, goals, and directives will be identified and set in motion during the recovery planning process. Section 4(f)(1)
of the Act specifies what should be included in a recovery plan. Criteria for downlisting or delisting are contained
in recovery plans, which function as goals to achieve species conservation. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team
has developed a draft Recovery Plan for the delta smelt and other estuarine fish species, and will include recovery
and delisting criteria for the delta smelt. The public will have the opportunity to comment on a draft delta smelt Recovery
Plan before it is approved as a final plan as required by section 4(f)(4) of the Act.



Comment 31: 

Senator Phil Wyman and The California Farm Bureau were disappointed with the quality of the public hearings held in
Fresno because only the Service and the EPA attended the meeting to hear testimony and answer questions. The Senator
and the Farm Bureau believed the Bureau and NMFS should have been at the hearing, since the issues involved ``Club Fed''.
Moreover, several of the participants in Fresno felt the hearings were simply a ``going-through-the-motions''
exercise.



Service Response: 

Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires the Service to hold a public hearing if one is requested within 45 days of the
publication of a proposed rule. The Service received such a request, and held hearings in Fresno, Irvine, Sacramento,
and San Francisco to accept public comment on two proposals by the Service and on one proposal by EPA_the proposed critical
habitat designation for the delta smelt, listing of the Sacramento splittail, and Bay/Delta water quality standards.

The hearings are not a ``going-through-the-motions'' event. Service staff review all oral comments presented at
the public hearings from the hearing transcripts. Oral comments are given the same weight and consideration as are
comments submitted in written form.



Comment 32: 

Many commenters thought the Service should prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) required by NEPA, to
comply with the holding in 

Douglas County 

v. 

Lujan. 

These commenters thought the Service should assess the environmental and social impacts that may occur in or near
the Estuary, and outside the Estuary area as a result of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt. Commenters
identified potential environmental impacts, including groundwater overdraft and subsequent land subsidence,
sagging canals and leaking rivers, fugitive dust, warming of reservoir water, impacts on regional water quality
control plans, increased energy use, impacts on listed and candidate species, loss of water for wetlands, loss of
open-space habitat provided by farms, and impacts on regional recreational use at reservoirs.



Service Response: 

The decision in 

Pacific Legal Foundation 

v. 

Andrus 

(657 F.2d 829) held that an EIS is not required for listings under the Act. The decision noted that preparing an EIS on
listing actions does not further the goals of NEPA or the Act. The Service believes that, under the reasoning of this
decision, preparing an EIS for the delta smelt critical habitat designation would not further the goals of NEPA, or
the Act, and is not legally required.

The United States District Court for the District of Oregon in 

Douglas County 

v. 

Lujan 

held that critical habitat designations should be analyzed under NEPA. However, the decision is stayed pending appeal
to the Ninth Circuit.

In addition, see the discussion in this rule respecting NEPA compliance.



Comment 33: 

One commenter thinks the Service violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) because it relied on scientific
information developed by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP) in developing the revised critical habitat designation.



Service Response: 

Section 4(b)(2) of the Act specifies that ``The Secretary shall designate critical habitat * * * on
the basis of the best scientific data available * * *.'' When the Service identifies critical habitat,
it relies on scientific data in published literature, data gathered as a result of status reviews, data received during
the public comment periods, and information communicated in conversations with biologists, economists and other
specialists. A summary of the findings of the SFEP (1993) was included in the body of information that the Service used
to revise the proposed rule to designate critical habitat.

Critical habitat for the smelt was first proposed in October, 1991. The Service revised the critical habitat boundaries
in 1994, relying on the best scientific information available from California Department of Fish and Game biologists,
Service biologists, and new scientific information received during the public comment period from the EPA and other
commenters. Included in this information were the findings and recommendations of the SFEP.

Had the Service not used SFEP information, the Service would not have complied with section 4(b)(2) of the Act, which
requires use of the best scientific evidence available. SFEP was created in 1988 as part of EPA's National Estuary
Program. The SFEP is an Environmental Management Program of EPA, the State of California and the Association of Bay
Area Governments. The Service has participated in the SFEP extensively over the past several years. The SFEP developed
recommendations for estuarine standards, and complied with FACA when they conducted workshops and meetings, and
when they chose participants to work on the standards.

Comment 34: 

One commenter thought the critical habitat designation 
is defective since the data supporting the expansion of critical habitat 
for the delta smelt was based on personal communications not available 
for the public review. 


Service Response: 

The Service relied on information that has been 
available to the public by contacting the California Department of Fish 
and Game, EPA or the Service. The administrative record for the 
critical habitat designation is and has been available for public 
inspection since publication of the initial proposed rule in 1991. 


Comment 35: 

One commenter urged the Service and the EPA to exhaust 
all possible remedies to recover the delta smelt (e.g., by using the 
Delta Protection Act) before more burdens were placed on California's 
water users with the designation of critical habitat. 


Service Response: 

Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.12, the Service must 
designate critical habitat unless it is not prudent to do so. The 
Service has not concluded that it is not prudent to designate critical 
habitat. Further, critical habitat is determinable. Therefore, the 
requirement at section 4(b)(6)(c)(ii) to publish a final designation by 
not more that one year after listing applies. 


Comment 36: 

One commenter felt the proposed critical habitat 
designation should be withdrawn since the Service did not comply with 
the statutory time period for designating critical habitat for the delta 
smelt. The commenter cited 

Idaho Farm Bureau Federation

 v. 

Babbitt, 

839 
F.Supp. 739 (D. Idaho 1993) to support its contention. 


Service Response: 

In this rulemaking, the Service first proposed 
critical habitat for the delta smelt in 1991. It revised its proposal 
in 1994 after public comment indicated that the Service had not included 
important spawning habitat for the species. These facts are 
significantly different from those of the case cited by the commenter. 
As such, the Service does not apply the holding in that case to this 
rulemaking effort. 


Comment 37: 

One commenter thought measures implemented in the past 
to protect delta smelt habitat be given a ``credit'' in any future section 
7 consultation or section 10 determination with the Service. 


Service Response: 

Under sections 7 and 10 of the Act, the Service 
assesses the merits of project proposals on a case-by-case basis. In a 
formal section 7 consultation, the Service evaluates the effects of an 
action, creating an environmental baseline (50 CFR 402.14(g)(3)). This 
baseline includes the past and present impacts of all Federal, State, or 
private actions and other human activities in the action area, the 
anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in the action area 
that have already undergone formal or early section 7 consultation, and 
the impact of State or private actions which are contemporaneous with 
the consultation in process (50 CFR 402.02). Conservation actions 
proposed by project proponents can be considered as suitable measures to 
reduce the impact of incidental take, or otherwise reduce, mitigate, and 
compensate for project effects. 


Economic Issues 




Comment 38: 

Many commenters thought the economic analysis prepared 
for the Service by the EPA was inadequate. 


Service Response: 

The economic analysis is described and its 
results are summarized in this final rule. The Service believes the 
economic analysis is sufficient in that it adequately and appropriately 
identifies costs of designating critical habitat. As such, it enables 
the Secretary to exclude areas from critical habitat designation if the 
benefits of an exclusion are found to outweigh the benefits of including 
an area as critical habitat. 


Comment 39: 

Several commenters accused the Service of incorrectly 
minimizing the economic impacts in the delta smelt critical habitat 
designation since the impacts associated with the critical habitat 
designation were separated from the economic impacts attributable to the 
listing of the species. 


Service Response: 

Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service 
to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of designating 
critical habitat. It does not direct the Service to assess the economic 
impacts of both listing the species and designating its critical 
habitat. Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act explicitly precludes the Service 
from considering the economic impacts of listing a species as threatened 
or endangered. The congressional intent behind inclusion of this 
statutory provision was to ensure that only relevant biological criteria 
are used to assess the ecological status of a species. 
The 1994 revised proposed critical habitat designation for the delta 
smelt explained the economic impacts attributable to listing and to 
critical habitat designation. Subsequent to listing and prior to this 
final critical habitat designation, protective measures for the delta 
smelt (e.g., as provided through section 7 consultation with the Bureau) 
have been in place and created economic impacts not associated with 
critical habitat designation. In a comprehensive economic analysis 
prepared by the EPA and other economists for the Service, the economic 
impacts attributed to designating critical habitat have been evaluated. 
The Service has not limited the examination of economic impacts so as to 
minimize the economic effects of designating critical habitat. 


Comment 40: 

One commenter thought that the Service could not begin 
to define critical habitat until it fully considered the economic 
impacts of the designation. The commenter thought a proposed rule for 
critical habitat could not be drafted until an economic analysis was 
conducted, and an opportunity to comment on the analysis was provided to 
interested parties. Another commenter thought the public should be able 
to comment on a revised critical habitat designation in the event the 
Secretary excludes portions of habitat which were included in the 
revised proposed rule.

Service Response: 

The Service has not defined critical habitat 
prematurely for the delta smelt because the Act does not require 
completion of an economic analysis before the Service can propose 
critical habitat areas. In a critical habitat rulemaking conducted in 
accordance with the Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the 
Service defines and proposes critical habitat boundaries, conducts an 
economic impact analysis, takes public comment on the proposed critical 
habitat designation and the economic analysis, makes exclusions, if any, 
to critical habitat boundaries, and promulgates a final rule. The 
Secretary, through the Service, has the discretion to exclude critical 
habitat areas based on economics, in accordance with the section 4(b)(2) 
standard. The section allows the Secretary to exclude any area from 
critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion 
outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of critical 
habitat, provided that exclusion will not result in extinction of a 
species. The Service has properly conducted critical habitat rulemaking 
for the delta smelt. 
Neither the Act, nor its regulations, require the Service to allow 
public comment on revised critical habitat designations where the 
Secretary has excluded areas of proposed critical habitat. The standard 
rulemaking process requires preparation of a proposed rule followed by a 
final rule. Publishing a draft final rule is not required. The Service 
acknowledges that the public was allowed to comment in the above 
described manner in the critical habitat designation for the Northern 
Spotted Owl, however, the opportunity for public comment was a policy 
decision made specifically for that rulemaking and is not required by 
law. 
The Service has provided ample opportunity for the public to comment 
on the delta smelt critical habitat designation proposals and on the 
economic analysis during prescribed comment periods from October 3 to 
February 3, 1992; March 16 to April 30, 1993, and again from January 27 
to March 11, 1994. Four public hearings also were held to solicit 
comments on the revised proposed critical habitat designation. 


Comment 41: 

One commenter thought the critical habitat designation 
was flawed since the economic analysis could not properly analyze 
economic impacts likely to arise from the proposed designation, because 
the Service failed to present any focused or concrete indication of what 
specific management measures would be pursued. The commenter thought 
the public was not able to effectively comment on the critical habitat 
designation due to this inadequacy. 


Service Response: 

Designating critical habitat does not result in a 
management plan. Specific management measures are identified in a draft 
Recovery Plan that currently is being prepared by the Service, and need 
not be identified in a proposed critical habitat designation. 
As described in the above comment, the Service believes the public 
was given an opportunity to effectively comment on the critical habitat 
designation and the draft economic analysis. The draft RIA was 
available for review and provided sufficient detail so that the public 
could provide meaningful comments. 


Comment 42: 

One commenter believes the critical habitat designation 
is deficient because the Service failed to analyze the potential 
economic impacts of any particular portion of the Delta. 


Service Response: 

Section 4 of the Act requires the Secretary to 
take into consideration ``The economic impact * * * of specifying any 
particular area as critical habitat.'' The Service may exclude any area 
from critical habitat if it is determined that the benefits of such 
exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of 
critical habitat, unless failure to designate such area will result in 
the extinction of the species. 
The Service believes it has adequately analyzed the potential 
economic impacts of the Estuary ``area.'' The Act does not require an 
agency to analyze potential economic impacts for any specific or 
particular ``area.'' An ``area'' is not limited to particular reaches of a 
river, or particular areas of a species' habitat. 


Comment 43: 

The Department of the Army thought the Service did not 
sufficiently analyze the economic impacts of designating critical 
habitat, and did not include adequate economic data. They thought the 
Service should have included channel dredging activities and the 
maintenance of flood control levees in the economic analysis, including 
the economic impacts of potential failure and flooding since maintenance 
might be limited due to critical habitat designation. 


Service Response: 

The Service believes the economic impacts of 
designating critical habitat have been sufficiently addressed, and 
include discussion of dredging and levee maintenance. As discussed in 
the final rule to list the delta smelt, and in the revised proposed rule 
to designate critical habitat for the species, the Service determined 
that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with deep 
water navigation channel dredging were attributable to the jeopardy 
standard imposed by the listing of the delta smelt as a threatened 
species. Hence, the economic impacts of these activities can not be 
associated with designating critical habitat. 
The Service did determine that levee maintenance may adversely 
modify critical habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the delta 
smelt. The economic impacts of restrictions associated with the 
construction and implementation of these projects have been analyzed to 
determine the economic cost or benefit of critical habitat designation. 
Properly scheduling maintenance and construction activities to avoid 
periods critical to a species can allow projects to go forward without 
incurring large economic impacts.

The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment and/or 
an Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in 
connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. 
A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was 
published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). 



Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
The Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rule 
will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of 
small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et 
seq.

). Based on the information discussed in this rule, significant 
economic impacts will not result from the critical habitat designation. 
Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or 
recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this 
designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements 
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 



Takings Implications Assessment 



The Service has analyzed the potential takings implications of 
designating critical habitat for the delta smelt in a Takings 
Implications Assessment prepared pursuant to requirements of Executive 
Order 12630, ``Governmental Actions and Interference with 
Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' The Takings Implications 
Assessment concludes that the designation does not pose significant 
takings implications.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Bluefin tuna quota transfer.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS transfers 5 metric tons (mt) of bluefin tuna from the longline-south Incidental subcategory to the longline-north
Incidental subcategory. NMFS has determined that the fisheries landing bluefin under the longline-south Incidental
subcategory will not achieve the full 1994 quota allocation. This action is being taken to extend the season for the
longline-north Incidental subcategory, which will assure additional collection of biological assessment and
monitoring data and increase the economic benefits from this fishery without contributing significantly to additional
bluefin mortality. In addition, this action will prevent waste of bluefin tuna that might otherwise be discarded
dead.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Bluefin tuna are currently leaving the fall feeding grounds in New England and migrating along the Mid-Atlantic waters,
so high incidental catches by longline vessels operating south of 34




 N. lat. are not expected to occur. After the addition of 5 mt, effective November 4, 1994 (59 FR 55821, November 9, 1994),
the longline-north Incidental subcategory has only 0.6 mt remaining of its total new allocation of 28 mt for vessels
fishing north of 34




 N. lat. Once the quota is reached for this northern subcategory, any bluefin tuna incidentally taken by longline vessels
must be discarded at sea. In order to prevent waste of bluefin tuna, which would otherwise be discarded dead, NMFS is
transferring an additional 5 mt of quota from the southern to the northern subcategory. With the addition of this 5
mt, the total annual allocation to date for the Incidental subcategory longline-north will be 33 mt. This amount should
be sufficient to account for incidental take of bluefin by the northern subcategory for the remainder of this year
while any unharvested balance for the southern subcategory will be added to the 1995 quota. After the transfer of this
5 mt, approximately 12 mt remains available in the longline-south Incidental subcategory. Based on reported catches,
bluefin taken from the southern subcategory will not exceed the 12 mt remaining of that quota.


Classification 


This action is taken under 50 CFR 285.22(i) and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule replaces the Interim Rule dated April 26, 1991, and implements the provisions of section 6 of the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Most recently, the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement
Act of 1994 provides alternate methods for disclosure of mortgage servicing history. Section 6 also sets forth procedures
regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing for any federally related mortgage loan, as defined in section 3 of RESPA
and the definition is refined in the implementing regulation for RESPA and 24 CFR 3500.2. Although RESPA was extended
by section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to subordinate liens, in this rule the Secretary
has exempted from RESPA's mortgage servicing coverage all federally related mortgage loans that are not secured
by a first lien. In addition, the Department has adopted conforming amendments to 24 CFR part 203, the FHA Single Family
Mortgage Insurance program. 


The Department is also publishing a conforming amendment to its final rule on escrow accounting procedures, published
on October 26, 1994 (59 FR 53890). This amendment will update a cross-reference in another section of part 3500 that
references enforcement of escrow accounting provisions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)), and assigned OMB control
number 2502-0458. 


Justification for Final Rulemaking_Part 203 


In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish for effect without first soliciting public comment the sections
of this rule that pertain to 24 CFR part 203, and that prior public procedure is unnecessary because those portions
of this rule merely conform part 203 to the provisions of Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974
(12 U.S.C. 2605) that have been developed through notice and comment rulemaking.

Background 



Section 941 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101-625, approved November
28, 1990) amended the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (RESPA), by adding a new
section 6, which addresses mortgage servicing requirements (i.e., the right to collect mortgage payments for principal,
interest, and any escrow account items). Section 6 (12 U.S.C. 2605) requires disclosure to certain mortgage loan
applicants of historical data regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing, as well as estimates regarding the potential
transfer of servicing pertaining to the applicant's mortgage loan and other mortgage loans. Section 6 was further
amended on April 10, 1991, by Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 102-27), to create a transition
period during which lenders and servicers would not be liable for violations of the Act. This amendment also directed
HUD to publish implementing regulations effective no later than April 20, 1991. On April 26, 1991, the Department
published an Interim Rule implementing Section 6 (56 FR 19505). That rule remains in effect until it is replaced by
this final rule. 

Section 6 requires that, at the time of application for federally related mortgage loans, applicants be given information
in a disclosure statement (hereafter called ``Servicing Disclosure Statement'') concerning the likelihood that
the servicing of their mortgage may be transferred and information regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers
of the person making the loan. Section 6 sets forth additional notice requirements at the time of a servicing transfer
(hereafter called ``Notice of Transfer'') and other rights for borrowers, and provides for the collection of damages
and costs by borrowers from servicers for noncompliance. Finally, section 6 preempts any State law or regulation
regarding notice to borrowers at the time of application or servicing transfer, as long as the lender or servicer complies
with the relevant provisions of section 6. 

HUD originally complied with the requirements to promulgate a model disclosure statement and applicant's acknowledgement
by publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

 on March 20, 1991 (56 FR 11886). These requirements were restated in an Interim Rule of April 26, 1991 (56 FR 19505).
HUD encourages persons covered by this new rule to implement its provisions earlier than its effective date. (The
Department also recently published a related rule on escrow accounting procedures under section 10 of RESPA (59 FR
53890, October 26, 1994). 



Comments on Interim Rule and Responses 



In the interim rule the Department requested comments on the provisions of the rule. The following is a summary of comments
received and HUD's position on the issues in the final rule. 



Questions Regarding Definitions 





Business day.

 There were two comments about the definition of ``business day.'' Both recommended that the definition be put in  3500.2,
so that it would apply to the entire regulation, and that it be the same definition in Regulation X and Regulation Z (Truth
in Lending). 



HUD response.

 The current RESPA rule defines a ``business day'' utilizing language conforming with the definition in Regulation
Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Section 6 of RESPA does not specifically define ``business day'', but
in certain provisions excludes public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays from references to ``days''. To assure uniform
statutory construction, as well as to continue uniformity with related Federal regulatory statutes, the Department
is applying the ``business day'' definition of the Regulation X in this rule. Therefore, business day means a day on
which the offices of the business entity are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of the entity's business
functions. If a day is not specified as a business day in this rule, the reference is to a calendar day. 



Effective date of transfer.

 There were three comments on this definition. One commenter approved of the definition because the date was pinpointed.
Another commenter disagreed and considered the date indefinite, particularly as it relates to delinquent mortgages.
The third thought the effective date of transfer should be the date the contract between the parties states that the
transfer takes place. 



HUD response.

 The term ``effective date of transfer'' is defined in Section 6 of the Act as the date on which the mortgage payment of
a borrower is first due to the transferee servicer (new servicer) pursuant to the assignment, sale, or transfer of
the servicing of the mortgage loan. The statute controls and HUD does not have discretion to consider the suggested
alternatives. 



Mortgage servicing loan.

 The Department received several comments regarding the extent and limitations of coverage under this rule. The term
``federally related mortgage loan'' was the starting point for delineating coverage and is defined in  3500.2,
subject to the exemptions in  3500.5. Pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA, at this time the Secretary has exempted
from the requirements of this rule any subordinate lien federally related mortgage loans and has excluded all open-end
lines of credit (home equity plans), whether secured by a first or subordinate lien, that are covered under the Truth
in Lending Act and Regulation Z. The penalty provisions of the Truth in Lending Act are similar to those of Section 6
of RESPA, and the error resolution section of Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.13) provides protections similar to Section
6 of RESPA. Any other federally related mortgage loan secured by a first lien and not exempted under  3500.5,
is covered by these requirements and called a ``mortgage servicing loan.'' 



Other Terms 



Four commenters asked for definitions of additional terms. One commenter suggested that ``loans made'' be distinguished
from ``loans originated'', and that ``servicing transfer'' be defined. 



HUD response.

 The terms ``loans made'' and ``loans originated'' are synonymous, but the Department agrees that consistent use
of terminology would avoid confusion and, therefore, has eliminated the term ``loans made.'' HUD considers a ``servicing
transfer'' to be a sale, assignment, or transfer of servicing to a person or legal entity other than the maker of the
loan named in the legal documents. Also, as discussed more fully later in this preamble, a servicing transfer occurs
as part of a table-funding (defined in  3500.2) between the mortgage broker, as transferor, and the funding
lender, as transferee. 



Refinancing Transactions



The Department received 18 comments relating to refinancing transactions. Seven commenters recommended that refinancing
be defined. Three commenters questioned the statutory authority for covering refinancing transactions. Since
HUD received these comments, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 amended RESPA to state specifically
that refinancing transactions are covered. A definition of refinancing was added to part 3500 in revisions published
on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505, concerning subordinate liens), and is applicable to this section. The impact of this
definition is that transactions specifically excluded from the definition of refinancing do not require new disclosures.

Questions Involving State Law Preemption


One commenter asked about the effect of Section 6 on State laws. While Section 18 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2616) sets forth
general provisions regarding preemption, Section 6 contains its own preemption provision. 
The Secretary believes that one of the significant achievements of Section 6 was the elimination of perceived difficulties
in the marketing of servicing rights for mortgage loans originated in various States. In part, Section 6 constituted
a recognition of the 

de facto

 national market for mortgages and mortgage servicing and represented an attempt to facilitate such a market by establishing
uniform standards. Therefore, Section 6 is determinative of the information required for the Servicing Disclosure
Statement and the Notice(s) of Transfer; any other similar State requirements are preempted. Other provisions of
State laws, such as those requiring additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities are not preempted
by Section 6 or this rule. If permitted under State law, such additional information may be added to a notice prepared
under this section. 


Requests for Exemption 


(1) Nine commenters requested that their institutions be exempted from providing Servicing Disclosure Statements,
either because they were not institutions that transferred servicing or because they were chartered to make certain
public purpose loans. Another commenter wanted an exemption for lenders that always transfer loans at closing; three
commenters requested an exemption for lenders that do not sell the servicing rights. 


HUD response.

 While the Secretary has the authority to create classes of exemptions under Section 19 of RESPA, no commenter advanced
a reason that would justify an exempted class. The Servicing Disclosure Statement is particularly appropriate when
a lender always transfers loans at closing. When a servicer never sells servicing rights, it can simply state that
fact. In any event, the information relating to complaint resolution must be provided, although lenders that do not
transfer servicing may incorporate this information into the HUD-1 or HUD-1A. HUD amended the Servicing
Disclosure Statement to include a sentence in the heading suggesting that a borrower save the statement if a loan is
approved and to include alternate language regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers that is allowed
under the 1994 amendments of Section 6. 
(2) In the event a lender changes its policy and begins to sell the servicing, a commenter suggested that these lenders
have to follow the rule within six months after beginning sale of servicing. 


HUD response.

 When a lender determines that it will sell servicing, the lender will be subject to the requirement that it furnish
to the borrower a 15-day Notice of Transfer. The lender may also be required to revise its Servicing Disclosure Statement
at the next calendar year revision. There is no obligation to send an amended Servicing Disclosure Statement for previously
closed loans at the time of the sale of servicing; the 15-day Notice of Transfer provides the required information.

(3) Three commenters suggested that mortgage brokers should be exempt from furnishing the Servicing Disclosure
Statement, because furnishing the Statement is the obligation of the funding lender. However, another commenter
suggested that a face-to-face meeting with the mortgage broker should satisfy the face-to-face meeting requirement
for a lender. Two other commenters stated that the time (3 business days) should begin to run after the lender receives
the written application from another party. 


HUD response.

 The general rule is that the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be provided within 3 days of receipt of the borrower's
written loan application, unless the application for credit is turned down within that time. If an application is
received by a mortgage broker that will close the loan in its own name using table funding, the table funding mortgage
broker is to provide the Servicing Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional
language in  3500.21(b)(4). Similarly, for first-lien dealer loans, the dealer should provide the Servicing
Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional language. 
(4) A commenter questioned whether a Servicing Disclosure Statement is required when the mortgage servicing function
is transferred to an affiliated entity. A question was also posited as to how to treat a circumstance when a lender had
a program that always sold servicing and another where no servicing was required. 


HUD response. 

A Notice of Transfer generally is required when there is a transfer of servicing between or to affiliates, unless there
are no substantial changes in the way the borrower makes payments (see discussion below). However, the information
regarding affiliate or subsidiary transfers is not required to be included in the statistical computations found
in the Servicing Disclosure Statement. In the interest of full disclosure, this information may be provided voluntarily;
the model format allows for this disclosure. If the lender is providing the historical data, the lender should indicate
whether the Servicing Disclosure Statement includes assignments, sales or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
When the lender has a variety of programs, some of which sell servicing and some of which do not, information may be added
to the model format to allow the servicer to describe this situation, or some variation of this situation. Further,
while the use of the acknowledgment is mandatory, the use of the model format is not, and the incorporation in a footnote
or otherwise of reasonable additional information, to describe situations that do not fit conveniently into the
format is anticipated and expected. Sample language describing other alternative situations has been included
with the model format.

(5) Several commenters discussed proposed variations to the Servicing Disclosure Statement. These variations
included permitting a lender to: (i) state its reasons for servicing or not servicing loans; (ii) identify the types
of loans it services and, by the percentages of each type of loan transferred, the types of loans it sells; and (iii)
advise the borrower of the new servicer, if any, at settlement. One commenter suggested that  3500.21(c) contain
a statement that the use of the sample language in the appendices be considered as compliance with the disclosure requirements
of that paragraph. Fifteen commenters recommended that lenders should not be required to obtain written acknowledgements
of the Servicing Disclosure Statement from loan applicants whose applications are rejected or withdrawn. One commenter
recommended that actual percentages be used rather than rounding to the nearest quartile. Commenters also requested
that HUD permit longer than 31 days to calculate the percentage after the end of the calendar year. 



HUD response. 

The elements contained in the rule and Servicing Disclosure Statement comply with the Secretary's mandate under
Section 6 of RESPA. The Secretary is required to develop a disclosure statement that would notify applicants for federally
related mortgage loans about the servicing procedures, transfer practices and requirements, and the available
complaint resolution process. In addition, the Secretary must develop an acknowledgement that the disclosure has
been read and understood, as evidenced by signatures of the applicants when such a statement appears in the application.
As in the interim rule, the Secretary has determined that is in the applicant's best interest for the signature to be
at the end of the Servicing Disclosure Statement, because this directs the applicant's attention particularly to
the servicing transfer issue. 

While the precise wording of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is left to the lender's discretion, HUD presumes
that lenders will use the sample language in developing their own forms. However, HUD will not give blanket approval
to forms that it has not seen; the lender must determine the appropriate language to make proper disclosure to the borrower.
Only the language in the model Applicant's Acknowledgement is mandatory and must be followed precisely. 

Even though the Department believes that most lenders will use the simpler alternative language allowed by the Riegle
Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-325, approved September 23, 1994),
the Department has adopted the suggestion of permitting a longer time for computation of the previous year's percentages.
The final rule allows the lender to calculate the percentages no later than the end of the first quartile in the next
calendar year (March 31). Under his Section 19 authority, the Secretary has also created an exemption to the disclosure
requirement, including the signed acknowledgment, if an applicant is turned down for credit within three business
days of receipt of the application. This exemption makes all the mortgage servicing notice provisions consistent
with good faith estimate amendments in section 951 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. 



Merger and/or Acquisition of Servicing 



(1) Several commenters asked various questions as to what disclosures were necessary when a servicer buys another
servicer, with or without changing the servicer's name, or merges one servicer into another servicer. In addition,
two comments concerned the functions of ``master servicers'' and ``subservicers.'' The entity holding servicing
rights is frequently called the ``master servicer,'' and the entity performing the actual servicing is called the
``subservicer''. Two situations were posited: first, the rights to servicing are sold, but the subservicer remains
the same. Second, the subservicer changes, but the master servicer remains the same. 



HUD response. 

The controlling consideration in whether a Notice of Transfer must be delivered for a sale, transfer, or assignment
is whether there is a significant change of servicing that potentially affects the borrower. In ordinary transfers
of servicing between distinct entities, the Notice of Transfer is always required. In certain other situations_e.g.,
transfers between affiliates, transfers because a servicer or subservicer is bought or merged into another entity,
and transfers between master servicers when the subservicer stays the same and when the subservicer changes_a Notice
of Transfer is required unless there is no change in the payee, the collection address, account number, or the amount
of the payment. 

(2) Six commenters suggested that when there are multiple applicants, it should be sufficient for the lender to give
the Servicing Disclosure Statement to one of the co-applicants in a face-to-face interview. One commenter requested
that a co-signer not be considered as a person who applies for a loan, therefore obviating the need for the co-signer
to receive a Servicing Disclosure Statement. Another commenter asked how long a lender must keep co-signers' signatures
on file. 



HUD response. 

Delivery of a single Servicing Disclosure Statement in a face-to-face meeting with one or more applicants is acceptable,
and the Acknowledgement may be signed at that time. For each applicant or co-applicant who is not present, the Servicing
Disclosure Statement may be delivered on his or her behalf to an applicant who is present, or may be mailed within 3 business
days by first class mail, postage prepaid. While a co-signer might be an integral party to the transaction, a co-signer
is primarily interested in timely payments of the mortgage, not in who holds the mortgage servicing. Therefore, a
co-signer's acknowledgment is not required. 

The signed acknowledgments are to be in the loan package. Consistent with other record-retention requirements of
part 3500, the lender must keep the signed acknowledgments for five years after the date of settlement of the loan unless
the lender disposes of its interest in the loan and does not service the mortgage. In this case, the Servicing Disclosure
Statement would be part of the transferred loan file.

(3) One comment suggested that requiring prepaid, first-class postage for a Servicing Disclosure Statement that
is mailed is unnecessary, costly, and inconsistent with the disclosure mailed in compliance with the Truth in Lending
and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts. If the transaction is handled by mail, one commenter suggested, the period of three
business days should begin only after the lender receives a written application from the borrower. 



HUD response. 

The use of prepaid, first-class mail is common business practice. The practice reasonably assures that the borrower
will receive the Servicing Disclosure Statement and, thus, affords protection to those responsible for delivering
the statement. The 3-business day period begins only when the application is received. 

(4) Four commenters suggested that lenders be permitted to include in the Servicing Disclosure Statement a statement
that ``the loan cannot be funded unless the acknowledgements are signed and returned.'' One commenter asked that
no follow-up correspondence be required if the lender has provided the Servicing Disclosure Statement to the borrower
and the borrower has not returned a signed Acknowledgement. 



HUD response. 

The Department has deleted in this final rule the provision that no loan should be funded unless the signed Acknowledgement
was contained in the loan package. HUD has determined that there is sufficient oversight by regulators and secondary
market purchasers, and no overriding reason to highlight the Servicing Disclosure Statement over any other required
statement. However, the Acknowledgement is still required to be a part of the loan package. The Department has also
eliminated the mandatory follow-up requirement that was included in the interim rule. 

(5) One commenter stated that if the servicing is always sold, transferred, or assigned, there is not a ``present servicer''
or a ``new servicer'' at the time of application for the loan. The model language of the Notice of Transfer indicates
that the borrower will be informed about the servicer, but the language fails to state when and in what format the borrower
will receive this information. 



HUD response. 

The Department disagrees with the content of this comment. Whoever sells, transfers, or assigns a federally related
mortgage loan is considered the present servicer and is called the ``transferor servicer'' in this rule. The servicer
that buys, is transferred, or is assigned the mortgage servicing function is the new servicer and is called the ``transferee
servicer.'' A mortgage broker that closes a table-funded transaction in its own name is in the position of a transferor
servicer. A dealer in a first lien dealer loan situation is also a transferor servicer. Appendix B of the interim rule
presented sample language for the Notice of Transfer; the language is retained in substantial degree in this final
rule. As with the Servicing Disclosure Statement, discretion is allowed concerning the exact wording of the Notice
of Transfer, but the various elements that the notice must contain are detailed in  3500.21(e). 

(6) Two commenters requested clarification about who bears the primary responsibility for notifying the borrower
of a transfer of servicing when the transferor and transferee choose to notify the borrower in a single, joint Notice
of Transfer. 



HUD response. 

HUD believes that in normal business transactions, the timing and issuance of Notices of Transfer would be resolved
as part of the purchase and sale agreement. If a joint notice is not feasible, both notices will be required. 

(7) Several commenters were concerned about the impact of the requirements on the servicer's ability to administer
collection practices consistent with investor requirements. A commenter questioned whether a late payment could
be assessed prior to the 60-day period if the payment had not been made to the transferee. Also, two commenters asked
whether late fees due prior to the transfer could be assessed.

<PARENT> FR941219-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



HUD position. 

If within the 60-day period the borrower has mistakenly mailed a payment to the transferor instead of the transferee,
a late fee may not be imposed. However, if neither the transferor nor the transferee has received a regularly scheduled
payment within the 60-day period, or any longer applicable grace period, late payment charges may be assessed in accordance
with the servicer's established practices. Late charges due from the borrower before the effective date of transfer
of servicing are not covered by RESPA or this rule.


Questions Relating To Qualified Written Requests


(1) Two comments addressed the type of information that HUD permits a borrower to include in a ``qualified written
request.'' One commenter wished to limit the requirements to those inquiries asserting errors that have been caused
by the transfer of servicing on a mortgage account. The other commenter wanted clarification on whether the requirements
were limited to inquiries on payments and account balances. Another question concerned the length of time a servicer
has to respond to qualified written requests after a loan is paid off or after servicing has been transferred.


HUD response. 

The statute encompasses all information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan and does not restrict the subject
matter to questions concerning the transfer of servicing, installment payments, or account balances. For example,
a written inquiry concerning a collection for or disbursement from an escrow account would be a qualified written
request if the correspondence contains the required identifying elements. In  3500.21(f)(2), the Department
establishes a 1-year period in which a qualified written request is valid after the date of loan pay-off or mortgage
servicing transfer.
(2) Three commenters were concerned about how written requests were received. One said that the regulations should
state that ``a qualified written request'' must be mailed to an address supplied by the servicer in the coupon book
or written correspondence and not the address for the mortgage payment. Another wanted to disregard requests that
lacked the account number or were attached to the borrower's check, as distinguished from being placed in the same
envelope. The third suggested that the regulations should specifically disqualify written inquiries that the borrower
includes with the loan payment. A commenter suggested that the Department require a servicer to provide to the borrower
information identifying the name and telephone number of a representative or the office or department of the servicer
through which the borrower will receive assistance after submitting a qualified written request.


HUD response. 

(i) This rule does not require that a servicer establish an office to handle borrowers' complaints. It does, however,
allow the servicer to do so. In the event the servicer establishes such an office and complies with all the necessary
notice provisions of this rule, then the borrower must deliver its request to that office in order for the inquiry to
be a ``qualified written request'' (see the optional language in Appendix MS-2 to part 3500).
(ii) If the servicer determines that a borrower's correspondence does not constitute a qualified written request
(the most likely disqualification would be writing the inquiry on the payment coupon), the servicer should retain
sufficient information to support its determination.
(3) A commenter sought clarification of when the Department considers an inquiry to be resolved.


HUD response. 

An inquiry is resolved when the servicer supplies the requested information or corrects an error. See, for example,
Regulation Z, 12 U.S.C. 226.13(e) and (f) for similar complaint resolution provisions.
(4) Eight commenters discussed the protection of the borrower's credit rating during a dispute. Most commenters
asked whether a lender could provide payment information to a consumer reporting agency prior to the end of the 60-business
day period if the dispute was resolved. Two commenters noted that a servicer would be in an unfair position if the servicer
has previously reported a borrower's loan as past due and then is not allowed to report the payment. The commenters
suggested that the servicer be permitted to advise the credit agency that the servicer is prohibited by law from providing
additional information at that time. As a benefit to the borrower, one comment suggested that the servicer be allowed
to report prior to the 60-business day period to clear a borrower's record. One commenter raised a question about whether
a lender should assume that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent, or should require proof from the borrower
of this delegation of authority. Furthermore, the commenter asked if the 20-business day time-frame, in which the
borrower must receive a written acknowledgement from the servicer, is calculated from when the request is received
or when the servicer confirms that the third party is the borrower's agent.


HUD response. 

HUD interprets the statute to mean that no adverse information relating to a borrower's overdue payment information
may be provided to a credit reporting agency within the 60-day period after the servicing function is transferred,
assigned, or sold or after the servicer receives a qualified written request for information. The statute is implemented
by this rule in a manner that does not prohibit a servicer from reporting an improvement (such as a payment found or received)
in the borrower's record within the 60 day period. It is the servicer's responsibility to determine whether it has
sufficient information that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent or the borrower should verify the agent's
representative capacity. When the servicer is in doubt as to the status of the third party, the written acknowledgement
can also be mailed to the borrower to ask that the borrower verify the status of the third party.
(5) One comment asked for clarification of whether the servicer was prohibited from reporting delinquencies unrelated
to a dispute.

<PARENT> FR941219-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



HUD response. 

A servicer may report a delinquency to a credit reporting agency provided that the report does not concern a pending
qualified written request, which questions the correctness of the account, or a loan payment sent by the borrower
to the transferor, rather than the transferee, within 60 days after the servicing of the loan is transferred.
(6) One commenter hypothesized a situation in which a borrower sends a qualified request in September concerning
a late charge assessed on the March payment, yet the borrower has not made his April through August payments. Is the
servicer prohibited from reporting these delinquencies in September, although they are unrelated to the March dispute?


HUD position. 

The receipt of a qualified written request by the servicer determines when the 60-business day period begins. If the
April through August delinquencies are caused by the problem or issue identified by the borrower in the request, adverse
information related to all of these delinquencies may not be submitted or resubmitted, if previously reported. In
this instance, the 60-business day period begins when the qualified written request is received in September. However,
there is nothing in RESPA that prohibits the servicer from initiating foreclosure action, or taking other remedial
actions under the applicable mortgage documents, against the mortgaged property based on the delinquent payments
in March through August. The servicer's timing on initiating foreclosure action is governed by the provisions of
the borrower's mortgage document.


Servicing Involving Certain Government-Related Agencies or Enterprises


Section 6 provides that certain government or government-sponsored entities that have oversight or other relationships
with servicers are not themselves servicers for purposes of Section 6. These entities include the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in connection with assets acquired, assigned,
sold, or transferred pursuant to section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or as receiver or conservator
of an insured depository institution. Section 6 also makes provisions for certain circumstances involving mortgage
servicing loans when government or government-sponsored entities have to deal with the termination for cause of
the contract for servicing a loan or with the commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer in a program
involving such entity. In addition, in giving the transfer notice the statute also allows a delay of up to 30 days after
the transfer of servicing. HUD believes that Congress exempted these entities from most mortgage servicing transfer
requirements so as not to interfere with the fiduciary responsibilities of the entities with regard to protective
actions needed to be taken by such entities, and not to create for such governmental entities potential liability
that could inhibit the orderly transfer of servicing. Also, imposition of standard business requirements in troubled
situations involving a fiduciary could adversely affect the underlying value of the related mortgage servicing.
Because the rationales discussed above apply equally well to other Federal entities not specifically enumerated
in Section 6(i)(2) of the Act, the Secretary has exercised his authority under Section 19(a) of RESPA and has added
certain other Federal agencies (HUD, including FHA; VA; NCUA; and FmHA) that might also be in a fiduciary position
or need to protect a borrower in an otherwise covered mortgage loan situation.
In addition, under Section 19 the Secretary has exempted FHA from having to provide the Notice of Transfer in those
instances where the mortgage has been assigned (along with the servicing) to FHA for the payment of the mortgage insurance
benefits pursuant to section 230 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715u). Under the assignment program, the
mortgagor actively provides information to both the mortgagee and FHA in order to show that the mortgagor meets certain
eligibility criteria. The assignment of the mortgage to FHA is not a business decision. Rather, it is a means by which
eligible mortgagors can avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.
Mortgagors are aware early on in the process that, if deemed eligible, HUD will become their mortgagee and servicer.
HUD also accepts assignment of other single-family insured mortgage loans under certain specialty programs. These
assignments are not comparable to the normal sale and purchase transactions that the mortgage servicing transfer
provisions of Section 6 were designed to address. Thus, requiring HUD to provide the notice of transfer in cases where
mortgages are assigned to HUD would not serve the purposes of Section 6, and these assignments have been exempted under
the Secretary's authority in Section 19.


Damages and Costs


(1) The statute provides that whoever fails to comply with any provision of Section 6 shall be liable to the borrower.
These damages include actual damages and, in an action brought by an individual, up to $1,000 for a pattern of noncompliance;
in a class action, the additional damages may not exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the servicer's net worth.
A commenter noted that ``actual damages'' should be clarified. If a servicer reported a debt to a credit bureau within
the 60-business day proscribed period, and the borrower alleges that the reporting resulted in the borrower's inability
to obtain credit, the servicer could be liable for damages, even if the report was correct. Therefore, the commenter
suggested that to prove actual damages the borrower must show:
(a) The servicer made the report to a credit company within the proscribed period;
(b) The borrower was correct, the dispute was resolved in the borrower's favor; and
(c) The borrower would have otherwise been approved for the credit.


HUD position. 

If a servicer violates  3500.21(g) by reporting information on a borrower to a credit agency relating to a dispute
regarding the borrower's payments within 60 business days of receiving a qualified written inquiry from the borrower,
that servicer will be liable for all proven actual damages that the borrower suffered because of the servicer's action.
Further, if a pattern of noncompliance can be established, the servicer may be liable to that borrower for additional
damages not to exceed $1,000. The costs of the action and attorneys fees also can be recovered. The statute requires
no qualifying criteria that the borrower must meet before actual damages may be sought from the servicer.
(2) One commenter suggested that the date on the Servicing Disclosure Statement was unnecessary. Another commenter
noted that the Acknowledgment Form requires the applicant to state that he has read and ``understands'' its contents;
however, the commenter stated, this might create potential legal complications.


HUD response. 

Since the servicer is liable for damages and costs, it is in the servicer's own interest to note, by dating the form,
when the Servicing Disclosure Statement was given (or placed in the mail) to the borrower. In any event, the requirement
is statutory and has been retained in the final rule. Similarly, the language concerning the applicant's understanding
of the disclosure statement reflects the statute and follows common business practice.


Conforming Amendment to Escrow Rule


The Department is also publishing a conforming amendment to its final rule on escrow accounting procedures, published
on October 26, 1994 (59 FR 53890).


Other Matters


Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HUD finds that there are no anticompetitive
aspects of the interim rule that are discriminatory with regard to small entities nor are there any unusual procedures
that would need to be complied with by small entities. In any event, by statute, the requirements of this rule must be
adhered to by all lenders and servicers.

Environmental Impact



At the time of publication of the interim rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was
made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). This final rule does not make changes to the interim rule that are significant in
this context. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for
public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.



Executive Order 12866



This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and
Review. Any changes made to the rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available
for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, S.W.,
Washington, DC 20410-0500.



Executive Order 12616, Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12616, 

Federalism,

 has determined that the policies contained in this regulation do not have significant federalism implications and,
thus, are not subject to review under the Order. Issuance of the regulation does not change existing Federal, State
or local governmental relationships, except that, under the statute, compliance with the disclosure provisions
of this rule will preempt State law requirements dealing with identical subject matter. Given the lack of discretion
pertaining to the preemption issue by the statute, further analysis of the federalism implications of the rule would
serve no purpose.



Executive Order 12606, the Family



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12606, 

the Family,

 has determined that the policies contained in this regulation do not have a potential significant impact on family
function, maintenance and general well being, and, thus, are not subject to review under the order.



Semiannual Agenda of Regulations



This final rule was listed as Item No. 1813 on the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations, published on November
14, 1994 (59 FR 57632, 57659), as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 Mortgage servicing transfers.



(a) 

Definitions.

 As used in this section:



Effective date of transfer

 means the date on which the mortgage payment of a borrower is first due to the transferee servicer of a mortgage servicing
loan pursuant to the assignment, sale or transfer of the servicing of the mortgage servicing loan.



Master servicer

 means the owner of the right to perform servicing, which may actually perform the servicing itself or may do so through
a subservicer.



Mortgage servicing loan

 means a federally related mortgage loan, as that term is defined in  3500.2, subject to the exemptions in  3500.5,
when the mortgage loan is secured by a first lien. The definition does not include subordinate lien loans or open-end
lines of credit (home equity plans) covered by the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, including open-end lines
of credit secured by a first lien.



Qualified written request

 means a written correspondence from the borrower to the servicer prepared in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of
this section.



Servicer

 means the person responsible for the servicing of a loan (including the person who makes or holds a loan if such person
also services the loan). The term does not include:

(1) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), in connection with
assets acquired, assigned, sold, or transferred pursuant to section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or
as receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution; or

(2) The Federal National Mortgage Corporation (FNMA); the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac);
the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD), including the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA); the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA); the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA);
and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in any case in which the assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing
of the mortgage servicing loan is preceded by termination of the contract for servicing the loan for cause, commencement
of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer, or commencement of proceedings by the FDIC or RTC for conservatorship
or receivership of the servicer (or an entity by which the servicer is owned or controlled).

(3) The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), in cases where a mortgage insured under the National Housing Act is
assigned to HUD.



Servicing

 means receiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any mortgage servicing loan,
including amounts for escrow accounts under section 10 of RESPA, and making the payments to the owner of the loan or
other third parties of principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the amounts received from the
borrower as may be required pursuant to the terms of the mortgage servicing loan documents or servicing contract.
In the case of a home equity conversion mortgage or reverse mortgage as defined in  3500.2, servicing includes
making payments to the borrower.



Subservicer

 means a servicer who does not own the right to perform servicing, but who does so on behalf of the master servicer.



Transferee servicer

 means a servicer who obtains or who will obtain the right to perform servicing functions pursuant to an agreement or
understanding.

Transferor servicer 

means a servicer, including a table funding mortgage broker or dealer on a first lien dealer loan, who transfers or
will transfer the right to perform servicing functions pursuant to an agreement or understanding.
(b) 

Servicing Disclosure Statement and Applicant Acknowledgement; requirements. 

(1) At the time an application for a mortgage servicing loan is submitted, or within 3 business days after submission
of the application, the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer who anticipates a
first lien dealer loan shall provide to each person who applies for such a loan a Servicing Disclosure Statement. This
requirement shall not apply when the application for credit is turned down within three business days after receipt
of the application. A format for the Servicing Disclosure Statement appears as Appendix MS-1 to this part. Except
as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the specific language of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is not
required to be used, but the Servicing Disclosure Statement must include the information set out in paragraph (b)(3)
of this section, including the statement of the borrower's rights in connection with complaint resolution. The information
set forth in Instructions to Preparer on the Servicing Disclosure Statement need not be included on the form given
to applicants, and material in square brackets is optional or alternative language.
(2) The Applicant's Acknowledgement portion of the Servicing Disclosure Statement in the format stated 

is mandatory. 

Additional lines may be added to accommodate more than two applicants.
(3) The Servicing Disclosure Statement must contain the following information, except as provided in paragraph
(b)(3)(ii) of this section:
(i) Whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold or transferred to any other person at any time while the loan
is outstanding. If the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan does not engage
in the servicing of any mortgage servicing loans, the disclosure may consist of a statement to the effect that there
is a current intention to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of the loan.
(ii) The percentages (rounded to the nearest quartile (25%)) of mortgage servicing loans originated by the lender
in each calendar year for which servicing has been assigned, sold, or transferred for such calendar year. Compliance
with this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is not required if the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer on a first lien
dealer loan chooses option B in the model format in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, including in square brackets
the language ``[and have not serviced mortgage loans in the last three years.]''. The percentages shall be provided
as follows:
(A) This information shall be set out for the most recent three calendar years completed, with percentages as of the
end of each year. This information shall be updated in the disclosure no later than March 31 of the next calendar year.
Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the number of mortgage servicing loans originated during
the calendar year for which servicing is transferred within the calendar year and, as the denominator, the total number
of mortgage servicing loans originated in the calendar year. If the volume of transfers is less than 12.5 percent,
the word ``nominal'' or the actual percentage amount of servicing transfers may be used.
(B) This statistical information does not have to include the assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing
by the lender to an affiliate or subsidiary of the lender. However, lenders may voluntarily include transfers to an
affiliate or subsidiary. The lender should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales,
or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
(C) In the alternative, if applicable, the following statement may be substituted for the statistical information
required to be provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section: ``We have previously assigned,
sold, or transferred the servicing of federally related mortgage loans.''
(iii) The best available estimate of the percentage (0 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, or 76 to 100 percent)
of all loans to be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date of origination for which the servicing may be
assigned, sold, or transferred. Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the estimated number
of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated for which servicing may be transferred within the calendar year
and, as the denominator, the estimated total number of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated in the calendar
year.
(A) If the lender, mortgage broker, or dealer anticipates that no loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year,
the word ``none'' may be substituted for ``0 to 25 percent.'' If it is anticipated that all loan servicing will be sold
during the calendar year, the word ``all'' may be substituted for ``76 to 100 percent.''
(B) This statistical information does not have to include the estimated assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage
loan servicing to an affiliate or subsidiary of that person. However, this information may be provided voluntarily.
The Servicing Disclosure Statements should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales
or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.

(iv) The information set out in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(v) A written acknowledgement that the applicant (and any co-applicant) has/have read and understood the disclosure,
and understand that the disclosure is a required part of the mortgage application. This acknowledgement shall be
evidenced by the signature of the applicant and any co-applicant.
(4) The following is a model format, which includes several options, for complying with the requirements of paragraph
(b)(3) of this section. The model format may be annotated with additional information that clarifies or enhances
the model language. The lender or table funding mortgage broker (or dealer) should use the language that best describes
the particular circumstances.
(i) 

Model Format: 

The following is the best estimate of what will happen to the servicing of your mortgage loan:
(A) 

Option A. 

We may assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of your loan while the loan is outstanding. [We are able to service your
loan[.][,] and we [will] [will not] [haven't decided whether to] service your loan.]; or
(B) 

Option B. 

We do not service mortgage loans[.][,] [and have not serviced mortgage loans in the past three years.] We presently
intend to assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of your mortgage loan. You will be informed about your servicer.
(C) As appropriate, the following paragraph may be used:



We assign, sell, or transfer the servicing of some of our loans while the loans are outstanding, depending on the type
of loan and other factors. For the program for which you have applied, we expect to [assign, sell, or transfer all of
the mortgage servicing][retain all of the mortgage servicing] [assign, sell, or transfer 

XX

% of the mortgage servicing].



(ii) [Reserved]
(c) 

Servicing Disclosure Statement and Applicant Acknowledgement; delivery. 

The lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer that anticipates a first lien dealer loan shall deliver Servicing
Disclosure Statements to each applicant for mortgage servicing loans. Each applicant or co-applicant must sign
an Acknowledgement of receipt of the Servicing Disclosure Statement before settlement.
(1) In the case of a face-to-face interview with one or more applicants, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall
be delivered at the time of application. An applicant present at the interview may sign the Acknowledgment on his or
her own behalf at that time. An applicant present at the interview also may accept delivery of the Servicing Disclosure
Statement on behalf of the other applicants.
(2) If there is no face-to-face interview, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be delivered by placing it in
the mail, with prepaid first-class postage, within 3 business days from receipt of the application. If co-applicants
indicate the same address on their application, one copy delivered to that address is sufficient. If different addresses
are shown by co-applicants on the application, a copy must be delivered to each of the co-applicants.
(d) 

Notices of Transfer; loan servicing. 

(1) 

Requirement for notice. 

(i) Except as provided in this paragraph or paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, each transferor servicer and transferee
servicer of any mortgage servicing loan shall deliver to the borrower a written Notice of Transfer, containing the
information described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, of any assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing
of the loan. The following transfers are not considered an assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing
for purposes of this requirement if there is no change in the payee, address to which payment must be delivered, account
number, or amount of payment due:
(A) Transfers between affiliates;
(B) Transfers resulting from mergers or acquisitions of servicers or subservicers; and
(C) Transfers between master servicers, where the subservicer remains the same.
(ii) The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is not required under paragraph (d) of this section to submit to the
borrower a Notice of Transfer in cases where a mortgage insured under the National Housing Act is assigned to FHA.
(2) 

Time of notice. 

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section:
(A) The transferor servicer shall deliver the Notice of Transfer to the borrower not less than 15 days before the effective
date of the transfer of the servicing of the mortgage servicing loan; and
(B) The transferee servicer shall deliver the Notice of Transfer to the borrower not more than 15 days after the effective
date of the transfer.
(C) The transferor and transferee servicers may combine their no
